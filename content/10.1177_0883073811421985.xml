<abstract>
<p>There are conflicting reports in the literature about the influence of valproate on thyroid function. A cross-sectional study was performed to determine the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in ambulatory children aged 3 to 15 years with controlled epilepsy receiving valproate monotherapy for at least 6 months. Fifty-seven consecutive children with controlled epilepsy on valproate monotherapy and 52 healthy age- and sex-matched control children were studied. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, and serum valproic acid levels were measured. There was a significantly high (<italic>P</italic> = .012) prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism (26%) in those receiving valproate monotherapy compared with healthy controls (7.7%). Median duration of valproate therapy was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> = .039) in the subclinical hypothyroidism group (21 months, range 6-36) compared with those without subclinical hypothyroidism (14 months, range 6-25). Results of the present study suggest higher prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in children with controlled epilepsy on long-term valproate monotherapy.</p>

<p>Subclinical hypothyroidism represents the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction. It is defined as an asymptomatic state in which a reduction in thyroid activity has been compensated for by an increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) output to maintain a euthyroid state. Biochemically, subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as a serum TSH concentration above the statistically defined upper limit of the reference range when free thyroxine (FT4) concentration is within its reference range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811421985">1</xref></sup> Although controversial, its presence raises concern of future progression to overt hypothyroidism and effect on development of the child.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811421985">2</xref></sup> Therefore, pediatricians should be alerted about conditions with which it may be associated.</p>
<p>Sodium valproate, an effective antiepileptic drug, is commonly used in childhood epilepsy. There are conflicting reports in the literature about the influence of valproate on thyroid function. Elevated TSH levels have been demonstrated in a few studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811421985">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811421985"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811421985"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811421985"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811421985"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811421985"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811421985"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811421985">10</xref></sup> but not all.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811421985">11</xref></sup> The results of previous studies have limited interpretation because of polytherapy, small sample size, and lack of proper control selection. Therefore, the present study was planned with a primary objective to determine the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in ambulatory children aged 3 to 15 years with epilepsy receiving valproate monotherapy for at least 6 months. The secondary objective was to explore the potential risk factors for subclinical hypothyroidism in the study population.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073811421985">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0883073811421985">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>All children with epilepsy receiving valproate monotherapy attending the outpatient services of the Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, were screened for eligibility for this study. Children were deemed eligible for inclusion when (1) they were aged 3 to 15 years, (2) had received valproate monotherapy for 6 or more months, and (3) were seizure free for 6 or more months. Patients were excluded if (1) they had received any drug within the past 6 months that could affect thyroid parameters; (2) they had progressive brain disease, trauma, epilepsy surgery, hydrocephalus, history of prematurity, global development delay, or mental retardation; (3) they had known thyroid or endocrine dysfunction; or (4) they had a family history of hypothyroidism or endocrine dysfunction.</p>
<p>Age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled. Controls were similar to cases except for epilepsy and valproate therapy. They were mostly siblings of index patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0883073811421985">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted between August 2008 and July 2009. We enrolled children with controlled epilepsy to eliminate direct and indirect effects of seizures and frequent alterations in dosage of valproate. Similarly, we also excluded children with organic brain pathologies. Informed parental consent was obtained from the children’s parents before inclusion into the study. The study design was approved by the institute’s ethics committee.</p>
<p>All participants were subjected to full medical history and examination. Seizures were analyzed determining seizure type, frequency, age at onset, and duration of antiepileptic drug therapy. Epilepsy type was classified according to the recommendations of the International League Against Epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811421985">12</xref></sup> Physical examination included measurements of height (with a stadiometer) and weight.</p>
<p>Blood samples from both groups were taken between 8 <sc>am</sc> and 9 <sc>am</sc> after an overnight fast. The parents were asked to withhold the morning dose of valproate and to take it after the blood sample was drawn. Serum was immediately separated by centrifugation. The serum samples were stored frozen at –20°C until analysis. Levels of serum FT4, TSH, and antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies were measured for both cases and controls and serum valproic acid levels for cases only.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0883073811421985">
<title>Assays</title>
<p>TSH assays were analyzed using two on-site fluoroimmunometric assays based on the direct sandwich technique using a Delfia hTSH Ultra Kit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Massachusetts). The TSH assay that was carried out had an intra-assay coefficient of variation &lt;2.1% and an interassay coefficient of variation &lt;3%. FT4 assays were analyzed according to the time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay principle by using a PerkinElmer Delfia kit. The FT4 assay had an intra-assay coefficient of variation &lt;3.3% and interassay coefficient of variation &lt;4.1%. Anti-TPO antibodies were analyzed with an electrochemiluminometric assay using a Roche Elecsys 2010 autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana). The assay had an intra-assay coefficient of variation &lt;4.2% and an interassay coefficient of variation &lt;9.2%. The serum valproic acid concentrations were analyzed for cases using high-performance liquid chromatography.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0883073811421985">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The reported prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in patients with epilepsy receiving valproate therapy varied up to 26%. We calculated that 49 patients would be required for expected 15% prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in our study population, with a 95% confidence level and ±0.10 width of confidence interval (CI). Hence, the present study was planned as an observational study with a sample size of total 50 patients. Similar number of controls was planned.</p>
<p>Data were analyzed using the SPSS version 17.0 software (SPSS, an IBM company, Chicago, Illinois). Frequencies and means were calculated by descriptive analysis. For statistical analysis, Fisher’s exact test, chi-square test, and Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test were used whenever appropriate. All the reported <italic>P</italic> values were two-sided, and <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered significant.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-0883073811421985">
<title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period, 81 consecutive children with epilepsy on valproate therapy were screened for eligibility. Twenty-four children were excluded for the following reasons: 15 had received other antiepileptic drugs (implicated with thyroid metabolism), 5 had global development delay, 3 had refractory epilepsy, and 1 had family history of hypothyroidism. Parents of 57 children gave consent for the study and formed the study population. During the study period, 55 consecutive healthy children, mostly siblings of children with epilepsy, were screened for eligibility for control in the study. Three children were excluded because of the following reasons; 2 had refused consent, and 1 had family history of hypothyroidism. Parents of 52 children gave consent for the study and formed the control group.</p>
<p>Clinical characteristics and thyroid hormone profile of enrolled children with epilepsy on valproate monotherapy and control group are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811421985">Table 1</xref>
. Both groups were comparable with respect to age, gender ratio, and mean height and weight. Both groups had male preponderance. Of the 57 children with epilepsy, 21 (36.8%) had generalized epilepsy and 36 (63.2%) had partial epilepsy. The mean duration of epilepsy in these children was 18.7 ± 11.7 months and the mean duration of valproate monotherapy was 15.9 ± 6.7 months. Children receiving valproate had significantly elevated median titers of TSH compared with the control group (<italic>P</italic> = .002), but comparable levels of median titers of FT4. A total of 15 (26%) children in the valproate group had subclinical hypothyroidism. Of these 15 children, 4 had grade I subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH &lt; 6 µU/mL), 11 had grade II subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH between 6 and 12 µU/mL), and none had grade III subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH &gt; 12 µU/mL). In comparison, only 4 (7.7%) children in the control group had subclinical hypothyroidism, and this difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .012). Of these 4 children, two had grade I subclinical hypothyroidism, and two had grade II subclinical hypothyroidism. None had grade III subclinical hypothyroidism. None of the children in either group had overt hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. None of the children in the valproate group had elevated anti-TPO antibody titers. One child in the control group had a significantly elevated anti-TPO antibody titer of 226.7 IU/mL.</p>

To our knowledge, this is the first study from India evaluating association of subclinical hypothyroidism in children with epilepsy on valproate therapy.

<p>The underlying mechanism may be due to γ-aminobutyric acid–stimulating properties of valproate. γ-Aminobutyric acid inhibits the release of somatostatin, which inhibits TSH secretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811421985">13</xref></sup> The causal association between valproate and subclinical hypothyroidism has been suggested by Eirís-Puñal and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811421985">4</xref></sup> They observed normalization of elevated TSH levels after the valproate was changed to ethosuximide in one case.

The present study did not reveal any association of subclinical hypothyroidism with age, valproate dose, and valproic acid levels, probably because of lack of power.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>To conclude, we observed a significantly high (<italic>P</italic> = .012) prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism (26%) in ambulatory children aged 3 to 15 years with epilepsy receiving valproate monotherapy for at least 6 months, in comparison with healthy controls (7.7%). Median duration of valproate therapy was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> = .039) in the subclinical hypothyroidism group compared with those without subclinical hypothyroidism. Results of the present study suggest that evaluation of thyroid function should be considered in children with epilepsy with prolonged duration of valproate monotherapy. Larger prospective studies are needed to assess causal relation and impact of valproate on thyroid function.</p>
