<p>This article presents an investigation of language understanding within the framework of receptive multilingualism. That Turkish and Azerbaijani are closely related languages within the Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages leads to the assumption that Turkish and Azerbaijani are mutually intelligible languages. That is, speakers of these two different languages of Turkic origin can comprehend each other without much difficulty. This article aims to consider whether these languages are, in fact, as mutually intelligible as estimated, especially on the part of the Turkish speakers. In other words, within the framework of this study, the focus is on how well Turkish speakers understand written and spoken Azerbaijani. In addition, the study asks whether there is any risk of understanding failure on the part of Turkish speakers and, if yes, it will examine the grounds of such understanding failure. The results of this study in which 30 Turkish participants took part show that even though Turkish and Azerbaijani are typologically similar languages, on the part of Turkish speakers the intelligibility is not as high as is estimated.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Azerbaijani and Turkish are closely related languages within the Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages. This fact may lead to the assumption that Turkish and Azerbaijani are mutually intelligible languages, that is, speakers of these two different languages of Turkic origin can comprehend each other without much difficulty. This assumption is along the lines of the argumentation of a relatively neglected area of linguistic research, receptive multilingualism. Studies in receptive multilingualism, which is defined as ‘the language constellation in which interlocutors use their respective mother tongues while speaking to each other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367006911426449">Zeevaert &amp; ten Thije, 2007</xref>: 1), in fact, go back to the 1950s when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367006911426449">Hickerson, Turner, &amp; Hickerson (1952)</xref> aimed to discover the degree to which members of a given speech community, Iraquois dialects in their study, can understand the utterances of members of another. Following this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367006911426449">Wolff (1959)</xref> studied the mutual intelligibility of American Indian languages. Then came the Scandinavian languages, which are the most systematically studied languages within this framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367006911426449">Braunmüller &amp; Zeevaert, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367006911426449">Gooskens &amp; Van Bezooijen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367006911426449">Haugen, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367006911426449">Maurud, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367006911426449">Zeevaert, 2004</xref>). What these studies all reveal is that for mutual comprehension to occur, the typological distance of the languages involved should be adequately close (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367006911426449">Van Bezooijen &amp; Gooskens, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional to close typological relatedness, there is a relatively large lexical overlap between the Turkish and Azerbaijani languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367006911426449">Menges, 1968</xref>). This strengthens the hypothesis that to a great extent these languages are mutually intelligible, and communication among their speakers may take place in their own first languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367006911426449">Bozkurt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367006911426449">Öztopçu, 1993</xref>). However, this alleged communication type, also referred to as semi-communication – initially by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367006911426449">Haugen (1966)</xref> – is not always easy to pursue, in contrast to the assertions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367006911426449">Zeevaert (2004)</xref> who finds semi- communication quite functional and straightforward. To avoid misunderstandings, in this article, the term ‘semi-’ is not used with a negative connotation; rather, being able to take part in semi-communication is perceived as a positive feature of a monolingual person. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367006911426449">Van Bezooijen and Gooskens (2007)</xref> claim that receptive multilingualism provides more advantages for the production side because people can express themselves best and most easily in their mother tongue. However, in their study of the intelligibility of written Afrikaans and Frisian by Dutch speakers, they also question the amount of effort needed to understand the spoken or written message by the reception side. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367006911426449">Zeevaert (2007)</xref>, utilizing examples taken from inter-Scandinavan semi-communication, emphasizes the active role of the hearer and explains how information is created with the contribution of the hearer. This article will also consider the hearer as the key person in receptive multilingual communication and will investigate how well Turkish speakers understand written and spoken Azerbaijani.</p>
<p>This article will also call attention to the term ‘English as a lingua franca’ (ELF). The global status of English, particularly in Europe and in many parts of the world, leads to the assumption that English is the only alternative way for people to communicate. This view about English and its role as a lingua franca is perceived as a serious threat to multilingualism in Europe and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367006911426449">House, 2003</xref>). However, looking at the meaning of the term lingua franca, it becomes clear that the term does not have a language-specific meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367006911426449">Kachru, 1997</xref>); rather, it is seen as a means of communication between people who share no common language and/or culture. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367006911426449">ten Thije &amp; Zeevaert (2007)</xref>, the editors of <italic>Receptive Multilingualism</italic>, highlight the fact that English is an important international language which, however, should not be regarded as the one and only solution for inter-lingual communication in Europe. On the contrary, they propose the method of receptive multilingualism as an efficient way for mutual comprehension, depending on the typological distance of the languages involved, the language competencies of the participants and the preconditions of the communication context. This study also presents receptive multilingualism as an alternative to lingua franca communication. In particular, the study investigates the intelligibility of Azerbaijani to speakers of Turkish and shows that, depending on the proximity of Turkish and Azerbaijani and the common cultural background, speakers of Turkish and Azerbaijani can utilize receptive multilingualism in their communication. Before dealing with the method of research and the results, some information about the relationship between the Turkish and Azerbaijani languages is given.</p>

<sec id="section2-1367006911426449">
<title>2 Turkish and Azerbaijani: Historical background and linguistic features</title>
<p>Turkish and Azerbaijani are both members of the Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages that belongs to the Uralic and Altaic language family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367006911426449">Comrie, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367006911426449">Menges, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367006911426449">Schönig, 1998</xref>). Some of the most important linguistic features of the Turkic languages are as follows: (1) Agglutination: grammatical functions are indicated by adding various suffixes to an initial stem, each carrying an additional meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367006911426449">Kornfilt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367006911426449">Öztopçu, 1993</xref>). In detail, verbs are richly inflected with suffixes marking person, number, tense, aspect, modality, voice, negation and interrogation; and nouns and pronouns are inflected for number, case and possession. (2) Vowel harmony: the vowels of suffixes must harmonize with the vowels of noun and verb stems. (3) Word order: while SOV (subject–object–verb) typology is a typical characteristic of Turkic languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367006911426449">Csató &amp; Johanson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367006911426449">Greenberg, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367006911426449">Kornfilt, 1987</xref>), in actual usage for various communicative functions inverted orders are also possible and even more frequently used than the unmarked word order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367006911426449">Erdal, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367006911426449">Erguvanlı, 1984</xref>). (4) Lack of grammatical gender. Excluding the vocabulary differences, these characteristics, seen in Turkic languages such as Turkish, Azerbaijani, Caucaus, Uzbek, Kazakh, Turkmen, Kirghiz, Tatar and Yakut, provide good conditions for mutual intelligibility among the speakers. In particular, there is a high potential of mutual intelligibility between Turkish, Azerbaijani, Uzbek and Turkmen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367006911426449">Öztopçu, 1993</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1367006911426449">
<title>2.1 Turkish</title>
<p>Turkish is a language spoken by about 85 million people worldwide. It is spoken as a native language mainly in Turkey and in Cyprus. Turkish is also spoken in the areas formerly governed by the Ottoman Empire, such as Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece, Romania and Serbia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367006911426449">Grimes, 1992</xref>). There are also significant Turkish-speaking communities in European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Turkish among other Turkic languages is regarded as the descendant of Ottoman Turkish which was basically Turkish in structure but loaded heavily with Arabic and Persian vocabulary and an occasional grammatical influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367006911426449">Csató &amp; Johanson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367006911426449">Kornfilt, 1997</xref>). It was represented in writing with an Arabic script. The current state of modern Turkish was established in 1928 by Atatürk as part of the modernization reforms following the foundation of the Republic of Turkey. Turkish was declared the official language of the country and the Arabic script was replaced with the Latin alphabet. Persian and Arabic loanwords were either removed or replaced with their Turkish counterparts. However, it should be noted that many of the loanwords are still widely used in Turkish, especially by the older generation, while the younger generation favours the new Turkish counterparts of those loanwords.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1367006911426449">
<title>2.2 Azerbaijani</title>
<p>The Azerbaijani language, which is also called Azeri, Azeri Turkic or Azerbaijani Turkic, is a Turkic language spoken in Azerbaijan and northwestern Iran. In this article, the term ‘Azerbaijani’ will be used to refer to the language spoken in Azerbaijan. The official language of Azerbaijan is Azerbaijani and it is spoken by about 10 million people. Historically and linguistically, among other Turkic languages Azerbaijani is the language most closely related to Turkish. Like other Turkic languages, Azerbaijani can be traced back to the Oghuz language, though it then spread to south-western Asia during the medieval Turkic migration. In the course of this time, Azerbaijani was influenced by Persian and Arabic to a great extent.</p>
<p>The historical background of Azerbaijan has a lot in common with Iran. Even the name of the country reflects this: it is supposed to derive from Atropates, an Iranian satrap who established a dynasty of local users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367006911426449">Swietochowski &amp; Collins, 1999</xref>). Azerbaijan kept its Iranian character until the invasion of Oghuz tribes under the Seljuk dynasty in the 11th century. With the migration of a considerable proportion of (pre-Ottoman) Turkish-speaking inhabitants, the country started to develop a new character and began to mix with Turkish-speaking immigrants. In time, the country replaced the Iranian family of languages with a dialect that evolved into a district Azeri-Turkish language.</p>
<p>Like all Islamic peoples, Azeris used the Arabic script following the acceptance of Islam in the 7th century. In 1924, however, Azeris replaced the Arabic alphabet with Latin characters and began to use the Latin alphabet officially, for three reasons: (1) the ill fit of the Arabic alphabet to the phonetics of the Turkic languages, (2) the growing need for social communication and (3) the prevalent illiteracy among the Azeri population. Latinization came to an end with the policies of the Soviet Union, which aimed at isolating the Azeris from the other Turkic peoples through Russification. This time, in the 1940s, Cyrillic was accepted as the official alphabet. Finally, the unraveling of the Soviet Union led Azerbaijan to reform their alphabet and, in 1983, Azerbaijan adopted a simpler version of Latin as its fourth alphabet. Throughout its history, Azerbaijani has passed through quite a few language-change processes, such as loan influence from Persian, Arabic and Russian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367006911426449">Erden, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367006911426449">Schönig, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367006911426449">Swietochowski &amp; Collins, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Though the language distance between Turkish and Azerbaijani has become wider in consequence of the changes listed above, this distance did not bring language contact to an end, and this is largely because the linguistic situation in both countries allows their speakers to get in contact with the other language. First of all, for educational, political or economic reasons, Turkish and Azerbaijani people often spend time in each other’s country. For instance, there are around 4500 Turkish students in Azerbaijan and around 2500 registered Azeri students in Turkey. Second, a wide range of Turkish-language media is available to the Azerbaijani public, including some TV news bulletins, Turkish-language newspapers and news websites. Turkish broadcasters are also available via satellite and/or cable TV packages, including nearly half a dozen Turkish TV channels, enabling the Azeris to follow TV shows and drama series in Turkish. This is also the case for Turkish people who would like to follow Azerbaijani-language media. Thus, Turkish and Azerbaijani are languages that are in regular contact. Third, the Azerbaijani educational system provides its students with the opportunity to choose the language of instruction they would like to pursue. Turkish is one of these options, together with Azerbaijani, Russian and English. This allows parents who want their children to learn Turkish to access the language in the school environment. Fourth, since the independence of Azerbaijan in 1918, Turkey and Azerbaijan have enjoyed strong diplomatic and economic relations. In recent years, Turkey has been a constant supporter of Azerbaijan in its efforts to hold its independence and preserve its territorial integrity. Moreover, being partners in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline, Turkey and Azerbaijan share a common economic interest which strengthens relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>As a consequence of these facts, and in addition to the vitally important factor that Turkish and Azerbaijani are linguistically in close proximity to each other, it would not be wrong to estimate a high percentage of intelligibility between these languages. Explaining the situation in another way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367006911426449">Kirchner (2006)</xref> puts forward that ‘Azerbajanian – especially its northern variety – and Turkish show numerous parallels in the lexicon as well as in major parts of their morphology and syntax. There are so many parallels that even speakers of one of these languages who are not suspected of sympathizing with the pan-Turkic ideology have the impression that the language of the respective neighboring country is nothing more than a dialect of their mother tongue’ (p. 158). In line with this argument – that the intelligibility between Turkish and Azerbaijani is attributable to their being dialects – and going a step further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367006911426449">Brendemoen (2006)</xref> claims that ‘it is a well-known fact that there is a gradual transition between West Anatolian Turkish dialects and Azerbaijanian (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367006911426449">Doerfer, 1976</xref>). Starting from İstanbul and going eastwards, even before we reach Ankara, we meet the first isoglosses that represent the different features characterizing both East Anatolian dialects and Azerbaijanian on the east side and west Anatolian on the west side …’ (p. 226). In other words, these two languages, from a linguistic point of view, have quite a lot in common – so much so that they look like dialects of each other. That many of the Azeri features are found in Anatolian dialects, most notably in Central and Eastern Anatolian dialects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367006911426449">Öztopçu, 1993</xref>), might be further evidence of this observation.</p>

<title>3 The study</title>
<sec id="section6-1367006911426449">
<title>3.1 Aim of the study</title>
<p>This article presents an investigation of language understanding within the framework of receptive multilingualism. Defining receptive multilingualism as a form of semi-communication where ‘both interlocutors speak their own language and at the same time are able to understand the language of their counterpart’ (2007: 104), Zeevaert emphasizes the need to test how well the interlocutors understand each other. As information is built on the input of the listener, the active role of the listener should be particularly examined in semi-communication.</p>
<p>The discussion above presented Turkish and Azerbaijani as supposedly mutually intelligible languages, due to both being members of the Turkic languages and having contact with each other. This article aims to consider whether these languages are, in fact, as mutually intelligible as estimated on the part of Turkish speakers. It aims to provide an answer as to how well Turkish speakers understand written and spoken Azerbaijani. In addition, the study asks whether there is any risk of understanding failure on the part of Turkish speakers and, if so, it will examine the grounds of such understanding failure.</p>

<sec id="section7-1367006911426449">
<title>4 Participants</title>
<p>A group of 30 Turkish university students, aged around 20–22, with no active knowledge of Azerbaijani, took part in the study. Before the investigation, the participants were informed about the main intent and design of the study. The investigation took 40 minutes in total and was carried out in a classroom environment.</p>

<sec id="section8-1367006911426449">
<title>5 Tasks</title>
<sec id="section9-1367006911426449">
<title>5.1 Language awareness questionnaire</title>
<p>Prior to the test proper, the participants were asked to fill in a language awareness questionnaire which included questions about their age, gender, home language, other languages known, attitudes towards Azerbaijani, and their views about how well they could speak and understand Azerbaijani (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1367006911426449">Appendix A</xref> for the questionnaire.)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1367006911426449">
<title>5.2 Language understanding test</title>
<p>Participants’ linguistic knowledge of written and spoken Azerbaijani was tested with a language understanding test. So as to compose the test, two Azerbaijani newspaper articles with an average level of complexity were used (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1367006911426449">Appendix B</xref> for the texts). The first article was about the Eurovision Song Contest and consisted of 11 sentences and nine critical words; the second one was about the State University of Baku and comprised 11 sentences and 11 critical words. The articles included 20 critical words in total. The term ‘critical’ is used, in the present study, to refer to the Azerbaijani words for which there are etymologically no Turkish correspondents and, hence, words that are assumed to cause difficulty in understanding (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367006911426449">Table 2</xref> for the list of critical words). For the development of the listening component of the test, the newspaper articles in Azerbaijani were read out by a native speaker of Azerbaijani. As for the procedure, the participants were expected to listen to the recorded texts, first, as a whole to get the main idea, and then, sentence by sentence, twice, with intervals given so as to provide the participants with time to write what they understood in Turkish. Finally, to let the participants proofread their texts, the texts were presented as a whole.</p>
<p>The texts used in the listening test were also used in the reading component of the test. The texts included 20 underlined critical words and the participants were expected to translate them into Turkish. The percentage of the sentences and the words translated correctly was taken as a measure of text comprehension, and likewise as a measure of intelligibility. The answers were coded with 0 points for wrong (or no) translations, 0.5 points for partly right translations, and 1 point for correct translations.</p>

<title>6 Results</title>
<sec id="section13-1367006911426449">
<title>6.1 Language awareness questionnaire</title>
<p>The questionnaire given to the participants consisted of eight questions. To start with the participants’ knowledge of language(s) spoken in Azerbaijan, they correctly assumed that three languages – Azerbaijani, Russian and Turkish – are spoken in the country. As for the language(s) of education in Azerbaijan, which are Azerbaijani, Russian, Turkish and English, most of the participants (24) thought that Azerbaijani was the only language used for educational purposes. Following the data collection process, the participants were informed about the availability of the other three languages.</p>
<p>The second group of questions asked about their access to Azerbaijani. While 19 of the participants had no regular contact with people speaking Azerbaijani, 11 of them stated that they had Azeri friends at the university and that they had the tendency to communicate in Turkish. This finding needs to be analysed carefully. Although these students are highly proficient in English, being students of an English-medium university, they prefer communicating in Turkish. Even though English is the lingua franca in a vast number of places in the world, including the university in which this study was carried out, in this specific case Turkish is the language mediating the interaction of Turkish and Azeri students. The 19 participants with no friends speaking Azerbaijani also stated that they do not follow the media broadcasted in Azeri. As a result, more than the half of the participants had very limited contact with Azerbaijani, in contrast to the assumptions highlighting the frequent language contact between Turkish and Azerbaijani.</p>
<p>Analysis of the question about the relationship between Turkish and Azeri cultures showed that 22 participants found these two cultures akin to each other. The main factors affecting the close relationship between the two cultures, as stated by these participants, from the most to the least important, were: (1) sharing the same ethnic background, (2) having similar traditions as an extension of having a Turkic background, (3) experiencing the same or similar historical events, and (4) holding the same religious beliefs.</p>
<p>For the question asking about the participants’ linguistic knowledge of Azerbaijani, almost all of them (28) highlighted the similarity between Turkish and Azerbaijani, particularly in terms of word order and agglutination. Nevertheless, they also pointed out the differences in pronunciation and orthography, assumed to originate due to the influence of Russian on Azerbaijani. Last but not least, vocabulary was the component that they were most confused about. While some (14) mentioned similarities in vocabulary as the key factor that enables mutual understanding, others (17) revealed the differences as a hindrance.</p>
<p>Based on the above-stated factors, when they were asked how well they thought they could speak, read, write and understand Azerbaijani in general, there were some remarkable answers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367006911426449">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367006911426449">Table 1</xref>, on the whole, distinguishes between productive and receptive skills. For productive skills, the majority of the participants thought they would never be able to speak or write in Azerbaijani, or only to a limited extent. However, for receptive skills their assumptions about their capabilities were not the same. A good number of them stated that they would, to some extent, comprehend what they read and listened to in Azerbaijani. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367006911426449">Table 1</xref> presents the participants’ assumptions about the intelligibility between Turkish and Azerbaijani speakers.</p>

<p>For the last question, which asked whether it would be easy or difficult for them to learn Azerbaijani, 23 participants believed that they could learn Azeri with no difficulty in a short time, thanks to the similarities between the two languages. Interestingly, two students stated just the opposite, owing to the discrepancies between the languages.</p>

<title>6.2 The listening test</title>
<p>Analysis of the listening test shows that the participants had almost no difficulty in getting to the essence of the texts. Similarities in syntax and the lexicon of Turkish and Azerbaijani could be the explanation for this outcome. However, problems occurred in comprehending the loanwords of Persian or Arabic origin which have made their way (via Persian in the case of the Arabic words) into the Azerbaijani language. Within the texts, there were 20 critical words, expected to be translated into Turkish, most of which were of Persian or Arabic origin. The answers were scored with 0 points for wrong (or no) translations, 0.5 points for partly right translations, and 1 point for correct translations. The maximum achievable score was 600 points, with 30 participants tested. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367006911426449">Table 2</xref>, the maximum score reached was 249, which shows that the participants seem to have managed to comprehend the texts, while translating the critical words correctly to only a relatively limited extent.</p>

<p>For better comprehension of how these critical words are translated into Turkish, the examples should be interpreted with care. Below are the analyses of some sentences including the problematic words. In Example (1), the noun <italic>vəsiqə</italic> (‘right’) is a loanword of Arabic origin and a word not in use in current Turkish. However, it is seen that the word is correctly translated into Turkish by 23 participants. The verb <italic>qazan-ıb-lar</italic> (qazan(V)-ıb(AOR)-lar(3PL), ‘to gain’), following <italic>vəsiqə</italic>, is a word in frequent use in Turkish. Thus, for this example, we might conclude that knowing the meaning of the verb <italic>qazanıblar</italic> activated the possible words that might be used together with it in the mental lexicon of the participants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367006911426449">1</xref></sup> Then, from the list of possible words used with <italic>qazanıblar</italic>, based on the main point of the context, the participants choose the correct one. This example shows that the syntactic and lexical similarities between Turkish and Azerbaijani seem to bring an obvious advantage in understanding the other language.</p>

<p>The same justification might be used to explain why <italic>məşq</italic> (‘rehearsal’) in Example (2) is not translated correctly by almost all of the participants. In the first place, the word <italic>məşq</italic> is not one of the loanwords of Arabic origin that is found in Turkish. Second, none of the words used adjacent to <italic>məşq</italic> activate words that might prompt the meaning of <italic>məşq</italic>. At this point, absence of a similar lexical item caused the participants not to be able to translate the sentence.</p>

<p>Example (3) illustrates another problem caused by vocabulary items. The words <italic>rəhbəri</italic> and <italic>göstərişi</italic> have different meanings in Turkish than they have in Azerbaijani. While <italic>rəhbəri</italic> means ‘guidance’ and <italic>göstərişi</italic> means ‘showing off’ in Turkish, in Azerbaijani these words mean ‘administration’ and ‘regulations’ respectively. The low scores obtained when translating these words may be accounted for by the fact that they suggest different things in these languages.</p>

<title>6.3 Results of the reading test</title>
<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367006911426449">Table 2</xref>, there are no big differences between the results of the listening and the reading tests with respect to the understanding performance, though the processing conditions for reading are better than for listening. One reason for these differences is the difficulty in processing certain sounds of Azerbaijani and guessing their Turkish correspondents. This is especially true for velar sounds like /k/, /q/ or /ch/. In Text 1, there is the expression <italic>qeyri-mümkündür</italic> (‘not possible’), which was understood by all readers, with one exception, as <italic>gayri-mümkündür</italic> (‘not possible’), which is a possible Turkish correspondent, though antiquated and not in use any more. Consequently, in 24 of the 30 translations, <italic>mümkün değil</italic> (‘not possible’) was preferred as Turkish correspondent; <italic>imkansız</italic> (‘impossible’) or <italic>mümkün olamayacak</italic> (‘will not be possible’), were the other correct translations. In the listening test, nine students failed to understand the velar /q/ and omitted the translation of <italic>qeyri</italic>, resulting in a sentence with the opposite meaning of ‘possible’, instead of ‘not possible’.</p>
<p>The Azerbaijani matrix clause <italic>Qeyd edək ki</italic> (‘let us register that’) is something like an assertion formula meaning ‘as it is known’ or ‘let us state that’. In the listening task, this phrase was omitted with two exceptions, where an adverb <italic>böylece</italic> (‘so’) or <italic>burada</italic> (‘here’) was chosen. In the writing task, in 7 of the 30 cases, expressions like <italic>kayd edelim ki</italic> (‘let us register that’) or <italic>belirtelim ki</italic> (‘let us indicate that’) were chosen. An important observation here is that the Azerbaijani introductory matrix clause did not cause any problem in understanding the text. This is because the conjunction ‘ki’, of Persian origin, is frequently used in contemporary Turkish. Turkish participants, in both listening and reading tests, understood that this was an introducing formula that does not affect the meaning expressed in the subsequent sentence.</p>
<p>Another point that needs to be discussed is that in the nominal compound <italic>final mərhələsi</italic> (‘the final stage’), the knowledge of the suffix ‘-si’ helped the Turkish participants to understand that this was a compound expression with the word <italic>mərhələ</italic> (‘stage’) that was unknown to the students (Turkish <italic>merhale</italic>, ‘stage’, is antiquated and replaced in modern Turkish by <italic>aşama</italic>, ‘stage’). About half of the students incorrectly translated the phrase simply as <italic>final</italic> (‘final’). Others chose <italic>final turu</italic> (‘the final tour’) or <italic>final bölümü</italic> (‘the final part’), all possible translations. At this point, it is possible to conclude that a common morphological knowledge helped the students to understand this nominal compound.</p>
<p>Another morphological element which is originally unfamiliar but correctly interpreted by the participants is ‘-p’. To illustrate, in Example (3) above, <italic>BDU-nun Mətbuat Xidmətinin rəhbəri Şərəf Cəlili isə «Azadlıq» radiosuna bildirib ki, rektorun belə bir göstərişi olmayıb</italic>, the finite verb <italic>olmayıb</italic> (‘have-NEG-b-PAST’) consisting of an unfamiliar verb ending ‘-Ip’ is used. Nevertheless, the students interpreted this suffix immediately and correctly as a finite verb suffix giving a past meaning. The Azerbaijani finite verb endings – ‘-ib’, ‘-ibler’, ‘-üb’, etc. – were not a problem for the students, though the Turkish correspondent ‘-ip’ constitutes an infinite participial verb ending with the meaning ‘and’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367006911426449">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interesting observation concerns a word of English origin. The Turkish correspondent for the Azerbaijani <italic>jurnalistika fakültəsi</italic> (‘faculty of journalism’) in Text (2) should be <italic>Gazetecilik Fakültesi</italic>. It was astonishing that about one third of the students, who are students of English, could not activate their knowledge of English, with the word <italic>journalism</italic>, to guess the meaning of the expression.</p>
<p>The Azerbaijani phrase <italic>abidə ucaltmaq məqsədi ilə</italic> (‘with the aim to exalt’) in Text (2) can be translated word for word into Turkish as <italic>abide yüceltmek maksadıyla</italic> (‘to exalt’) but this correspondence was not easily recognized by the students. Instead, what all students realized was that the whole construction was an adjunct. Problems with this phrase did not affect the processing of the other parts of the sentences, and the students chose options that omitted this part until they guessed a phrase with a very similar meaning. Again, knowledge of Turkish syntax, here of the adverbial expression <italic>məqsədi ilə</italic> (‘with the aim’), was helpful in the understanding processing.</p>
<p>The phrase <italic>xatirə daşı qarşısına əklil qoymasına icazə verilməyib</italic> (‘they do not give the permission to put a wreath on the memorial’) contains <italic>icazə</italic> (‘permission’), a word that is not known to the students but that was correctly translated. Actually, there exists an antiquated Turkish/Ottoman word, <italic>icazet</italic>, which is not used anymore. Here, the context and knowledge of syntactic structure helped the students to process the phrase correctly.</p>
<p>More difficult to process was the phrase <italic>25 ölkənin təmsilçilərinin əsas və son məşqi keçirilir</italic> (‘the exact and last <underline>rehearsals</underline> of the 25 countries’ representatives are held’). The word <italic>məşq</italic> (‘rehearsal’) was completely unknown to the students, though Ottoman <italic>meşk</italic> (‘rehearsal’) is still known to the older generations; today <italic>prova</italic> (‘rehearsal’) is the commonly used word. Just as the interpretation of Azerbaijani /q/ as Turkish /g/ or /k/ caused difficulties, the realization of Azerbaijani /k/ as Turkish /g/ caused the same problem. Azerbaijani <italic>keçirilir</italic> (‘keçir-il-ir’, do-PASS-AOR) has simply <italic>geçirilir</italic> (‘to do’) as its Turkish counterpart. In the text, the same problem was apparent in the first sentence, where <italic>keçiriləcək</italic> (do-PASS-FUT, ‘will be done’) occurred, with <italic>geçirilecek</italic> as its Turkish counterpart. Nobody recognized this correspondence; interestingly, <italic>gerçekleştirilir</italic> or <italic>gerçeklestirilecek</italic> (‘will be realized’) was chosen as the most frequent solution, but nobody profited from the hint that /k/ may be simply realized by /g/. Another blocking effect is the nominative case in <italic>məşq-I</italic> (‘rehearsal-AKK’), using the passive ‘geçir-il-ir’ (do-PASS-AOR); a dative case is the correct case marking in Turkish. Not having this grammatical hint of a dative case was a further reason for the blocking effect towards correct processing of the sentence. In the end, 23 out of 30 students could not translate this sentence at all, leaving it without interpretation, though the other parts of the sentences were not unsolvable.</p>

<title>6.4 The reflection task</title>
<p>As the last phase of the data collection process, the participants were asked for their reflections concerning their experience with the Azerbaijani language. Participants revealed problems in understanding both spoken and written Azerbaijani. While 22 of them found the listening test more difficult than the reading test, eight of them found both tests equally difficult.</p>
<p>Taking part in this study and being exposed to Azerbaijani, more than half of the participants (18) acknowledged that their beliefs about Azerbaijani had changed, in that before the experiment, being speakers of Turkish, they thought it would be very easy for them to understand Azerbaijani. However, this did not occur as expected and they had difficulties in understanding Azerbaijani.</p>
<p>Last but surely not least, as a result of the experiment three participants stated that Azerbaijani sounded like a dialect of Turkish rather than a different language. This observation is in accordance with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367006911426449">Kirchner (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367006911426449">Brendemoen (2006)</xref> and will be discussed in the next section.</p>

<sec id="section17-1367006911426449" sec-type="discussion|conclusions">
<title>7 Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this study in which 30 Turkish participants tried to understand what was said or written in Azerbaijani reflect the extent to which Turkish speakers comprehend Azerbaijani. Based on the above results, it is possible to propose the following conclusions as explanations. Even though Turkish and Azerbaijani are presented as mutually intelligible languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367006911426449">Öztopçu, 1993</xref>), on the part of Turkish speakers, the intelligibility is not as high as estimated. It is necessary to note that the figures in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1367006911426449">Table 3</xref> do not make any suggestions about how well Turkish and Azerbaijani speakers could actually communicate but, rather, how well Turkish speakers understand spoken and written Azerbaijani. The overall results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1367006911426449">Table 3</xref> show that speakers of Turkish managed to understand spoken and written Azerbaijani to a limited extent although they assumed that they would easily understand it. The proportion of 41 (50 percent), calculated via the listening test, and of 59 (80 percent) via the reading test, can be accepted as evidence for some degree of intelligibility. These findings might be attributable to the influence of Persian and Russian on Azerbaijani. Analysis of the data reveals that the problems in comprehending and translating Azerbaijani texts occurred mostly with the existence of loanwords of Persian origin. Even though there are a large number of loanwords from Persian and Arabic in both languages, slight differences in pronunciation create problems in understanding. Concerning the sentences that include vocabulary of Turkish origin, the conclusion presents widely differing responses: while some of these words of Turkish origin did not create any problem but rather seem to have triggered accurate guesses of words even of Persian origin, some others, with different meanings in Turkish and Azerbaijani, led the participants to make wrong guesses when translating the texts.</p>

<p>Concerning the validity of these conclusions, the results obtained might be considered more valid for younger people, such as those who took part in this study. Conversely, it could be assumed that if the participants were of an older generation, different results could have emerged. As a result of the language reforms initiated by the Turkish Language Association, loanwords of Persian and Arabic origin were replaced by their Turkish variants. However, the consequences of this on the language have been gradual. While the older generations still tend to use words of Arabic and Persian origin, the younger generations have the tendency to use words of Turkish origin. That is, the effects of the language reforms are observed to differing extents in different generations. In order to validate the conclusions, the listening and reading tests used in this study were applied to two people who were aged around 60. As assumed, they easily translated the words of Persian origin, such as <italic>mərhələ, məşq, mətbuat, təhsil</italic> and <italic>ucaltmaq</italic>, which had been found to be difficult to translate by the younger participants of this study.</p>
<p>Another result that needs to be discussed is that the mean percentage of the correct translations appears to be slightly higher for the reading test than for the listening test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1367006911426449">Table 3</xref>). That is, understanding seems to improve when the participants are given the opportunity to read the texts. This result should be interpreted with reference to the diverse features that Turkish and Azerbaijani have in pronunciation and orthography. During the listening test, although the participants got the main idea of the texts, they were not able to grasp each and every word. Differences in pronunciation seem to be the main reason for incomprehensibilities during the listening test. As for the reading test, even though Turkish and Azerbaijani differ orthographically (in addition to the 29 characters of the Turkish alphabet, there are three more characters – ‘q’, ‘x’, and ‘w’ – in the Azerbaijani alphabet), this did not completely prevent understanding even though it slowed down the reading process. This finding might be used to confirm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367006911426449">Kirchner’s (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367006911426449">Brendemoen’s (2006)</xref> opinion that Turkish and Azerbaijani have so many commonalities that speakers of one of these languages perceive the other language’s differences as dialectal differences. In other words, although they do not understand the other language thoroughly, they feel as if they understand the language more than they really do. This is also confirmed by the participants’ belief that they could easily learn Azerbaijani.</p>
<p>The differences in the results between the listening and reading tests were expected to be higher. First, the students had been confronted with the tests during the listening test. Second, while reading, the readers had the possibility of going over the difficult parts more slowly and they could move around in the texts or read the same part again and again. Third, the proper names were written with capitals, which should have facilitated their understanding process. Therefore, the relative success of the listening test is surprising. This might again be explained by the typological closeness of the languages: common verb endings, genitive and possessive constructions, case markers, numbers and other morpho-syntactic elements, presumably, give the listener something that sounds like a dialect of their own language. These morpho-syntactic elements function like triggers that activate their receptive knowledge by means of which the listeners rebuild the sentences with the help of their available lexical knowledge. In this way, their receptive knowledge remains active during the oral understanding process. Thus, reading becomes only a process of reinforcing some parts that had not been successfully processed in the first listening tests. In the end, difficulties remain where words were unknown or could not be guessed. Therefore, the reading tests do not show a qualitative progress with respect to the listening tasks.</p>
<p>Last of all, due to the proximity of Turkish and Azerbaijani and the common cultural background, Azerbaijani is relatively intelligible to Turkish speakers. Therefore, the speakers of these languages, even if they might know another foreign language like English, tend to use Turkish as a lingua franca. Although the term lingua franca is these days commonly used together with the English language, this study shows that among Turkic speech communities, where receptive multilingualism acts as an adequate vehicle for mutual comprehension, Turkish might serve as a means of communication.</p>

<title>Text 2. Rəsulzadənin xatirə daşı qarşısına qoyulan əklil götürülüb</title>
<p><italic>Bakı Dövlət Universitetinin (BDU) jurnalistika fakültəsinin tələbələrinin Məmməd Əmin Rəsulzadənin xatirə daşı qarşısına əklil qoymasına icazə verilməyib. Mayın 23-də bir qrup tələbə universitet ərazisində yerləşən xatirə daşı qarşısına əklil qoyub. Onlar bunun Azərbaycan Xalq Cümhuriyyətinin 90-cı ildönümü ilə əlaqədar olduğunu bildiriblər. Lakin az keçməmiş bir qrup şəxs əklili xatirə daşının qarşısından götürüb. Onlar bunu universitet rektorluğunun tapşırığı ilə etdiklərini bildiriblər. Tələbələr «Azadlıq» radiosuna deyiblər ki, onlar hər il Xalq Cümhuriyyətinin yarandığı gün - mayın 28-də xatirə daşı qarşısına əklil və gül dəstələri qoysalar da, universitet rəhbərliyinin göstərişi onları dərhal götürürlər. BDU-nun Mətbuat Xidmətinin rəhbəri Şərəf Cəlili isə «Azadlıq» radiosuna bildirib ki, rektorun belə bir göstərişi olmayıb. O, Cümhuriyyətin 90 illiyi ilə bağlı BDU-da tədbir keçiriləcəyini bildirib. Bakı Dövlət Universiteti 1919-cu ildə Məmməd Əmin Rəsulzadənin təşəbbüsü ilə yaradıldığından bir müddət bu ali təhsil müəssisəsi onun adını daşıyırdı. 1992-ci ildə Rəsulzadəyə abidə ucaltmaq məqsədi ilə universitetin qarşısında xatirə daşı qoyulub. Lakin sonradan Rəsulzadənin adı universitetdən götürülüb</italic>.</p>
<p>‘Students of the Faculty of Journalism at the State University of Baku are not given permission to leave a wreath on the memorial of Mehmet Emin Resulzade. On 23 May, a group of students left a wreath on the memorial placed on the university area. They stated that it was in reference to the 90th anniversary of the Republic of Azerbaijan. However, after a short time, some people took the wreath away. They said that they did it according to the order of the rector. The students told Radio Azadlıq that every year on 28 May, which is the anniversary of the foundation of the Republic of Azerbaijan, they leave a wreath on the memorial; however the administration of the university take the wreath away. The secretary of the administration office of the State University of Baku, Şərəf Cəlili, told Radio Azadlıq that their rector did not have such regulations. He said that they will make preparations for the 90th anniversary of their republic. As the State University of Baku was established with Mehmet Emin Resulzade’s enterprise, this high education institution bore his name. In 1992, in order to exhalt Resulzade, his memorial was erected before the university. However, later, his name was taken from the university.’</p>

<p>The theoretical basis of this case might be explained by a neurolinguistic perspective. <italic>The Activation Threshold Hypothesis</italic> (ATH) which was initially proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367006911426449">Paradis (1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367006911426449">1993</xref>) assumes that activation and inhibition mechanisms control the multiple languages in the brain. That is, there is need for a certain amount of impulses to activate a language item of one of the languages constituting the activation threshold of that language. Items (or languages) that are more frequently activated need less stimulation to be reactivated than items (or languages) that are less frequently activated. Based on this brief explanation, it is possible to assume that depending on the frequency of use, different linguistic items within the same language might require various degrees of stimulation in order to become activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367006911426449">Paradis, 1997</xref>). In the case above, the word <italic>qazanıblar</italic> (‘to gain’) (qazan(V)-ıp(AOR)-lar(3PL) which is phonetically similar to its Turkish equivalence <italic>kazan-ır-lar</italic> (‘to gain’), having high frequency, is an active verb. Thus, activation and estimation of the meaning of <italic>vəsiqə</italic> (‘right’), a collocation of the verb <italic>kazanmak</italic>, probably required less stimulation.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-1367006911426449">
<label>2.</label>
<p>‘-Ip’ is, according to discussions in Turkish linguistics, not ‘an infinite participial verb’, but a ‘converb’ of old Turkic origin (not only correspondent but identical in Turkish and Azeri). Grammatically speaking, ‘-Ip’ is more an adverb than a verb (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367006911426449">Johanson [1998)]</xref> for a comprehensive morpho-syntactic analysis of Turkish converbs and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367006911426449">Rehbein [1999]</xref> for a morpho-pragmatic analysis of converbs). In both sources, ‘-Ip’ is presented as a finite form used in a sequence of sentences in order to lend the text a higher grade of connectivity.</p></fn>
