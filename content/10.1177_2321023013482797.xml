<p>This is a lucid, powerfully original and rigorously argued book in terms of the disparate terrains of bureaucracy, biopolitics, inscription and poverty that it traverses and in the way it frames questions of political anthropology. The strength of Akhil Gupta’s writing springs from his consistent rejection of the axiomatic as well as the incidental. Be it ideological truisms or empirical phenomena—literacy as empowerment, liberalization as the new-rich-middle-class driven juggernaut of violence against the poor, the routine deaths of the poor owing to malnutrition, corrupt lower-level officials—Gupta pauses to patiently interrogate and often overturn dominant assumptions of the relationship between poverty and the Indian postcolonial state.</p>
<p>To say that this book is empirically rich would be understating things. Gupta weaves his arguments through example: theoretical formulations, fictional representations and journalistic observations are all evaluated against everyday practices of the state at different levels of bureau, branch, location and official hierarchy.</p>
<p>Arriving from a biopolitical standpoint that critically engages with Foucault and Agamben, Gupta seeks to understand a paradox—of violence against the poor and official tolerance of poverty—induced deaths in a state that regards impoverished subjects as vital to ‘projects of national sovereignty’ (p. 6). By way of comprehending this paradox, he studies various government rural welfare programs among which the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), Mahila Samakhya and the Jawahar Rojgaar Yojana (JRY) prominently feature. In studying these programs, Gupta considers the various modalities through which structural violence—a theme that runs as a motif in this book—or a violence that is constantly but not necessarily intended, is unleashed against the rural poor. The modalities he identifies are corruption, ‘inscriptions’ (p. 141) and governmental practices. Gupta’s approach to corruption is innovative in that he stresses not its ‘dysfunctional aspect’ (p. 78) but its narrative dimensions. The state and citizenship are frequently imagined in everyday encounters of rural subjects with officials and in media reportage of popular perceptions, rumours and accounts of corruption.</p>
<p>Akhil Gupta’s forays into the analysis of bureaucratic inscription in the form of records, registers, certificates, counterfeit documents, complaints filed by rural subjects against state officials and those by lower level officials against each other complement his theoretical project to show mere literacy to be inadequate in everyday encounters with power. Through various examples—such as the one where a rural applicant has to struggle against odds to obtain the crucial signature of an official who in fact knows close to nothing about the life-experiences of the claimant—Gupta argues against an unqualified understanding of literacy. Gupta maintains that unless it is contextualized across language and location, the emancipatory potential of literacy collapses in the face of political power, the fetishizing of degrees, the absence of familiarity with bureaucratic procedures, the prospects of ‘intra-bureaucratic conflict’ (p. 186) and the inability to convert monetary assets into cultural, educational and social capital. Gupta critiques writing and literacy in their claims to truth, transparency, accountability and empowerment. However, Gupta also cites instances where the emphasis on writing allowed lower-level officials to perform a benign act or two, like saving economically and socially distressed <italic>anganwadi</italic> workers who were as much the subjects of welfare as the beneficiaries of the ICDS. The scholar who sets store by documentary practice may however be disconcerted by Gupta’s agenda in construing writing practices as tethered stubbornly to constituting the state. Occasionally, he sees various forms of bureaucratic writing as instrumental to debates on structural violence against the poor. While Gupta urges us to pay attention to the performative aspects of writing, he fails to consider the semiotic and representational possibilities of different practices of inscription beyond the pale of the state.</p>
<p>Gupta’s critique of Foucault’s writing and subsequent scholarship on governmentality is sharply pertinent in the postcolonial context of a government which is influenced by transnational ideas and institutional models of development and poverty reduction. The novelty of Gupta’s revision of governmentality must be traced to his attentiveness to its rapidly shifting forms during colonial rule and later in the pre and post liberalization era, and in different rural settings. Some of Gupta’s excellent observations challenging the efficient operation of governmentality in postcolonial India include the dubious nature of the information gathered on beneficiaries and census subjects and the tendency of over-evaluation in the form of reports submitted under welfare programs.</p>
<p>Another construction which is thoroughly worked out in the book is ‘neo-liberal governmentality’ (p. 240). Here, Gupta departs from scholarship and media perceptions that liberalization has caused the retreat of the state from social spending and welfare initiatives. His analytical move to read processes of empowerment central to neo-liberalism as complementary to processes of entitlement which lie at the heart of welfareism is a little suspect given that both processes labour under erratic practices of govermentality by Gupta’s own admission. His empirically supported critique of neo-liberalism is however insightful in so far as it points out that neo-liberalism should be held responsible for renewing and perhaps modifying forms of structural violence against the poor rather than introducing it.</p>
<p>One of the commendable analytical tasks that Gupta consistently executes is the disaggregation, most expertly, of all the central themes of his work: the theme of the state but also others like liberalization, poverty, structural violence, the bureaucracy and the poor. The last subject alone stands out as not adequately heterogenized even though Gupta does filter the category of the poor through inflections such as the indigeneous tribal poor caught in the cross-fire between the government and armed Maoist groups and the urban poor trapped in the uncertainties of unorganized labour and routine evictions. Had Gupta applied even briefly some of his ethnographic inquiries—the ‘arbitrary outcomes’ (p. 6) of bureaucratic interventions, the constitutive nature of popular narratives of corruption, the idiomatic aspects of biopolitics, the complementary relationship between orality and writing—to urban spaces, this work would have been an even more authoritative text on Indian politics, bureaucracy, state and society than it already is.</p>
