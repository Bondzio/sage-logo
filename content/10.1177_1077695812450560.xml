<p>Media law professors frequently face an initial challenge with students to spark passion about the subject and make clear its relevance to a career in professional media. In my Media Regulation &amp; Freedom course, I begin by probing personal values of freedom and social responsibility. In my next class, I will be showing <italic>Barbershop Punk</italic>.</p>
<p>The award-winning documentary tells the story of Robb Topolski, a Comcast customer who uncovered his Internet service provider (ISP) network processes that slowed and restricted access to peer-to-peer file sharing sites. Topolski has an interest in barbershop music and was attempting to share content that had fallen out of copyright and into the public domain. However, his use of services known for illegal uploading and file sharing of copyrighted music and video produced around-the-clock content restrictions. Soon, Topolski became an Internet celebrity after <italic>The New York Times</italic> reported on the issue.</p>
<p><italic>Barbershop Punk</italic> explores media consolidation and notes that Comcast eventually merged with NBC during the production of this film, and the deal was approved in early 2011 by regulators. <italic>Barbershop Punk</italic>, which was shown at numerous film festivals and won many awards, including the Big Apple Film Festival Best Feature Documentary, expresses worry about the power of large ISPs and telephone companies to control the Internet and potentially restrict content, or even promote paid content. While the film offers big business positions as well, it does so from a clear point of view that the government needs to check unchecked power. John Perry Barlow and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), for example, appear as a stronger voice than former Clinton administration spokesman Mike McCurry, who is discredited near the end of the DVD as part of the Washington, D.C., establishment after he dismisses the net neutrality debate as over.</p>
<p>Do not expect the film to explore the most current regulatory issues, such as the debate about the Stop Internet Piracy Act (SOPA) and Internet privacy, which happened after the release of the documentary in the United States. The extensive reliance on a half dozen interviews also produced inaccuracies of opinion. For example, there is a tirade about how the First Amendment is the most important of the Bill of Rights. Yet we know the first two amendments proposed by the framers failed to be ratified, and the Supreme Court most often balances fundamental rights.</p>
<p>While Topolski initially “won” his case, the film briefly notes that Comcast appealed. <italic>Barbershop Punk</italic> will not help your students understand the courts and law, but you will have the rest of the class to explain why so much time is devoted in case law to “punks” that challenge boundaries. The documentary has a nice explanation of the “common carrier” principle that guided the old wired telephone system, but it does less well with the public interest standard and its limitations.</p>
<p><italic>Barbershop Punk</italic> is thought-provoking and likely to encourage lively class discussion—especially if shown in chunks. The DVD, which has been released for sale ($295) or rental ($95) to classrooms and other educational group showings, is a primer on the Washington, D.C., policy system; the influence of lobbyists; the role of the Federal Communications Commission in regulating business competition; and the murky future of access to content through smart phones, tablets, and other premium devices. The filmmakers leave to us to conclude whether we should worry, but they tip the scale toward those fearing that the big business of telecommunication will favor their interests over the consumer.</p>
