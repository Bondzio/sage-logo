<abstract>
<p>Understanding how primary care clinicians manage depression is a key backdrop to current and future initiatives to improve detection and treatment of depression. We systematically reviewed, identified, and extracted findings from 13 qualitative studies that examined general practitioner (GP) management of depression. We assessed articles for quality using Critical Appraisal Skills Program guidelines for assessing qualitative research but did not exclude any articles based on quality. We carried out a thematic analysis for systematic review of qualitative research in which we identified four main themes with various subthemes: “negotiating the nature of depression,” “detect and diagnose,” “interventions,” and “burden.” The results of the analysis illuminate the complex dilemma faced by GPs in managing depression, which appears to be characterized by a sense of dissonance between the medicalization of depression and a sense of its social determinants.</p>

<p>The incidence of clinical depression in developed countries constitutes a major health burden. Twelve-month prevalence estimates vary between 6.7% in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312448540">Kessler, Chiu, Demler, &amp; Walters, 2005</xref>) and 3.2% worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312448540">Moussavi et al., 2007</xref>), constituting one of the leading causes of disability worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312448540">Mathers &amp; Loncar, 2006</xref>). A diagnosis of major depression covers a range of severity and illness duration. It includes mild, moderate, severe, and treatment-resistant depression as well as acute episodes and chronic and lifetime disorders.</p>
<p>During the 1990s, the growing availability of antidepressant medication provided the opportunity for drug treatments to be widely prescribed in primary care, and this activity was further promoted through the proliferation of guidelines and training in the recognition and management of major depressive illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312448540">Littlejohns et al., 1999</xref>). In the United Kingdom, the limited availability of nonpharmacological treatments for depression in primary care (such as counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) meant that prescription of antidepressant drugs rapidly became the first treatment of choice. More recently, however, psychological treatments are regaining popularity, in part as a result of critical reviews of the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312448540">Kirsch et al., 2008</xref>). Primary care physicians therefore now have a wider choice of treatments available.</p>
<p>The widening range of treatment options, however, has been accompanied by major debates about the exact nature of depression. The past few decades have witnessed major shifts in psychiatric thinking about how depression should be classified and managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312448540">McPherson &amp; Armstrong, 2006</xref>). Moreover, the uncertain distinction between “normal” mood swings and clinical depression has led to the charge that medicine has been increasingly medicalizing sadness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312448540">Parker, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312448540">Dowrick (2004)</xref> argued that the diagnosis of depression lacks validity and utility, and has proposed a new framework for conceptualizing patients’ emotional and social difficulties in primary care. Dowrick encouraged the clinician to step outside the prescribed manuals for diagnosis and treatment and engage with patients’ distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312448540">Dowrick, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the past 10 years, primary care physicians in the United Kingdom have stood at the crossroads of these debates. In the United Kingdom all patients are registered with their own general practitioner (GP), who provides almost all initial advice and management for illness. This means that the identification and management of clinical depression, whether presented overtly or covertly, as a symptom of low mood or as an inference made from the patient’s report of some other illness, is a common experience for GPs. How GPs in their everyday practices make sense of debates about diagnosis or appropriate treatment modalities therefore provides a case history of how elements of the diagnosis and treatment debate are being operationalized. In this article we present a systematic review of the findings from qualitative studies investigating how frontline clinicians engage with this debate.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1049732312448540">
<title>Search Strategy and Inclusion Criteria</title>
<p>In conducting the present review, we aimed to identify all published studies reporting qualitative research that addressed the views of GPs about depression and its management. Qualitative research was defined as a formal method such as a focus group or interview method accompanied by in-depth analysis. Studies employing relatively superficial data collection or analysis methods such as written comments on a questionnaire were not included. We used a qualitative filter based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312448540">Hughes, Closs, and Clark’s (2009)</xref> qualitative systematic search method. The databases Embase, Medline, British Nursing Index, and PsycINFO were searched in October 2010 using the following search strategy: (1) ethnographic studies.af, (2) qualitative studies.af, (3) phenomenological research.mp, (4) grounded theory.af, (5) qualitative validity.sh, (6) observational method.sh, (7) purposive sample.sh, (8) observational method.sh, (9) content analysis.af, (10) thematic analysis.af, (11) constant comparative method.af, (12) field studies.af, (13) theoretical sample.af, (14) discourse analysis.mp, (15) focus groups.af, (16) phenomenol$.mp, (17) ethnography.mp, (18) hermeneutic$.af, (19) heidegger$.af, (20) colaizzi$.af, (21) husserl$.af, (22) narrative analysis.af, (23) OR/1-22, (24) depress$.af, (25) common mental disorder.af, (26) melanchol$.af, (27) dysthymi$.af, (28) OR/24-27, (29) GP$.mp, (30) general practi$.mp, (31) primary care.mp, (32) family practice.mp, (33) family doctor$.mp, (34) OR/29-33, (35) 23 and 28 and 34.</p>
<p>Duplicates were removed, and the resulting list of 430 article titles and their abstracts was scanned in detail. Studies were excluded if their focus was either too narrow within the context of depression, such as studies concerning depression in children, postnatal depression, or management of depression associated with specific health conditions such as HIV, Alzheimer’s disease, or pain, or too broad, such as studies addressing common mental illness, anxiety, and depression or general mental illness. Studies were also excluded if their focus was on a narrow topic relating to depression such as prescribing antidepressants, use of guidelines, views on specific interventions, or techniques such as questionnaires or GP therapy, because these studies might have biased the findings by having set the topic of discussion in advance of the data collection. Studies were also excluded if the data from GPs were combined with data gathered from other professionals and were difficult to disentangle, because the focus of the present review was exclusively concerned with GPs. We identified 13 studies initially. We then scanned reference lists of these articles and searched author names iteratively until no new relevant articles could be identified. We obtained a total of 28 articles for full examination. After full examination, we found 13 that met the inclusion criteria and included them in the review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312448540">
<title>Quality Assessment</title>
<p>We read all 13 articles thoroughly and extracted information from each article. We assessed the quality of each study following Critical Appraisal Skills Program guidelines for qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312448540">Public Health Resource Unit, 2006</xref>), which are part of a range of critical appraisal tools developed in the United Kingdom National Health Service for use by health professionals to assess the quality of health-related research. We did not consider any studies to have significant ethical or methodological flaws. Some studies had relatively small or limited samples, some studies lacked reflection on the relationship between the researcher and participants, several studies failed to address the issue of added value by not having reviewed previous studies, and most studies that claimed to take a grounded theory approach fell short of a theory or synthesis of themes. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312448540">Noyes and Popay (2007)</xref>, we did not exclude any studies on the basis of quality because the quality issues could be addressed in the process of systematic review. For example, the combined samples of all studies covered a relatively large and diverse group of GPs, and we aimed to provide some corrective to the lack of synthesis in individual studies in the present review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312448540">
<title>Data Extraction and Synthesis</title>
<p>Although the synthesis of qualitative studies is less formalized than quantitative ones, there have been major advances in methods over the past decade or so. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312448540">Dixon-Woods, Agarwal, Jones, Young, and Sutton (2005)</xref> identified a number of qualitative approaches to research synthesis including narrative summary, thematic analysis, and grounded theory. Following the approach set out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312448540">Braun and Clarke (2006)</xref>, we employed thematic analysis. Within this approach, we employed an inductive analysis, aiming to generate themes that were data driven rather than theoretically driven because we had no preexisting framework into which we expected our themes might fit. Our analysis also followed a semantic approach in which themes were based on their explicit meaning rather than an interpretation. Interpretation and theorization took place after the generation of a thematic structure to consider the broader implications and meaning, but interpretation was not employed during the identification and development of the themes (see Braun &amp; Clarke).</p>
<p>Because the data we were analyzing were secondary rather than primary research findings, the analysis did not involve examining raw data such as participant quotations. Following Sandelowski and Barroso (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312448540">Hughes et al., 2009</xref>, p. 1142), data subject to analysis were “the data-driven and integrated discoveries, judgments or pronouncements which researchers offer[ed] about the phenomena, events, or cases under investigation.” This meant that direct quotations from participants or comments relating to single participants were not treated as data, nor were authors’ comments that drew on other literature or offered implications for findings.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312448540">Braun and Clarke (2006)</xref>, after familiarizing ourselves with the data set, we generated initial codes based on salient features in the data, systematically collecting data relevant to each code. We then developed themes from the initial codes, continuing to gather the relevant data systematically. We then reviewed themes and provided further definition and naming. We summarized findings from each article within each theme. We developed higher-order themes that were felt to appropriately categorize the themes. Both authors took part in the thematic analysis, and we resolved any thematic disagreements in discussion. The analysis involved only examination of published articles, so there were no ethical concerns.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 13 included articles, some appeared to report on results from the same sample or overlapping samples, given that the descriptions of the GPs in the reports appeared to be identical, or in some cases the authors explicitly referred to other publications using the same sample. Authors were contacted for clarification, but no responses were received. Presumed overlaps are noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312448540">Table 1</xref> and treated as one study, resulting in 10 studies. Sample sizes ranged from 10 to 32, representing a total of more than 200 GPs. Methods included interviews and focus groups. Most studies used a grounded theory informed approach, some used thematic analysis, and one used discourse analysis. The majority of studies were conducted in the United Kingdom. Two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312448540">Andersson, Lindberg, &amp; Troein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312448540">Andersson, Troein, &amp; Lindberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312448540">Lehti, Hammarstrom, &amp; Mattsson, 2009</xref>) were conducted in Sweden and one in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312448540">Miedema, Tatemichi, Thomas-Maclean, &amp; Stoppard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448540">Thomas-Maclean &amp; Stoppard, 2004</xref>). The thematic analysis identified four higher-order themes with a number of subthemes each (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312448540">Table 1</xref>), namely, negotiating the nature of depression, detection and diagnosis, interventions, and burden.</p>

<title>Negotiating the Nature of Depression</title>
<sec id="section7-1049732312448540">
<title>“Normal” response</title>
<p>A common idea reflected in many studies was of depression as a “normal” response to life stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312448540">Lehti et al., 2009</xref>), social circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312448540">Maxwell, 2005</xref>), and the social environment including workplace stress, family breakdown, unemployment, crime, and poor housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham, May, Cole, &amp; Hedley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham, Mullin, May, Hedley, &amp; Cole, 2002</xref>). It was thought to form within social contexts in which there were “multiple sources of disadvantage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312448540">Rogers, May, &amp; Oliver, 2001</xref>):
<disp-quote><p>Our respondents were, for the most part, people with multiple structural problems that were largely related to occupational insecurity, poverty and social exclusion, and with the impact that these had on interpersonal relationships and on child-care. Respondents accounted for the onset of their depression in terms of being unable, in some fundamental way, to cope with their everyday circumstances in the face of this pressure. (p. 320)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In some studies more severe or “traumatic” stressors were cited as causal, including “current” traumatic experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312448540">Rogers et al., 2001</xref>) and past trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312448540">Lehti et al., 2009</xref>) or trauma associated with being an immigrant, such as missing home and loss of social status (Lehti et al.):
<disp-quote><p>Migration resulted quite regularly in loss of status. The previous, self-evident social position was questioned. The power in gender relations could be changed and differ from the norms in the old country. The GPs realized that dramatic changes in status and social circumstances could cause tensions and conflicts leading to anxiety and depressive expressions. (Lehti et al., para. 24)</p></disp-quote>

<sec id="section8-1049732312448540">
<title>Medicalization, dissonance, and “true” depression</title>
<p>Only one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2001</xref>) appeared to find strong preference for a biological model of depression. Depression was seen by these Swedish GPs as a physiological disturbance, often with organic causes including chronic pain. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448540">Thomas-Maclean and Stoppard (2004)</xref>, GPs also talked about depression being “physiological in nature and result[ing] from a biochemical imbalance” (p. 281). However, in both of these studies an organic depression was coupled with something else relating to social factors which was not “true” (Thomas-Maclean &amp; Stoppard) or “proper” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2001</xref>) depression: “When depression could not be attributed to events in their patients’ lives, it was characterized by physicians as ‘true,’ that is, purely biological in origin” (Thomas-Maclean &amp; Stoppard, p. 281)</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448540">Thomas-Maclean and Stoppard (2004)</xref>, the analysis focused on discourse dissonance. GPs drew heavily on medicalized discourses of illness and cure and framed somatization as a kind of denial or dishonesty in patients, rather than part of a holistic problem, yet they also acknowledged depression as being “normal” in some cases. The authors located this problem in Cartesian dualism, suggesting that GPs were unable to view depression in a holistic sense because of an underpinning dualism in medical training and the unavailability of an appropriate discourse. This interpretation resonated within other studies. For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312448540">Rogers et al. (2001)</xref>, the authors noted,
<disp-quote><p>However much the profession of general practice has focused on ideas about “holistic” care, and however much individual clinicians in this study recognised the idiosyncratic circumstances that led to the patients presentation, the pathology of depression lay at the centre of their activities. . . . However much they constituted depression as a product of the social and psychological experiences of sufferers, they reasoned about depression as a medical problem and constituted sufferers as patients like any other. (p. 326)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Similar to this, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312448540">Johnston et al. (2007)</xref>, GPs described depression as a “highly individual concept, imbued with moral and cultural values” (p. e3), yet they encouraged their patients to consider it as a treatable illness, purportedly to minimize stigma.</p>
<p>The medicalization of depression was questioned much more directly by GPs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312448540">Lehti et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312448540">Maxwell (2005)</xref>, which dealt specifically with depression in minority cultural groups and women, respectively. GPs in Lehti et al. questioned the disease status of depression to the extent that they suggested “political actions and support groups” (para. 50) would be more appropriate for dealing with the types of problems presented by this group of patients. In Maxwell, GPs felt concerned about their role in “the social construction of depression” (p. 69): “Managing depression involved contemplating the boundaries of their professional role and their contribution to the social construction of depression. GPs’ accounts revealed their own dilemma concerning whether they should prescribe medication for essentially social problems” (Maxwell, pp. 68-69). These discordant findings might suggest either that engagement with patients from minority ethnic groups allows GPs to be more critical of their traditional medical model or that GPs who are more critical of the traditional medical model are more likely to engage with other cultures.</p>

<title>Curability</title>
<p>The dissonant nature of depression was further highlighted in the contradictory views on its treatability. Some researchers found a perception that depression was “intractable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham et al., 2002</xref>), whereas other researchers found that depression was generally self-limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312448540">Rogers et al., 2001</xref>) and “treatable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312448540">Johnston et al., 2007</xref>), with the goal of the GP being to cure or control. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312448540">McPherson and Armstrong (2009)</xref>, GPs were asked specifically to discuss patients who did not respond to treatments, and one common view expressed was that these patients did not have “depression,” which resonated with the idea of there being a “true” depression. In other words, the concept of depression as an illness was challenged when GPs were faced with clients who did not respond to the medical model by getting better. This also led GPs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312448540">McPherson and Armstrong (2009)</xref> to report that “they would be less likely to help patients perceived as unhelpable or unwilling to help themselves” (p. 1139).</p>
<p>On the whole, the nature of depression appears to have posed a conceptual challenge for GPs in these studies that perhaps demonstrates the difficulty of encountering patients with a plethora of social and emotional problems on a daily basis and yet feeling bound by the limited knowledge, skills, discourses, and interventions provided by a disease model of depression. The tensions and discordance reported by the researchers support the view that despite a formal medical view of the problem at the doctor–patient interface, the nature of depression was subject to considerable negotiation.</p>

<sec id="section11-1049732312448540">
<title>Stigma</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham et al. (2000</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham et al. (2002)</xref> found that GPs were eager to give patients a diagnosis of depression to provide some comfort in the absence of effective treatments, and diagnosis was seen to have secondary gain for GP and patient in that a diagnosis of depression allowed the patient time off work and provided a clear consultation outcome for the GP. In contrast, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312448540">Railton et al. (2000)</xref>, a diagnosis of depression was considered likely to cause stigma with patients not wanting a psychiatric diagnosis in their medical notes. Anticipated resistance to a diagnosis was reported as a barrier to diagnosis and treatment. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312448540">Miedema et al. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448540">Thomas-Maclean and Stoppard (2004)</xref>, resistance to diagnosis (owing to stigma) as well as noncompliance with treatment (owing to cost, stigma, or speed of efficacy of medication) were both anticipated. The problem of stigma was particularly acute in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312448540">Lehti et al. (2009)</xref>, which addressed depression in cultural minorities: “To be depressed was in some societies the same as being mad and just to mention depression was regarded as an insult” (para. 26). Moreover, GPs in this study reported that the conceptual clash with different cultures meant that it was not possible to talk about a concept of “depression,” nor did patients present their symptoms in conceptually coherent ways fitting with the Western model of depression.</p>

<sec id="section12-1049732312448540">
<title>Knowing the patient</title>
<p>A significant facilitator of diagnosis was continuity. Continuity was felt to be critical to allow GPs to recognize changes in mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312448540">Railton et al., 2000</xref>) and to enable GPs to be familiar with the patient’s history and social context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312448540">Miedema et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448540">Thomas-Maclean &amp; Stoppard, 2004</xref>). “Despite drawing on a medicalized understanding of depression, physicians also talked about the importance of establishing rapport with their patients and of possessing knowledge about the social context of their lives” (Thomas-Maclean &amp; Stoppard, p. 283). Where continuity was hindered, as in the example of immigrants and exiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312448540">Lehti et al., 2009</xref>), GPs felt that their knowledge of the patient’s history and life was limited and that this could lead to critical information that might help in diagnosis being missed.</p>

<title>Guidelines and diagnostic tools</title>

For example, guidelines were seen to categorize depression in unhelpful and not meaningful ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312448540">Railton et al., 2000</xref>). Depression was regarded by some GPs as too variable, subjective, or individual to be amenable to guidelines and screening tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312448540">Maxwell, 2005</xref>), and these tools were generally considered as unsuitable for use with depressed patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312448540">Lehti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312448540">McPherson &amp; Armstrong, 2009</xref>):

<title>Prescribing views and practices</title>
<p>Prescription of antidepressants was generally accepted as a standard feature of the management of depression. In some studies, the cost of antidepressants was a factor. Although newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were preferred because of their reported increased effectiveness and fewer side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2001</xref>), they were also more expensive, which could be prohibitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312448540">Railton et al., 2000</xref>) and could mean using the older tricyclic drugs instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2001</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312448540">Miedema et al. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448540">Thomas-Maclean and Stoppard (2004)</xref>, based in Canada, medication costs were considered to be problematic for patients without private health care insurance, and GPs needed to make use of compassionate programs offered by pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>In parallel with the biomedical concept of depression expressed by GPs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312448540">Andersson et al. (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312448540">Andersson et al. (2001</xref>), these GPs were also the most strongly in favor of antidepressants and felt that medication was critical to reduce suffering. Psychotherapy was seen as a possible adjunct in some cases but could not replace drug treatment. Even in this study, however, there were glimpses of the disease concept splintering in that some of the participants thought the medication worked as a placebo, although others believed medication worked by correcting an “imbalance.”</p>
<p>In other studies there was more evidence that medication might not be the preferred option but was often the only pragmatic option. GPs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham et al. (2000</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham et al.

Yet GPs in this study also described “an inverse relationship between giving time and prescribing drugs” (p. 267), indicating that listening and allowing patients to talk about their difficulties was a better form of therapy than medication. The strongest views expressed against medication were found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312448540">Lehti et al.’s (2009)</xref> discussion of depression in minority groups: “The peril of medicalization of human stresses was discussed” (para. 45). GPs’ accounts revealed their own dilemma concerning whether they should prescribe medication for essentially social problems. However, the same GPs felt that using antidepressants in Swedish patients was useful, suggesting that medication was effective only in particular cultural groups. Similar to this, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312448540">McPherson and Armstrong (2009)</xref>, “Non-response was commonly described as inevitable if patients had particular life problems or a particular attitude or personality which defied the medical logic of psychotropic drugs . . . implying a treatment worked only when the psychosocial conditions were right” (p. 1139).</p>

<title>Lack of resources</title>
<p>These mixed and often contradictory views on the effectiveness and mechanisms of antidepressant medication highlight again an underlying dissonance in the disease model of depression. Were GPs to embrace a more psychological or sociological model of depression, it is evident that they would have felt entirely unsupported given the limited resources for counseling and therapy in secondary care. Secondary care was described as having long waiting lists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham et al., 2002</xref>), being overwhelmed by the seriously mentally ill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312448540">Rogers et al., 2001</xref>), being inadequate or scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312448540">Pollock &amp; Grime, 2003</xref>), or having a lack of qualified counselors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312448540">Miedema et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448540">Thomas-Maclean &amp; Stoppard, 2004</xref>).

<title>Interactional difficulties</title>
<p>In spite of the positive aspects of being able to provide patients a “sounding board,” there was nevertheless a general sense that patients with depression were a practical and emotional problem for GPs. Because depression is an “interactional problem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham et al., 2002</xref>), patients were felt to place a high demand on GPs’ psychological resources, although some felt the work could be rewarding nevertheless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2001</xref>). Because working with depressed patients required emotional work, it was recognized to be affected by the GP’s mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312448540">Railton et al., 2000</xref>), gender, or personal qualities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2001</xref>). The role of interaction was particularly highlighted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312448540">Lehti et al.

Interpreters were not an ideal solution to the problem, as “the triad interaction (a patient, an interpreter and a doctor) was time-consuming and frictions in communication were common” (para. 30).</p>
<p>The greatest frustration seemed to be expressed when discussing patients who did not respond to treatment. “GPs often described frustration and uncertainty when depression resists cure, regarding such patients as inappropriately seeking help and ‘difficult’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312448540">Johnston et al., 2007</xref>, p. e8). Similar to this, in McPherson and Armstrong, in which GPs were asked to talk about patients who did not respond to medication, patients were described
<disp-quote><p>as having generally unpleasant characteristics and who do not generate caring or helping responses; empathy could be lost as a result of GPs feeling frustrated by not being able to close consultations, but also that loss of empathy represented a fundamental problem in GPs’ interactions and conceptualisations of nonresponsive patients.

This strategy is not underpinned by either a medical model or a social causation model, but represented a third competing construct in GPs’ negotiation of the nature of depression.</p>

<title>Lack of time</title>
<p>Depressed patients were also burdensome in terms of time and workload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312448540">Johnston et al., 2007</xref>). The time spent on depressed patients was seen as being at the cost of other patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312448540">Chew-Graham et al., 2002</xref>), and resulted in waiting room delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312448540">Miedema et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448540">Thomas-Maclean &amp; Stoppard, 2004</xref>) and long days for the GP. Some GPs seemed to adopt approaches to managing time such as providing extended appointments, but this could not always be managed proactively, particularly when patients presented with depression for the first time unexpectedly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312448540">Miedema et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312448540">Pollock &amp; Grime, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448540">Thomas-Maclean &amp; Stoppard, 2004</xref>):
<disp-quote><p>There was agreement also that dealing with depression typically required longer than most other conditions dealt with in general practice. This was particularly true of the first consultation, which often considerably over-ran the booked appointment time. . . . First consultations for an episode of depression were reckoned to take two or three times as long as routine visits, typically lasting about 20 minutes. GPs could accommodate these through their willingness to run over time with their surgeries. (Pollock &amp; Grime, p. 264)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The lack of time meant that it was hard to listen to patients’ problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312448540">Johnston et al., 2007</xref>) and that it was difficult to properly explore problems and make a reliable diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312448540">Andersson et al., 2001</xref>). However, GPs described spending extra time as a long-term investment: “Taking time to establish their understanding of the problem, and develop the patient’s trust and confidence would result in a more effective response to treatment, and save time later” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312448540">Pollock &amp; Grime, 2003</xref>, p. 265).</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312448540">Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)</xref>, a thematic analysis approach to systematic review is limited in that it can be data driven or theory driven and that this is often not explicit. We have aimed to be explicit about how the thematic analysis was conducted and claim that the present review was largely data driven (inductive), based on the findings presented in the articles reviewed. However, it is not always possible for the reviewers to entirely ignore the influences of any implicit theories employed by the authors of the articles reviewed. Nevertheless, the majority of articles reviewed by and large did not present any well-developed theories, although one article reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448540">Thomas-Maclean &amp; Stoppard, 2004</xref>) was clearly more influential than others in terms of helping to formulate an understanding of the overall findings.</p>
<p>It was also not possible to completely put aside any underlying assumptions we might have held as reviewers, particularly because we had been the researchers in one of the studies reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312448540">McPherson &amp; Armstrong, 2009</xref>). It is therefore possible that the findings of our own study might have influenced our interpretation of the other studies. However, this influence was limited because the present review was carried out prior to the study we reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312448540">McPherson and Armstrong (2009)</xref>, and only the later stages of writing and final consolidation of the present review took place after the writing up of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312448540">McPherson and Armstrong (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>A significant limitation of all of the studies reviewed, and thus of the review, was that “depression” was not defined in any explicit way for the purpose of the interviews or focus groups. The findings therefore represent working interpretations of “depression” that might be individual to GPs. Nevertheless, the findings of the review highlight the very issue of definition and the contested nature of depression. Providing a diagnostic-symptom-based definition as part of the research process might not therefore have added to the utility of the findings.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In spite of the limitations of the review, some useful conclusions can be drawn. The diagnosis and management of depression in primary care remains in a state of flux. In 2000, for example, most or all guidelines in the United Kingdom instructed GPs to use antidepressant medication as a first-line treatment for depression in the context of a drive to increase diagnosis and treatment. SSRIs were at that time fairly new on the market and were heralded as the modern, safe antidepressant with fewer unpleasant side effects compared to tricyclics. By 2004 there was growing concern about overprescribing, and the national guidelines shifted in emphasis toward psychological treatments (though this was not coupled with increased provision of psychological treatments in the United Kingdom until 2009, when a large national program was launched to provide CBT for mild and moderate depression). During this period, perhaps owing to a parallel increasing acceptance and practice of qualitative research in health services, a number of qualitative studies investigated GP management of depression. The very existence of these studies and their stated aims provides an indication of the various pressures and expectations that have been applied to GPs within this time period.</p>
<p>In the present review, most GPs appeared to have regarded antidepressant medication as a standard feature of the management of depression either because this was the most helpful intervention or because there were limited resources in secondary care, though as noted this might be changing. The increasing availability of talking therapy for mild and moderate psychological problems might enable a shift away from the medicalization of distress observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312448540">Parker (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312448540">Dowrick (2004)</xref>, and others.</p>
<p>The present review suggests that during a period in which various changes to the environment in terms of service provision and attitudes toward antidepressant use in the wider medical and lay community have occurred, there have also been different views of depression among GPs. Although the idea of a two-type causal model (true vs. normal response) suggests an overall sense of conceptual clarity among GPs in these studies, there is also a sense of contradiction in some studies. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312448540">Thomas-Maclean and Stoppard (2004)</xref>, although there is a “normal response” concept in which depression is seen as a normal response to the social environment, common, and hence acceptable, there is also an element of tension in GPs’ discourse between the “normal response” and the medicalization of depression. Thomas-Maclean and Stoppard found that GPs tended to discuss depression in terms of something being “wrong,” such as a biochemical imbalance, and tended to describe a mechanistic approach to treatment. This highlighted a dissonance in GP thinking that Thomas-Maclean and Stoppard identified as a tension between a “normal response” idea and the notion of treatability, which has implications for the GP’s role in medical encounters. This dissonance was also reflected in some of the other studies and throughout the themes. In addition, not only is there a potential dissonance between a medical model and a social causation model, there is also a third potential model suggesting the involvement of individual patient responsibility. For patients encountering different concepts of depression among GPs, this might be confusing.</p>
<p>The kind of “GP therapy” described by several of these studies is the kind of intervention espoused by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312448540">Dowrick (2004)</xref>, who proposed that GPs should adopt a new conceptual framework for working with depression. In the present review, this aspect of management appeared to be one of the few positive ways GPs talked about their work with depressed clients. This might explain why psychiatric rotations, training in psychiatry, guidelines, and psychiatric screening tools were held to lack utility in primary care. Psychiatric rotations, for example, were described by some GPs as unhelpful, owing to the severe nature of psychiatric illness encountered, which did not reflect the type of mental illness encountered most often in primary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312448540">McPherson &amp; Armstrong, 2009</xref>). As an alternative to the traditional primary care model of diagnose and treat, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312448540">Dowrick (2004)</xref> encouraged listening, understanding, and helping patients to construct their life stories in different ways. Dowrick also espoused the kind of social prescription described in some studies, which might mean stepping outside the currently understood boundaries of medical behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312448540">Dowrick, 2009</xref>), and the present review seems to lend some support to these ideas.</p>
