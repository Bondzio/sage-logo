<p>In my short commentary, I dwell on the distinction between basic and complex empathy, and suggest that a basic perception-based form of empathy might point to the existence of a type of social understanding that is more direct and more fundamental than the types of social cognition normally addressed by simulation theory and theory theory.</p>

<p>Despite the recent upsurge of interest in and work on empathy, there is still no clear consensus about how to demarcate empathy from related phenomena such as emotional contagion and sympathy, in part, of course, because there is still no agreement on what precisely empathy is. Not only are conflicting definitions currently being proposed with diverging implications for the contribution that empathy can supposedly make to interpersonal understanding—some claim that empathy is “the glue that makes social life possible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073911421387">Hoffman, 2000</xref>, p. 3; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073911421387">Gallese, 2001</xref>, p. 43), others that it is a less direct and more mediated form of interpersonal understanding than the kind provided by cognitive perspective-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754073911421387">de Vignemont &amp; Singer, 2006</xref>, p. 439)—but there is also no agreement on whether empathy is a single unified phenomenon or rather a multidimensional construct.</p>
<p>Given this lack of consensus, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself in agreement with many of the points made by Hollan in his article “Emerging Issues in the Cross-Cultural Study of Empathy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421387">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>To start with, I think <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421387">Hollan (2012)</xref> is right in distinguishing the “that question” from the “why question,” and also in suggesting that different forms of empathy might be involved. To see <italic>that</italic> another person is angry or performing a specific action is already a form of interpersonal understanding that arguably depends on a basic form of empathy. But even if one ascribes a certain primacy to this rather primitive, automatic and affective form of social understanding, one also has to realize its clear limitations. It doesn’t as such provide us with an understanding of <italic>why</italic> somebody is angry or performing the action in question. And if the latter kind of understanding also requires a form of empathy, we are dealing with a cognitively more complex type. As Hollan writes, “The second type of empathy may grow out of and be dependent upon the visceral and perceptual mechanisms enabling the first, but its full realization also requires knowledge that is more sensitive to situation and context, and also more prone to misinterpretation and error” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421387">Hollan, 2012</xref>, p. 71).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421387">Hollan’s (2012)</xref> claim that a comprehensive account of empathy needs to consider the role of context and the importance of background knowledge, should be familiar to readers of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754073911421387">Schutz (1967)</xref>, who in his classical contribution <italic>Phenomenology and the Social World</italic> argued that we have to go beyond a narrow focus on face-to-face interaction and embodied engagement, if we want to understand the full psychological life of others. Although it might be permissible to say that certain aspects of the other’s consciousness, such as his joy, sorrow, pain, shame, pleading, love, rage, and threats, are given to us directly and noninferentially, it does not follow from this that we also have a direct access to the <italic>why</italic> of such feelings. And in order to uncover these aspects, it is not sufficient simply to observe facial expressions and actions; we also have to rely on interpretation, and have to draw on a highly structured context of meaning. In short, if we wish to reach a deeper level of interpersonal understanding, we have to go beyond what is directly available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754073911421387">Schutz, 1967</xref>, pp. 23–24, 168; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754073911421387">Zahavi, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>One question to ask though is whether the role of empathy is restricted to face-to-face based forms of interpersonal understanding, or whether there are forms of empathy that reach further. One problem with making the latter claim—that is, the claim that people in Copenhagen can, say, feel empathy with those affected by the March 11 tsunami and that they employ empathy in order to understand the stressful situation of the workers at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant—is that it blurs the distinction not only between empathy and sympathy, but also between empathy and simulation-based or theory-based forms of standard mindreading. In my view, this should be avoided, since the existence of a basic perception-based form of empathy might precisely point to the existence of a type of social understanding that is more direct and more fundamental than the types of social cognition normally addressed by simulation theory and theory theory (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754073911421387">Zahavi, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1754073911421387">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Recognizing that there might be different types of empathy, and that some might be more basic than others, doesn’t yet answer the question of whether and to what extent the more automatic forms can be affected by top–down modulation. I consequently welcome and endorse Hollan’s call for more studies that compare and explore the relation between the various forms of empathy.</p>
<p>Another important issue that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421387">Hollan (2012)</xref> touches upon concerns the alleged moral neutrality of empathy. It is important not to conflate empathy and sympathy. Whereas the latter necessarily involves a component of care and concern, this is not the case with the former. Just think of the skilled interrogator or the sadist. A high degree of empathic sensitivity might precisely be of use if one wants to humiliate somebody. Hollan, however, questions the epistemic purity of empathy. As he points out, empathy is very rarely simply a matter of passively understanding the thoughts and feelings of others; rather, it is something that impels one to action. But even if Hollan might be right in arguing that “complex empathy is never ‘neutral,’ but rather is always found embedded in a moral context which affects both its likelihood and means of expression, and its social, emotional, and even its political and economic, consequences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421387">Hollan, 2012</xref>), the question that needs to be asked is whether this also holds true for the most basic form of empathy.</p>
