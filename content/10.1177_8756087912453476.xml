<p>This year the SPE annual technical conference (ANTEC) was co-located with National Plastics Exposition (NPE) April 1–5, 2012 in Orlando, Florida, USA. This was the second time ANTEC and NPE were co-located and the first time in Orlando Florida. Attendees had the opportunity to learn from the many presentation provided during ANTEC and also to view hardware at NPE.</p>
<p>I had the honor of presenting the keynote presentation for the special symposium in memory of our founding editor James P Harrington. James was born on Decmeber 25, 1925 in Lucknow, India and attended the Woodstock School in Mussoorie, India. His father Burritt Harrington taught school in India and that is why he spent his early years there. Jim graduated from Cazenovia High School in 1943 and served as a Sargent in the 238<sup>th</sup> General Hospital Unit in Europe from 1944 to 1946. He attended Princeton University earning a BSE in 1949 and MSE in 1952. He worked at DuPont for 18 years as a research engineer, technical representative and group manager. During this time he was awarded two patents. He then moved to L.D. Caulk Company as their R&amp;D Director. Then he became the Director of Exhibits for the Franklin Institute and taught at Drexel University. In 1984 he was approached by Mel Kohudic, the owner of Technomics to edit a journal for him. Jim realized that there were 15–30 film papers presented at ANTEC and TAPPI’s PLC each year with only 2–5 being published. So thus became the Journal of Plastics Film &amp; Sheeting which had volume 1, issue 1 published in 1985. In 2001 Sage Publishing took over the journal and is its current publisher. In 2001 Jim asked me to help him edit the journal and then retired in 2010 handing the editor duties over to me. On February 27, 2010 Jim died after a 6-year struggle with pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension. For the people who knew Jim, he was a scholar, mentor, family man and a warm human being. While his body died, his spirit lives on with his family, friends and the many communities who were touched by his wonderful life.

<p>The invited presenters and the titles of their talks were:
<list id="list1-8756087912453476" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Dr Evan Mitsoulis, ‘Some Issues Arising in Finding the Detachment Point in Calendaring of Plastic Sheets’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dr Abdellah Ajji, ‘Functionality in Multilayer Films for Packaging’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dr Miko Cakmak, ‘Real-Time Tracking of Birefringence, Weight and Thickness during Drying/Curing of Solution Cast Polymer Coatings and Films’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dr Douglas E Hirt, ‘Additive Migration in Polymer Films’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dr Hung-Jue Sue, ‘Fracture Toughness and Scratch Behavior of Polymeric Thin Films’</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>This symposium was well attended and the talks were very interesting.</p>
<p>Besides the learning at ANTEC, I found the NPE show to be of great value. While NPE is not as large as Kunstoffe, it is still very impressive and is a great opportunity to view new technology and meet suppliers. The contrast between NPE in Chicago and NPE in Orlando is something to take notice of. In Orlando the major hotels are within walking distance of the presentation halls. There was plenty of room for expansion and bigger NPE’s in the future. The weather was great and hotel and meal cost was much less than Chicago. It is no wonder that NPE was moved to a right to work state where there are no restrictive union rules for setting up the booths.</p>
<p>Continuing with the idea that film and sheet is used to package food and that safety is important let us look at myth number 3 from the US government food safety web site: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.foodsafety.gov/">http://www.foodsafety.gov/</ext-link>.<disp-quote>
<p>Myth #3: When cleaning my kitchen, the more bleach I use, the better. More bleach kills more bacteria, so it’s safer for my family.</p>
<p>Fact: There is actually no advantage to using more bleach than needed. To clean kitchen surfaces effectively, use just one teaspoon of liquid, unscented bleach to one quart of water.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Why does it matter? Illness-causing bacteria can survive in many places around your kitchen, including your hands, utensils, and cutting boards. Unless you wash your hands, utensils, and surfaces the right way, you could spread bacteria to your food, and your family.</p>
<p>In the industry news section we have the future events calendar, a photo essay of NPE in Orlando Florida and patents summaries from 7,838,604 to 7,867,414.</p>
<p>The first of the four papers in this issue ‘Effect of maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene on engineering properties and morphology of fumed silica filled polyethylene blown films’ by Sangita Nandi, Sanjukta Bose, Susanta Mitra and Anup K Ghosh is about Blown films of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/fumed silica (FS) composites that were prepared by melt-mixing in twin-screw extruder. Both oxygen and water vapor transmission rates of the films increased in composites as compared to HDPE, plausibly due to formation of nanogaps in blown film and/or increased solubility of penetrant molecules at filler–matrix interface.</p>
<p>The second paper ‘In silico genomics analysis of weed Lantana camara and its proposed application in synthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate’ by Protiti Bose and Rahul Shrivastava is about a class of microbially produced polyesters (poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs)) that have potential applications as conventional plastics, specifically thermoplastic elastomers.</p>
<p>The third paper ‘Experimental and statistical analysis of the effects of the processing parameters on the seal strength of heat sealed, biaxially oriented polypropylene film for flexible food packaging applications’ by Rajarajan Aiyengar and Jyoti Divecha is about seal strength for packaged products such as biaxially oriented polypropylene films.</p>
<p>The fourth paper ‘Preparation and properties evaluation of nonisocyanate condensation polyurethanes based on phenol sulfonic and hydroxybenzoic acids’ by M Bakar and A Białkowska investigates the preparation of nonisocyanate polyurethane through condensation of oligomeric hard segments produced by using phenol sulfonic and hydroxybenzoic acids and soft segments obtained by transesterification reaction of polyoxypropylene glycol with ethyl urethane.</p>
