<p>
<italic>Purpose:</italic> Pharmacists have been shown to improve medication reconciliation at hospital admission. Limited resources may obligate pharmacy departments to target resources for medication reconciliation rather than extend services to the entire hospital. We conducted a prospective, randomized, nonblinded assessment of the effectiveness and feasibility of pharmacist-led admission medication reconciliation for geriatric patients. <italic>Methods:</italic> Eighty-one geriatric patients were randomized 1:1 to receive medication reconciliation per current hospital practice or to pharmacist-led medication reconciliation at admission. The primary end point was medication profile appropriateness by pharmacist review at 48 hours postadmission. Secondary end points involved in determining the impact and feasibility of this program. <italic>Results:</italic> Pharmacist-led medication was superior to standard hospital practice, with 48% of controls and 71% of intervention patients having appropriate medication profiles at 48 hours postadmission (<italic>P</italic> = .033). Pharmacists identified 116 discrepancies among 81 patients including predominantly omissions (41%) and a composite of wrong dose, route, or frequency (35%). Pharmacists spent a median 15 minutes per patient. <italic>Conclusion:</italic> Pharmacists improved admission medication reconciliation for geriatric patients. Pharmacists identified a significant number of discrepancies, including predominantly omissions and wrong dose, dosage form, or frequency. Pharmacists’ contributions to medication reconciliation could yield substantial benefit to patient care.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>A 1999 report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlighted medical errors, including medication errors, as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011422605">1</xref>
</sup> Preventable adverse drug events occur at a rate of almost 2% of inpatient admissions with an estimated national cost of $2 billion nationwide annually. In response to the high rates of medication errors occurring at transitions in care (ie, inpatient admission from home), the Joint Commission<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011422605">2</xref>
</sup> identified medication reconciliation, a process of “accurately and completely [reconciling] medications across the continuum of care” as the focus of National Patient Safety Goal (NPSG) 8. The Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medication Errors describes a broad 3-step process for achieving medication reconciliation; this process defines medication reconciliation as the compilation of a complete home medication list, using that list to guide inpatient ordering and resolving any discrepancies with existing orders.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011422605">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Pharmacist participation has been shown to improve the quality of medication reconciliation in a number of studies. Nester and Hale found that pharmacists performing medication reconciliation intervened on 34% of patients, identified more nonprescription and herbal medications, and contacted community pharmacies for clarification significantly more often than nurses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011422605">4</xref>
</sup> Gleason et al found similarly that when pharmacists performed medication reconciliation, they intervened in 27% of patients with 70% of interventions accepted by a physician.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011422605">5</xref>
</sup> Reeder and Mutnick<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011422605">6</xref>
</sup> showed that compared to physicians, pharmacists identified significantly greater numbers of home medications, documented significantly more allergies and vaccination statuses, and found an overall discrepancy rate of 21%. In one study, pharmacist-led medication reconciliation had the highest net benefit and cost-effectiveness compared to 4 other solutions: computerized systems with pharmacist feedback, nurses, pharmacy technicians, and use of a medication list faxed from a general practitioner.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011422605">7</xref>
</sup> Despite the benefits of pharmacist-led medication, it is still not the standard of care at many institutions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011422605">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>At our institution, a 676-bed tertiary care medical center with 1500 monthly admissions to medicine and surgery, pharmacist-led medication reconciliation is currently not the standard of practice. However, as part of a transition from a centrally based to a unit-based staffing model, pharmacists will be expected to have additional responsibility for medication reconciliation, whether they are performing medication reconciliation themselves or supervising doctor of pharmacy students. At this time, staffing levels do not permit pharmacist-led medication reconciliation for every admitted patient, necessitating the development of tools to guide unit-based pharmacists in their selection of patients for medication reconciliation.</p>
<p>Gleason et al demonstrated that patient age is an independent risk factor for medication errors at transitions of care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011422605">9</xref>
</sup> Geriatric patients are at increased risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and medication errors due to a number of factors including deteriorating organ function, altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, polypharmacy, and exclusion from clinical trials.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190011422605">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190011422605">11</xref>
</sup> Pharmacist involvement in care of geriatric patients has been shown to reduce drug-related morbidity, improve prescribing, and potentially decrease costs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190011422605">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190011422605">11</xref>
</sup> The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of pharmacist-led medication reconciliation within 24 hours of admission for hospitalized geriatric patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0897190011422605">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a prospective, randomized, nonblinded study approved by the local institutional review board (IRB). Patients more than 70 years of age were eligible for inclusion if they were admitted to 1 of the 2 general medicine floors or 1 general surgery floor during the study period (December 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010). These floors were selected in order to obtain a broad population of patients in terms of disease states and home medications. Patients were excluded from the study if their expected duration of hospital stay was less than 48 hours as indicated by their admission to a designated short-stay service or if they were admitted to a primary service rounding with a clinical pharmacist.</p>
<p>All patients were randomly assigned to either control or pharmacist-led medication reconciliation based on the last digit of their medical record number (ie, controls, odds; intervention, evens). Medication reconciliation in the control group was defined as medication reconciliation per existing standard hospital practice; at our institution, at the time of the study, primarily the admitting medical resident or intern performed medication reconciliation. This was typically done at the time of admission or as soon as the family could be contacted for any necessary input. Additionally, as part of the existing hospital practice, staff pharmacists review medication orders for appropriateness and agreement with the electronic home medication list completed by the admitting medical resident; however, they do not have significant opportunity for direct patient contact and rely on that list to be accurate. Our control patients received this standard practice, followed by additional quality assurance performed by a pharmacist at 48 hours after admission, to determine whether the original medication list was reconciled correctly and to allow for comparison to the intervention group.</p>
<p>Pharmacist-led medication reconciliation was defined as comprehensive admission medication reconciliation performed by a pharmacist within 24 hours of inpatient admission. Pharmacists were required to use at least one source of information apart from the patient’s electronic medical record and interviewed every patient when feasible. There were situations when a full patient interview by the pharmacist was not conducted, but these were limited to patients unable to participate in an interview for medical, psychological, or social reasons. Other sources of information included, but were not limited to, family discussion, review of a home medication list, assessment of prescription vials, and communication with outpatient or retail pharmacy. Pharmacists utilized a standard medication reconciliation form prefilled with patient demographic and background information as well as a list of patient home medications from the medical resident history and physical note to guide patient discussion. Prior to, and throughout, the study, pharmacists received training regarding the expectation for the project and how best to interview patients, identify discrepancies, and document interventions. This was done primarily to promote a standardized approach between clinicians. Discrepancies were broadly defined as any inappropriate medication use or ordering requiring intervention per the pharmacists’ clinical judgment. Interventions were communicated to the patient’s primary medical resident using electronic paging, telephone conversation, or personal interaction.</p>
<p>All patients’ medication profiles were reviewed by a pharmacist at 48 hours after admission to identify any outstanding discrepancies in the physician-obtained medication reconciliation. For control patients, this review was performed with similar methodology as in the 24-hour intervention, using the same medication reconciliation form. As in the 24-hour intervention, discrepancies were defined as any inappropriate medication use or ordering requiring intervention per the pharmacists’ clinical judgment. For intervention patients, the review was primarily to assess whether all prior identified discrepancies had been resolved. All outstanding discrepancies identified during the 48-hour review were communicated to the patient’s primary medical resident.</p>
<p>The primary end point assessed was medication profile appropriateness at 48-hour pharmacist review. For a medication profile to be deemed as “appropriate,” it required all discrepancies from medication reconciliation to be resolved and all medication use to be appropriate as documented by the reviewing pharmacist. Secondary end points assessed primarily to determine feasibility of pharmacist-led medication reconciliation included effectiveness of pharmacist-led medication reconciliation (ie, physician acceptance of pharmacist recommendations), discrepancy type and anticipated severity if allowed to persist for the duration of hospitalization (as defined by the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention [NCC MERP] taxonomy for patient outcomes), number and type of information sources used, and time spent per patient.</p>
<p>With a planned sample size of 80 patients, the study was designed to have 80% power to detect a difference of 20% in medication profile appropriateness of the pharmacist-led medication reconciliation group compared to the control, assuming a statistically significant 2-sided α level of 0.05. The primary end point was assessed using the Pearson chi-square test. Other baseline data and end points were assessed using the student <italic>t</italic> test for continuous data and the Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables. Statistical analysis was completed with SPSS version 14 (Chicago, Illinois)</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 81 patients were enrolled in the study. Forty patients (49%) were randomly assigned to receive medication reconciliation per existing hospital practice (control) and 41 (51%) were assigned to pharmacist-led medication reconciliation (intervention). Baseline characteristic were similar between the 2 groups except that 37% of patients had altered mental status per pharmacist assessment in the intervention group compared to 23% in the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190011422605">Table 1</xref>
). The mean patient age was 80 years, and the majority of patients enrolled in the study were admitted to medicine services. Most patients identified themselves as Caucasian (51%) or African American (38%), and were predominantly English speaking (90%). Patients’ home medication profiles contained an average of 8 or 9 medications prior to admission and at the time of pharmacist interview and were discharged on an average of 10 or 11 medications.</p>

<p>Seventy-one percent of patients who received pharmacist-led medication reconciliation had appropriate medication profiles at 48 hours compared to 48% of patients who received medication reconciliation per standard practice, a statistically significant improvement in the primary end point (<italic>P</italic> = .033; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190011422605">Table 2</xref>
). A total of 71 discrepancies were identified in the intervention group compared to 45 in the control group. Of these discrepancies, a similar amount were resolved by the reviewing pharmacist in the intervention group (45; 63%) compared to the control group (32; 71%). Control patients had a lower rate of appropriate medication profiles at 48 hours despite fewer identified discrepancies because every unresolved discrepancy identified at the 48-hour review was considered inappropriate per the definition stated earlier.</p>

<p>Overall, of the 81 patients included in the study, 48 (59%) had appropriate medication profiles at 48-hour pharmacist review. Pharmacists identified 116 discrepancies requiring intervention per their clinical judgment. Seventy percent of these discrepancies were resolved upon communication with a physician with similar proportions of interventions accepted in each group.</p>
<p>The most common types of errors identified by pharmacists were omissions and incorrect dose, route, or frequency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0897190011422605">Table 3</xref>
). The predominant medication classes for omissions were cardiovascular ([CV] 30%), gastrointestinal ([GI] 19%), electrolytes and vitamin (19%), endocrine (9%), and psychiatric (9%). In terms of incorrect dose, route, or frequency discrepancies, CV (39%), anti-infective (15%), endocrine (12%), and psychiatric (12%) medications were most frequent. Pharmacists also identified errors of commission without indication, incorrect medication ordered, inappropriate therapy, and therapeutic duplication (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0897190011422605">Table 3</xref>). Type of discrepancies identified did not differ between treatment groups.</p>

<p>Pharmacists were asked to assign anticipated severities to all identified discrepancies from both the control and intervention groups, should those discrepancies be allowed to continue, using the NCC MERP taxonomy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0897190011422605">Table 4</xref>
). For the purposes of this study, anticipated severity was defined as the likely severity of the medication error if no intervention had been made. Anticipated severity according to pharmacist assessment was fairly equally distributed between categories C, D, and E, indicating that most errors identified likely would have results in no harm or temporary harm requiring intervention. It is important to note that these are merely estimated severities if the particular intervention had not been made; no actual patient harm from a medication reconciliation error was identified during this study. For this reason, anticipated NCC MERP severity is only broken down into 3 categories.</p>

<p>Pharmacists assessed a mean of 1.7 information sources per patient, apart from the electronic medical record, to obtain an up-to-date medication list and complete medication reconciliation. While pharmacists were encouraged to use patient interview as one of their sources of information, there were occasions where a patient interview could not be considered a reliable source of information due to patient knowledge, mental status, or language barriers. Sources of patient-specific drug information used (nonexclusive) included patient interview (49%), up-to-date medication list (including nursing home records; 43%), family interview (31%), and a community pharmacy (23%). Pharmacists reported spending a median time period of 15 minutes, performing medication reconciliation for each patient. This time period encompassed any assessment of the patient’s electronic medical record, obtaining the up-to-date medication list, and reconciling any discrepancies with the primary resident. The process took between 10 and 25 minutes for most patients, with 23 patients (28%) requiring greater than 30 minutes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pharmacist-led medication reconciliation within 24 hours of admission significantly improved medication profile appropriateness for geriatric patients at 48 hours by 23% (<italic>P</italic> = .033). This finding is similar to the previous reports<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011422605">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011422605"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011422605">6</xref>
</sup> that have found pharmacists contribute to an absolute reduction in admission medication reconciliation errors of 20% to 30%. Pharmacists identified a clinically significant number of discrepancies requiring intervention (116, 1.4 per patient), of which 70% were accepted by the patient’s primary physician. Similar to prior reports, the most common types of errors identified by pharmacists were errors of omission and wrong drug, route, or frequency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011422605">5</xref>
</sup> When assessing for anticipated potential severity if an error was allowed to continue, pharmacists predominantly anticipated that the error would lead to no harm (31%) or require increased monitoring to prevent harm (41.4%). Pharmacists used a wide variety of sources in a more extensive attempt to ascertain the patients’ true home medication list, including frequent communication with community pharmacies. It is possible that such a broad search for information may not have been used by other health care professionals, although this was not measured in this study.</p>
<p>There were a number of limitations of this study. The patient population was small, predominantly medicine patients, and any results from the study would be primarily applicable to geriatric patients. Additionally, due to the small number of patients in the trial, our randomization resulted in a greater number of patients who were not fully alert and oriented in the intervention group, indicating that pharmacists were working with a potentially more challenging population. While we found pharmacist-led medication reconciliation to be effective for geriatric patients, other factors such as increased number of medications have been established as independent risk factors for medication reconciliation errors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011422605">9</xref>
</sup>A polypharmacy population could also represent a potential target for pharmacist-led medication reconciliation.</p>
<p>Additionally, we would have liked to achieve a higher rate of medication profile appropriateness than 71% in our intervention group. We found during the course of the study that when the pharmacist would attempt to perform medication reconciliation within 24 hours, frequently the patient’s admitting medical resident was away from the medical center since they had been on call the previous night. Cross-covering physicians often were hesitant to deviate from prior orders entered by the primary team. There was not a strong partnership between pharmacists and physicians in design and implementation of this study which likely contributed to inconsistent communication. The pharmacists completing the study were often unknown to the medical residents, who would not typically expect a pharmacist to participate in medication reconciliation. This issue likely contributed to our lower appropriateness rate and potentially could be circumvented by a stronger partnership with the medical staff and a formal mechanism for follow-up in future projects. Finally, the majority of interventions not accepted were not clinically significant based on anticipated severity and/or medication class (eg, vitamins and electrolytes).</p>
<p>Another limitation of the study was a lack of validation by other health care professionals. While no changes were made to a medication profile without physician approval, independent physician review of study patients would have been useful to ensure the clinical significance of each intervention, whether there were missed opportunities for intervention, and to validate the pharmacist-assigned severity ratings. Despite the lack of outside validation, the wide variety of medications intervened on and the severity assessments support the clinical significance of these interventions. Additionally, the pharmacists participating in the study were either clinical pharmacy specialists in internal medicine or postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) pharmacy residents who would be able to identify most significant discrepancies.</p>
<p>Anecdotal data support the clinical significance of the interventions made. We had multiple examples of incorrect or discontinued psychiatric medications ordered and a number of times when angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) had been continued during acute renal failure with elevated potassium. One patient was admitted with 10 different discrepancies including omissions without justification, wrong medications ordered, and discontinued medications restarted on admission inappropriately. We also had 1 patient who had previously experienced angioedema secondary to an ACE inhibitor restarted on the same medication on admission. These errors were corrected by the pharmacists and did not result in further potential harm to the patient.</p>
<p>Implementing a program of this magnitude for all patients admitted to our institution or those fitting the demographic of this study would require significant commitment of pharmacist hours. Extrapolating a median time spent of 15 minutes to approximately 25% of 1500 monthly admissions suggests a mean weekly requirement of approximately 22 hours, or 0.5 full-time equivalents (FTEs) for a pharmacist to provide medications reconciliation for all patients over age 70 admitted to the medical center. Similarly, a program targeted to provide pharmacist-led medication reconciliation for all admissions would potentially require an investment of approximately 88 hours weekly, or 2 FTEs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Pharmacists significantly improved the appropriateness of admission medication reconciliation by 23% for geriatric patients, with substantial benefit to patient care in terms of reduction in medication reconciliation discrepancies. Pharmacists identified a clinically significant number of discrepancies and were usually able to translate those into accepted interventions; all interventions communicated by pharmacists represented clinically significant discrepancies, many of which could have resulted in patient harm if unresolved. Pharmacists often used a variety of sources of information in an effort to truly obtain the most accurate home medication list. The benefits on patient care observed in this study were consistent with previous studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011422605">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011422605"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011422605">6</xref>
</sup> Targeting geriatric patients for medication reconciliation appears reasonable based on the benefits observed in this study and the low FTE burden. While this study was effective in improving medication reconciliation, formalized partnership with physicians where there is an expectation of pharmacist involvement, a mechanism for communication, and a pathway for documentation could further improve pharmacist-led programs for this population.</p>
