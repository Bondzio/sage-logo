<abstract>
<p>The bodily self is constructed from multisensory information. However, little is known of the relation between multisensory development and the emerging sense of self. We investigated this question by measuring the strength of the rubber-hand illusion in young children (4 to 9 years old) and adults. Intermanual pointing showed that children were as sensitive as adults to visual-tactile synchrony cues for hand position, which indicates that a visual-tactile pathway to the bodily self matures by at least 4 years of age. However, regardless of synchrony cues, children’s perceived hand position was closer to the rubber hand than adults’ perceived hand position was. This indicates a second, later-maturing process based on visual-proprioceptive information. Furthermore, explicit feelings of embodiment were related only to the visual-tactile process. These findings demonstrate two dissociable processes underlying body representation in early life, and they call into question current models of body representation and ownership in adulthood.</p>

<p>People’s sense of self is constructed from multisensory information, including cues from vision, touch, and proprioception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612462902">Ehrsson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612462902">Longo, Schüür, Kammers, Tsakiris, &amp; Haggard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612462902">Makin, Holmes, &amp; Ehrsson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612462902">Tsakiris, 2010</xref>). Although it is clear that both multisensory bodily perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612462902">Bremner, Holmes, &amp; Spence, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612462902">Rochat, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797612462902">Zmyj, Jank, Schütz-Bosbach, &amp; Daum, 2011</xref>) and the sense of self (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612462902">Lewis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612462902">Rochat, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612462902">Slaughter &amp; Brownell, 2011</xref>) develop in infancy and early childhood, there has been little investigation of the relationship between these processes. For example, it is clear from young infants’ visual preferences that they can perceive the visual-proprioceptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612462902">Bahrick &amp; Watson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612462902">Morgan &amp; Rochat, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612462902">Schmuckler, 1996</xref>) and visual-tactile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797612462902">Zmyj et al., 2011</xref>) correspondences that underpin own-body perception in adults. Yet the extent to which young children actually derive a sense of bodily self or body ownership from these multisensory correspondences is difficult to determine (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612462902">Bremner et al., 2012</xref>). Using the <italic>rubber-hand illusion</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612462902">Botvinick &amp; Cohen, 1998</xref>), we investigated the development of young children’s use of multisensory information to localize their own body parts and gain a subjective sense of body ownership. In this illusion, the sight of a fake hand being stroked, combined with synchronous tactile cues on the participants’ real hidden hand, causes adults to feel as if the fake hand is their own and to perceive the touch they feel as arising from the brush they see stroking the fake hand.</p>
<p>Although the relation between the multisensory bodily self and the subjective sense of self in childhood is poorly understood, a wide range of studies have addressed these two issues separately. The subjective sense of self in children has been studied using explicit measures of self-knowledge, including mirror self-recognition, the use of personal pronouns, and the tendency to engage in pretend play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612462902">Lewis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612462902">Rochat, 2010</xref>). Some aspects of an explicit subjective sense of the self appear to continue developing well into childhood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612462902">Povinelli, Landry, Theall, Clark, &amp; Castille, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The multisensory bodily self has been studied with a range of tasks. Research has shown that young infants can achieve crossmodal transfer between visual and tactile stimuli (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612462902">Sann &amp; Streri, 2007</xref>), perceive temporal synchrony between visual and tactile stimulation to the limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797612462902">Zmyj et al., 2011</xref>), and perceive synchrony between visual and proprioceptive signals during limb movement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612462902">Rochat, 1998</xref>). Despite this early competence, research investigating children’s intermanual pointing and ballistic movements indicates a protracted development of multisensory body representations across childhood. More specifically, whereas adults integrate proprioceptive and visual cues for localizing the hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797612462902">van Beers, Sittig, &amp; Denier van der Gon, 1996</xref>), in middle childhood, visual cues to the hand appear to dominate proprioception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612462902">Hay, Bard, Fleury, &amp; Teasdale, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612462902">Smothergill, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612462902">Smyth, Peacock, &amp; Katamba, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0956797612462902">von Hofsten &amp; Rösblad, 1988</xref>; although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612462902">Pagel, Heed, &amp; Röder, 2009</xref>). This late development is also in line with recent evidence concerning the development of multisensory processing more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612462902">Gori, Del Viva, Sandini, &amp; Burr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612462902">Nardini, Jones, Bedford, &amp; Braddick, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>There are several key issues concerning the development of the bodily self that are, as yet, unaddressed. First, it is not clear whether, in childhood, vision of the hand dominates in establishing a subjective sense of hand ownership to the extent that it does in establishing a sense of hand position. Second, as well as receiving information about one’s body from vision and proprioception, nearby objects can play a role, through touch, in determining where people perceive their limbs to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612462902">Botvinick &amp; Cohen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612462902">Makin et al., 2008</xref>). No studies have focused on how, during childhood, these tactile cues interact with visual cues in establishing hand position and ownership.</p>
<p>In the experiment reported here, we used the rubber-hand illusion to investigate how young children (from 4 to 9 years old) employ visual and visual-tactile information to localize the body and establish a subjective sense of bodily self. After either synchronously or asynchronously stroking one of the participant’s real hands and the fake hand, we measured perceived hand position by asking participants, with eyes closed, to point underneath the table with the unstimulated hand to the index finger of the stimulated hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612462902">Botvinick &amp; Cohen, 1998</xref>). Finally, participants’ sense of body ownership was quantified using a questionnaire. On the basis of what is known of the development of multisensory processing for hand localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612462902">Smothergill, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0956797612462902">von Hofsten &amp; Rösblad, 1988</xref>), and more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612462902">Gori et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612462902">Nardini et al., 2008</xref>), one might expect to find developmental progression throughout early and middle childhood.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>We measured the strength of the rubber-hand illusion in adults and children. Participants sat with their left hand on a table in front of them, hidden from view. To measure baseline hand-localization ability, we asked participants to use their right hand to point underneath the table to their left index finger. Following this, a fake hand was placed on the table, and the researcher stroked the fake hand and the participants’ real hand either synchronously or asynchronously. Participants again used their right hand to point underneath the table to their left index finger. We measured whether these postinduction pointing responses shifted with respect to baseline pointing responses. Finally, we asked questions concerning the sense of ownership felt over the fake hand and the perceived location of the paintbrush touches.</p>
<sec id="section2-0956797612462902">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We tested adults (mean age = 23.9 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.2 years; <italic>n</italic> = 30) and three age groups of children (4- to 5-year-olds: mean age = 5.1 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.3 years; <italic>n</italic> = 30; 6- to 7-year-olds: mean age = 7.1 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.5 years; <italic>n</italic> = 30; 8- to 9-year-olds: mean age = 9.2 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.4 years; <italic>n</italic> = 30). Two 4-year-olds from our initial sample were excluded because of their performance on a catch trial and replaced with two other 4-year-olds so that the final sample for this age group comprised 30 participants. For half of each age group, the fake and real hands were stroked synchronously; for the other half, they were stroked asynchronously. This between-participants design (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612462902">Botvinick &amp; Cohen, 1998</xref>) minimized testing time for the young participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0956797612462902">
<title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>To keep the postural configuration and motor demands of the setup the same across differently sized participants, we scaled setups and measured behavioral responses in units of percentage of arm length rather than absolute distance (e.g., centimeters). The right hand was placed on a tray under the table, at 50% of the participant’s arm length to the right of the body midline. On two training trials, the left hand was visible and rested on the table. Participants were trained to slide their right index finger along a horizontal groove so that it ended up underneath the left index finger. This meant that in all trials, pointing responses were made only in the mediolateral axis.</p>
<p>After training, participants completed four baseline trials. The right hand was positioned as before, with the left hand resting on the table at 25% arm length to the left of body midline. With eyes closed, participants were asked to point with their right index finger underneath their left index finger. The position of each pointing response was marked under the table. For each participant, the mean and standard deviation of these four pointing responses were used in analysis. Participants then chose a sticker from a small box as a reward. This encouraged the children and reduced the likelihood of the baseline trials biasing subsequent test-condition pointing.</p>
<p>The test condition started with the participant’s eyes closed, the real left hand placed at 25% arm length to the left of the body midline, the fake left hand at the midline, and the right hand, as before, under the table at 50% arm length to the right of midline. Positioning the fake hand at body midline eliminated any disturbances of tactile localization due to changes in head or eye position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612462902">Harrar &amp; Harris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612462902">Ho &amp; Spence, 2007</xref>). A cloth was then placed over the left arm. The fake hand was a painted, plaster-cast hand, appropriately sized for each age group (children’s hand lengths were all within 2 cm of their age-appropriate fake hand; adults’ hand lengths were within 3 cm).</p>
<p>After the hands were positioned, the participant watched for 2 min while the fake and real left hands were stroked by the researcher with two identical paintbrushes. In a between-participants design, stroking of the fake hand occurred either synchronously (same time, same position) or asynchronously (different time, different position) with stroking of the real hand. Next, participants were asked to close their eyes and point with their right index finger under the table to the left index finger of their own hand (as in baseline trials). Then the right hand was repositioned, eyes were opened, stroking was repeated for 20 s, and participants were asked to close their eyes and point again. In total, each participant pointed four times. As in baseline trials, the position of each pointing response was recorded by the experimenter, and the mean of these four postinduction pointing responses was used in the analyses. The four experimental trials were followed by one catch trial, in which participants were asked to point first under the fake finger then under their own finger. These data were not included in the analyses but were used to exclude children whose response when they were instructed to point under their real finger was closer to the fake hand than was their response when they were instructed to point under the fake finger.</p>
<p>Finally, participants were asked two questions: “When I was stroking with the paintbrush, did it sometimes seem as if you could feel the touch of the brush where the fake hand was?” and “When I was stroking with the paintbrush, did you sometimes feel like the fake hand was your hand, or belonged to you?” The 7-point answer scale was designed to be understood easily by children: 0 = <italic>no, definitely not</italic>; 1 = <italic>no</italic>; 2 = <italic>no, not really</italic>; 3 = <italic>in between</italic>; 4 = <italic>yes, a little</italic>; 5 = <italic>yes, a lot</italic>; 6 = <italic>yes, lots and lots</italic>.</p>

<title>Baseline (no fake hand present)</title>
<p>In baseline trials, participants were asked to point to their own hand with eyes closed and were given no additional tactile information. We first calculated the constant error and variable error of these pointing responses. For each trial, we measured the difference between mean pointing position and actual hand position, mediolaterally, scaled as a percentage of arm length. The constant error for each participant was calculated by taking the mean of these four values. The variable error was calculated by taking the standard deviation of the values. A positive constant error indicated that pointing responses were made away from the hand in the direction of the body midline. Constant error varied nonlinearly with respect to age group, <italic>F</italic>(3, 116) = 4.89, <italic>p</italic> = .003, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .112, becoming increasingly positive with age between the 4- to 5-year-old group and the 8- to 9-year-old group, but declining again in the adult group. Both linear and quadratic components were observed—linear <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .05, <italic>F</italic>(1, 118) = 5.88, <italic>p</italic> = .017; quadratic <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .11, <italic>F</italic>(2, 117) = 6.99, <italic>p</italic> = .001 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612462902">Fig. 1a</xref>). However, it is important to note that despite these trends, there were no differences in baseline constant error between children (all ages) and adults, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>(120) = 1,349, <italic>Z</italic> = −0.006, n.s. Variable error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612462902">Fig. 1b</xref>) declined steadily with age, <italic>F</italic>(3, 116) = 14.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .272, with both linear and quadratic components—linear <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .25, <italic>F</italic>(1, 118) = 39.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; quadratic <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .25, <italic>F</italic>(2, 117) = 19.8, <italic>p</italic> = .001.</p>

<title>Postinduction</title>
<p>To measure the extent to which intermanual pointing was influenced by multisensory cues in the induction phase, we used the difference between mean postinduction pointing position and mean baseline pointing position in the mediolateral axis, scaled to a percentage of arm length (“proprioceptive drift,” as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0956797612462902">Tsakiris &amp; Haggard, 2005</xref>). In other words, we subtracted the baseline responses from the postinduction responses to yield a measure of drift toward the fake hand relative to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797612462902">Fig. 2</xref>). This drift was greatest in the synchronous-stroking condition, and it was larger in children than in adults. Across all participants, drift was significantly affected by stroking mode, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>(120) = 923, <italic>Z</italic> = −4.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Drifts toward the fake hand were stronger in participants given synchronous visual-tactile information than in participants given asynchronous visual-tactile information. To determine whether visual-tactile cues influenced adults’ and children’s hand localization differently, we compared proprioceptive drifts across both stroking modes in children (all ages) and adults. A Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test revealed that children showed significantly greater proprioceptive drifts than adults, <italic>U</italic>(120) = 925, <italic>Z</italic> = −2.6, <italic>p</italic> = .01. Additional analyses showed that this was true for both synchronous, <italic>U</italic>(60) = 196, <italic>Z</italic> = −2.4, <italic>p</italic> = .016, and asynchronous, <italic>U</italic>(60) = 222, <italic>Z</italic> = −1.97, <italic>p</italic> = .049, stroking modes. This was further confirmed with a 2 (stroking mode: synchronous vs. asynchronous) × 2 (age group: children vs. adults) analysis of variance (ANOVA) on proprioceptive-drift scores, which showed main effects of stroking mode, <italic>F</italic>(1, 119) = 14.72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and age group, <italic>F</italic>(1, 119) = 8.39, <italic>p</italic> = .005, and no significant interaction between these factors, <italic>F</italic>(1, 119) = 1.12, n.s. Therefore, children responded more strongly than adults to the illusory, visually specified hand position, whether or not tactile stroking information was congruent with visual stroking information.</p>

<p>We next considered the performance of children separately. For children (all ages combined), postinduction pointing responses were significantly different from baseline pointing responses in the synchronous-stroking condition, <italic>t</italic>(44) = 6.62, two-tailed <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and approached significance in the asynchronous-stroking condition, <italic>t</italic>(44) = 1.95, two-tailed <italic>p</italic> = .058. An ANOVA with age group (4–5 years, 6–7 years, 8–9 years) and stroking mode (synchronous, asynchronous) as factors revealed a main effect of stroking mode, <italic>F</italic>(1, 84) = 18.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .183, no effect of age group, <italic>F</italic>(2, 84) = 0.022, n.s., η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .001, and no interaction between age group and stroking mode, <italic>F</italic>(2, 84) = 0.288, n.s., η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .007.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>For children, as for adults, viewing a fake hand stroked in synchrony with a real hand induces the rubber-hand illusion. In the experiment reported here, the perceived position of the participant’s own hand was shifted toward the position of the fake hand, and participants also experienced a referral of touch to the fake hand and sense of ownership over it. These effects were apparent from pointing measures, questionnaire data, and spontaneous reactions (comments such as, “That feels like my hand!”).</p>
<p>As well as the induction of the illusion in children, two specific developmental results emerged from our data. First, the magnitude of the difference between the synchronous- and asynchronous-stroking conditions was unaffected by age. This was true for both the proprioceptive- drift measure and the subjective experience of ownership as assessed by a verbal question. This indicates that the role of multisensory visual-tactile cues in determining hand position and embodiment changes little across childhood. Indeed, existing data indicate that infants are clearly able to distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous tactile cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797612462902">Zmyj et al., 2011</xref>). Second, irrespective of visual-tactile cues, children’s perceived hand position was closer to the rubber hand than adults’ perceived hand position was. In both synchronous- and asynchronous-stroking conditions, children’s postinduction pointing responses drifted significantly further toward the fake hand than did adults’ responses. We suggest that, for children 4 to 9 years old, viewing an appropriately oriented hand is a particularly powerful cue to their own hand position and that the strength of this cue declines between childhood and adulthood. On the basis of these findings, we argue for two dissociable processes underlying body ownership and suggest differential developmental trajectories for these processes.</p>
<p>The first process underlying body ownership that is implied by the data is an early maturing visual-tactile process. The integration of visual and tactile cues in perihand space is a key component of several current models of body ownership and the rubber-hand illusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612462902">Botvinick &amp; Cohen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612462902">Makin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612462902">Tsakiris, 2010</xref>). The present data show that this visual-tactile process is present in children as young as 4 years, because, across all ages, visual capture of perceived hand position toward the fake hand was significantly modulated by the stroking condition. Spatiotemporally congruent visual-tactile information significantly increased proprioceptive drift, explicit feelings of tactile displacement, and feelings of ownership over the fake hand. Findings of early sensitivity to visual-tactile synchrony are consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797612462902">Zmyj et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore suggest that a visual-tactile process for own-body localization and ownership matures early in development.</p>
<p>The second process implied by the results is a late-maturing visual-proprioceptive process that subserves self-localization. Through this process, the sight of an appropriately oriented hand is used to determine own-hand position. This type of visual-proprioceptive process has been considered both as a prerequisite for, and a potential outcome of, successful visual-tactile integration in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612462902">Ehrsson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612462902">Makin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612462902">Rohde, Di Luca, &amp; Ernst, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612462902">Tsakiris, 2010</xref>). The present data suggest that this process is functional by 4 years but has a protracted developmental trajectory: Children 4 to 9 years old showed significantly larger proprioceptive drifts than adults across both stroking modes. Therefore, irrespective of visual-tactile information (indeed, despite it in the asynchronous condition), the visual-proprioceptive process powerfully influenced the sense of hand position for children.</p>
<p>What underlies the developments we found in visual-proprioceptive processing during childhood? One possibility is that our data indexed age-related differences in baseline hand localization. When reaching to a hand specified by proprioception only, the reduction in variable error that we observed (consistent with previous studies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0956797612462902">von Hofsten &amp; Rösblad, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612462902">Nardini, Begus, &amp; Mareschal, 2012</xref>) could have led to decreasing reliance on the visible fake hand. Crucially for the current experiment, however, these baseline differences have been discounted in order to obtain measures of drift solely due to the visible fake hand.</p>
<p>A second possibility is that, in determining own-hand position, reliance on the sight of the hand changes in childhood. What aspects of the hand determine this visual reliance? Adults rely on both orientation and corporeality. To more fully characterize this visual-proprioceptive process in children, further investigations could assess the impacts of rotating the fake hand or presenting children with a noncorporeal object. However, we assume that some degree of corporeality and a broadly correct orientation of the hand are key for children, as they are for adults (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612462902">Ehrsson, Spence, &amp; Passingham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0956797612462902">Tsakiris &amp; Haggard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797612462902">Tsakiris, Carpenter, James, &amp; Fotopoulou, 2010</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that reliance on the sight of an appropriately oriented hand changes during childhood.</p>
<p>The conclusion of these analyses, namely, that an influential visual-proprioceptive process appears early in development, is consistent with preferential-looking studies of infants’ responses to their own limbs. These studies suggest that vision of an appropriately oriented limb signals own-body position even in infants under 1 year old: When the basic prerequisite of a body-like object is removed by changing the visual form of the legs, looking preferences also disappear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612462902">Morgan &amp; Rochat, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797612462902">Zmyj et al., 2011</xref>; although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612462902">Bremner &amp; Cowie, in press</xref>). This reliance on visual information concerning the limbs is a pervasive feature of children’s bodily control (see the Introduction). A frequently invoked explanation for such visual dominance is that children’s proprioception provides more variable estimates of body layout than vision does, and this leads to a sensory weighting in favor of vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612462902">King, Pangelinan, Kagerer, &amp; Clark, 2010</xref>). However, such an account does not provide a good explanation of our data. Whereas baseline variable error (proprioceptive variance) declined steadily with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612462902">Fig. 1</xref>), visual reliance on the sight of the hand (proprioceptive drift across both stroking modes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797612462902">Fig. 2</xref>) was very similar across children of all ages.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for this heavy reliance on the sight of the hand during childhood, what is striking from the present data is that even at 9 years of age, this visual-proprioceptive process is not adultlike but is in fact significantly stronger for children than for adults. We propose that there is an early appearing visual-proprioceptive process, which does not become adultlike until late childhood. We thus explain children’s responses to the rubber-hand illusion in terms of (a) an early developing visual-tactile process underlying perceived hand position and a sense of hand ownership and (b) a late-developing visual-proprioceptive process underlying perceived hand position only. Differential development in these visual-tactile and visual-proprioceptive processes bears important implications for both an understanding of development and models of body ownership in the mature adult. We address the implications for each of these literatures in turn.</p>
<p>First, our findings reveal two distinct developmental pathways to the bodily self in young children. The visual-tactile process is early developing, explicit, and context dependent: It links to the explicit perception of ownership over one’s body (as assessed in this experiment by questionnaire items) and relates this explicit bodily self to external stimuli (in this case, touches from the brush). In contrast the visual-proprioceptive process is later developing, more implicit, and internal: It affects pointing responses but not explicit questionnaire responses. The notion of an early developing visual-tactile process is consistent with perspectives that argue for an early (or innate) appreciation of the physical self (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612462902">Butterworth, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612462902">Gergely &amp; Watson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612462902">Rochat, 2010</xref>). However, the differential development of processes underlying body localization and body ownership presents more of a challenge to current accounts of the developing self-concept, most of which do not draw a clear distinction between these aspects of the bodily self. Because the visual-tactile and visual-proprioceptive processes develop independently and utilize different sensory information, it will be crucial in future research to distinguish between children’s use of these different kinds of information in their acquisition of self-perception and self-knowledge.</p>
<p>The differential development of these processes also calls into question current models of body localization and ownership in adulthood. Most adult models have assumed that perceived hand position and an explicit sense of body ownership are intimately bound together: The original model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612462902">Botvinick and Cohen (1998)</xref> assumes that the feeling of ownership is a direct consequence of increased visual weighting toward the fake hand position, as induced by the illusion. In these models, the sense of embodiment leads to increased weighting of visual information to determine limb position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612462902">Makin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612462902">Tsakiris, 2010</xref>). However, the developments revealed in the present experiment suggest a dissociation between visual weighting for hand position and a sense of embodiment in children. Whereas an explicit sense of embodiment (measured by questionnaire) seems to derive only from a visual-tactile process, perceived hand position (measured by pointing) seems to be influenced by both visual-tactile and visual-proprioceptive processes. Thus, questionnaire items were affected only by stroking mode (reflecting a visual-tactile process) and not by age, whereas proprioceptive-drift responses were affected by both stroking mode (reflecting a visual-tactile process) and age (reflecting a visual-proprioceptive process). This pattern of results supports recent suggestions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612462902">Holle, McLatchie, Maurer, &amp; Ward, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612462902">Holmes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612462902">Rohde et al., 2011</xref>) that perceived hand position and an explicit sense of embodiment are not so intimately bound together as was previously thought.</p>

<p>Pointing errors were measured as a percentage of arm length. In absolute terms, adults’ proprioceptive drifts (synchronous-stroking condition: ~3% of arm length) equated to approximately 2 cm, whereas children’s proprioceptive drifts (synchronous-stroking condition: ~8% of arm length) equated to approximately 4 cm.
