<title>1. What is the primary message you want to send to patients regarding their medication therapy?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Winston:</speaker>
<p>Many patients and families present to me for asthma management and ask, “Isn’t this too much medicine for my baby or child?” “Are these medicines safe for children?” or “Are these medications safe when used long term?” Patients and families are bombarded with information from many sources: television, news, the Internet, family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers, among others. Patients and families may not be able to discern reliable, accurate information from inaccurate or even dangerous information. Confusion about the actual risks and possible side effects of medications can contribute to poor adherence, when parents are more fearful of the medications than asthma.</p>
</speech>
<p>The primary message that I try to communicate to my patients and their families regarding their medication therapy is that although I use evidence-based guidelines, I look at their child as an individual with a chronic condition and think about asthma therapy as it applies to their current condition and control, as well as in the future as their child grows up and becomes an adult. I consider the benefits and risks of medication in both the short and long term control of asthma and their quality of life. We need to communicate with our patients and families in an open manner, so that parents feel comfortable stating their fears about medications especially when they disagree with our plan. A strategy that I have found helpful is to offer a “trial period” of medication and then set up a follow-up appointment to evaluate the response to this treatment before making a determination about further treatment. I have seen and felt parents’ stress level dissolve after their child has a good response to treatment. I also prepare parents for the fact that it can take time to find the correct medication regimen for their child and that this is a process of ongoing reevaluation.</p>
<p>Although patients and families may be confused when we change medications, step up or step down, it is important to tie this to the degree of asthma control and highlight the factors that go into the decision to modify a medication regimen.</p>
<p>I also emphasize that medication is only one part of the treatment plan and that identification and avoidance of asthma triggers is equally important to controlling asthma. It is important for parents to understand that if they reduce exposure to triggers, such as quitting smoking, it will help better control their child’s asthma and we may be able to use less medication.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Gardner:</speaker>
<p>It is important for patients and care providers to understand that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, and although it cannot be cured, it can be controlled. We stress that medication therapy is an important component of gaining asthma control and includes long-term control medications, which are taken every day to help reduce inflammation in the airways and prevent symptoms, and quick-relief medications, which are used for acute asthma symptoms. Our primary focus with our patients and families is to help them understand these concepts and reinforce this in the written asthma action plan. Part of our education always includes the importance of prevention and long-term control therapy and why it is critical to continue prescribed therapy even when symptoms become controlled.</p>

<title>2. What do you feel is the best way to teach a patient inhaler technique (metered dose and/or dry powder)?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Winston:</speaker>
<p>As asthma educators, we have to keep studying and learning about the most effective patient education techniques. We have to be open to learning about, assessing, choosing, and using new technology whether it is video, online, game, or smartphone application that meets the needs of the patients and families that we serve.</p>
</speech>
<p>I don’t think that there is one best way to teach a patient proper inhaler administration technique. First it is important to assess the patient and family, their ability and readiness to learn, and their preferences and barriers (whether it is language or insurance coverage of equipment).</p>
<p>However, in the real world of my office I use photographs (poster demonstrating the difference in lung deposition when a metered dose inhaler [MDI] is administered by closed mouth technique versus by chamber). I have demonstration devices (placebo MDIs, dry powder inhalers [DPIs], chambers with and without masks, reusable and disposable nebulizers with and without masks, and the In-Check DIAL), so I am able to demonstrate proper technique. Most important, we should have patients perform return demonstration. Most patients don’t come to appointments with their medications and equipment—we need to use this as a teachable moment to explain the importance of having medications available at all times. I use discussion, Q&amp;A, repeat back, to teach proper medication administration technique (including need to prime and rinse HFA MDIs), how to clean, and how to maintain and replace equipment. Also I will demonstrate a technique and ask kids to assess whether or not I did it properly. I provide written handouts (with illustrations, low-grade-level instructions and available in English and Spanish) and use these adjunctively with interactive techniques. Printed instruction sheets are important to remind care givers of details they may have not absorbed and reinforce what was discussed, so the parent who attended the office visit can turn around and correctly teach other family members, baby sitter, day care, coach, or school nurse to administer medications properly.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Gardner:</speaker>
<p>Demonstration of inhaler technique and ongoing reeducation is critical for proper administration of inhaled medication whether by a metered dose inhaler (MDI) or dry powder inhaler (DPI). We first make an assessment of the patient to determine what would be the most appropriate therapy and device choice.</p>
</speech>
<p>We use valved holding chambers (VHCs) for all our patients using MDIs. For younger children and infants, we use VHCs with masks and as they get older transition to a VHC with a mouthpiece. Our first step is to show the equipment to be used to the patient and/or caregiver. We demonstrate each step of assembling the equipment and preparing the device to be administered. Following this, we answer questions and then have them demonstrate the procedures back to us. This gives the instructor the opportunity to correct any mistakes that are made, as well as to determine if an alternative therapy might need to be considered. We provide a written instruction sheet with pictures to each patient/caregiver to reinforce the teaching.</p>

<title>3. How often do you assess a patient’s inhaler technique and how do you assess it?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Winston:</speaker>
<p>Ideally, all providers when seeing a patient in any setting for asthma would address and assess medication administration technique at every visit. In a perfect world, patients would come to an asthma visit with all their medication and equipment, but we know that this is not what happens in the real world. However, in the course of an asthma office visit as I take the history, I assess for clues that this is an issue that needs priority at this visit. I ask about device/equipment use, medication adherence, and if, in the interim the patient has experienced an asthma exacerbation, been treated with prednisone, been seen in the emergency room, or hospitalized. We may have provided the patient with the correct diagnosis, level of asthma severity, and medications, but if inhaled medications are not administered with the proper technique, it can be a primary factor that leads to uncontrolled asthma.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Gardner:</speaker>
<p>At each clinic visit (usually every 4-6 months), the nurse reviews medications and inhaler technique on check in with the patient and/or caregiver. This is usually by question and answer. Patients who are old enough to do spirometry are questioned in depth by the respiratory therapist and are asked to describe and show step by step how they take their medication. Any errors in technique are discussed and corrected. Although demonstration of the actual device would be ideal, many people do not bring in the devices, despite being asked to bring them to clinic visits. Lack of availability of demonstration devices for each individual is a disadvantage; however, we keep demonstration units that are used by our staff for reeducation purposes.</p>

<title>4. What clinical pearls can you share for improving adherence to asthma therapy?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Winston:</speaker>
<p>When I present a medication plan to a patient and family, I present the rationale for the medications based on level of asthma severity. I am clear with families that I treat children with asthma as per the NIHLBI/NAAEPP guidelines that are based on research. I differentiate long-term control and quick-relief medications.</p>
</speech>
<p>One explanation that seems to help patients and families is when I explain that patients cannot feel long-term control medications working, parents administering them don’t “see” them working, and when initiating treatment, long-term control medications can take time to start working. There are metaphors that can be used to illustrate this point, like using sunscreen to prevent sunburn. You don’t feel the sunscreen doing anything especially when it does what is supposed to do and you don’t get a sunburn.</p>
<p>After I present an asthma treatment plan to a patient and family, I ask them if they agree with it and how they see it working in their lives (ie, where will they store medication or how will they remember to take it). This provides another opportunity for them to ask questions and voice concerns that I may not have considered.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Gardner:</speaker>
<p>Education, education, education is key to improving adherence to therapy. It is also important to establish a trusting relationship with the patient/caregiver. Be sure to include the patient and/or caregiver in the choice of therapy when appropriate, as that goes a long way in encouraging adherence. One of the most important things that can help improve adherence is taking the time to be sure that your patient/caregiver understands the purpose of the therapies that are prescribed and how the therapy can best fit into day-to-day living.</p>
</speech>
<p>It is so easy to give a prescription and a written action plan with everything listed; but did we ever explain what we expect the therapy to do? It only takes a few minutes to educate the patient/caregiver about how each medication works to keep asthma controlled and the importance of not stopping therapy as symptoms are controlled. Be sure to include not only the caregiver but also the child or teenager in these discussions, to give them ownership of their asthma.</p>
<p>Establishing trust and open communication will make it easier for the patient/caregiver to confide in you if there are barriers to adherence, such as financial difficulty in obtaining medications, intolerable side effects, or issues at work or school.</p>

<sec id="section5-2150129713494684">
<title>5. What financial resources for medications do you share with your patients?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Winston:</speaker>
<p>I practice in 2 hospital-based practices, one a subspecialty practice and the other a primary care practice. If the patient has a financial need that is not being met, then I can refer the patient to a social worker or financial counselor who can help obtain medications in the short term and determination of long-term benefits. Both were needed when I saw a toddler with not well controlled asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy in the primary care office with no insurance and no prescription plan but needed a step up in control therapy.</p>
</speech>
<p>We have a consignment program with a durable medical equipment company for chambers, so we dispense the chamber during the visit. This helps us provide hands-on teaching. For most patients the device is covered by their insurance or can be purchased at a reasonable cost (usually less than the retail cost at a pharmacy).</p>
<p>If a patient does not have a prescription plan, has a high co-pay, or does not want waste to medications, I may prescribe a medium-strength inhaled corticosteroid to be administered as one puff BID, so the inhaler lasts 2 months instead of 1 month when stepping down.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Gardner:</speaker>
<p>We have good working relationships with the pharmaceutical representatives in our area and are always requesting any voucher, co-pay programs, or underinsured/uninsured patient assistance programs they have available for specific medications. We keep these on hand and distribute them during clinic visits. We also work with our social workers, who can assist patient/caregivers in applying for assistance with these programs. We keep up-to-date on the formularies for low-cost generic prescription medication programs that are available at local pharmacies and use these programs for those who need these services.</p>
</speech>
<p>Two programs that help to locate medication financial assistance programs are the following: (<italic>a</italic>) The Partnership for Prescription Assistance, which helps qualifying patients without prescription drug coverage get the medicines they need for free or nearly free. They offer a single point of access to public and private programs. (<italic>b</italic>) RXAssist—Patient Assistance Program Center, which offers a comprehensive database of patient assistance programs.</p>
