<abstract>
<p>The expression of DNA mismatch repair (DMMR) genes in patients with maturation arrest (MA) was analyzed. Samples were subjected to mutL homolog 3 (MLH3) mutation analysis by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography/sequencing and quantification of MMR expression in testicular tissue by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Microsatellite instability assays were negative. Two missense and 1 intronic mutations were found. The missense mutation 2531C/T (P844 L), predicted to affect MLH3 function, was found in 3 MA cases in association with the intronic variant IVS9 + 66G/A. Relative messenger RNA (mRNA) quantification identified 2 patients who overexpressed MLH3, 1 of them also overexpressing mutL homolog 1 (MLH1). The latter also presented the 2531C/T-IVS9 + 66G/A mutation. In conclusion, we suggest that a predominance of MLH3 expression might favor the MLH1/MLH3 complex which then would compete with the MLH1/PMS2 complexes. This could convey disruption of the relative stoichiometry between MLH1/MLH3 and MLH1/PMS2 complexes, thus causing meiosis failure, as MLH1/PMS2 complexes are supposed to replace MLH1/MLH3 during diplonema.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spermatogenesis is a complex process that involves 3 phases: the phase during which stem cells undergo mitotic expansion; meiotic division; and cellular differentiation. During meiosis, primary spermatocytes undergo DNA replication, followed by homologous chromosome coupling, meiotic recombination (crossing over), and homologous segregation to yield secondary spermatocytes. For these reasons, the meiotic checkpoint is considered one of the most important checkpoints in cellular and molecular biology.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111428521">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The difficulty in obtaining pure populations of spermatocytes remains an obstacle to the molecular characterization of meiosis-controlling genes in mammals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111428521">2</xref>
</sup> Because of this obstacle, mutant analysis has proved an extremely important means of decoding the elements controlling this process. Although such cases are rare, humans with maturation arrest (MA) have sterility due to secretory azoospermia (SAZ), a condition characterized histopathologically by the presence of only diploid germ cells that have reached but not completed the meiotic step of spermatogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719111428521">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719111428521">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Previous molecular studies of patients with MA, as well as those of the patients with SAZ (nonobstructive), Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS), and hypospermatogenesis (HP) have revealed that the candidate genes for these syndromes are located in a region on the long arm of the Y chromosome (AZF.Yq11.2).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111428521">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719111428521">5</xref>
</sup> Studies have suggested that microdeletions in the AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc regions occur, respectively, in patients who have SCOS, MA syndrome, and HP. Microdeletions in the gene copies <italic>DAZ1</italic> and <italic>DAZ2</italic> were then shown to cause severe oligozoospermia and HP,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719111428521">6</xref>
</sup> and later attributed to only the microdeletions in DAZ1, which was also suggested to be responsible for causing MA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111428521">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111428521">8</xref>
</sup> However, the frequencies of the AZF microdeletions are too low to explain every case of MA.</p>
<p>DNA mismatch repair (DMMR) plays a critical role in genomic stability (corrections during DNA replication and recombination). Inactivation of DMMR genes is dependent on an inherited germ line mutation and the appearance of a somatic mutation in the other allele (loss of heterozygosity), causing, as a consequence, microsatellite instability (MSI). Deficiencies in DMMR are associated with inherited and sporadic cancers. These cancers display MSI. Germ line mutations in <italic>DMMR</italic> genes have been found in almost 70% of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancers (HNPCCs), with MLH1 being associated with most HNPCC familial cases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111428521">9</xref>

</sup>
</p>
<p>MLH3 is a member of a conserved protein family involved in DMMR and meiotic recombination, being ubiquitously expressed. MLH3 was found to interact with MLH1. Based on this interaction, and because deficiencies in MLH1 were shown to confer a mutator phenotype and an increased susceptibility to cancer, the human MLH3 protein was suggested to play a role in DMMR. However, hMLH3 is presently supposed to play a minor role in DMMR,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719111428521">12</xref>
</sup> as mutations of the <italic>hMLH3</italic> gene have either been associated with or found to be absent in HNPCC, and deficiencies in hMLH3 have also been associated with or found to have no role in triggering MSI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111428521">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111428521">13</xref>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Another role of DMMR proteins is to promote somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination that allow B cells to make high-affinity antibodies of various isotypes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111428521">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111428521">20</xref>
</sup> Deficiencies in Mlh1 result in SHM defects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111428521">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111428521">22</xref>
</sup> The participation of Mlh3 in SHM was studied in Mlh3-deficient mice, which showed, contrary to Mlh1 knock-out mice, an increased rate of SHM, thus suggesting that MLH3 might normally play an inhibitory role in SHM. Another possibility is that Mlh3 plays a role in suppressing DMMR by interfering with Mlh1 and Pms2 interaction in patch repair. Because MLH3 interacts with MLH1,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111428521">23</xref>
</sup> loss of Mlh3 could potentially enhance the stability of the Mlh1-Pms2 complex and consequently enhance SHM. Another role is in apoptosis, as Mlh3 null mice were shown to present an abnormal response to DNA damage and increased cancer susceptibility, suggesting that MLH3 may contribute to carcinogenesis through abnormal interaction with apoptotic pathways.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719111428521">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The Mlh3 protein is also involved in meiotic recombination, as Mlh3-deficient mice do not show MSI and are sterile due to meiotic arrest.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111428521">25</xref>

</sup> However, there is no experimental evidence for a similar involvement in human meiosis. Because of these observations, it is reasonable to consider that MA in humans, in the absence of chromosomal anomalies, secondary lesions, and AZF/DAZ microdeletions, may also be associated with changes in DNA repair genes, specifically MLH3. In this study, this hypothesis has been evaluated by addressing the following for each MA patient: MSI, the presence of mutations in the <italic>MLH3</italic> gene, and MLH3 expression in human testicular tissue.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>According to the National Law on Medically Assisted Procreation (PMA, Law 32/2006) and the National Council on Medically Assisted Procreation (CNPMA, 2008) guidelines, seminiferous tubule fragments were obtained, after patients’ informed and written consent, from cases with SAZ, who needed an open treatment testicular biopsy (Testicular Sperm Extraction [TESE]) to recover testicular spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment cycles in a private clinic. Under informed consent, only surplus testicular material was used for research after patient testicular tissue was used for treatment by TESE/ICSI and freezing excess material for patient’s future use. Infertile patients also routinely provide blood samples for Y chromosome and karyotype screening. DNA from these samples was also used under informed consent. This work did not involve human or animal experiments. Patient databases were only used with a statistical purpose under informed consent.</p>
<p>The present study included 29 consecutive infertile males with SAZ due to MA at the spermatocyte stage (as diagnosed by histopathology after testicular diagnostic biopsy [TDB]). If in at least 1 of the seminiferous tubules there was a focus of complete spermatogenesis it was called incomplete MA. From the 29 patients with MA, 17 presented complete MA and 12 incomplete MA morphologies. Patients were submitted to multiple bilateral testicular biopsies for infertility treatment.<sup>

<title>Detection of Yq11.2-AZF Microdeletions by Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
<p>Yq11.2-AZF microdeletions were screened in DNA samples of the 29 patients with MA (29 genomic and 17 testicular samples from patients withcomplete MA) by multiplex or uniplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 24 sequence-tagged sites ([STS] Laboratorial licence from EQAS Y Chromosome, 2004): AZFa: sY86, sY84, sY620 (<italic>USP9Y</italic>), GY6 <italic>(DBY)</italic>, DBY2 (<italic>DBY</italic>), sY88; AZFb: sY591 (<italic>XKRY</italic>), sY1227, sY113, sY114, sY121, sY2629 (<italic>SMCY</italic>), sY124, sY127, sY691 (<italic>EIF1AY</italic>), sY130, sY134, sY135, sY142; and AZFc: sY152 (<italic>DAZ</italic>), sY254 (<italic>DAZ</italic>), DAZ1 (<italic>DAZ</italic>), sY157, CDY (<italic>CDY1</italic>). As a positive internal control, Y14 (<italic>SRY</italic>) was used on the multiplex reactions.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA samples of fertile men and a healthy female sample were used, respectively, as positive and negative controls in each PCR experiment. Analyses of AZF-STS deletion were also performed in a control population of 114 fertile men (blood samples collected at the time of delivery of their own children; Department of Obstetrics, St. John Academic Hospital, University of Porto, under Ethical Committee approval and after individual informed consent). The PCRs were carried out in 25 μL reaction volume, with 1× PCR buffer, 1.5 to 3 μL MgCl<sub>2</sub> (25 mmol/L, volume depending on the primers; MBI Fermentas, St Leon-Rot, Germany), 1 μL of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) mix (12.5 pmol/μL of each dNTP; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California), 0.5 μL of each primer pair (12.5 pmol/μL), 0.2 μL Taq recombinant DNA polymerase (5U/μL; MBI Fermentas), and 100 ng of genomic DNA (50 ng of testicular DNA). The PCR reaction profile was as follows: 30 cycles with a pre-soak for 5 minutes at 95°C, denaturation for 1 minute at 95°C, annealing for 1 minute at the specific annealing temperature for each multiplex or primer pair, with a subsequent polymerization step of 1 minute at 72°C and, at the end, a final extension step of 4 minutes at 72°C. Amplified PCR products (10 μL aliquots) were analyzed on 2.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide (Qbio-gene, Carslbad, California).<sup>

<title>Single-Nucleotide Variants/STS PCR Assays for Partial DAZ Deletions</title>
<p>Fifty of the control fertile males and patients with MA presenting no microdeletions in the AZFc region (only genomic material was used due to insufficient testicular DNA) were submitted to single-nucleotide variant (SNV)/STS deletion analysis using 6 DAZ-SNV and 2 DAZ-STS: SNV-I (GenBank accession n: G73167; Restriction endonucleases Fsp I; DAZ gene copy: 1,2,3; specificity 4; SNV allele: A, B), SNV-II (G73163; Mbo I; 2,3,4; 1; A, B), SNV-III (sY586; G63907; Taq I; 1,3,4; 2; A, B), SNV-IV (G73168; Alu I; 1,3,4; 2; A, B), SNV-V (sY587) (G63908; Dra I; 3,4,1,2; A, B), SNV-VI (G73169; Afl III; 1,2,3; 4; A, B), STS-RRM3 (G73171; BAC; 1 + 4), STS-DAZ3 (G73170; BAC; 3), and 2 internal positive controls, DAZ1/DAZ4 (sY152; G12002; BAC; 1+4) and the SRY locus (sY14; G38356). Primer sequences and PCR conditions are deposited in GenBank. The origin of SNV restriction enzymes was (MBI Fermentas), except for Fsp I and Afl III (Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany).</p>
<p>The PCR reactions were performed in a 25-µL reaction volume with 1× PCR buffer (Gibco-BRL, Life Technologies GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany), 2.5 mmol/L MgCL<sub>2</sub> (SNV III, IV, Y-DAZ 3) or 2.0 mmol/L MgCL<sub>2</sub> (SNV I, II, V, VI, DAZ-RRM3), 0.2 mmol/L dNTP, 1 IU Taq DNA polymerase (Gibco) and 100 ng of genomic DNA. Multiplex PCR assays contained 2 internal positive controls, one for the SRY locus (sY14) and another to confirm the proposed DAZ1/DAZ4 deletions (sY152) which was also analyzed by DAZ-RRM3 STS. Genomic DNA samples from a fertile male and a female were used as positive and negative controls, respectively, in each PCR experiment. The DNA sample from the fertile man controls the sensitivity and specificity of each performed PCR assay, whilst the female DNA sample controls the Y specificity of the used primer pairs. In addition, a water sample containing all components except DNA samples was run with each set of primers in order to detect any possible reagent contamination.</p>
<p>The PCR reaction profile (Biometra T-Gradient Personal Cycler) was as follows: 35 PCR cycles with a pre-soak for 3 minutes at 94°C, denaturation for 1 minute at 94°C, annealing for 1 minute at the annealing temperature specific of each primer pair (SNV I, 66.5°C; SNV II, 65°C; SNV III, 63°C; SNV IV, 57°C; SNV V, VI, 64°C; STS-RRM3, STS-DAZ3, sY152, sY14, 66°C), with a subsequent polymerization step of 1 minute at 72°C and, at the end, a final extension step of 3 minutes at 72°C. The PCR products (5 µL aliquots for SNV and 15 µL aliquots for STS) were analyzed on agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. GeneRuler 100 bp DNA ladder-plus (Gibco) was used as molecular size marker. A positive result for STS markers was indicated by the presence of the respective fragment on the gel. For the subsequent SNV analyses, the restriction digestions were performed in a 25-µL reaction volume with the appropriate 1× buffer (MBI Fermentas: SNV II, II, IV, V; Biolabs: SNV I, VI), 10 units of each enzyme and 20 µL of the PCR solution. Incubations were for 2 hours at 37°C, except for Taq I digestion which was performed at 65°C. The digests (25 µL aliquots) were analyzed on agarose gels, 2% or 3% depending on the fragment size obtained for each SNV (SNV I, 709 bp; SNV II, 182; SNV III, 301; SNV IV, 630; SNV V, 195; SNV VI, 431; DAZ-RRM3, 473; Y-DAZ3, 260; sY152, 125; sY14, 470) and stained with ethidium bromide (Qbio-gene).<sup>

<title>Microsatellite Instability</title>
<p>Paired genomic DNA from blood cells and testis tissues (as for this method, the amount of testicular DNA required is low, the testicular tissues of all 29 patients with MA were analyzed) were independently amplified with primers against 6 different microsatellite loci located on different chromosomes. As recommended in the “International Workshop on Microsatellite Instability and RER Phenotypes in Cancer Detection and Familial Predisposition” guidelines, a panel of at least 5 microsatellite loci were analyzed to determine whether the samples demonstrated instability.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719111428521">28</xref>
</sup> Because microsatellite stability is believed to be maintained by several proteins, each specific for a certain type of error, different types of repeats known to be susceptible to instability were analyzed. The loci selected therefore consisted of 2 intronic mononucleotide tandem repeats (BAT-25 and BAT-26) and 3 dinucleotide tandem repeats within coding sequences of genes for APC, Mfd15CA, and AFM093xh3 (D2S123, D17S250, and D5S346). These loci were amplified by multiplex PCR using the HNPCC Microsatellite Instability Test–recommended protocol (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and single fluorescent PCR for the BAT34 locus was analyzed individually. After PCR, to analyze the amplification products, 1 μL of each reaction product was mixed with 12 μL of loading buffer containing formamide and TAMRA-350 size standards (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). This mixture was denatured at 95°C for 2 minutes and then cooled on ice. The denatured PCR products were run on an ABI PRISM 310 sequence analyzer (Roche), following the manufacturer protocol. The PCR reaction products were separated by high-resolution electrophoresis, and the length of the individual fragments was determined using the GeneScan software by comparing the lengths of the products with the internal GeneScan-350 TAMRA-350 Size Standard (Applied Biosystems). The elution (electrophoretic) pattern for the paired blood and testicular amplification products (DNA fragments) were compared and the length of the polymorphic repeats was determined for all loci. Normally, when genomic stability prevails, no difference is noted between the repeat lengths for the paired blood and testicular samples, and these lengths are consistent throughout all tissues in the body. Thus, MSI is present when different sized alleles are noted in the same individual for blood and testicular DNA, for at least 1 of all loci tested.</p>

</sup> Exon 1 was divided into 7 overlapping fragments, while exon 9 and exon 10 were amplified together as part of a single fragment because of their small sizes and the small intron in between (they are close together). Polymerase chain reaction was conducted in a 25-μL reaction volume containing 50 ng of testicular DNA, 1× PCR buffer solution, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl<sub>2</sub> (MBI Fermentas), 100 μmol/L of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 0.2 μmol/L of each primer, and 1.25 Units of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (MBI Fermentas). Touchdown PCR programs were used for all exons. The following PCR cycles were used for all of the fragments and exons: 95°C (9.5 minutes), 6 cycles of 95°C (30 seconds), 58°C (1 minutes), −1°C per cycle, and 72°C (1 minutes), followed by 28 cycles of 95°C (20 seconds), 53°C (30 seconds), and 72°C (30 seconds). The final extension was 72°C (7 minutes), 95°C (5 minutes), and 95°C (1 minutes), after which the temperature was reduced by 1.5°C per cycle over 40 cycles. All of the PCR products were then examined for specificity and amount to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.</p>
<p>Before DHPLC analysis, the PCR amplification products from a negative control of each amplicon were mixed with the PCR product to be tested. This mixture was denaturated at 95°C (5 minutes) and gradually cooled down to room temperature at 1.5°C per cycle decrements on a PCR machine to enable the efficient formation of heteroduplexes. Denaturing HPLC was performed in an automated DHPLC instrumentation, the Transgenomics WAVE Nucleic Acid Fragment Analysis System equipped with a DNASep column (Transgenomics, Crewe, UK). The mobile phase gradient and running column temperature selected for optimal heteroduplex separation were determined for each amplicon using the WAVEMAKER 3.4 software provided with the instrument (Tansgenomics).<sup>

</sup> Samples of 10 µL were injected onto the DNASep Column, followed by elution with a mixture of buffer A (0.1 mol/L triethylammonium acetate) and buffer B (0.1 mol/L triethylammonium acetate and 25% acetronitrile; Bie &amp; Berntsen A/S, Rodrove, Denmark) at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min. Abnormal elution profiles were identified by visual inspection of the chromatogram on the basis of the appearance of one or more additional earlier elution peaks. For all samples exhibiting abnormal DHPLC profiles, the testicular DNA was reamplified. After purification of DNA (GFX PCR Purification Kit; Amersham, Munich, Germany), sequence changes were evaluated by direct sequencing in both directions using BidDye Terminator V3.0 Ready Reaction Cycle Sequencing kit according to manufacturer instructions (Applied Biosystems). Cycle sequencing products were electrophoresed and analyzed on an ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems).</p>

<p>Total testicular RNA was purified (Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit) from 2 groups: (1) 8 patients with MA who were analyzed for <italic>MLH3</italic> mutations (samples from patients for which there was still enough testicular DNA) and (2) a control pool of 18 individuals with anejaculation (mainly due to spinal cord injury but also including psychogenic and polyneuropathy cases; these patients are usually treated by testicular sperm aspiration), normal karyotypes, and absence of Y chromosome microdeletions. The testicular tissue (a small seminiferous tubule was aspirated) and blood DNA were used under informed and written consent at the Clinic.<sup>

<p>Spermatogenic cells were isolated by micromanipulation from 2 control testicular samples. Small seminiferous tubules were collected in sperm preparation medium (SPM-Hepes; Medicult, Copenhagen, Denmark). Seminiferous tubules were squeezed under a heated stereomicroscope to release luminal epithelial cells. The resultant fluid fraction was washed in SPM (235 minutes, 1500 rpm) and incubated (5 minutes, 32°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, filtrated humidified air) in 2 mL erythrocyte-lysing buffer (155 mmol/L NH4Cl, 10 mmol/L KHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 mmol/L EDTA, in water, pH 7.2 with KOH, 0.2 μm filtered; endotoxin free, embryo and cell culture tested; Sigma, Barcelona, Spain) followed by the addition of 2 ml SPM. The suspension was then washed (235 minutes, 1500 rpm), digested (20 minutes, 25 µg crude DNase and 1000 units collagenase-IV in 1 mL SPM; Sigma), and separated (5 minutes, 600 rpm) into supernatant (haploid germ cells) and pellet (diploid germ cells and a few Sertoli cells) fractions. The fractions were washed with SPM (2 × 5 minutes, 1500 rpm), and the final pellets were resuspended in 100 µL in vitro fertilization medium (without HEPES buffer; Medicult).<sup>

<p>Cells of specific stages were selected by micromanipulation in an inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with Hoffman optics and a heated stage (328C) using Narishige micromanipulators (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) and micropipettes of 15 to 20 lm in diameter (SweMed, Frolunda, Sweden). Spermatogonia A and primary spermatocytes were collected from the pellet fraction, whereas secondary spermatocytes and round spermatids were collected from the supernatant fraction. In each microdrop (40 µL SPM) about 600 cells were plated: Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, and early (without flagellum) round spermatids. Spermatogenic cells were differentiated accordingly to morphological criteria. Sertoli cells display a cytoplasm rich in lipid droplets and a nucleus with a prominent nucleolus. Elongated A-spermatogonia present an ellipsoidal shape and a fusiform extreme. Large primary spermatocytes (19 + 24 µm in diameter) and secondary spermatocytes (14 + 1 µm in diameter) were distinguished based on the relative cell and nuclear sizes. Also, ST2 frequently present a polarized nucleus and cytoplasm. Round spermatids (8-10 µm) have a well-delimited and smooth nucleus and a short rim of cytoplasm. Small lymphocytes were distinguished from round spermatids as they contain irregular patches of chromatin in the nucleus and, when aspirated through a 6 to 8 μm micropipette, attach to the glass tip and stretch; additionally, after 24 hours of culture, lymphocytes attach to the culture dish and spread.<sup>

<p>Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). From these samples, 30 ng of total RNA were reverse transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) in a 20-µL reaction volume containing the following: 2 μL of 5× reverse transcriptase (RT) buffer (200 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 500 mmol/L KCl), 1.5 μL MgCl<sub>2</sub> (25 mmol/L), 2 μL dithiothreitol (DTT) (0.1 mol/L), 1 μL of dNTP mix (10 mM of each dNTP), 1 μL of random primers (50 ng/μl), 1 μL RNase out (40 U/μl), and 0.2 μL SuperScript II RT (200 U/μL). All components were purchased from (Invitrogen). A control of genomic DNA contamination was prepared with all components except SuperScript. Reverse transcription was performed by incubating the samples at 22°C for 10 minutes and then at 42°C for 50 minutes. The reactions were stopped by heating at 95°C for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Relative quantification of MLH3 testicular mRNA was performed by 2-step RT-PCR using 2 internal normalization standards and 2 other <italic>MMR</italic> genes, <italic>MLH1</italic> and <italic>mutS homolog 4 (MSH4)</italic>, as controls. Expression levels were measured by real-time PCR using the DNA dye SYBR Green (Qiagen). The quantitative real-time PCR system is based on the detection and quantification of a fluorescent reporter. This signals increase in direct proportion to the amount of PCR product formed in the reaction. By recording the amount of fluorescence emission at each cycle, it is possible to monitor the PCR reaction during the exponential phase where the first significant increase in the amount of PCR product correlates to the initial amount of target template.</p>
<p>The different primer pairs for <italic>MLH3</italic>, <italic>MLH1</italic>, and <italic>MSH4</italic> were designed with the OLIGO 4.0 software against the corresponding cDNA sequences published in GenBank (GenBank accession numbers AB039667, HSU07343, and AF104243, respectively). The primers were designed using the following parameters: primer size between 17 and 23 base pairs, primer Tm range between 50°C and 60°C, exclusion of hairpin and dimmer formation. <italic>MLH3</italic> primers were specifically designed to avoid the splicing alternative region (exon 7).</p>
<p>Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and β-actin were used as internal normalization standards. Each PCR reaction (final volume of 20 μL) contained 1 μL of each primer (10 pmol), 10 μL of 2× QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen), and 2 μL of first-strand synthesis reaction (each reverse transcription reaction product). This volume was loaded onto the glass capillaries, centrifuged, and placed into a cycling rotor. The products were amplified and monitored using the LightCycler Real-Time PCR System (Roche). The following 4-cycle program was used: (1) activation of the HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase (1 cycle of denaturation at 95°C for 15 minutes); (2) amplification and quantification (45 cycles of 94°C for 15 seconds, 54°C-58°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds); (3) melting curve analysis (1 cycle of 95°C for 1 second, 65°C for 10 seconds, and 95°C for 1 second); and (4) cooling to 40°C for 30 seconds. The temperature transition rate was 20°C/sec except for the third segment of the melting curve analysis where it was 0.2°C/sec. Real-time detection of SYBR Green I fluorescence intensity, indicating the amount of PCR product formed, was measured at the end of each extension phase.</p>
<p>Quantification of the amplification products and melting curve analysis were done using the LightCycler software (Roche). Gene expression (long linear phases of the sample curves) was quantified from the standard curves that resulted from 2-step RT-PCR. Standard curves were obtained by correlating the threshold cycle values (Cts; second derivative maximum method) with graded dilutions of a control RNA (1.25-80 ng). A 4-step experimental protocol was used: (1) denaturation program (15 minutes at 94°C), (2) amplification and quantification program repeated 35 to 45 times (15 seconds at 94°C; 30 seconds at 54°C-58°C; 30 seconds at 72°C, with a single fluorescence measurement), (3) melting curve program (60°C-95°C with a heating rate of 1°C/sec and a continuous fluorescence measurement), (4) cooling down program to 40°C. Thereafter, PCR products were identified by generating a melting curve. The  size of the products (MLH3, 113 bp; MLH1, 127 bp; MSH4, 161 bp; GAPDH, 160 bp; and β-actin, 132 bp) was confirmed by gel electrophoresis on a standard 2% agarose gel. Annealing temperatures were MLH3, MLH1, and β-actin (56°C), MSH4 (54°C), and GAPDH (58°C).</p>
<p>Agarose gel electrophoresis and melting curve analysis were performed for each primer pair to determine their specificity. The melting curve and gel analysis revealed a single peak for each reaction and a single band in the agarose gel, respectively. To examine the validity of the 2-step real-time PCR assay system, testicular RNA from a control sample was serially diluted (6×), reverse transcribed, and amplified with specific primers against MLH3, MLH1, MSH4, and GAPDH. The resulting threshold cycle (Ct) values, as determined by the second derivative maximum method, were plotted versus the logarithm of the dilutions, revealing an almost linear relationship (<italic>r</italic>

</sup> = 1) for each gene. This observation indicated that the relative amounts of amplified cDNA estimated by cycle numbers at threshold reflected the relative amounts of original mRNA. This method was then used to analyze MLH3, MLH1, MSH4, and GAPDH levels in the patient and control samples. The quantification of the expressed gene was calculated from the respective standard curve as a transcript copy number value. Normalization of the genes of interest was performed by dividing the values of the transcript copy number by the housekeeping gene copy number. All of the reactions were performed in triplicate.</p>
<p>The statistical significance of expression level differences was determined by comparing each normalized patient value within the confidence interval to the mean determined for the control group, while using 95% as the significance cutoff and taking into account the intrinsic variance for each individual. Analysis of data was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS v 9, for Windows), with the 1-sample <italic>t</italic> test to compare the 2 groups.</p>

<p>Microdeletions in AZF (114) or DAZ1/DAZ2 (50) were not detected in fertile males. Genomic DNA from the blood of 29 patients with MA and DNA from 17 testicular samples were analyzed for the presence of microdeletions in AZF and DAZ1/DAZ2. Three AZFc microdeletions were detected (2 in complete MA). As these were also found in the corresponding testicular DNA, data did not indicate the presence of further de novo deletions. Thus, DAZ analysis was performed on the genomic samples that were negative for the AZFc microdeletions (n = 26), and 2 deletions of DAZ1 were found.</p>

<title>MLH3 Mutation Analysis by DHPLC and Sequencing</title>
<p>Screening for de novo mutations was performed in the DNA of testicular tissue from 13 patients with MA, confirmed to have a meiotic arrest at the primary spermatocyte stage after treatment testicular biopsy. For these 13 samples, all of the exons examined were successfully analyzed. Denaturing HPLC identified 3 abnormal profiles, whose subsequent sequencing showed 2 missense mutations in exon 1 (P844L-2531C/T and S966P-2896T/C) and an intronic mutation in intron 9 (IVS9 + 66 A &gt; G), all in heterozygosity (HTZ) at the MLH3 locus: nucleotide exchange 2531, aminoacid exchange Pro844Leu; nucleotide exchange 2896, aminoacid exchange Ser966Pro.</p>
<p>To assess the potential functional significance of the <italic>MLH3</italic> mutations, the missense variants were analyzed in silico using the “sorting intolerant from tolerant” (SIFT) algorithm. Sorting intolerant from tolerant is a Web-based algorithm that predicts how amino acid substitutions will affect protein function by taking into account the similarities between a normal and variant amino acid. In silico analysis using the SIFT algorithm was done on the entire MLH3 protein sequence (including variants) and on the MLH3 protein sequence without the MutL domains (amino acids 439-1199). Amino acid substitutions are reported as “tolerated” or as “affects function.” For the missense variant P844 L, SIFT did predict to affect MLH3 function (SIFT score 0.00). For the missense variant S966P, SIFT did not predict to affect MLH3 function (SIFT score 0.27).<sup>

<p>In order to emphasize the role of <italic>DMMR</italic> genes during human spermatogenesis and to evaluate the expression levels of these genes, different spermatogenic populations were isolated by micromanipulation from 2 control cases. No expression was observed in Sertoli cells, secondary spermatocytes, or round spermatids. Relative mRNA expression of the 3 genes in spermatogonia were low (2.4-MLH3; 5.2-MLH1; and 1.5-MSH4), and peak at the primary spermatocyte stage (24.5-MLH3; 17.8-MLH1; and 15.3-MSH4).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Meiosis defects during spermatogenesis are a significant cause of infertility due to MA. This phenotype may be caused by Y chromosome microdeletions, namely the AZFb region, but also in AZFc that may cause a regressive evolution from severe oligozoospermia to different spermatogenic histology patterns, including MA.<sup>

</sup> However, the origin of idiopathic patients with MA remains to be solved. In this study, we intended to investigate whether <italic>DMMR</italic> genes are also involved in idiopathic meiotic disruption. Our series of 29 patients with MA was first screened for karyotypes and Y chromosome microdeletions. Knockout mice for Mlh3 display no MSI and are infertile due to meiosis arrest.<sup>

</sup> In the present study, MLH1 and MSH2 inactivation as the origin of meiotic arrest was excluded, as all of the patients with MA were negative for MSI.</p>
<p>The 3 MutL proteins act during mammalian meiosis as part of 2 different heterodimers: MLH1/MLH3 and MLH1/PMS2. Because MLH3 and PMS2 share the same interaction domain on MLH1, it is possible that the quantitative balance of the MLH1-binding partners (MLH3 and PMS2) is important in specifying different functions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111428521">23</xref>
</sup> The <italic>MutL</italic> gene (located at 14q24.3 in humans) has 2 isoforms; 1 of the isoforms has 12 exons, while the other is alternatively spliced and lacks exon 7 (MLH3Δ7).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111428521">13</xref>
</sup> Although the role of MLH3 in MMR during DNA replication has been widely studied, the results are contradictory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111428521">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111428521">13</xref>

</sup> In contrast, all of the studies reporting on the involvement of MLH3 in mammalian meiotic recombination are in concordance. MLH3 mRNA studies showed that both isoforms are expressed in a large number of fetal and adult somatic tissues in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111428521">13</xref>
</sup> as well as in human testis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719111428521">26</xref>
</sup> The MLH3 protein is found in mouse spermatocytes and localizes to chiasmata from the mid-pachynema to the early diplonema stages.<sup>

<p>Meiotic recombination requires the activity of protein complexes that introduce double-strand DNA breaks, which must subsequently undergo DNA repair. Consistent with the role of DNA repair factors in recombination is the finding that knockout mice lacking components of the MMR complexes MutS (MSH4 and MSH5) and MutL (MLH1, PMS2 and MLH3) are infertile due to a checkpoint arrest in meiosis I.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111428521">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719111428521">32</xref>

</sup> Although Mlh3<sup>−/−</sup> mice are viable and show no evidence of MSI, these mice are sterile due to arrest in meiosis. Although no recombination nodules were observed on Mlh3<sup>−/−</sup> bivalent chromosomes at the pachynema stage, most spermatocytes progressed to diplonema and metaphase I and then entered apoptosis due to the missegration of chromosomes and aneuploidy. Expression of human MLH3 in Mlh3<sup>−/−</sup> mice restored spermatogenesis and rescued fertility.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111428521">25</xref>
</sup> In one study, authors analyzed 6 men with MA, comproved by TDB and testicular aspiration, using a highly polymorphic microsatellite Citosine/Adenine (CA) repeat containing marker on chromosome 19q12 (marker D19S49 in genomic, blood, and testicular tissue), and in comparison to controls (obstructive azoospermia with normal spermatogenesis), and a significant increase in point mutations in 3/6 MA patients only in testicular tissue was found.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719111428521">36</xref>
</sup> DNA <italic>MMR</italic> genes have been described to participate in crossover events during meiotic recombination, a key step of spermatogenesis. Thus, it is possible that MMR expression may be altered in infertile men with disruptive spermatogenesis. In another study, in 6 men with MA, comproved by TDB, authors found that DMMR expression (except PMS2) was severely decreased in MA and that only MSH4 appeared as a marker of spermatogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719111428521">37</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We first characterize the expression patterns of MLH3, MLH, and MSH4 on different cell stages of the human spermatogenesis. Cells were isolated from testicular fragments obtained from 2 men with anejaculation (conserved spermatogenesis), normal karyotypes, and absence of Y chromosome microdeletions. These genes appeared exclusively expressed in replicative germ cells (spermatogonia) and in those meiotic germ cells where recombination occurs (primary spermatocytes). This is in agreement with the findings on mice that showed MLH3 to be involved in chiasmata and recombination.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111428521">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719111428521">32</xref>

</sup>
</p>
<p>The 2 MLH3 mutations (P844L and S966P) found in 4 patients with MA had already been reported in fertile patients from HNPCC families,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111428521">18</xref>
</sup> thus suggesting that, isolated, these mutations might be not responsible for the meiotic arrest. Because MLH3 competes with the other MutL protein PMS2 for the same target on MLH1 to form the MLH1/MLH3 and MLH1/PMS2 heterodimers, it is possible that the quantitative balance of these proteins plays an important role in specifying different outcomes during meiosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111428521">23</xref>
</sup> MLH3 was overexpressed in 2 of the 8 MA patients tested. One of these patients had 2 mutations, of which one was missense (P844 L) and the other intronic (IVS9 + 66G/A) and also presented MLH1 overexpression. P844 L is a common germ line missense variant (polymorphism) predicted to affect protein function by SIFT.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719111428521">31</xref>
</sup> The prediction accuracy of the SIFT analysis has been determined experimentally as ranging from 63% to 68%. Because MLH3 is not well conserved, and because SIFT predictions were based on closely related sequences, it is not possible to know how reliable this SIFT prediction are.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1933719111428521">38</xref>
</sup> Nevertheless, the association of P844 L in heterozygosity with IVS9 + 66G/A increases the chance of the prediction to be functionally significant. To evaluate whether the increase in MLH3 levels in these cases was a cause or consequence of MA, 2 other <italic>MMR</italic> genes known to interact with MLH3 during meiosis, <italic>MLH1</italic> and <italic>MSH4</italic>, were also quantified. In all cases, <italic>MSH4</italic> levels were normal. Although 1 patient with MA at the round spermatid stage had a S966P mutation (predicted by SIFT to not affect function) and presented overexpression of MLH3, some of the substitutions predicted to be tolerated by SIFT may also be deleterious.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1933719111428521">38</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>These findings therefore suggest an association between increased <italic>DMMR</italic> gene expression and the meiotic arrest phenotype. Meiosis progression requires the correct balance of the MLH1-binding partners MLH3 and PMS2. Given our results, we hypothesize that increased expression of MLH3 and MLH1 leads to a predominance of the MLH1/MLH3 heterodimer, thereby creating an imbalance in the number of functional complexes containing PMS2, which would be predicted to behave similarly to a PMS2-dominant negative mutation. This absence or shortage in MLH1/PMS2 complexes would be predicted to prevent cells from completing meiosis, as partial replacement of MLH1/MLH3 with MLH1/PMS2 during diplonema is required for resolving crossovers.<sup>
