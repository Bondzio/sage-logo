<abstract>
<p>Scholars have observed growing variability in life course transitions, such as entry into a full-time job. Life course theorists use the concept of agency to account for increasing diversity and unpredictability in developmental trajectories. In so doing, they presume that agency can only be a source of heterogeneity. Drawing from in-depth interviews with 406 people from all walks of life, I examine a form of temporal agency or ‘time work’ – that is, efforts to modify one’s own experience of time or that of others. The findings suggest that agency does not operate in the way life course theorists envision.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961463X12455598" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Journalists and other members of the scribbling trades are prone to name generations as a descriptive shorthand. The Baby Boomers were followed by Generation X, which was followed by Generation Y or the Millennials. Generation Y represents people who are in their 20s, and they are earning a reputation for being less independent than their predecessors. So many of them return home after graduating from college that they are also called ‘boomerang kids.’ This tendency is not the result of psychological maladjustment, but the sociological fact that they are launching their careers during a period of economic retrenchment.</p>
<p>Generational monikers result from anecdotal impressions, not careful research. They are stereotypes, and it is easy to think of countless exceptions. Behind these sweeping generalizations, however, we can glimpse a classic version of sociological determinism. Presumably, one’s behavior and experience are shaped by the fact that one is a product of a particular generation, but how do generations have this effect? Human beings are conditioned by their social location, argues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961463X12455598">Mannheim (1952 [1927]</xref>: 297), and the concept of generation is a temporal variation on this fundamental insight: ‘Members of a generation are “similarly located”’ – not necessarily in geography or social structure, but in <italic>time</italic>. As such, they share ‘the handicaps and privileges inherent’ in that temporal location; they are members of ‘the same historical community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961463X12455598">Mannheim, 1952 [1927]</xref>: 303).</p>
<p>Following Mannheim, generations are commonly defined with reference to a specific historical event or period (e.g. the War generation or the generation of the Great Depression). Yet what period of time do we refer to as a generation? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961463X12455598">Mannheim (1952 [1927]</xref>: 278) observed that the ‘duration of a generation is … variously estimated’ at something between 15 and 30 years. Thus, as a unit of time, the generation is imprecise and irregular. For this reason, sociologists who study the life course examine cohorts – that is, categories of people who were born within a specific period of time (e.g. those born between 1952 and 1962), or who have a given age at a certain time (e.g. those between 50 and 60 years of age in 2012). There is a presumption that roughly the same things will happen to these people at roughly the same time because they are roughly the same age. Sociologists refer to this pattern as ‘cohort effects.’ Twenty years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X12455598">Clausen (1991: 806)</xref> found the sociological emphasis on cohort effects unsatisfactory: ‘My preferred conception of the life course,’ he declared, ‘entails negotiation by a reflexive self of a set of potentially available roles that are interlinked and to which persons commit themselves to varying degrees at different periods of their lives.’ In this statement, Clausen questions the emphasis on cohort effects by invoking ‘a reflexive self,’ which, regardless of one’s age, makes for variability in one’s commitment to social roles. Life course transitions result from decisions, but the statistical analysis of cohort effects does not take subjectivity and interaction into account.</p>
<p>When does one become an adult? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X12455598">Shanahan (2000: 667)</xref>, ‘the transition to adulthood’ is marked by life course events, such as ‘leaving school, starting a full-time job, leaving the home of origin, getting married, and becoming a parent for the first time.’ The measurement of these transitions changed during the years following Clausen’s critique of cohort effects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X12455598">Shanahan (2000: 667)</xref> notes that previous research had ‘emphasized central tendencies in these life course events (for example, the median age at first marriage).’ This approach ignored the growing variation within cohorts. Shanahan adds that, in accord with Clausen’s conception of the life course, ‘Research of the past two decades … has increasingly focused on the variability of these’ transitions.</p>
<p>The life course paradigm emerged from this critique of cohort analysis. Presumably, a given cohort is exposed to the same social and historical environment, which brings about correlations between age and various forms of behavior or experience. But how does this occur? One can only speculate. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X12455598">Elder and O’Rand (1995: 455)</xref> put it, ‘a cohort approach to adult lives … identifies broad categories of potential influences that provide no clear understanding of the mechanisms which link history with individual development or change.’ Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X12455598">Elder and O’Rand (1995: 457)</xref> challenge the root assumption of cohort analysis by calling attention to the great variability within cohorts:<disp-quote>
<p>The life course is age-graded according to generalized divisions or categories, from childhood to old age, but members of a birth cohort do not move through this age structure in concert according to the social roles they occupy. Age at entry into a full-time job, completion of formal education, cohabitation and marriage, the birth of the first child – these and other events in the transition to adulthood are not experienced by all members of a birth cohort, and those who experience them do so at widely varied times in life.</p></disp-quote>With their life course perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X12455598">Elder and O’Rand (1995: 458)</xref> ‘redirected the focus of research from the invariant stages of adult life … and the oversocialized view of development … to the ongoing processes by which lives are constructed and reconstructed from birth to death in ways only weakly correlated with age.’ If cohort analysis is not the correct approach, what should we do instead? The response from Elder and other students of the life course is implicit in the foregoing quotation. Assuming a constructionist stance, they assert that we should attend to what cohort analysis disregards: namely, the decision-making processes associated with the self and self-determination, or what sociologists since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961463X12455598">Giddens (1979: 56)</xref> have called ‘agency.’ In what follows, I try to show that this way of compensating for the shortcomings of cohort analysis brings about its own problems with theory and method.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961463X12455598">Giddens (1979: 56)</xref> defines agency as self-consciously intentional effort to change the trajectory of social interaction ‘It is a necessary feature of action that, at any point in time, the agent “could have acted otherwise”: either positively in terms of attempted intervention in the process of “events in the world,” or negatively in terms of forbearance.’ Clearly, agency concerns the exercise of choice or self-determination, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961463X12455598">Mead (1934: 25)</xref> would have it. In contrast, social structure represents enduring patterns of behavior or experience that are rooted in abstract positions. The externality and constraint of social structure is supposed to make for determinism, not self-determination. If there is agency, how is social structure possible, and vice versa?</p>
<p>Since the formulation of agency, there has been a fierce and ongoing debate about how to reconcile the apparent contradictions between agency and structure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961463X12455598">Alexander (1988: 77)</xref> established the parameters for this debate: ‘Neither micro nor macro theory is satisfactory. Action and structure must now be intertwined.’ According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X12455598">Collins (1992: 77)</xref>, however, the distinction between agency and structure does not pose ‘an explanatory question but an idealogical one’, because this distinction represents nothing more than an effort ‘to show that human beings control their own destinies.’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X12455598">Collins (1992: 78)</xref> urges his colleagues to ‘stop worrying about agency,’ but they have not taken his advice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961463X12455598">Sewell (1992)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X12455598">Emirbayer and Mische (1998)</xref> strive to theorize agency, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961463X12455598">Callero (1994: 228)</xref> echoes Alexander: ‘any attempt to conceptualize social structure must ultimately confront the dilemma posed by the problem of agency.’</p>
<p>We can define time work as one’s effort to promote or suppress a particular form of temporal experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961463X12455598">Flaherty, 2003</xref>: 19). Time work is a species of agency because it involves the intentional self-determination of temporal experience. In this article, I show that the empirical study of time work enables us to reconcile agency and structure because, in large measure, such agency contributes to the establishment and maintenance of temporal structure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961463X12455598"><title>Agency and the life course</title>
<p>Those who study human development find themselves confronted by ‘increasing diversity and unpredictability of life course trajectories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961463X12455598">Lutfey and Mortimer, 2006</xref>: 190). They have turned to the social psychology of agency in an effort to understand this growing heterogeneity in their data. Yet, on the face of it, agency is not a concept that sits comfortably within an otherwise macro-sociological and deterministic framework. As it stands, consequently, the parts of this framework are not integrated in a coherent theory. The role of agency in the life course remains paradoxical because the relationship between determinism and self-determination is left unresolved. Thus, agency becomes something akin to a ghost in the machine.</p>
<p>In their paradigmatic statements, life course scholars repeatedly refer to a deterministic social environment and the self-determination of agency without clarifying: (1) how these factors are related to one another; or (2) how life course transitions result from their combined influence. Consider, for example, this extract from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X12455598">Elder (1994: 4)</xref>: ‘Developmentalists have gained more sensitivity to the interlocking nature of human lives and generations, as well as an informed awareness of individuals as choice makers and agents of their own lives.’ Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X12455598">Elder and O’Rand (1995: 453, 455)</xref> first confirm that ‘The life course … refers to age-graded life patterns embedded in social institutions and subject to historical change,’ and then add that ‘The distinctive contextual theme in contemporary studies of adult lives is coupled with an appreciation of the plasticity and agency of the individual.’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961463X12455598">Gubrium et al. (1994: 199)</xref> also endorse this dualistic formula but quickly admit to some discomfort with its ambiguity: ‘The life course is a product of human discretion and interpretation, even as it reflects the rationalizations of modern society. There is, however, a certain tension regarding agency in this imagery.’ Indeed, this ‘tension’ emanates from an unresolved paradox at the heart of the life course paradigm.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961463X12455598">Hitlin and Elder (2007)</xref> are, themselves, troubled by the current conceptualization of agency, which they disparage as ‘curiously abstract.’ Their extensive review makes it apparent that social scientists have not come to terms with agency. Nonetheless, it has become a heralded, if enigmatic, component in the developmental perspective. Rather than birth cohorts ‘progressing from one life stage to another in a fairly uniform manner’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961463X12455598">Lutfey and Mortimer, 2006</xref>: 190), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X12455598">Elder (1994: 5)</xref> proposes a more variegated model consisting of ‘transitions’ and ‘trajectories.’ Transitions are turning points in the life course, such as the birth of one’s first child. They mark significant changes in one’s social status. Trajectories represent alternative paths through the life course – for example, a career in military service versus higher education and subsequent white-collar employment. These concepts are meant to embrace agency because both transitions and trajectories are viewed, at least in part, as self-selected outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X12455598">Elder (1994: 5)</xref> identifies ‘four themes [that] deserve special note as central to the life course paradigm.’ The first three are familiar aspects of social structure (‘the interplay of human lives and historical times, the timing of lives, linked or interdependent lives’), while the fourth is ‘human agency in choice making.’ As one would expect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X12455598">Elder (1994: 5)</xref> avows that his ‘perspective tends to stress the social forces that shape the life course and its developmental consequences.’ Despite the proclaimed inclusion of agency, there are still ‘social forces,’ and they still have ‘consequences’ for the life course. In this formulation, agency remains unassimilated – neither fully conceptualized nor operationalized.</p>
<p>We can find the same tension in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X12455598">Clausen’s (1991: 811)</xref> analysis of ‘planful competence’ – that is, one’s ability to make well-considered choices concerning the future. On the one hand, he states that ‘the life course is a creation of the person’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X12455598">Clausen, 1991</xref>: 805), which certainly seems to place the responsibility for one’s life squarely on the individual. It would appear that the life course is purely an artifact of choice or self-determination. On the other hand, however, he argues that ‘Societies and their cultures … tend to shape individual lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X12455598">Clausen, 1991</xref>: 805), because ‘the choices are constrained by the institutional structures within which the person must fit’ (1991: 806). What are we glossing over with the phrase ‘constrained choices’? What does it mean? Presumably, sociology and its social forces are represented by constraint on individual volition. By implication, then, choice would seem to represent something else, something that is not sociological, something that can account for observed variability in the life course. But Clausen is at pains to point out that planful competence is a product of (i.e. caused by) one’s prior socialization (1991: 838), and he demonstrates that it ‘can influence the life course over a period of 40 or more years beyond adolescence’ (1991: 811). Once again, despite the vaunted inclusion of agency, we have arrived at predetermined causes and their predictable consequences.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961463X12455598">George (1996: 248)</xref> tells us that ‘life course scholars expect heterogeneous life course patterns.’ The conceptual apparatus of agency is their proffered explanation for this heterogeneity. Why are life course patterns so variable within and between birth cohorts? The response from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X12455598">Elder and O’Rand (1995: 459)</xref> is that ‘environments do not have a uniform impact on the lives of individuals who occupy them.’ It was, of course, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961463X12455598">Mead (1934: 25)</xref> who taught us that human self-consciousness ‘is selective of certain types of stimuli … [because] we open the door to certain stimuli and close it to others.’ Elaborating on Mead’s insight, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X12455598">Elder and O’Rand (1995: 461)</xref> concur that the individual exercises some ‘selection’ from his or her environment. If choice and subjectivity matter, this suggests that individuals do not share a uniform environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X12455598">Elder and O’Rand (1995: 457, italics in original)</xref> conclude that ‘the agency of individuals and their life choices ensures some degree of <italic>loose coupling</italic> between social transitions and stages.’ From this standpoint, agency is the wild card in the game of life. Yet this line of reasoning brings us back to undoubtedly simplistic imagery: that ‘the life course is a creation of the person’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X12455598">Clausen, 1991</xref>: 805). Try telling that to a member of the Millennial Generation who is looking for a job.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X12455598">Gecas (2003: 370)</xref> is quite right when he states that ‘the self is at the heart of causal and agentic processes.’ All social action is agentically grounded in self-selected choices. Human conduct is deliberate, and our intentions emerge from the internal dialogue that serves as a vehicle for self-consciousness. However, the self is not an uncaused cause; it is a product of social interaction and a thoroughly socialized entity. Like Clausen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X12455598">Gecas (2003: 374)</xref> shows us that one’s capacity for agency or self-efficacy arises from developmental contexts, such as family, peers, school, occupation, race, class, and gender. Agency is not a rare and always insurgent mode of action, nor does it only figure in social change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961463X12455598">Garfinkel’s (1967: 53)</xref> breaching exercises demonstrate that <italic>compliance</italic> with cultural norms is a form of agency. Through socialized self-consciousness, the individual is motivated to comply with folkways and mores. Agency is, therefore, part and parcel of the causal chain that brings about sociological determinism.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X12455598">Shanahan (2000: 668)</xref>, ‘trends reveal significant changes in the transition to adulthood.’ Specifically, there is growing heterogeneity. Life course scholars theorize that agency is the source of this developmental variability. ‘Loose coupling reflects the agency of individuals,’ writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X12455598">Elder and O’Rand (1995: 457)</xref>. To substantiate this claim, one would have to show that there is more agency during a particular era than there was prior to it. Yet, given that agency is a universal feature of social interaction, how can there be more (or less) of it during a specified historical period? And how can we account for social change (i.e. increased heterogeneity in the life course) by means of agency – a phenomenon that is conditioned by its social context and serves as the foundation for compliance with the cultural status quo?</p>
<p>A small, isolated society with only primitive technology has very little life course variability, but it has no less agency than we would find in a more advanced society. Agency makes for compliance where options are few and rigidly enforced. If there is greater life course variability in recent decades, it is not the result of agency, per se, but rather structurally imposed changes in social institutions that offer a broader range of life course options from which to choose. The people in question are often reluctant to embrace these changes, and with good reason. In short, agency is neither a wild card nor a ghost in the machine. It is an intrinsic component of that process whereby culture is produced and reproduced across generations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961463X12455598" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Agency operates within the context of social interaction, but how is it manifest, and what difference does it make? These are empirical questions, but where should we begin our inquiry? My recent research concerns temporal agency – that is, efforts to modify or customize one’s own experience of time or that of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X12455598">Flaherty, 2011</xref>). I call such effort ‘time work.’ How do people construct lines of activity or social occasions in order to instigate or suppress various forms of temporal experience? This question can only be addressed by means of first-person narratives that describe cognitive and behavioral effort at the micro-management of one’s own temporal experience.</p>
<p>With the aim of generating such narratives, I designed and supervised semi-structured, open-ended interviews with 406 people. These interviews were conducted in two overlapping stages. From 1998 to 2001, my research assistants and I interviewed 271 undergraduates who were enrolled in sections of an introductory sociology course. These respondents came from every region of the US, but, as one would expect, they were quite homogeneous in terms of age and socio-economic background. Consequently, from 2001 to 2004, we interviewed 135 people from all walks of life. Their occupations ranged from waitress to banker and from beautician to engineer. Of the total sample, 53.5% were women, and 12.6% were non-white. They ranged in age from 18 to 73.</p>
<p>Our interviews began with the following introduction: ‘This study concerns ways in which people attempt to control or customize their own experience of time, or that of others. Is there any way in which you try to influence or manipulate the experience of time?’ This opening was designed to make our respondents start thinking about time work – certainly not a subject uppermost in their thoughts when the interview began. Confirmation followed the interviewer’s recognition of a pertinent (but often tentative) response: ‘Yes, that’s what we’re looking for.’ Handing the respondent a pad of paper, the interviewer then prompted written answers to the following questions: ‘Is there a particular time or day during which you find yourself in this situation?’; ‘Would you describe the physical location of this situation?’; ‘Would you describe any relevant objects?’; ‘Generally speaking, how would you describe the social situation? In other words, what is supposed to be happening?’; ‘Are there any other persons involved in this situation besides yourself? If so, please describe them, including your relationship’; ‘Now we would like you to describe how you control or customize the experience of time, and please be as specific as possible.’ Finally, the interviewer recorded each respondent’s age, gender, race, and occupation.</p>
<p>Our subjects reported efforts to modify multiple dimensions of time: duration, frequency, sequence, timing, and allocation. In addition, they report stealing time from others, most notably, their employers. Here, I discuss some of the principles that emerge from our findings as well as their implications for the image of agency in life course theory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961463X12455598"><title>Time work in context</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X12455598">Collins (1992: 77)</xref> views agency as a figment of our imagination and pointedly rejects political revolutions as evidence of agency because, ‘far from being miracles of indeterminism and free will, [they] are explicable by macro-social conditions which are already well understood.’ Like so many others (including life course theorists), Collins mistakenly conflates agency with indeterminism, free will, and insurgency. In so doing, he overlooks the most prevalent form of agency: conformity with cultural prescriptions. Consider the following instance. While spending a semester abroad in Spain, a 22-year-old American student made it a point to accommodate the unfamiliar schedule of her host, a 62-year-old woman: ‘Every day, we made sure that we were at home at 2:30 to eat the big meal of the day together.’ Her use of the plural ‘we’ may seem odd – in this extract, only one person is adapting to a foreign schedule – but, in fact, she is quite correct. Both student’s and host’s compliance arise from comparable agentic effort. The student chooses to respect an exotic temporal norm; her host chooses to enact conformity with a familiar temporal routine. At home or abroad, choosing to conform to normative expectations is most assuredly an agentic practice.</p>
<p>Like the American student and her Spanish host, we often contribute to, and thereby help to maintain, temporal structures that confront us with exteriority and constraint – indeed, the same structures we resist (via different forms of time work) when the occasion suits us. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X12455598">Thompson (1967)</xref> has shown us that getting oneself to work on time could not be taken for granted during the early years of the Industrial Revolution, and, despite the fact that workers have become habituated to this temporal regime, the same is true today. Put differently, whenever someone gets to work (or school, or dinner in a foreign land) on time, agency is implicated in that causal process. How does this occur? Should we say that the cause is someone’s decision to set an alarm clock (i.e. intervention)? What about one’s decision to forgo an interesting (but late) film in order to ensure one’s ability to get up in the morning (i.e. forbearance)? Is the cause located in that person’s primary socialization to the cultural value of punctuality? Or is it rooted in feelings of self-esteem, authenticity, and self-efficacy that ensue when one shows up on time? Is it the feeling of superiority one has when contrasting oneself to a colleague who is chronically late? By means of a reflexive self, the individual is engaged in agentic deliberations throughout this causal process, yet the upshot is an instance of conformity with temporal norms. Clearly, compliance is a rather large species of agency. There is, then, no reason to presume (in the manner of life course theorists) that agency is only a force for divergence from the status quo. Both critics and advocates of agency focus on resistance and insurrection, but, more often than not, agency makes for social order and cultural persistence.</p>
<p>How could it be otherwise? Agency is conditioned by its social context. ‘Homeschooling,’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X12455598">Lois (2010: 422)</xref> observes, ‘is almost always performed by at-home mothers in two-parent, heterosexual families with a father serving as the single wage-earner in the paid labor force.’ Homeschooling is an agentic choice, but fathers do not choose this path despite expressing ‘enthusiasm for the idea of homeschooling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X12455598">Lois, 2010</xref>: 433). If, as Collins would have it, agency is the shadow of ‘free will,’ why do fathers not exercise their free will to stay at home and educate their children? Mothers solicit help with the homeschooling from fathers, but they ‘reported that fathers “got too busy” or “forgot” to honor their commitments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X12455598">Lois, 2010</xref>: 430). Faced ‘with putting their own lives on hold for prolonged periods’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X12455598">Lois, 2010</xref>: 433), these mothers turn to compensatory forms of time work: sequencing and savoring. With sequencing, mothers devote the current period of their lives to their children, but, as one puts it, ‘There will be time for me later’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X12455598">Lois, 2010</xref>: 434). With the second strategy – savoring – mothers defined the current period of their lives as one that deserves their full attention because ‘Their children’s childhoods were evaporating daily, and they would regret not making the most of this time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X12455598">Lois, 2010</xref>: 437). Homeschooling mothers are engaged in agentic practices, but, in effect, these practices reproduce a gendered social structure.</p>
<p>Let us consider another case in point – this one from my own data. Two young scholars – one male, one female – are visiting Miami’s South Beach neighborhood on a crowded Saturday night. It takes nearly an hour for them to find a parking space. During this protracted interval, the female driver is described by her male companion as ‘completely calm’ (‘in full Zen mode,’ to use her own words), while he is ‘absolutely seething’ because he ‘can’t believe that it could take so long to park.’ How can their reactions to the same setting be so divergent? They pay selective attention to different aspects of their shared environment. The female driver has the more challenging role, but, unlike her male companion, she has mastered certain techniques of time work. She knows how to conjure patience by diverting her attention away from time itself. This skill, which he lacks, is referenced by the slang, ‘in full Zen mode.’ The machineries of time work are collectively available to the members of a society, but this knowledge is socially distributed. It is, of course, no coincidence that the female half of this couple is the calmer, more patient person. Like homeschooling, the relevant skills are not randomly distributed across sociological categories in the population, nor can one simply summon patience at will.</p>
<p>Agency that is directed toward temporal deviance is no less conditioned by its social context. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961463X12455598">Hochschild and Machung (1989)</xref> conceptualized the ‘second shift’ to help us see that women who participate in the paid labor force, nonetheless, also assume responsibility for housekeeping and child-rearing with little or no help from the men in their lives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961463X12455598">Parker-Pope and Pope (1999: 7H)</xref> elaborate on this insight by observing that ‘women actually work an additional Secret Shift – a parallel workday in which women manage their family life at the same time they do the job for which they’re being paid.’ What we have here is the agentic theft of time. These women are ‘on the clock,’ so, strictly speaking, they are choosing to divert time from the work assigned to them by their employers. Yet this is not self-indulgent behavior. They are stealing from Peter to pay Paul; they reappropriate time from one social role for the sake of another social role. ‘For many women,’ write <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961463X12455598">Parker-Pope and Pope (1999: 7H)</xref>, ‘it’s the only way they’re able to maintain the delicate balance between work and family.’ In an ultimate sense, of course, this behavior is no more requisite than any other, but responsibilities unrelated to their employment (responsibilities they hold dear) will suffer if they do not engage in this illicit and clandestine form of multitasking.</p>
<p>Clearly, this temporal deviance is an artifact of gender. A 23-year-old woman who works as a staff-service associate in a financial firm notes that she must ‘make personal appointments by phone at work.’ As she puts it, ‘When you work nine to five and so do most of the doctors and other businesses, it becomes necessary to do this then.’ She is somewhat uncomfortable with this confession (hence her use of the word ‘necessary’) – a discomfort that marks her own agentic complicity. Still, telephone calls of this type are only an issue for people who work in subordinate and supervised positions, and, more often than not, these people are women. The demands of gainful employment are such that lower-level employees can elect to steal time from themselves. In this regard, the staff-service associate provides further testimony.<disp-quote>
<p>I usually don’t do much eating at lunch. I am allowed a break from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. and must be back for the others to take theirs. I usually go out and run errands: groceries, a return at the mall, recycling, post office. You name it, at noon is usually when I do it! Technically, I guess that is not using work time because that is my personal time, but I mention it because of an interesting trend that I found: all of the staff-service associates and operations staff do this …. The interesting thing is not that we are too busy to do this stuff later (most of the women in the office have children at home), but that the financial advisors in the office [all of whom are men] don’t have a set time; they break at any time of the day. They run errands at any time they feel like leaving. They check out the new Home Depot that opened down the street at 2:30 in the afternoon or go out to get a cinnamon bun and latte at 10:00 a.m.</p></disp-quote>Her astute observations point to a significant, but typically overlooked, division in the US occupational structure: those who can mix personal work (or play) with the demands of their job without getting into trouble for doing so and those who cannot. Both men and women engage in agency, and it would be difficult to say that there is more of it on one side or the other, but there is certainly a gendered distinction in the types of agency permitted them.</p>
<p>Social interaction is saturated with temporal agency, but this time work is typically directed toward the self-regulation of temporal desires, not something that warrants the phrase ‘free will.’ When we examine empirical instances of time work, we do not find that the data are characterized by self-indulgence. On the contrary, it quickly becomes apparent that most of our efforts to modify temporal experience emerge from and reflect a socialized self-discipline. In the following excerpt from an interview with a 29-year-old insurance salesman, our respondent describes engaging in agency by choosing to limit the amount of time he spends with his girlfriend, thereby striking a balance between the temporal demands of conflicting social roles:<disp-quote>
<p>I work all week and I like to have the nights to myself to do my work and rest. My girlfriend would like to see me more often, but when she’s around I can’t concentrate. So I tell her she can only come over on the weekends, which she doesn’t really like, but it has to be that way so I can get my work done. I’d like to see her more often, too, but it’s more convenient this way.</p></disp-quote>His claim that ‘it has to be that way’ is nothing more than a cover story for ambivalence. He wants to be a good boyfriend, and he wants to be a good employee, but both of these social roles require the allocation of temporal resources. He elects to ration time with his girlfriend as a solution for this temporal quandary. This arrangement was not imposed on him; he created it. What is more, his temporal agency makes for her experience of temporal structure, with its externality and constraint. He succeeds whereas she fails.</p>
<p>There is, then, the intriguing and uniquely human possibility that we may look upon <italic>enjoyable</italic> conduct or experience as ‘bad for us’ – at least beyond a certain frequency. Lest we jump to a gendered conclusion, however, consider the following case, where a young woman rations time with her boyfriend for the sake of impression management:<disp-quote>
<p>I specifically will not go places where I know he is at because I don’t want him to think I’m some obsessed crazy girl who can’t get enough of him. So I will usually switch my plans or the order of them so I won’t end up seeing him at certain places when we don’t plan to meet.</p></disp-quote>He is her boyfriend, and she enjoys his company, but she purposefully restricts her time with him. She does so in order to avoid being viewed as deviant for the intensity of her affections. Social norms govern our intimate relationships, and some of these norms concern the allocation of time. This young woman’s testimony shows us that one can spend too much time with a loved one – becoming, thereby, a pitiable and perhaps frightening person in the eyes of one’s lover and peers. She eludes this fate by means of adroit time work (i.e. intermittent temporal abstinence).</p>
<p>When should I do something? For how long? One chooses what to do with one’s time, which entails the exercise of temporal agency, but these decisions are not made with utter autonomy. The individual in question is a product of a particular social location and, consequently, the allocation of time reflects cultural priorities. By dint of enculturation, many of us are oriented toward the asceticism or self-denial that makes for economic productivity. It follows that one must be on guard against losing track of time during enjoyable activity, as noted by a 22-year-old male:<disp-quote>
<p>When I walk my dog, I have a timer on my watch that counts down 10 minutes. I used to just glance at my watch, but I would end up spending 15 minutes out there. I take her out three times a day so, if I don’t watch it, I end up wasting my time.</p></disp-quote>The insurance salesman, the girlfriend, the young man who walks his dog, each of them makes a self-conscious decision; they engage in temporal agency. Yet the aim of this deliberate effort is restriction of the time they might otherwise devote to activity they enjoy. Respectively, their time work affirms social roles, social norms, and social values. Instead of self-indulgence, their agency celebrates the temporal structure of their society.</p>
<p>If we bear in mind that agency is conditioned by social forces, then it is easier for us to understand why time work is so rarely capricious or insurgent. There are, however, instances where an individual elects to toy with temporal experience for self-indulgent reasons – what I call ‘time play.’ It is useful to consider what one of these cases can teach us about the relationship between time and agency. In this excerpt, a 38-year-old social scientist recalls her willful days as an undergraduate:<disp-quote>
<p>I used to reverse day and night by staying up all night talking to whomever was around, wandering campus in the dark, reading, then going to class, if I went that day, and then going back to the dorm to sleep. I’d get up around 9:00 p.m., as things were getting socially interesting, and start over. This was mostly as a result of finding daytime to be quite boring, and the reversal provided some variety and better conversational partners.</p></disp-quote>Why are there so few cases like this one? Most of us are entangled in a web of social relationships that make temporal demands on our behavior. We are not at liberty to toy with temporal experience in this fashion. And where do we find this rare and unruly form of time play? Precisely in that stage of the life course where we should expect to find it. During one’s undergraduate studies, one enjoys a special societal license (almost a social expectation) for just this type of experimentation. Where else but as an undergraduate can you indulge in such temporal idiosyncrasy? Indeed, she would be quickly fired from her current position were she to engage in anything like this conduct.</p>
<p>Like all forms of agency, time work is perspectival. One’s effort at temporal agency is often experienced by others as a bid for temporal determinism. The boss demands that employees work from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The hostess for a sociable gathering invites her guests to arrive at 7:00 p.m. Parents tell their children to prepare for bedtime at 8:00 p.m. In each case, agentic deliberations and decisions precede attempts to dictate the temporal behavior of others. Yet the others do not simply accede to these demands. Employees arrive late, take unscheduled breaks, pretend to work while doing personal business, and leave early. Some of those people invited to a sociable gathering deliberately procrastinate so that they can arrive fashionably late or avoid awkward conversations with others who have arrived too early. And, of course, the parents’ attempt to impose a bedtime provokes angry protests, tearful entreaties, and all manner of delaying tactics. In short, agentic efforts at temporal determinism serve as a springboard for temporal resistance and equally agentic forms of time work. There is, then, no clean line between agency and determinism. What we find instead is ceaseless interaction, negotiation, and strategy.</p>
<p>If all social interaction is agentically guided, it follows that there cannot be more or less agency during different stages of the life course, nor is there more or less agency in different generations. To be sure, there is more temporal agency due to time scarcity among the middle-aged, but more temporal agency is occasioned by an overabundance of time among youth and the elderly. People of all ages strive to modify the same temporal dimensions of their lives: duration, frequency, sequence, timing, and allocation. While parents attempt to control when their children do homework, their children try to customize when they can meet with their friends. While parents steal time from their employers, their children steal time from their teachers. In short, we find small, predictable variations in the content of time work across age categories, but no differences with respect to the quantity or forms of time work. It is, therefore, difficult to see how agency can be used to explain a measurable increase (or decrease) in life course heterogeneity during any particular era.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0961463X12455598" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Time work is a form of agency. Through time work, we attempt to shape the contours of our own temporal experience. By means of time work, we resist external sources of temporal constraint or structure. These observations have important implications for sociological theory. ‘It is necessary,’ writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961463X12455598">Bourdieu (1977 [1972]: 73)</xref>, ‘to abandon all theories which explicitly or implicitly treat practice as a mechanical reaction, directly determined by the antecedent conditions.’ Indeed, evidence from the study of time work makes it apparent that the intricacies of temporal creativity cannot be accurately represented by mechanistic determinism.</p>
<p>We do not allow time to simply happen upon us, yet much of the external constraint and structure that we resist via time work has its origins in our own humanly produced forms of temporal creativity. We cannot wish these temporal structures away, as the French Republicans and Soviet Bolsheviks discovered when, 140 years apart, they each failed to overthrow the seven-day week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961463X12455598">Zerubavel, 1985</xref>: 35). This is why ‘rejection of mechanistic theories in no way implies that … we should bestow on some creative free will the free and willful power to constitute … the meaning of the situation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961463X12455598">Bourdieu, 1977 [1972]</xref>: 73). Sociological theory must recognize the dialectical character of our temporal experience without defining the self as an autonomous sovereign or depicting time as the plaything of our desires.</p>
<p>There are temporal norms in every society. As cultural conventions, they originate in human improvisation and enterprise. Citizens are not required to uphold them, although there may be consequences when they fail to do so. The fact that, by and large, they choose to do so (and they must <italic>choose</italic> to do so) is an artifact of socialization in concert with other mechanisms of social control. Temporal norms make for motivated compliance with the temporal status quo, but this motivated compliance is, and must be, ongoingly realized through self-guided decisions and practices. The citizens of a given society are only trying to enact an elusive image of themselves as good people – people who do what is expected of them. In so doing, however, they recapitulate the temporal structure of their society and achieve a fleeting sense of self-esteem in the bargain. By electing to conform to temporal norms, they reproduce the objective conditions of time as it is understood in that society. Thus, the study of time work provides an empirical foundation for ‘the reintegration of subjective voluntarism and objective constraint’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961463X12455598">Berger, 1991</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>Agency often involves choosing to comply with mores and folkways. It is conditioned by its cultural context and serves to reproduce social structure. Agency sometimes makes for temporal deviance, but, in these instances, it is no less conditioned by its social context. It is, consequently, rarely capricious or insurgent. Agency is perspectival in that one’s effort at self-determination can be viewed as a deterministic move from the standpoint of another. All social interaction is agentically guided, but agency is not antithetical to causality and sociological determinism. By the same token, we cannot marginalize agency in the remote realms of unexplained variance and insurrection. Agency is embedded within the causal chain of sociological determinism as a necessary, if deliberate and ultimately indeterminate, link. This is what agency looks like when you examine it closely, and life course scholars must come to terms with these findings if they want to incorporate this concept into their theoretical framework.</p>
