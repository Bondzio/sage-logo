<abstract>
<p>The emergence of China as a powerhouse of the world economy has added a new dimension to the global currency market. China’s impressive economic growth and phenomenal rise in exports have given considerable strength to its currency yuan in recent years. To what extent will China push to make the yuan the world’s reserve currency has become a burning issue. Currently, the share of yuan in total world reserves is hardly 1 per cent. The reasons are obvious. The yuan is not fully convertible, the capital market is shallow, the exchange rate is not flexible and international acceptance of yuan as a store of value is non-existent. In the face of these constraints, China is showing an inclination to make the yuan an international currency and to rival the US dollar and euro. Increase in the inflow of foreign direct investment as well as outflow of investment abroad is enabling China to move towards internationalisation of yuan in the near future. Regionalisation of the yuan is gaining importance with rise in its international trade in Asia. China has now allowed the commercial banks in Hong Kong to accept the yuan-denominated deposits. It is further extending loans in yuan to developing countries. Many steps are being taken towards making the yuan an international reserve currency. At the outset, it appears that the yuan would become an international currency in the foreseeable future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>China has emerged as a powerhouse of the world economy ever since it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001. Now, it has become a key driver of global growth. Its gross domestic product (GDP) has grown near to 10 per cent and exports over 20 per cent during the last three decades. This has changed the very complexion of the Chinese economy from that of a developing country to the global dominant manufacturing economy. It is recognised as a prominent emerging economy with diversified growth potential. In 2010, it surpassed the United States (US) to be the world’s top exporter, and the second-largest importer after the US. China’s total international trade (export + import) is second to that of the US. China is the fourth-largest exporter and the third-largest importer of world commercial services in 2010. Its share in the world exports jumped to 13.3 per cent. China’s GDP is estimated to be $5.9 trillion in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0974928413489467">1</xref></sup> China accumulated over $3.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserve by March 2011. China holds around $1.1 trillion in US securities. The inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) was $93 billion and the stock of outward direct investment is estimated to be around $60 billion in 2010. Its financial sector has grown with a cautious doze of liberalisation. Its non-financial companies have acquired foreign assets mainly to secure access to natural resources in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Sudan and some of the African and South American countries. Its banks have been acquiring equity stakes in companies, such as Blackstone, Barclays, Bear Stearns,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0974928413489467">2</xref></sup> South Africa’s Standard Banks and others. Will all these positive factors help China to make the yuan accepted as an international currency?</p>
<p>Till the end of 2008, yuan had not served any functions of international currency. It was not being used in invoicing China’s exports or imports. Among the currencies of the six largest economies in the world, China’s yuan is the only one that is not traded easily and accepted worldwide—that is, it is not a hard currency. Assets denominated in yuan are not held by foreign governments as part of their foreign exchange reserves, nor do foreign companies borrow in Chinese capital markets and repatriate the proceeds abroad. Lack of use of yuan in international trade stems mainly from the restrictions placed by the government on the use of the currency (capital controls of various types). The underdevelopment of both the Chinese financial market and capital market is also responsible. However, these two factors are in the process of being relaxed, raising the question of whether the currency will be used for international trade, and if so, how quickly and to what extent?</p>
<p>China’s financial system is not yet developed and is inefficient in mobilising and allocating funds, but it is moving slowly from a government-owned bank-dominated system to one in which equity and bond markets play more active role. China’s exchange rate regime currently stresses stability over efficiency; the authorities are committed to allowing greater stability for determining the value of the currency. Capital controls are gradually removed to offset high accumulation of foreign exchange reserves that result from inflexibility of the foreign exchange rate. However, some rigidities still persist.</p>
<p>Following the creation of the European Monetary Union (EMU), many predicted that the euro would emerge as the world’s major reserve currency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0974928413489467">Chinn and Frankel 2008</xref>). Recently, the debt problems of Eurozone and rising US indebtedness have brought forward the debate about the alternative reserve currencies including IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0974928413489467">Williamson 2009</xref>). Among the possible contenders for international currency status are yuan and euro. However, the recent euro crisis is setting the clock back on euro. The UK, Switzerland and Japan have necessary economic and financial size for their currency to achieve the reserve status, but only to a limited extent. On current reckoning, China is set to replace the US dollar to a large extent at least by 2020. In recent times, China has taken steps to promote international use of the yuan, even though it has not been willing to open up its economy to the free flow of capital and allow its exchange rate to be flexible. Nevertheless, given the sheer size of China’s economy and its rising shares of global output and foreign trade, these steps portend a rising role for the yuan in international trade and finance. Currently, the US is the world’s largest debtor<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0974928413489467">3</xref></sup> and China is a large net external creditor, only trailing Japan. Parallels can be drawn between today’s situation and the dollar replacing sterling during the inter-war period and post–Second World War. British Sterling, burdened by the financial legacy of First World War and Second World War, was replaced as the world’s reserve currency by an economically and financially rising dollar. This raises a number of questions. How likely are we to witness another such transition in the coming decades? What are the prospects that the yuan will replace the dollar as the dominant reserve currency? What would be its economic, financial and political implications?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0974928413489467">
<title>Necessary Preconditions</title>
<p>There are several conditions that underpin a reserve currency and its international use. Some of them are: the size of the economy, low inflation rate, exchange rate stability, deep and efficient capital markets, political stability and geopolitical strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0974928413489467">Papaioannou and Portes 2008</xref>). Let us examine each variable in the context of China. In terms of economic size, China is the second-largest economy, only next to the US. Its GDP was estimated to be $5.9 trillion in 2010 and the contribution of the industrial sector was around 47 per cent and that of the services sector was 43 per cent of GDP in 2010. The share of external trade sector to GDP was 56 per cent in 2010. The GDP is growing in the vicinity of 9–10 per cent and external sector is growing by 26 per cent in the recent years with the exception of year 2008. China has already become an industrial hub. The contribution of foreign invested enterprises to the total export is 58 per cent. These facts provide ample testimony to the strength of the economy. Although this not a necessary condition, it is indeed important to provide confidence to other central banks. For instance, Swiss Franc is a global reserve currency even though its share is small in global GDP and trade. Some major reserve currency economies, such as Euro area, Japan and the US, have large public debt, which casts doubts on their macroeconomic stability but has not affected their currencies’ reserve status till now. Based on the US experiences, some experts view that China will have to run large current account deficits if it wants to provide reserve assets to the rest of the world. However, it is not the case with Japan and Switzerland, as they have achieved reserve status despite consistent current account surpluses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0974928413489467">Prasad and Lei 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent years, the rate of inflation has been low in China. It averages around 2.32 per cent per annum; in 2011 it was 3.0 per cent and it was projected to be 2.9 per cent in 2012. China has succeeded in controlling inflation to a large extent. Prudent monetary and fiscal policy enabled it to control the price rise to the modest level. China maintains capital controls and a quasi-pegged exchange rate. So it cannot be said to have passed the test yet. However, there is no reason to believe that China will not be able to maintain relative exchange rate stability if it moves towards convertibility in a calibrated manner accompanied by the required domestic institutional reforms, such as central bank independence and inflation targeting. This will require a move towards a market-based banking system. This implies that the government will not only have to implement a host of secondary reforms aimed at ensuring financial sector stability post convertibility, but also have to accept a significant diminution of direct control over the financial system. Like other maturing emerging markets, China may move to a developmental approach to managing its exchange rate and capital flows to a floating exchange rate and an open capital account. As China’s economy grows in size, it will become less dependent on export-led growth and make a switch towards a flexible exchange rate regime which will be highly attractive in terms of policy flexibility.</p>
<p>Deep and efficient capital markets and full convertibility are more important than exchange rate stability. China has not yet developed in this area. Yuan is not fully convertible and the government maintains tight capital controls. The domestic bond market is relatively small and illiquid and foreigners’ access is highly restricted. A reserve currency requires sophisticated foreign exchange and derivative markets. On several occasions, China has affirmed its commitment to gradually move towards yuan convertibility and is seeking to develop domestic bond and derivatives and foreign exchange markets. Although China enjoys political stability, it continues to lag as regards the rule of the law. As long as it continues to compare poorly with the US and the Eurozone, foreigners may remain reluctant to invest in onshore yuan assets. According to the World Bank, China has made little progress on this account over the past decade. In all these areas, China has a long way to walk. How quickly China will manage to put in place the necessary conditions for the yuan to emerge as a major reserve currency depends mainly on political decisions. At the outset, it appears that gradual approach will prevail, specifically with regard to convertibility. It may probably take 5–7 years’ time to put in place the conditions required for the yuan to emerge as a reserve currency. Currently, yuan’s private and official use is very limited. Yuan has no role as an international store of value (as foreign exchange reserves) nor as unit of account (Hong Kong and Macao do not peg their currencies to yuan). Recently, the authorities have allowed the yuan assets such as deposits to be held offshore (particularly by Hong Kong) and for the yuan to be used in trade settlement, albeit in a pilot project.</p>
<p>If China manages to meet the prerequisites, yuan will become a reserve currency. As predicted by many, China’s economic size and international trade will grow, increasing the incentives of its widespread trading partners, particularly of small open economies, to manage their currencies vis-à-vis the currency of their dominant trading partner. As trade with China becomes more important relative to other countries, they will have an incentive to hold at least parts of their reserves in yuan-dominated assets—provided that yuan meets the conditions specified. From there onwards, it will only be a small step towards the yuan’s greater private use as a store of value, transaction vehicle and unit of account. This does not mean, however, that yuan will necessarily become the world’s dominant currency. Prerequisites are, by definition, necessary but not sufficient conditions, for even if China makes the yuan fully convertible, creates deep and liquid domestic bond markets, maintains a strong financial position, it will still need to overcome ‘network externalities’ (that is, an economic agent is more likely to use a currency if everybody else uses it), ‘Politics’ and the existence of ‘peer competitors’ (dollar and euro). Politics does matter. The countries which have no close political relations with China are less likely to keep the bulk of their foreign assets in yuan (for example, India, Japan and Vietnam). Other friendly countries may keep bulk of their foreign assets in yuan (for example, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan and North Korea).</p>
<p>China’s share of international currency use is expected to grow as its economy expands: as external trade, inflow and outflow of investment increase. Out of the world’s $9.7 trillion currency reserves, China’s share is only 0.5 per cent as compared to the US share of 60.7 per cent, Euro’s 26.6 per cent, the UK’s 4.1 per cent and Japan’s 2.9 per cent in 2010. On the basis of GDP growth, low inflation rate, and trade and investment flow, the yuan could be expected to become a major international currency. However, the attractive international currency must be associated with ‘… financial markets that are substantially free of controls; broad, in that they contain a large assortment of financial instruments; and deep, in that they have well developed secondary markets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0974928413489467">Tavlas 1991</xref>). On this criterion, China has a long way before it could rival the US or even the Eurozone. China’s rudimentary financial development is the major impediment to an international role for yuan. The tight regulation of Japanese financial markets is a factor that has inhibited financial innovation and limited international role of the yen. Hence, the yen’s share of official foreign exchange reserves remains small despite low inflation. It was once the second-largest economy (before China and the creation of Eurozone). In contrast, the US dollar is the preeminent international currency because it has broad and deep financial markets. These markets are liquid, so that assets can be bought and sold with low transaction costs and little adverse effect on market prices. Assets can be liquidated in emergencies with little penalty. For these reasons, the US dollar and, in particular, the US securities are viewed as safe in times of crisis.</p>
<p>It is indeed difficult to isolate individual effects, and the breadth and depth of US security markets are the results of several reinforcing factors, namely, the availability of sophisticated financial instruments and range of private financial intermediaries and dealers, transparent and effective supervisory and regulatory oversight, legal recourse and contract enforcement, and a respected central bank which is able to operate effectively as lender of last resort. The dollar’s attractiveness is also enhanced by the liquidity of the US treasury market, ranging from short-term treasury bills to 30-year bonds, issued in large amounts by triple-A rated borrowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0974928413489467">Dobson and Masson 2008</xref>). The US has an important advantage over the other issuers of international currencies, including the Eurozone, the UK and Japan. For example, the Eurozone government holds a large volume of government debt; there is no single issuer as large as the US treasury. This matters because different government liabilities are not perfect substitutes. These factors help explain why the euro has so far lagged behind the dollar as a reserve currency, with the dollar over twice as important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0974928413489467">Masson 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>China’s Financial System and Exchange Control</title>
<p>The yuan is hardly used internationally—partly as a result of past deliberate policies that limit the holdings of the currency by the foreigners because of the non-maturity of China’s financial markets. Even after the removal of impediments to non-resident holdings, the fate of the yuan rests on its usability to purchase goods, services and financial assets—that is, on its convertibility—and on the breadth and liquidity of the capital markets that are associated with it. At present, the yuan is convertible for the current account transactions, that is, for the payments for goods and services. Residents of China can freely use the yuan to meet any foreign obligations. But, the capital account convertibility is more limited. However, the payments associated with current account transactions and trade credits also allow for some arbitrage between domestic and foreign yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0974928413489467">Ma and McCauley 2007</xref>). There was a beginning of international use of yuan as a store of value. In 2004, Hong Kong banks were allowed to offer yuan deposits to individuals. It has grown over 40 billion yuan in 2010. Nevertheless, foreigners cannot freely acquire Chinese assets in exchange for their foreign currencies. Restrictions on the convertibility of a currency severely limits its attractiveness in official foreign exchange reserves, as means of denominating international claims and liabilities or as a vehicle currency.</p>
<p>The state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are allowed to acquire assets abroad, both to secure access to energy and other natural resources and as a way of investing their profits. China offers medium- and long-term loans on preferential terms as well as investment insurance for outward FDI. China has established a special fund providing subsidies to support Chinese enterprises overseas investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0974928413489467">UNCTAD 2006</xref>, Box VI. 5, p. 212). The FDI outflows have grown strongly, and the stock of FDI assets abroad was over $130 billion in 2010, while the securities and other investments abroad totalled well in excess of $600 million. China has heavily invested in Sudan, Angola and South Africa and South American countries. These countries are willing to accept the yuan as a reserve currency. South Africa has mooted the idea of using the yuan for international transactions. First, it would like the BRICS to adopt within Group-5; this proposal was mooted at the meeting held in New Delhi during March 2012. According to Standard Bank Report, if it is accepted, at least $100 billion in bilateral trade between China and Africa will be settled in yuan by 2015.</p>
<p>China has created a ‘sovereign Wealth Fund’ to invest some of its foreign exchange reserves in real assets. In June 2007, China established China Investment Corporation (CIC) whose purpose is to invest $200 billion of foreign exchange reserves. With respect to foreign issuers, since 2005, Asian Development Bank and International Financial Corporation have been permitted to borrow in Chinese domestic currency bond market through the so-called Panda Bonds, introducing international best practice in bond issuance procedures. So far the amount has been small, but enhancement is taking place gradually.</p>
<p>China’s restrictions on capital inflows are heavily biased against short-term portfolio capital flows and in favour of FDI. The Chinese diaspora were the first equity investors to come in, but since China’s accession to the WTO in 2001, it has become the largest recipient among the developing countries, receiving more than $80 billion annually. The total stock of FDI has crossed $650 billion. Further, more than 58 per cent of China’s fast-growing goods exports were produced by foreign invested enterprises. With the increase in Chinese assemblers, wholly-owned foreign entities have been permitted to use the yuan in trade transactions.</p>
<p>The extent of financial development so far is limited. The financial system is not broad since it is dominated by bank finance with few market-based instruments. The government controlled banks are yet to face competition from debt markets. Markets for corporate debt, in the form of commercial paper and asset-based securities, are still in the early stages of development. The corporate debt market is underdeveloped because of the restrictions placed on corporate issuers by several regulators. With the recent changes that eliminated requirements for Planning Commission approval of issues, corporate issuance has begun to rise. The Chinese bond market highlights problems of market segmentation, lack of benchmark rates, poor liquidity and underdeveloped credit market because of the newness of bankruptcy law. The institutional deficiencies underlying these problems are: lack of familiarity with bankruptcy laws, default procedures not based on market principles, investors lacking the transparency afforded by a credit rating system, lack of modern accounting standards, lack of market disciplines and inadequate investors’ education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0974928413489467">Zhou 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The official institutions that support and regulate Chinese financial markets are likewise not developed. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) as the central bank controls the money supply and regulates credit to commercial banks, but it does so not through indirect instruments. Instead of open market operations, it changes the reserve requirements and exerts direct control over banks’ lending and deposit rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0974928413489467">Naughton 2007</xref>). The PBOC is nominally independent but reports to the State Council. It is constrained in its ability to conduct independent monetary policy due to lack of flexibility of exchange rate against the US dollar. Inflation in China has recently been kept to single digits. The PBOC has not been able to tighten credit as much as it would have if exchange rate were flexible. On the whole, it appears that regulation of banks and financial markets can be characterised as non-transparent.</p>
<p>Chinese currency has fluctuated little against the US dollar since the end of 1993, when it was devalued from 5.8 to 8.7 to the dollar. In July 2005, China allowed some limited flexibility, and the yuan appreciated by about 15 per cent by early 2008, when it stood at 7 yuan per dollar. Because of the quasi-fixity of exchange rate, while Chinese inflation has remained low, the US dollar has been depreciating against other major currencies producing a flat real effective exchange rate—even a small depreciation—despite very large current account surpluses. Capital inflows through export earnings and large inflow of FDI have required central bank intervention to maintain the nominal exchange rate within the declared band.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0974928413489467">4</xref></sup> As a result, China has accumulated a huge volume of foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>The pace of reform and modernisation of the financial system is influenced by ‘growth at any cost’ objective.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0974928413489467">5</xref></sup> China has undertaken the restructuring of large number of SOEs since the mid-1990s. Now, nearly 80 per cent of industrial production originates in non-state sector. The radical restructuring has succeeded, as investment has surged in government sponsored infrastructure, housing projects and heavy industry. FDI has poured into the manufacturing sector since WTO accession in 2001. Economic growth is being driven by high rates of investment which exceeds 50 per cent of GDP. This is creating capacity overhangs in the heavy and chemical industries. The administered interest rates have been ineffective in slowing down the growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0974928413489467">Dobson and Kashyap 2006</xref>). The lack of exchange rate flexibility reduces the central bank’s monetary policy independence and its ability to conduct monetary policy. The administered interest rates are an obstacle to the play of competitive forces desirable in a modern banking system. However, since 1984, the banking system has been gradually liberalised and modernised. Since 2004, the largest commercial banks have acquired foreign strategic investors and listed some of their shares on stock exchanges to encourage transparency and greater efficiency of banking operations. The prudential standards and oversight have been strengthened. The large banks continue to rely on traditional mainstay borrowers; many of them are government owned or controlled firms. These firms still account for 70 per cent of their loans (ibid.). In 2008, more than 40 per cent of industrial SOEs were losing money—and losses continue to mount. Despite management, ownership and governance weakness, the investors, depositors and customers believe that the government-owned banks are ‘too big to fail’. The PBOC is not independent, but there is a widespread confidence in it as a lender of last resort.</p>
<p>Capital controls restrict the internationalisation of the yuan. Some view that capital account convertibility could substitute for exchange rate appreciation as relatively higher rates of return offshore attract large-scale capital outflows by individuals and corporations. It was found that onshore and offshore yuan yields are not equalised by cross-border arbitrage despite the legal channels for inflows and outflows and the leakages. Because interest rate differentials persist despite leakages, capital controls still bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0974928413489467">Ma and McCauley 2007</xref>). Loosening of capital controls may open the door to future vulnerability; therefore, a move to exchange rate flexibility may be preferred over capital account openness. Making the bank deposits freely convertible would not eliminate China’s substantial balance of payments surplus.</p>

<title>Regionalisation of the Yuan</title>
<p>China is more integrated in manufacturing production with its Asian neighbours. The size of its regional trade is far in excess of its trade with Europe or North America or even both combined. This may be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0974928413489467">Table 1</xref>. The large size of its imports and exports results from large amount of trade in intermediate goods, reflecting China’s position as an assembly platform in integrated Asian supply chains. Imports from Asia exceed exports to Asia in large part because of China’s role in doing final assembly of high-tech products, which are then exported to North America and Europe.</p>

<p>The internationalisation of the yuan would begin through its use as a regional invoicing currency. The yuan is not much used in invoicing, but recent relaxation that allows holding yuan balances in Hong Kong would establish the precondition for yuan invoicing. The advanced countries generally invoice exports in their own currencies. The developing countries do not enjoy that privilege. Trade in primary products is generally invoiced in dollars. The US is the only country whose share of invoicing exceeds substantially its share of world exports. China’s extensive trade with more advanced countries like Japan and South Korea would, therefore, be invoiced in the latter’s currencies, or the US dollar, rather than the yuan. Just over 14 per cent of China’s exports go to Hong Kong, but substantial part of that is entrepot trade, and such trade is likely to be invoiced in the currency of the ultimate destination. It may be in the form of dollar or euro. It is possible if Hong Kong itself adopts the yuan. As for trade with ASEAN, which is over 10 per cent of China’s total trade, it is perhaps the best candidate for some invoicing in yuan. If the yuan is to become an important regional invoicing currency, China must make progress in developing financial markets and improving their efficiency.</p>
<p>Internationalisation could also be promoted through the expansion in activities of Chinese companies abroad. With an expanded overseas presence, the Chinese companies could more readily manage their financial and currency exposure with large-scale transactions spanning both their onshore and offshore operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0974928413489467">Ma and McCauley 2007</xref>, 18). The promotion of outward direct investment is likely to loosen the effect of other controls. Chinese banks with operations abroad may offer both yuan and foreign currency facilities to their corporate customers.</p>
<p>Internationalisation of the yuan might also benefit from official efforts to foster Asian financial integration among 10 ASEAN countries, China, Japan and South Korea, although most concrete proposals for an Asian currency unit has come from Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0974928413489467">Ogawa and Ito 2002</xref>). So far concrete measures have been limited to the creation of swap lines between central banks, but reducing intra-regional exchange rate volatility—given the importance of intra-regional trade—remains an important objective. This might lead to the creation of a regional currency. The prospect of this happening may take some time (not very likely in the near future), by which time China should be the regional dominant economy with a more developed and liberalised financial system. Financial liberalisation in the region may result in the development of deeper links with global financial markets than regional financial integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0974928413489467">Eichengreen and Park 2005</xref>). In making the yuan an international currency, Hong Kong dollar has to play a critical role. It appears that trade is a significant determinant of reserve currency status. China’s growing trade dominance portend strongly for the yuan. The route to the yuan internationalisation will be via its increasing use as a currency within Asia because of the increasing trade links. It looks like the road to internationalisation of yuan will likely occur via regionalisation of yuan within Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0974928413489467">Subramanian 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Potential Advantages and Disadvantages of Reserve Currency</title>
<p>A reserve currency country (RCC) derives seigniorage. To the extent that foreigners hold a reserve currency, the RCC acquires foreign goods or financial assets by printing money. This is an exorbitant privilege. By holding currency, foreigners effectively extend an interest-free loan to the RCC. Additionally, the RCC benefits from ‘liquidity discount’. To the extent that foreigners are more likely to hold RCC liabilities, interest rates are lower than would otherwise be the case. Estimates as to the ‘seigniorage and liquidity discount’ benefits vary, but it is estimated to be around $500 billion and annual 100 bp in the case of the US. Further, the RCC enjoys an ‘exorbitant privilege’ not because it can finance its deficit by issuing its own currency or get debt denominated in its own currency. As a world’s banker it can also borrow ‘short’ at low rates and lend ‘long’ at higher yields, earning the spread, and act as the world’s ‘venture capitalist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0974928413489467">Gourinchas and Rey 2005</xref>). It can sell liquid, domestic currency denominated high-grade domestic debt to finance (foreign currency denominated) illiquid, high-return assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0974928413489467">Hausmann and Sturzenegger 2006</xref>). This may help make a net foreign debtor position sustainable in the long term. By increasing the number of investors, RCC financial markets may also be deeper and more efficient than they would otherwise be, thus potentially benefiting the international competitiveness of the financial industry. To the extent that the reserve currency is in greater use, an RCC may also benefit from improved terms of trade. Increasing use of reserve currency in international trade tends to raise the value in terms of the quantity of goods that can be purchased for every unit of the currency. The domestic companies may benefit from lower transaction costs and lower exchange rate uncertainty.</p>
<p>There are also costs involved. First, the reserve currency will tend to be overvalued, hurting the competitiveness and potential economic growth, due to larger demand than otherwise for its financial assets. Second, RCC economics, particularly monetary and exchange rate policies, matter greatly to other countries, potentially opening the RCC to international scrutiny and pressure. The country is then compelled to take greater account of international public opinion and other countries’ views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0974928413489467">Cooper 2009</xref>). However, this point is debateable. The US always pursued the policy of its interest; examples are the Nixon shock and Reaganomics advocacy. While the US in the past managed to delay and reflect pressure for international adjustment and even got other countries to adjust (examples are Plaza and Louvre accords), this was partly due to it reserve currency status and partly due to the size of its economy and its importance as export market to other countries—which were more concerned about their competitiveness, growth and monetary stability than about the potential financial losses on their dollar holdings. The most important concern is a ‘fall from grace’, that is, the painful economic and financial adjustment that takes place when a reserve currency declines. Under the fixed exchange rates, economic policies will be heavily constrained, as the country has to absorb the monetary ‘overhang’. The risk of a run on the currency may also become considerable. Under flexible exchange rates, however, it is likely to be somewhat less of a problem. Similarly, an RCC runs the risk of greater instability of demand for money. This perceived risk made the German and Japanese authorities reluctant to push for a greater international role for their currencies in the 1980s (for potential advantages and disadvantages see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0974928413489467">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications for China</title>
<p>Yuan as a reserve currency would confer benefits on China. It would boost seigniorage revenue, and would enable China to finance its debt more cheaply. It might have only a limited effect on China’s ability to resist international pressure for economic adjustment, which is already considerable. China’s ability to deflect international pressure will be largely a function of economic size and financial prowess. The larger its economy and the less dependent it becomes on foreign trade, the less vulnerable it becomes to protectionist threats. On the other side, increased foreign yuan reserve holdings may constrain the policy flexibility of other countries, similar to the way in which China’s dollar holdings and dependence on the US market are constraining it now. Moreover, China would benefit from more efficient financial markets, even though efficient capital markets are also a precondition for reserve currency status, and Chinese corporate and banks are likely to become internationally more competitive. However, it is indeed difficult to quantify the gains, that is, particularly in the short run.</p>
<p>What will be the impact of yuan on the US once it becomes a part of the reserve currency? Its privilege of issuing dominant currency would diminish. The US may have to ‘mop up’ excess dollar liquidity in the event that official reserve holders actively sell down dollar reserves to refrain from increasing dollar holdings. Even under the floating exchange regimes, this may lead to sustained monetary weakness and constrain macroeconomic policy flexibility. The US may increasingly have to resort to issuing non-dollar-denominated debt in order to finance its deficits and more binding balance of payments constraint would limit the US capacity to run large external deficits. The US may have to raise taxes or curtail expenditure instead of relying on free or low-cost foreign funding. The US economic policy flexibility would diminish sharply. If the yuan emerges as a reserve currency rivalling the US dollar, China will become more powerful and the US less powerful in the international economic and financial affairs, particularly given the divergent net financial positions and China’s great economic size. However, the factor that will do most to alter the balance of power will be China’s declining dependence on the US market or conversely the US’s relatively increasing dependence on the Chinese market.</p>
<p>The emergence of the yuan as a major reserve currency will reflect the underlying shift in economic and financial power, even if it does, independently, provide tangible benefits to China. China’s diminished dependence on the US as an export market coupled with exchange rate flexibility will enhance China’s position vis-à-vis the US. Significantly, the US will face greater constraints in terms of financing its balance of payments deficit. This will be compounded by China’s declining relative dependence on the US market, allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility as to whether and under what conditions to extend credit to the US. China will gain a degree of control over how hard or how soft the US balance of payments constraint will be, potentially influencing the US economic and financial flexibility. This will likely have ramifications for the US’s political position in the world.</p>

<title>How Will the System Evolve</title>
<p>The current trends suggest that China’s financial system will evolve in the direction of the more liberalised and market-oriented manner. How quickly and to what extent will that occur is a big question. China’s growing external imbalances suggest that pressure is building on three key policy variables, namely, trade surplus, capital outflows and investment abroad by SOEs, and yuan appreciation. So far these are carefully managed. Yuan appreciation has gathered steam; the surplus has declined due to high commodity import prices. The expansion of the yuan’s international role is slowly unfolding. However, China is unlikely to accede to major changes in the exchange regime, nor implement widespread liberalisation of the financial system, in response to foreign pressures. However, changes may occur by the end of 2015. The growing policy emphasis on rebalancing the growth impetus to more reliance on domestic demand will take time. A partial list of required reform would include:

<p>These measures have benefited Chinese companies: (a) less exposures to foreign exchange rate movement and reduced foreign exchange risk; (b) mitigates currency mismatches between revenues and costs; (c) lowers domestic costs of capital raising and transaction; (d) access to cheap yuan-denominated loans from abroad; and (e) easier cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) by Chinese companies. Similarly, the global companies trading with Mainland China enterprises benefited by: (a) less exposure to exchange rate fluctuations of US dollar and euro; (b) ability to hold yuan as a store of value; (c) ability to sell yuan and expand customer base; and (d) access to yuan-denominated loans from Chinese banks and access to Chinese investors in general. These measures have considerably expanded the scope of internationalising the yuan.</p>

<sec id="section8-0974928413489467" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The greater flexibility of yuan and further move to relax capital controls will help encourage some international use of the currency. Relaxing capital controls on banks’ foreign currency operations without strengthening regulation and putting state-owned banks on fully commercial footing would be inviting trouble. Exchange rate flexibility in context where banks were allowed to take on large foreign currency exposure would open the door to the same problems as faced by the emerging Asian market economies in 1997–1998. Therefore, it may be wise to plan liberalisation gradually. Experience shows that a strong balance of payments and pressure for exchange rate appreciation are the ideal time for moving away from a fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rate regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0974928413489467">Eichengreen, Masson, Savastano and Sharma 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In the mean time, liberalisation measures are on and it may lead to increasing international use in invoicing and expansion of foreign holdings of the yuan. But substantial use of the yuan as a store of value would require a major development of deep and liquid yuan security markets in China. China needs to face the issue of whether actually to encourage the international use of its currency. The advantages of doing so include potentially lower borrowing costs and international seigniorage and perhaps greater international prestige. The disadvantages come from potential loss of monetary control and dangers of being under the influence of foreign investors. So far, furthering the international use of the yuan is contemplated as a policy objective. And, they are taking cautious steps. It may take 5–10 years before the currency assumes the multi-faceted role of an international currency. The functions include widespread use of trade invoicing, foreign exchange reserves and use as major vehicle for foreign exchange transactions. The geopolitical influence does count in enhancing attractiveness of the yuan as a store of value internationally. There is a doubt whether China’s political regime can ever accept the market-friendly policies. The contemporary international situation may compel China to accept the reserve currency position.</p>
<p>At the outset, it appears that China may take 10 years to put in place the conditions required for the yuan to emerge as an international reserve currency and become an effective rival to the dollar and the euro. All this depend on China’s future economic size, foreign trade and financial market size. Finally, the rise of the yuan depends upon China’s willingness to push forward with financial markets reform and yuan convertibility. Prerequisites are, by definition, necessary but not sufficient conditions, for even if China makes the yuan fully convertible, creates deep and liquid domestic bond markets, maintains a strong financial position and gains foreign investors confidence through legal–institutional reform, it will need to overcome ‘network externalities’ currently favouring the dollar and the euro. A lot will depend upon the global political situation 10 years from now. Along with the dollar and the euro, the yuan may also remain a major reserve currency. Arvind Subramanian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0974928413489467">2011</xref>) is of the view that the yuan could rival or even overtake the dollar as the primary reserve currency as soon as the early years of the next decade. Whether this happens will depend, to a large extent, on whether China maintains a reasonable amount of growth momentum. Currently, China is in the right direction. How stable such a system would be will hinge on the underlying economic, financial and political dynamics of China.</p>
