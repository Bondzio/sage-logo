<p>“The use of deliberate questions is a critical strategy for getting gifted students to learn about their world in more complex and in-depth ways.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Instructional strategies have always been underestimated for their role in enhancing gifted student learning. As a field, educators of the gifted have supported the idea that students could learn on their own without the direct facilitation of teachers. Even when teachers were encouraged to intervene, it was always with an eye to being a facilitator of learning, not a deliberate strategist in using techniques that might promote it in learners. Thus, we have not taken seriously the models of inquiry necessary to work effectively with the gifted. Yet, there are three reasons that these types of strategies matter in teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The three reasons are,</p>
<list id="list1-1076217511428310" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>To provide content-relevant pedagogy to enhance deep learning</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Schulman and others have cited the role of appropriate content-pedagogy in enhancing student learning. Knowing how to facilitate the research project in science by asking relevant science-related questions or asking the pointed questions in a discussion of <italic>Hamlet</italic> about the theme of filial duty both constitute the effective use of such pedagogical approaches.</p>
<list id="list2-1076217511428310" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>To scaffold learning for gifted students to promote automaticity</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Deliberate use of questioning strategies can help gifted learners understand what is necessary to use in their own learning as they attempt independent projects and other forms of autonomous learning. Questioning, for example, can enable the gifted to understand how to elevate their own learning in similar ways through asking questions that require analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and creation.</p>
<list id="list3-1076217511428310" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>To elevate thinking and problem solving</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Higher level questioning serves long-term ends to promote lifelong learning. By exposing students to models and approaches that can be internalized and transferred to new learning situations, students become more ready to tackle new problem scenarios with confidence in their ability to think and problem solve via the asking of relevant questions that move a problem forward.</p>
<p>While higher level inquiry processes are effective with all learners, the research in gifted education suggests they are crucial for promoting learning in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217511428310">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Brown, 2007</xref>). One of these inquiry approaches is the use of questions as a deliberate strategy to promote thinking of different types and levels. It is a strategy that calls for teachers to develop and organize questions into clusters to elevate thinking. Some questioning models are hierarchal in orientation, moving students from lower to higher level thinking. Others are more circular, moving from one higher level question to another, often not bothering to use lower order questions as a bridge. Other models deliberately exploit different kinds of thinking, moving from convergent to divergent to evaluative.</p>
<p>One model that combines a hierarchal approach and different types of thinking is the following, based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511428310">J. P. Guilford (1967)</xref>:</p>
<list id="list4-1076217511428310" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Cognition (What is the name of the nuclear plant in Japan that was compromised by the tsunami?)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Convergence (What factors accounted for the series of explosions that rocked the plant?)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Divergence (If you were a worker assigned to the plant, how would you react to the crisis?)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Evaluative (In your opinion, should nuclear energy be promoted as an energy source, given its demonstrated danger? Why or why not?)</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The use of Bloom’s taxonomy in its newest reiteration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511428310">Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2000</xref>) is also a common tool to enhance student learning from lower to higher levels.</p>
<list id="list5-1076217511428310" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Remember (What is the plot of <italic>Hamlet?</italic>)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Understand (What does the plot contribute to our understanding of the play?)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Apply (How does Hamlet apply his hatred of his uncle in the play?)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Analyze (What comparisons may be drawn between Ophelia and Hamlet?)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Evaluate (What is your assessment of Hamlet’s delay in killing his uncle? What would have happened if he had done it earlier in the play?)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Create (What is a different scenario that could be written to make Hamlet a more likable character?)</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>There are also questions that provide organizing strength to curriculum development work because of their underlying connection to concepts that we want students to learn. Essential questions provide that service. Typically few in number, they set the stage for learning activities to follow that allow students to uncover the answers to these powerful questions. Thus, a unit on power, for example, might ask as essential questions,</p>
<list id="list6-1076217511428310" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>What is the concept of power at work in the world?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How may we see it as promoting good or evil?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What is the impact of power on people?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>From these questions, then, a unit of study might be developed that focused on the use of power in Shakespearean tragedy, the power of nature, or governmental use and abuse of power. The questions provide the frame for further definition of conceptual learning.</p>
<p>Finally, questions can be constructed that promote interpretative inquiry into a phenomenon without the use of a deliberate model. Our interest in weather patterns, for example, might lead us to question several aspects of what we do not understand through pointed questions that get at the unknown:</p>
<list id="list7-1076217511428310" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>What causes hurricanes to become more or less intense as they travel?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Why do hurricanes change course?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What prevention methods are most effective and why?</p>
</list-item>
</list>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The use of deliberate questions is a critical strategy for getting gifted students to learn about their world in more complex and in-depth ways. It provides multiple pathways for challenging the gifted through their content learning. It enhances their thinking by deliberately focusing attention on issues and problems that require solution in the real world. Questions can be improved by using a model for construction as models provide the scaffold for specific types of thinking.</p>
<p>Question-asking by teachers, however, is an art as well as a science. The late Mortimer Adler used to opine that one good question could carry a seminar for an hour. So it is not the number of questions that matter, but the having of good questions from which you as a teacher want to learn and that elevates and enhances the learning process for students.</p>
