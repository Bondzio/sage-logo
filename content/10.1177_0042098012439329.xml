<p>When writing a review of a book first published over 35 years ago, the most obvious question to ask is one about its contemporary relevance. <italic>A Seventh Man</italic> by John Berger and Jean Mohr has not only retained its significance, but also, as the authors suggest, grown younger over the years. The work offers a contextualised narrative of a migrant guest worker’s journey to his contract site in western Europe and back in 1970s. We accompany him on a bus from his home village, at the recruitment centre, the train station in a metropolis, the barracks where he lodges and at the construction site where he works. The steps of this journey are explained through a Marxist analysis of the global economy, suggesting that guest labourers became a new type of working class, underprivileged compared with the indigenous workers. However, rather than providing a dry academic analysis of factors behind international labour migration, the book is a humanised account of how people’s aspirations and hopes are integrated into the workings of international markets. This account of interaction between individual agency and global economic structures make the volume a timeless read.</p>
<p>Berger and Mohr combine several narrative strategies to engage their audience emotionally: poetry, individualised descriptive vignettes, shocking statistics, personal accounts and, most importantly, evocative images. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012439329">John Collier Jr (1975)</xref> said: “The value of the camera record is its literacy, which allows diverse people to extract a significant level of information from photograph or film”. Mohr’s photographs allow audiences across time to identify emotionally and factually significant information. Take the images of young men being subjected to medical testing before entering their destination countries (pp. 50–60). The host countries made sure they were getting a physically fit labour force by performing routine blood and urine tests, as well as tests of mental capacities and skill levels. The pictures, while taken in 1970s, have an enduring relevance—they could have been taken on Ellis Island a hundred years ago or currently in the office of a US doctor offering an “immigration medical exam” for green card applicants. The men’s anxiety, the medical instruments inserted under the skin, the scrutiny of the objectifying gaze: all point out the material and embodied nature of the international movement of people.</p>
<p>The book’s focus on the body and the physical experience of work, in which migrant men become one with the machines they operate, resonates with contemporary feminist accounts of women working the assembly lines in Mexican <italic>maquiladoras</italic>, or Dominican seamstresses labouring in the sweatshops of New York City. What sets the book apart from most contemporary analysis is its exclusive and henceforward reductionist Marxist lens. When describing the migrants’ home countries, the authors make a Trotskyist claim: “Without the example of a revolutionary party the economic and social relations which maintain and create rural poverty appear to be unchangeable” (p. 37). Despite their humanist portrayal of migrant workers, Berger and Mohr seem to view them as helpless victims of global capitalism, deprived of any means of exerting agency. As a result, the main characters of the narrative—migrant men—are frequently reduced to becoming symbolic representations of abuse and exploitation. Their actions, dreams and political aspirations are presented as irrelevant and insignificant for the functioning of the global economy. Yet, the fact that most migrants managed to stay and settle in Germany and were not sent back as expected at the time Berger wrote, is an example of the victory of human ingenuity over the vast socioeconomic forces.</p>
<p>Audiences interested in urban environments will find the book rich with enlightening perspectives on migrant experiences of the city. Cities are currently the primary destination for migrants: they provide employment opportunities and ethnic support networks. Yet, the literature on how newly arrived migrants experience cities is surprisingly scarce. Berger and Mohr view the metropolis as the rural migrants’ primary destination, an unknown land where new rules of social conduct have to be learnt. The authors’ insistence on the dichotomy between the country and the city is reminiscent of the early Chicago School of sociology and the opposition between the rural <italic>gemeinschaft</italic> and urban <italic>gesellschaft</italic>. They write</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>sometimes something happens on an ordinary day in a village which never happens in a city … A man or a woman acts altruistically. A spontaneous action, quite uncalculated. … In the metropolis, no action can be completed in this way (p. 94).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Regardless of whether we agree with such a disillusioned portrayal of urbanity, it provides a challenging opening to research on the migrant experience of the city.</p>
<p>Contemporary scholars of migration will be surprised by the absence of women from the main narrative—an absence which would not currently be acceptable, given the increasing feminisation of migration streams. The book reflects the situation from 40 years ago, when men preceded women in their migration to western Europe. The authors present women as those who stay behind and await the return of male family members. Women passively look at the reader from the pages of photographs: a Greek peasant girl; three grandmothers, their heads covered with shawls; a young woman seated by a new TV set bought with remittance money. Yet, looking at them from the perspective of 40 years later, we realise that these women did not stay behind, but joined the vast streams of labour migrants. Whether one reads this shift as an expression of women’s agency, or as a triumph of global economy, depends on one’s ontological leanings.</p>
<p>Today, the relations between migrants and native-born populations have acquired a new quality of intensity and intimacy. Migrants are no longer as exotic and, essentially, as strange, as they were in 1970s western Europe. They have become an integral part of the European visual landscape and everyday interactions. This book captures the moment when, in post-war Europe, labour migration was still a new phenomenon, conceptualised as temporary, guest work. It offers us a glimpse of how people viewed migrants before they became a permanent reality of 21st-century Europe.</p>
