<abstract>
<p>Students in Bedouin schools in Israel completed a survey in which they indicated how frequent abusive teacher behaviors occurred in their classrooms; responses indicated that abusive teacher behaviors occur often. Female students tended to register higher levels of punitive teacher behaviors than male students and secondary school students tended to register higher levels of punitive teacher behaviors than elementary school students. Also, the perceived frequencies of abusive teacher behaviors presented in this study tended to be significantly higher than perceived frequencies of similar teacher behaviors reported in a comparable 1997 study. This problem of school violence deserves attention and resolution.</p>

<body>
<p>A problem faced by school psychologists in many countries is violence in its various forms (e.g., parental violence against children in India; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034312453388">Deb &amp; Walsh, 2012</xref>; community violence against children in child-headed households in South Africa; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034312453388">Pillay, 2012</xref>). A prominent form of violence in the Bedouin schools in Israel is the abuse of students by teachers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034312453388">Elbedour, Assor, Center, and Maruyama (1997)</xref> provided evidence of this deplorable condition. In their study, 1,170 Bedouin students in Israel completed a questionnaire composed of 29 items that measured physical and psychological punishment in school settings.</p>
<p>For each item, a respondent was asked to indicate the frequency of occurrence of specific teacher behavior manifested in response to challenging behaviors of students (from <italic>never</italic> to <italic>always</italic>). Of the 29 items, eight of them assessed the frequency of physical punishment behaviors, 19 assessed frequency of psychological punishment behaviors, and the two remaining items were unclassified. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034312453388">Elbedour et al. (1997)</xref> reported that two-in-three of the participating students had witnessed physical abuse in the classroom and that 95% of those students witnessed at least some psychological and physical punishment. Students frequently cited the following forms of physical abuse by teachers: Slapping (47%); kicking or hitting (34%); twisting ears (34%); and grabbing or pushing (30%). Students also mentioned the following forms of psychological abuse by teachers: Shouting (61%); sulking (44%); and refusing to grant permission to use the restroom (43%) in response to challenging classroom behavior.</p>
<p>Psychological and physical abuse by teachers can have deleterious consequences for students. Such abusive behavior toward students acts as violence against them and violence against students can lead to problematic outcomes for students such as poor self-esteem, low academic achievement, and even dropping out of school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034312453388">Browne &amp;Finkelhor, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034312453388">Kaufman &amp; Cicchetti, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034312453388">McGee &amp; Wolf, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143034312453388">Melton &amp; Flood, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the consistency of teacher abuse against students in the Bedouin schools in Israel over time by comparing the patterns of teacher abusive behavior cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034312453388">Elbedour et al. (1997)</xref> with patterns of teacher abusive behavior identified in this report.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0143034312453388" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample of participants in the present study consisted of 1,592 students (920 male, 672 female). The mean age for the males was 13.07 years with a SD of 2.19 years. The mean age for the females was 13.29 years with a SD of 2.23 years.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0143034312453388"><title>Perceptions of Teacher Attitudes and Behaviors (PTAB)</title>
<p>The PTAB is a 29-item questionnaire developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034312453388">Elbedour et al. (1997)</xref> for use with school-aged children. Written in the Arabic language, it is a widely used instrument in studying the Bedouin Arab and other ethnic communities in Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034312453388">Elbedour et al., 1997</xref>). There were nine items assessing physical abuse and 20 items assessing psychological abuse.</p>
<p>In completing the questionnaire (average time, 15 minutes), respondents indicated the frequency of a specific teacher behavior in response to disruptive students (e.g., yells at them, pulls their ears). Responses to the items in the PTAB received the following scores: (a) 1 = <italic>neve</italic>r; 2 = <italic>sometimes</italic>; 3 = <italic>frequently</italic>; 4 = <italic>always</italic>. The PTAB reported in the 1997 study had five options per item; whereas, the PTAB used for this study was simplified by providing four options per item. The item-options <italic>occasionally</italic> and <italic>sometimes</italic> from the 1997 version of the PTAB were merged into 2 = <italic>sometimes</italic> for this study. Two items in the original version of the PTAB were excluded from the newer version of the PTAB, because of psychometric weaknesses. Additionally, each of two other items in the original version of the PTAB was subdivided to make two items to increase psychometric precision. As a result, the newer version of the PTAB had 29 items, as did the older version.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034312453388">Elbedour et al. (1997)</xref> reported a reliability of the PATB with Cronbach alpha values of 0.92 for the 29-item <italic>total scale</italic>; 0.89 for the <italic>physical punishment</italic> subscale; and 0.86 for the <italic>psychological punishment</italic> subscale. Elbedour et al. also reported a measure of face-validity in that experts tended to place the items into the same categories, physical punishment and psychological punishment, as were indicated in the test.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0143034312453388"><title>Demographic characteristics of student questionnaire</title>
<p>This student questionnaire has four items relating to the following demographic characteristics: Age, gender, current school setting, and grade level (elementary school, 5th through 8th grade; high school, 9th through 12th grade). Responses provided demographic information about the sample.</p>

</table-wrap></p>
<p>Item means in excess of 3 indicate punitive teacher behaviors that occur <italic>often</italic>. Using that cutoff value, the means for seven of the nine physical punishment items indicated that the related punitive teacher behaviors frequently occurred in the schools. The teachers often throw objects at students (3.22), grab or push students (3.09), pull student’s hair (3.37), grab or twist student wrists (3.06), tell students to stand on one foot (3.38), tell their students to hold their hands up for a long time (3.48), and pull or twist a student’s ear (3.05). These results imply that teachers in Bedouin schools in Israel frequently engage in a wide array of physical punishments directed at their students.</p>
<p>Using that same cutoff value, the means for six of the 20 psychological punishment items indicated that the related punitive teacher behaviors <italic>frequently occurred</italic> in the schools. The teachers often give students detention at recess (3.38), give students detention after school (3.56), tell students to stand outside in the rain or heat (3.29), tell students to do extra writing (3.11), ask students to memorize as a punishment (3.20), and send students home early (3.16). These results further imply that teachers in Bedouin schools in Israel frequently engage in an array of psychological punishments directed toward their students. Most of the item responses (73.2%) were coded as either ‘3’ or ‘4’. That finding suggests that student participants contend that the various forms of physical or psychological punishment occurred often in their respective Bedouin schools.</p>
<p>The fourth column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034312453388">Table 1</xref> provides the percentages of students who responded <italic>sometimes</italic>, <italic>frequently</italic>, or <italic>always</italic> to the 1997 version of the PATB. Those proportions are clearly more inclusive than the data reported in this current study, because the entries in the fourth column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034312453388">Table 1</xref> include <italic>sometimes</italic> responses and the entries in the third column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034312453388">Table 1</xref> do not include those responses. As a result, one would expect that the percentages cited in the third column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034312453388">Table 1</xref> would be uniformly lower than the corresponding percentages cited in the fourth column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034312453388">Table 1</xref>. Yet, the percentages of students who responded either <italic>frequently</italic> or <italic>always</italic> for this study exceeded the corresponding percentages of students who responded at least <italic>sometimes</italic> for the 1997 study for 28 of the 29 items. One may infer that frequencies of abusive behavior by teachers in Bedouin schools in Israel have increased since 1997; only the frequency of teacher shouting at students has seemed to decline.</p>
<p>The newer version of the PTAB had some noteworthy psychometric properties. The correlation of the total of the item scores for the nine physical punishment items with the total of the 20 psychological punishment items was 0.78; lending support to the notion that teachers’ physical punishment is highly related to their psychological punishment. A principal components analysis of the PTAB item scores was completed with principal components being determined only for eigenvalues greater than or equal to one. The resulting principal components structure had four principal components accounting for 53.9% of the total item variance. The first principal component had an eigenvalue of 11.44 that accounted for 39.46% of the total item variance—implying that there is a large general principal component underlying the 29 PTAB items. Another data analysis was a series of univariate two-way analyses of variance with the dependent variable in each analysis being the item scores for a PTAB item and the factors being gender (male and female) and school level (elementary school and secondary school). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143034312453388">Table 2</xref> provides the statistics for those univariate analyses, including partial eta squared (<inline-formula id="ilm1-0143034312453388"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0143034312453388"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>p</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) values as measures of effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034312453388">Cohen, 1973</xref>). For 28 of 29 PTAB items, there was a significant main effect for gender with the female group registering significantly higher means than the male group. For 21 of the 29 PTAB items, there was a significant main effect for school level with the secondary school group registering significantly higher means than the elementary school group. Those results need to be tempered, because most of the effect size values were small or moderate with partial eta squared values being less than 0.06. However, several significant main effects are noteworthy. There was a significant main effect for school level for the slap item with a substantial effect size of 0.070. There was also a significant main effect for school level for the stand on one foot item with a substantial effect size of 0.071. More noteworthy is the significant main effect for school level for the stand in the corner item with a large effect size of 0.117. These findings lend support to the contention that teachers in Bedouin secondary schools regularly punish misbehaving students with these indignities.

<p>Two multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) provided supporting evidence that gender and school level are significant factors. In the first MANOVA, the PATB item scores were the dependent variables. There were main effects for both gender and school level with Hotelling Trace = 0.10, <italic>F</italic>(29, 1560) = 5.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for the gender factor and Hotelling Trace = 0.49, <italic>F</italic>(29, 1560) = 26.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 for the school level factor. In the second MANOVA, the sum of the nine physical punishment PATB item scores and the sum of the 20 psychological punishment PATB item scores served as the two dependent variables. Again there were main effects for both gender and school level with Hotelling Trace = 0.046, <italic>F</italic>(2, 1587) = 36.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for the gender factor and Hotelling Trace = 0.07, <italic>F</italic>(2, 1587) = 51.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for the school level factor. With both MANOVAs, the female group registered a vector of means greater than the vector of means for the male group. Also, the secondary school group registered a vector of means greater than the vector of means for the elementary school group for both MANOVAs.</p>

<p>This study provides evidence that students experience physical and psychological punishments from their teachers at a rate that continues to be a serious problem in Bedouin schools in the State of Israel. The responses of students in Bedouin schools indicate that the frequencies of abusive teacher behaviors toward students were greater, in general, to comparable frequencies cited in a 1997 study. Female students tend to register higher levels of abusive teacher behaviors than do male students, and secondary school students tend to register higher levels of abusive teacher behaviors than elementary school students. This climate of school violence entails not only teacher violence toward students and student violence toward students, but also student violence toward teachers. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034312453388">Zeira, Astor, and Benbenishty (2004)</xref> reported that 9.1% of Arab teachers, many of whom were Bedouin, were threatened with physical violence by their students.</p>
<p>Another finding of the current study is that the perceived incidence of abusive teacher behaviors that are physical in nature is highly correlated with the perceived incidence of abusive teacher behaviors that are psychological in nature. Such abusive teacher behaviors are likely incompatible with the healthy psychological and educational development of students.</p>
<p>A number of micro and macro risk factors predispose violence in Bedouin schools and the Bedouin community, surpassing even anxiety provoked by the political violence. For example, students who belong to tribes with lower social status are more likely to experience higher rates of victimization. In addition, polygamous marriages marked by male dominance over women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034312453388">Abu-Rabia, Elbedour, &amp; Scham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034312453388">Al-Krenawi &amp; Graham, 1999</xref>) and the patriarchal family structure commonplace in the Bedouin community reinforce obedience without questioning the parental or teacher authority figure and contribute to the climate of school violence. Furthermore, it is not surprising that tensions on the macro-level (Israeli-Palestinian conflict) find their way into schools. As a result of the political conflict, children come to see violence as the norm and believe that the way to deal with conflict is through hostility, aggression, and violence.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the problem of crushing poverty in the Bedouin community. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034312453388">Abu-Bader and Gottlieb (2008)</xref>, the rate of poverty in non-recognized Bedouin village reaches 80% (more specifically, it is seven times higher than the poverty rate reported for the mainstream Jewish population in Israel; excluding the predominantly poor Jewish ultra-orthodox society). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034312453388">Landsman (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034312453388">Thein (2007)</xref> also attested to the debilitating condition of poverty among Bedouin students in their respective reports on the challenges faced in providing psychological services to Bedouin students, who often travel to school in bare feet and who often do not have access to running water in their homes.</p>
<p>With 65% of the population living beneath the poverty line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034312453388">Rouhana &amp; Ghanem, 1998</xref>), the Bedouin find themselves at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder among all Israeli citizens. Such a high concentration of poverty likely contributes to an increase in social problems including community and school violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034312453388">Rosenblum, Goldblatt, and Moin (1999)</xref> also found for Israeli immigrant high school students, in particular Ethiopian immigrants, that poverty has deleterious consequences such as high dropout rates, higher levels of stress, and lower levels of cognitive performance. Quite different from efforts at incorporating marginal populations into the mainstream in Western countries (e.g., Inuit in Canada—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034312453388">Burack, et al., 2013</xref>; Native Americans in the USA—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034312453388">Fryberg, Covarrubias, &amp; Barack, 2013</xref>; Maori in New Zealand—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034312453388">Little, Akin-Little &amp; Johansen, 2013</xref>; Aboriginals in Australia—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034312453388">Yeung, Craven, &amp; Ali, 2013</xref>) the marginal Bedouin population are not systematically incorporated into the institutions of Israeli society. The Bedouin population aspires to be incorporated into the mainstream but remains excluded by a body of law controlled by members of the dominant community. The children are caught between a system into which their families have been transplanted and a traditional culture which is neither prescribed nor protected by the new environment.</p>
<p>Finally, the curriculum in Bedouin schools places heavy emphasis on pedagogy and less on mental and emotional well-being of the children. As a result, that curriculum likely limits the level of school peace and perpetuates cycles of violence in the schools from generation-to-generation. In addition, overcrowded classrooms and the paucity of mental health professionals in the Bedouin schools likely contribute to the disruptive educational environments in the schools.</p>
<p>The chronic condition of abusive teacher behaviors toward students in Bedouin schools in Israel warrants substantial scientific inquiry. Interventions then need to be designed and implemented to resolve this condition for the benefit of students served in Bedouin schools (and hopefully other students facing similar plights elsewhere in the world).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0143034312453388"><title>Implications for school psychologists</title>
<p>One implication for school psychologists is that school psychologists serving the Bedouin Arab community should design and implement interventions intended to promote positive behavior among students and teachers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034312453388">Lewis &amp; Garrison-Harrell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034312453388">Safran &amp; Oswald, 2003</xref>). To build prevention or intervention programs, school psychologists must respect the traditional values ​​of the family hierarchy (for a parallel in Kenya, see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034312453388">Lasser, Fite, &amp; Wandende, 2011</xref>). The father is considered the central figure in the family and it would likely be a serious error for any school psychologist to undermine the authority of the father in the Bedouin family. In order to build and maintain an alliance with the family, the school psychologist must establish rapport with the head of the household.</p>
<p>Culturally competent practice requires that school psychologists are aware of and understand the family honor-code of behavior and gender roles that can affect the delivery of prevention programs. For instance, working with families surrounding the issue of school violence against students requires the school psychologist to direct attention to the man (as head of the household) and less to the woman because of cultural mores, family honor-code, and religious beliefs. To be specific, culturally sensitive practice would dictate that eye contact with the mother should be avoided when addressing the family.</p>
<p>In efforts to modify behavior, school psychologists should raise the awareness of the negative stigma associated with methods of discipline such as shame and criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034312453388">Haboush, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, school psychologists should introduce parents to methods of behavioral change that will decrease the frequency of tension and conflict between student and teachers and among students.</p>
<p>In addition, school psychologists should consult and collaborate with religious leaders and ask them to speak about the ills of violence during religious meetings and other community gatherings over which they may preside—particularly on Fridays where both teachers and parents are attending Jumah, the Islamic congregational prayer. The Imam and religious leaders can incorporate verses from the Quran or a Hadith (i.e., a saying typically attibuted to the Prophet Muhammad) that enhance positive methods of conflict resolution and youth development with emphasis on caring, sharing, and peace-making rather than traditional coercive methods of control and disciplining. Religious leaders can empower the school psychologist and improve the image of the school psychologist; that is, one typically associated with mental health and sickness to one that is preventive and solution-oriented. Intervention must be sensitive to both the religious and familial environments and not lead to conflicts between these forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034312453388">Hanna &amp; Green, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, building alliances with religious institutions and families can promote positive relations with the school psychologist who is often stigmatized as a ‘Western doctor.’ To illustrate, in Western culture, one should typically refuse food and drink if visiting a family to maintain objectivity; whereas, in the Bedouin traditional community, sharing food and drinks is essential to building rapport and trust with the school psychologist.</p>
<p>In addition, the school psychologist serving the Bedouin community should refrain from stigmatizing the community. As a marginalized/minority group in Israel, this community is already characterized by lower social class, fewer economic resources, polygamous marital structure, strict family honor-codes, a cultural heritage that emphasize collectivity over individualism, and a tribal structure marked by male dominance. Any school psychologist providing culturally responsive services to Bedouin students and their parents should be very sensitive to these unique Bedouin family features and values.</p>
<p>This study clearly indicates that Bedouin schools place children at higher risk of psychological and physical maltreatment. The concept of resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034312453388">Masten, 2001</xref>), the capacity to cope with adversity and stress, is particularly relevant when considering the implications of this study for school psychologists. One task for school psychologists serving Bedouin schools in Israel and elsewhere is to foster resilience and to enhance social competence among students by promoting school environments ‘that actively foster warm relationships, encourage participation, and provide clarity about boundaries, rules, and expectations.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034312453388">Toland &amp; Carrigan, 2011</xref>, p. 100; see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034312453388">Theron &amp; Donald, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Implications for school psychologists wishing to foster resilience, specific to the Bedouin context, are to be sensitive to the family structure and the religious environment and collaborate with the family and the religious leadership in promoting peaceful conflict resolution so as to lessen school-related violence and foster students’ resilience. The view that resilience-promoting conditions may vary across social-political contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034312453388">Theron &amp; Donald, 2012</xref>) seems more reasonable than the position that such conditions are invariant across socio-cultural contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034312453388">Toland &amp; Carrigan, 2011</xref>).</p>
