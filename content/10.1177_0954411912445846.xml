<abstract>
<p>The wrist is the most complex joint for virtual three-dimensional simulations, and the complexity is even more pronounced when dealing with skeletal disorders of the joint such, as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In order to analyse the biomechanical difference between healthy and diseased joints, three-dimensional models of these two wrist conditions were developed from computed tomography images. These images consist of eight carpal bones, five metacarpal bones, the distal radius and ulna. The cartilages were developed based on the shape of the available articulations and ligaments were simulated via mechanical links. The RA model was developed accurately by simulating all ten common criteria of the disease related to the wrist. Results from the finite element (FE) analyses showed that the RA model produced three times higher contact pressure at the articulations compared to the healthy model. Normal physiological load transfer also changed from predominantly through the radial side to an increased load transfer approximately 5% towards the ulnar. Based on an extensive literature search, this is the first ever reported work that simulates the pathological conditions of the rheumatoid arthritis of the wrist joint.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The wrist joint is involved in virtually every human functional activity and, as such, is exposed to high number of traumatic injuries, primary osteoarthritis and secondary degenerative disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912445846">1</xref></sup> One of the most common skeletal diseases that is always associated with the wrist joint is rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912445846">2</xref></sup> Even though other joints such as the hip and knee can also be affected by RA, the most commonly affected joint is the wrist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912445846">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general, there are three main symptoms of the wrist affected by RA: cartilage destruction, synovial proliferation and ligamentous laxity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912445846">3</xref></sup> Damage to the cartilage, such as thinning, occurred due to cytochemical effects resulting in degradation and inhibition of new cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912445846">4</xref></sup> Bone erosion due to the synovial proliferation may cause sharp bony edges which might lead to tendon rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912445846">3</xref></sup> The laxity of the ligaments caused by the synovial expansion will result in altered physiological bone translation and displacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912445846">5</xref></sup> Occurring concurrently, these changes will lead to biomechanical imbalances that ultimately result in visible deformity of the wrist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912445846">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Understanding the pathomechanics and the possible course of RA is important as cases tend to be patient specific.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912445846">3</xref></sup> This can be deduced from previous clinical studies where treatment for severe RA, such as total wrist arthroplasty, was not as successful as replacements for other joints such as the hip and knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912445846">6</xref></sup> One of the reasons for this is the difficulty of thoroughly analysing the behaviour of the disease due to its complexity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912445846">7</xref></sup> Simulating such a complex system is extremely challenging and thus has received little attention. A detailed insight of the arthritic wrist and its associated cause could be explored through biomechanical three-dimensional finite element (FE) analyses. These techniques have been widely used to analyse load transmission on relatively less complex human joints such as the hip and knee,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912445846">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912445846">9</xref></sup> and has been accepted by medical researchers as one of the important assistive tools in surgical planning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912445846">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912445846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912445846"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912445846">13</xref></sup> Even though this method has been used for simulation of various human joints, the amount of literature related to the wrist is fairly limited with most reports on the three-dimensional model development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912445846">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912445846">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912445846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912445846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912445846"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912445846">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study aimed to investigate the biomechanical behaviour of a rheumatic wrist using FE analysis, with a healthy wrist model used as a control. A simulation of such a complex system was performed using ten major characteristics of Type IIIa RA wrist: a pathological type suitable for arthroplasty. Load transmission and contact pressure at the articulations are important issues to address where results were compared with other clinical and numerical published reports. This study provides further insights into the complex biomechanical behaviour of the diseased wrist through computer simulation which could be useful for the development of implants to replace type IIIa RA wrist.</p>

<title>Geometry</title>
<p>A three-dimensional (3D) model of the wrist joint was reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) images of a healthy asymptomatic male (53 year old volunteer) with no radiological signs of pathology. The scans were taken from the whole upper limb of a healthy human body in extended (33.11°) and deviated (17.34° ulnar) wrist position, measured relative to anatomically based radial coordinate system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912445846">19</xref></sup> The radiograph images of the wrist, ranging from the distal end of the long bones of the left forearm (radius and ulna) to the proximal third of the metacarpals, were then cropped. The total length of the scans was 102.3 mm with a resolution of 0.98 mm in plane and the slice thickness was 1.5 mm. Semi-automatic segmentation was performed using Mimics software (Materialise, Belgium) on each CT image to select the cortical region. The inner surface of this region was then used as the outer layer for the cancellous bone. The 3D models of the wrist were constructed using AMIRA software (Mercury Computer Systems, Inc., San Diego, USA) where an automatic compilation through the software’s marching cubes algorithm was applied, which generates a 3D triangular surface mesh. The ratio of twice the radius of the inscribed circle to the radius of the ascribed circle of the triangle was used as the normalised indicator to determine the mesh quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912445846">20</xref></sup> The value was set at 0.4 to produce a high quality of surface mesh.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912445846">17</xref></sup> Additionally, an average element size of 0.4 mm was chosen which resulted in an accurate geometric description of the bone geometry which has been compared and considered acceptable according to an anatomy software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912445846">21</xref></sup> Boolean operations were performed in order to check for any intersecting bodies. Marc.Mentat (MSC.Software, Santa Ana, USA) software was used to convert the completed model to 3D solid linear first-order tetrahedral elements. This resulted in a FE model of the healthy wrist consisting of 828,888 elements and 204,218 nodes.</p>
<p>Cartilage layers in the articulations between the solid geometry were modelled by manually identifying the articulating surfaces between bones. In order to form the cartilage, extracted profiles representing the cartilage distribution surfaces were extruded with a thickness size of half the minimum distance between two bones,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912445846">14</xref></sup> resulting in a good geometrical representation and material distribution of the cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912445846">Figure 1</xref>). The distribution of the cartilage was compared and considered acceptable according to anatomy software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912445846">21</xref></sup></p>

For ligaments where their material properties could not be found in the literature, the properties of the neighbouring ligaments would be used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912445846">15</xref></sup> Parallel multiple links were applied and the number varied according to the distribution of the origin and insertion of the ligaments.</p>

An assessment made on the model quality based on surface element confirming its reliability where the ratio of twice the radius of the inscribed circle to the radius of the ascribed circle of the triangle for 90% of elements was greater than 0.80 (where unity represents an equilateral triangle).</p>
<p>Only the healthy wrist model in this study was compared since there is no reported literature on the RA model that is suitable for direct comparison. Several aspects of stress transfer emphasized in previous studies were in agreement with our study. One of them is the load transmission at the radiocarpal joint which was transferred more to the scaphoid than the lunate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954411912445846">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>In their cadaveric studies, Macleod et al. (2007)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954411912445846">34</xref></sup> reported that 68% of the load at the forearm was transferred through the radius, whilst Gislason et al. (2009)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912445846">15</xref></sup> reported a range between 78.7% to 92.8% in their simulation studies. The two reported studies showed the importance of the radius as the most significant load bearer in the wrist joint. Most of the load for the healthy wrist joint found in this study was transferred radially similar to those reported by Gislason et al. (2010)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912445846">17</xref></sup> and Givissis et al. (2009).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954411912445846">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>The strain magnitudes at the radius were also compared with previous clinical reports. Bosisio et al. (2007)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954411912445846">36</xref></sup> reported an ultimate strain value for the cortical radius to be ε<sub>u</sub> = 1.50% and the yield strain of ε<sub>y</sub> = 0.90%. Another study by Kerin at al. (1998)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411912445846">37</xref></sup> reported a failure strain value of cartilage under compression to be 30%.

<title>Biomechanical effect of symptoms and pathophysiology criteria</title>
<p>The deterioration in mechanical properties of the associated tissues and physiological function of the wrist affected by RA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912445846">2</xref></sup> was prescribed and thus simulate to a certain extent the non-physiological behaviour of the rheumatic wrist. Although ten characteristics were analysed as a whole, the biomechanical behaviour will be discussed separately to ease understanding of such a complex condition.</p>
<p>The osteoporotic RA bones analysed here had 20% lower stresses generated compared to the healthy bones thus indicating less stiffness of the RA bones. Patients suffering from RA tend to underutilize the affected joint due to pain especially for severe cases. Hence, this situation leads to slow generation of the bone cell resulting in bone loss or bone atrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954411912445846">38</xref></sup> The continued loss of bone substance or volume could further worsen the osteoporotic condition of the bone.</p>
<p>The mechanism of RA started with destruction of the soft tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912445846">3</xref></sup> Simulated in this project was the deterioration of the articular cartilage. The simulation of cartilage damage due to chondrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912445846">2</xref></sup> was found to contribute to drastic changes in the mechanical properties of the articulation of the joint. This finding was also supported by Carrigan et al. (2003)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912445846">18</xref></sup> where the material properties of the cartilage had the largest effect on contact pressures at the cartilage surfaces and on compressive stresses within the cartilage layers. In this FE analysis, the cartilages were modelled using hyper-elastic properties to allow large deformation cartilage behaviour. This property functions as a nearly frictionless bearing while uniformly transferring loads on underlying bone preventing high stress concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954411912445846">39</xref></sup> Therefore, the absence of the cartilages resulted in higher stress concentration with high contact pressure generated at the articulation areas. The analysed contact pressure showed that the absence of the cartilage in the RA model resulted in three times higher contact pressure compared to the healthy model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912445846">Figure 5c</xref>).</p>
<p>The high contact pressure was also due to the eroded surfaces of bones with the existence of sharp edges, which can be clearly seen in the RA model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912445846">Figure 6b</xref>). The healthy model, on the other hand, showed a good distribution of stress. These differences occured due to the absence of the cartilage as well as the existence of the sharp edges in the RA model.</p>
<p>In RA, inflammation of the synovial fluid could severely affect the ligaments through stretching or tearing with a potential eventual deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912445846">2</xref></sup> This condition distorts the constraint initially provided by the ligaments and led to the random translation, dislocation, and rotation of the affected bones. This resulted in the dislocation of carpus towards ulnar causing changes in load distribution, where higher load was transmitted through the ulnar side in the RA model (42%) compared to the healthy model (37%). The differences were also due to the hand scoliosis condition, in which the radially rotated metacarpals as prescribed in this study caused the direction of the stresses to move towards the ulnar side. This is due to the highest stress at the first metacarpal located at the lateral side of the wrist joint pushed the bones towards the ulnar.</p>
<p>The higher load transfer to the ulnar side was also due to stage 2 of scapholunate advance collapse (SLAC) with scapholunate dissociation (SLD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912445846">Figures 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912445846">5b</xref>). For the healthy wrist, the contact between the capitate, scaphoid and lunate was considerably uniform, resulting in normal load bearing. However, the RA model had a complete destruction of the radioscaphoid joint with collapse of the articular space due to the weakened and distorted scapholunate ligaments resulting in subluxation of the scaphoid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954411912445846">40</xref></sup> The simulated collapse had clearly illustrated that the capitolunate joint was unable to physiologically sustain the applied load. The abnormal load transfer due to this condition was clearly depicted in our RA model showing high stress concentration at the capitolunate articulation compared to the scapholunate. The capitate no longer has equivalent support at both the scaphoid and lunate, dislocating the dorsal radial portion of distal lunate articular surface causing injury to the cartilage at the capitolunate joint.</p>
<p>The SLAC and SLD also caused some other physiological abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954411912445846">40</xref></sup> The scaphoid is at risk of degenerative changes due to the nature of the articulation. The scaphoid facet is elleptical in shape whilst the articulation of the lunate with the radius is spherical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912445846">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, any changes to the position of the scaphoid will result in incongruent loading of the radioscaphoid facet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954411912445846">40</xref></sup> Our study is the first ever reported literature where both SLD (through separation of the scaphoid and lunate) and SLAC (through rotary subluxation of the scaphoid) were incorporated to simulate the worst case of RA. One of the major differences for SLAC compared to the healthy wrist was the reduction of the contact area between radius and scaphoid, resulting in the increased load surrounding the area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954411912445846">40</xref></sup> Our study predicted a similar outcome where the average contact pressure at the radioscaphoid joint for the RA model was higher than the healthy model.</p>
<p>Despite all the findings reported in this study, the wrist is a very complex joint and patient specific, with the complexity even more pronounced when simulating pathological conditions such as RA. There are various limitations to our study and there was a certain level of uncertainty involved in simulating the RA wrist. Even though we have simulated all of the ten characteristics, quantitative data for each one is scarce. The only quantitative data that we found was the carpometacarpal ratio of 0.4 for severe RA. This ratio provided the upper and lower boundary of the carpal region. The position of the individual bones has to be determined from clinical reports; for example, the proximal carpal row has to be dislocated in the palmar and ulnar direction. For the FE model itself, there were numerous assumptions that need to be analysed such as linearity–non linearity, isotropic–orthotropic, second-order element–first-order element, tetrahedrals–hexahedrals, touching contact–glue contact, effect of sharp gradient between the two material properties, to name a few. As the amount of time required to analyse all these uncertainties was too prohibitive, we have decided to use existing data reported from the literature. The enormous amounts of data for this kind of sensitivity analyses study will be conducted in the future. Nevertheless, this is by far the first ever attempt at creating a working model to analyse complications related to the wrist and can be used to gather information for a potential solution.</p>
<p>It can be concluded that this biomechanical study of the rheumatic wrist had successfully identified that damage of soft and hard tissues caused altered biomechanical behaviour of the joint. Abnormal stress distribution and contact pressure at the articulation was found for the RA model.</p>
