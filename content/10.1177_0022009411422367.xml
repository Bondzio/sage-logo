<abstract>
<p>The Pavilion of Yugoslavia at EXPO ’58 in Brussels was an attempt to internationally showcase the specific brand of socialism developed in that country since its break from the Soviet bloc ten years prior. That goal was best achieved through the pavilion building, an inspired piece of modern architecture designed by the Croatian architect Vjenceslav Richter, which attracted much positive attention. In most other respects, the presentation was a relative disappointment, failing to engage the visitors in an attractive and well-rounded experience. This article provides an analysis of the conceptualization, development, and reception of the pavilion based on the abundant material from the Archive of Yugoslavia in Belgrade. It argues that Richter’s avant-garde design resonated with the self-proclaimed avant-garde status of Yugoslav socialism, but that its complex connotations, when seen through the lens of the Cold War, were reduced to a mere index of Yugoslavia’s break from the Soviet bloc.</p>

<body>
<p>On September 10, 1958, only five weeks before the closing of the 1958 Universal and International Exposition in Brussels, a small exhibition opened at the top floor of the Pavilion of Yugoslavia. Forty-five dolls dressed in traditional folk attire from all parts of Yugoslavia, surrounded by the images of the country’s most beautiful natural landscapes, went on display to considerable attention from the journalists from the local media. The response to the dolls’ intricate costumes and smiling faces was overwhelmingly positive: almost every major Belgian paper and both existing television channels covered the show, praising the beauty of Yugoslav folk art.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009411422367">1</xref></sup> The pavilion’s hosts estimated that the resulting exposure boosted the numbers of visitors by at least 10 per cent, thus achieving the exhibit’s goal to improve a mediocre attendance.
<fig id="fig1-0022009411422367" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The Pavilion of Yugoslavia at EXPO 58, Brussels, 1958.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422367-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The problem with this apparent success, however, was that, in its somewhat desperate last-minute attempt at generating popular appeal, it almost directly negated the central conceptual goal of Yugoslavia’s presentation in Brussels: to cast the country as completely oriented towards a modern future. And while the overall concept suffered from a lack of clear focus and popular attractions, at least this one goal was consistently and successfully pursued, as everything about the pavilion – from the elegant blue suits of the hosts to the exhibited artworks – emanated an unpretentious but pervasive modern appeal. The absolute star of this orchestration was the pavilion building itself: an architectural <italic>tour-de-force</italic>, it was universally praised by the cultural elite visiting EXPO, forging a reputation for Yugoslav architecture that would reverberate for years after the show. Designed by the Croatian architect, interior designer, artist, theorist, and activist, Vjenceslav Richter, the building retains a minor cult status among Belgian architects to this day, its memory still living thanks to the fact that it was one of the few EXPO pavilions that survived the closing of the show and was reconstructed as a school at another location outside Brussels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009411422367">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite their contrasting messages, however, the ultra-modern pavilion building and the sentimental traditionalism of the dolls both centered the successes of Yugoslav presence in Brussels in the sphere of culture, rather than the more obvious fields of political propaganda or commercial marketing, as was the case with many other countries. The central political message – to present Yugoslavia’s experiment in constructing a ‘humane’, decentralized socialism – remained buried in dry displays that visitors often overlooked. Instead, elements of that message were far more successfully delivered when sublimated through cultural products, most notably the pavilion building itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009411422367">3</xref></sup> As I will argue in this article, the pavilion’s architecture, and its careful synergy with the artworks displayed inside and around it, virtually embodied Yugoslavia’s new and reformed version of socialism, effectively surpassing any more explicit political statements shown inside. And yet, the success of these messages was a matter of contingency, rather than of a deliberate program: just as the exhibition of dolls came out of a last-minute attempt to boost visits, the architectural success of the pavilion was the unpredictable product of an inspired design and not of a clear strategy of national propaganda.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Yugoslav presence in Brussels was as much riddled with practical problems, inexperience, and missed opportunities, as it was blessed with enlightened visions and efficient decisions. This perhaps should not be surprising: just as Yugoslavia itself was in a constant political flux during the 1950s, the concept of its presentation in Brussels constantly changed over the four years during which it was created. The unusual wealth of information about the conceptualization, construction, and reception of that presentation – amounting to 27 boxes of various documents kept at the Archive of Yugoslavia in Belgrade – allows for an unusually detailed analysis of the development. In this article, I will examine that material to reveal the intended and unintended meanings attached to the pavilion, which emerged from the intertwined contexts of the Cold War, Yugoslavia’s internal politics, and modernism’s own history. Ultimately, both the Pavilion and the paintings and sculptures exhibited inside and around it testified to a continued politicization of culture, despite the fact that the aesthetic division of the Cold War world, which confronted modernism and Socialist Realism as irreconcilable signifiers of the two opposing political systems, began waning precisely at the Brussels show.</p>
<p>As the catalogue of the national pavilion and all the official reports proudly stated, Yugoslavia was one of the first countries to accept the invitation from the Belgian government to participate at EXPO, in November 1954.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009411422367">4</xref></sup> What particularly appealed to the Yugoslavs was the ’humanist concept proclaimed by the organizers of the Exhibition’, which resonated with the shift in Yugoslavia’s own politics that had occurred after the 1948 break with the Soviet bloc: away from a bureaucratized Stalinist system and towards a more decentralized governing that placed greater emphasis on the well-being of the individual.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009411422367">5</xref></sup> A direct result of this new orientation was the introduction of ‘workers’ self-management’ in 1950, which – at least in theory – removed the management of economic resources from the domain of the state and placed it directly in the hands of workers. Another result of 1948 was a limited – but nevertheless significant – release of party control over cultural production. As the head of the Agitprop, Milovan Đilas (later the most famous Yugoslav dissident), realized in 1949, ‘trying to change people’s minds through decrees’ made no sense; instead of being run by administration, culture would be better served through democratic confrontation of opinions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009411422367">6</xref></sup> The result was a quick demise of Socialist Realism and the flourishing of high modernism, as well as the more radical artistic practices, both of which, arguably, reached their apex in Brussels.</p>
<p>EXPO’s global perspective that stressed cooperation and tolerance, rather than competition, also resonated with Yugoslavia’s current policies, particularly the emergent foreign relations based on national independence, tolerance between rival ideological systems, and a belief that each country should be allowed to follow its ‘own road to socialism,’ independent of Soviet patronage. By the time the exhibition opened, this policy was already being further formulated into the ideology of non-alignment; but it is important to mention that during the development of the pavilion this policy was still very much in flux. In 1954, when it accepted the invitation to exhibit in Brussels, the Yugoslav government still seriously considered entering a Balkan Pact with Turkey and Greece, both capitalist countries and members of NATO.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009411422367">7</xref></sup> By 1958, however, Tito had thwarted such hopes by reestablishing contacts with the USSR – signified by Khrushchev’s conciliatory visit to Belgrade in 1956 – and by setting the ground for the Non-Aligned Movement together with Gamal Abdul Nasser of Egypt and Jawaharlal Nehru of India. Moreover, by 1958, another so-called ‘second confrontation’ with the Soviets occurred over the Yugoslav advocacy of independent roads to socialism, thus further stressing the country’s independent position.
<fig id="fig2-0022009411422367" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Vjenceslav Richter: The winning design at the second round of the competition for the Pavilion of Yugoslavia at EXPO 58, 1956.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422367-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The archival material leaves it somewhat uncertain as to how the Commissariat General of the Yugoslav Pavilion was assembled and who exactly came up with the exhibition's initial concept. Some members, such as the ambassador to Belgium, the President of the federal Committee for Foreign Trade, or the Secretary of the Committee for Cultural Connections with Foreign Countries, seem like obvious choices; but important executive roles were also assigned to two prominent cultural figures without direct political appointments (although both very much in line with the political establishment): Branislav Kojić, a well-known modernist architect in the pre-war period and current professor at the University of Belgrade, and Otto Bihalji-Merin, a prolific author and art-critic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009411422367">8</xref></sup> It was probably thanks to them that cultural products – art and architecture – played the disproportionately successful role in the Yugoslav presentation in Brussels. Particularly significant in this respect was Bihalji-Merin, a striking personality and intellectual of European repute, who used his international contacts to relentlessly promote Yugoslav art. A Belgrade-born cultural activist and life-long leftist, before the Second World War, he had been closely involved with the circles of the European avant-garde, including Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Thomas Mann, as well as left-wing intellectuals such as György Lukacs<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009411422367">9</xref></sup> Thanks to his many international connections, Bihalji-Merin found his way into the International Committee of Experts responsible for curating the exhibition <italic>Fifty Years of Modern Art, </italic>shown during EXPO at the Palace of Art in Brussels, alongside such famous critics as Herbert Read and Jean Cassou. As a member of the Committee, he lobbied for the inclusion of Yugoslav artists in the show and managed to secure a disproportionately large national representation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009411422367">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>If modernist culture had strong and capable advocates, it represented only one segment of the future Brussels pavilion, whose overall concept was not so firmly defined. From the very start, four sections were envisioned: state and social organization; culture, science, art, and education; economy; and natural beauties. The section on state and social organization obviously emerged as the most important: it was clear that Yugoslavia could not compete with the technological achievements of the more developed countries, but self-management and the emergent non-alignment seemed like original and attractive contributions to postwar human development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009411422367">11</xref></sup> This choice seemed obvious even to the outsiders: as Bihalji-Merin reported, Emile Langui, the Commissar of the exhibition <italic>Fifty Years of Modern Art </italic>and a leftist intellectual sympathetic with the Yugoslav cause, advised the Yugoslavs to focus precisely on ‘projecting what is characteristic for your country and for socialism … a hope in the possibility of a transformation of human thought.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009411422367">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Eventually, some reduction was necessary and the pavilion ended up with four ‘galleries:’ of State and Social Organization, Contemporary Art, Economy, and Tourism. This transformation reflected two significant pragmatic realizations that apparently dawned on the Commissariat members during the development process. The first was that, despite its proclaimed idealistic goals and non-commercial purpose, the EXPO was still a business opportunity and that other countries were about to take it without reservations. The section on the economy was thus used to advertise the country as a major source of coloured metals and water power. The change of the section on ‘natural beauties’ to a ‘Gallery of Tourism’ was also a clear attempt to promote Yugoslavia as a tourist destination in the West, which it indeed was fast becoming having opened its borders for foreign visitors earlier in the decade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009411422367">13</xref></sup> The second transformation – reducing the section on ‘culture, science, art, and education’ to a ‘Gallery of Contemporary Art’ – was most likely a result of previous politically beneficial experiences with international art shows, in which modernist artworks quickly emerged as potent visual signifiers of the country’s distinction from the Soviet bloc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009411422367">14</xref></sup> Since the early 1950s, Yugoslav modernist art and architecture were consistently interpreted in the West as symptoms of ‘Tito’s break with Russia’ and of a renewed freedom of expression, which further indicated greater civic liberties than in the countries behind the ‘Iron Curtain.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009411422367">15</xref></sup> And while the clear aesthetic distinctions between the East and the West were obviously on their way to extinction in Brussels, the stereotypes from the early Cold War period persisted during and long after the show, allowing Yugoslavia to continue reaping benefits from its presumed aesthetic difference from the Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>Unlike the gallery of art, which was clearly outlined in consultations with the country’s leading artists, critics, and curators, the pavilion’s chief section – the gallery of state and social organization – suffered from a long and tedious ‘design by committee’ process. Leading politicians and legal experts were consulted. Multiple script-writers were employed. At one point, two parallel teams, one in Belgrade and another in Zagreb, competed at conceptualizing this part of the show. In the end, the section comprised a little bit of everything: history, emphasizing the long struggle for national liberation of all Yugoslav peoples, especially during the Second World War; political and economic decentralization, with an accent on self-management in industrial enterprises and local governance; foreign policy and international cooperation; cultural life; science; social security; education; cooperatives in agriculture, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009411422367">16</xref></sup> The exhibition provided important evidence of the political self-perception at one of the key moments in the history of socialist Yugoslavia; but to say that it was unfocused, especially in competition with EXPO’s abundant popular attractions, would be an understatement.</p>
<p>The problem of <italic>where </italic>to display was just as complicated as the question of <italic>what </italic>to show. Like many other countries, Yugoslavia asked for a considerably larger plot than the Belgian hosts had at their disposal, but the site finally allotted allowed only for one of the smaller pavilions at the show. The question of the position, however, proved highly sensitive. The site that the hosts first offered was next to the Spanish pavilion, rousing an immediate protest from the Yugoslav side, which refused any association with Francisco Franco’s regime. In search of a replacement, Kojić and Bihalji-Merin had an eye on one of the central plots, but they could not compete with a large and powerful delegation from the Vatican, which eventually acquired the plot for itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009411422367">17</xref></sup> Yugoslavia thus ended up at a somewhat secluded section of EXPO, hidden behind a small forest between the pavilions of Portugal and Switzerland, next to the UK and not far from Germany. It was thus in the company of other European countries, but away from its immediate geographic neighbors of the Communist bloc, which were grouped around the USSR. This in itself was a subtle political statement. On the one hand, the site offered a beautiful backdrop of a natural landscape with a forest behind the pavilion. On the other, the official reports at the end of the exhibition blamed this position, away from the main traffic routes, for comparatively low numbers of visitors.</p>
<p>After the site was secured, an open architectural competition for the design of the pavilion was organized in the spring of 1956. Reflecting the significance of the occasion, the jury included some of the most prominent Yugoslav architects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009411422367">18</xref></sup> But despite the prestigious occasion, the quality and the number of entries submitted to the two rounds of the competition was surprisingly low.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009411422367">19</xref></sup> A clear exception was the winning design by Vjenceslav Richter, who proposed a striking structure suspended from a gigantic central pillar, thus reducing the building’s footprint to a single point. Apart from the spectacular structural system, however, the proposal also had high spatial and functional qualities, particularly the well-connected exhibition spaces that cascaded smoothly from level to level, as well as an open ground floor that significantly increased the total available area.</p>
<p>In Richter, the story of the Pavilion of Yugoslavia got its final and most important protagonist, one that proved to be a perfect match for the project, both for his considerable professional experience in exhibition design and for his political devotion to the Yugoslav socialist project. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009411422367">20</xref></sup> Politically active in leftist circles since his youth, and a participant in the Partisan resistance during the war, Richter had a solid political reputation, which allowed him to hone his design skills in a series of small but important commissions for various exhibition pavilions. This, in turn, allowed him to travel to the West well before it was possible for ordinary Yugoslavs and thus to acquire first-hand information on the latest foreign architecture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009411422367">21</xref></sup> Richter was committed to an avant-garde view of art and architecture as instruments of social and political change, influenced by Constructivism, the Bauhaus, and other progressive movements from the interwar period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009411422367">22</xref></sup> Consequently, as a co-founder and chief ideologue of EXAT 51 (<italic>Eksperimentalni atelier </italic>– Experimental Studio), Yugoslavia’s first postwar independent artistic group based in Zagreb, he argued for a synthesis of visual arts in the creation of totally designed environments based on abstraction and continuous experimentation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009411422367">23</xref></sup> The resonance of this return to the original revolutionary art in the broader political context was powerful, echoing the precisely contemporaneous formulation of self-management as a return to ‘authentic Marxism-Leninism;’ but it did not go without considerable reaction from conservative circles, for whom abstraction was still too controversial. For Richter himself, however, this realignment of artistic and political avant-gardes was no coincidence, since he saw his artistic activities as part of his political commitment and considered socialism as a precondition for a ‘general transformation of our image of the world.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009411422367">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Richter’s original project for Brussels, which proposed to suspend the whole building from an enormous central cable-stayed mast, inevitably evoked Constructivism and its penchant for suspended structures, most famously exemplified in Ivan Leonidov’s project for the Lenin Library in Moscow (1927), or Hannes Meyer’s <italic>Petersschule </italic>in Basel (1926). In this context, the central mast may be interpreted as the chief signifier of the project’s avant-garde lineage and, by extension, of the avant-garde status of Yugoslav socialism represented by it. On the other hand, the concept also resonated with the contemporaneous landmarks at international exhibitions, particularly the ‘Skylon,’ a gigantic cable-stayed tower erected for the Festival of Britain in London in 1951 (of which Richter almost certainly knew). From the very start, however, the suspension concept emerged as a major point of contention. Structural engineers from the ‘Đuro Đaković’ metal works, the company responsible for the construction of the pavilion, claimed that the wind deflections and the settling of the single footing rendered the proposal unviable. The Commissariat, therefore, required the project to be redesigned so that it rested on conventional columns. But Richter had a very hard time reconciling with this alteration; in his insistence on keeping the mast, he went as far as privately hiring a structural engineer to prove the viability of the project.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009411422367">25</xref></sup> At one point, even some of Yugoslavia’s leading politicians expressed their opinions on the matter: Moša Pijade, former President of the Federal Assembly, himself a painter, was very enthusiastic about Richter’s solution; Edvard Kardelj, the ‘architect’ of self-management, thought it was too extravagant and hoped for something ‘quieter.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009411422367">26</xref></sup> There is no proof, however, that either of their opinions mattered in the final decision, which seems to have been made purely on technical grounds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009411422367">27</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig3-0022009411422367" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The Pavilion of Yugoslavia at EXPO 58, entry plaza.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422367-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Eventually, the pavilion was built on 12 conventional steel columns, albeit thin enough to still allow for an unobstructed, open ground floor. Instead of a central mast, Richter succeeded in constructing a daring sculpture in front of the pavilion, a light obelisk consisting of six tensile arches that functioned as a visual marker. But for the rest of his life, he held a grudge against Bihalji-Merin, whom he held responsible (as the sources suggest, mistakenly) for the omission of the mast, illustrating how important it was for him. The removal of the mast, therefore, also meant the removal of some of the pavilion’s avant-garde connotations, and, by extension, the reduction of its social and political subtext, which was, arguably, in consonance with the country’s recently proclaimed ideology.</p>
<p>Even without the mast, however, the pavilion was a small masterpiece and a full realization of Richter’s ideas about the synthesis of visual arts. Raised on cruciform steel columns, the building’s weightless interlocking volumes appeared to float above a luxurious plaza interspersed with rectangular water pools, creating a dynamic cascade of flowing spaces with no barriers between the exterior and interior. Rectangular cut-outs in floor slabs contributed to the sense of lightness and openness and strengthened the vertical integration of spaces. Part of the building’s success lay in the fact that, compared to the overcrowded commercialism of much of the EXPO, it seemed like an embodiment of good taste. Rather than a fair pavilion, it resembled an elegant, sparsely furnished art gallery, in which every exhibit yielded to a dominating Mondrianesque aesthetic of black and white three-dimensional grids interspersed with occasional splashes of color. Indeed, although other artists were hired to design the interiors and the exhibition, it was ultimately Richter that eventually took full aesthetic control of all displays, creating a powerful <italic>Gesamtkunstwerk </italic>in the service of state representation. A parallel with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s famed 1929 Pavilion of Germany in Barcelona, one of the iconic buildings of modern architecture and itself a modernist <italic>Gesamtkunstwerk,</italic> comes to mind here. In either case, it was the building’s open, free-flowing space, more than anything exhibited inside it, that couched powerful political messages: of a modern, peaceful, and democratic Weimar Germany, instead of the conservative war-mongering Wilhelmine Empire; and of a reformed, open, and modern Yugoslav socialism, liberated from Stalinist oppression. In this context, one wonders if Richter’s use of cruciform columns – similar to those in Barcelona – represented a pure coincidence or, perhaps, a deliberate homage to Mies’s legendary pavilion.</p>
<p>As a side-effect – intended or not – the building also advertised certain branches of Yugoslav economy. Richter paved the ground-level plaza with 12 different kinds of polished marble in various colors, ranging from a bright white to black, including shades of pink, red, and terracotta; the ceilings in the interior were similarly clad in a mosaic of different kinds of wood. As the pavilion’s hosts reported, a number of foreign businessmen showed interest in the marbles and subsequently established contacts with Yugoslav sellers. Since the materials came from virtually all parts of the country, they also may have made a reference to ‘brotherhood and unity,’ the core dogma of Yugoslav federalism, but I found no evidence that this interpretation was deliberately intended.</p>
<p>An important quality of Richter’s architectural solution was that it gave clear spatial articulation to the exhibition’s four parts. The split-level layout allocated a clearly defined space to each of the four ‘galleries,’ while maintaining easy circulation and visual connections between them. The main entry to the pavilion led across the marble-paved plaza, past the souvenir booth, and then either half a floor downstairs, to the sunken Gallery of Economy, or half a floor upstairs, to the Gallery of State and Social Organization. From the latter, another half-level up, one accessed the Gallery of Art directly above the entry plaza, and from there the final Gallery of Tourism. This organization – the economy firmly anchored to the ground, the rest floating above it – made the Marxist tropes of ‘social basis’ and ‘superstructure’ materially tangible, which did not go unnoticed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009411422367">28</xref></sup> There were no doors anywhere along the path through the pavilion: the ground levels were completely open and could be accessed from the street at no fewer than eight points. (This, of course, caused problems with control and security, enabling the theft of one of the smaller sculptures from the Gallery of Art.) The top levels, while enclosed, were soaked in light thanks to ample glazing and crescent-shaped skylights.</p>
<p>Perched above the entry, the glazed Gallery of Art enjoyed a very prominent position, with paintings and pieces of applied art clearly visible from the access road. This view was particularly spectacular at night, when the whole pavilion glowed like a large lantern. The artistic theme continued on the ground levels, which were just as lavishly decorated with sculptures, relieves, and murals, artfully combined with water pools, colorful marble paving, and islands of greenery to create an atmosphere of restrained opulence and grace. In such settings, even the few exhibited pieces of industrial machinery looked like objects of art. Indeed, the overall impression was one of rigorous aesthetic coordination of every part of the pavilion, including such utilitarian elements as oversized drainage pipes, which stood freely at a distance from the building like pieces of abstract art. Despite its overall austerity, a subtle air of playfulness permeated the design, from the complex changes in levels and the colourful mosaics of marble paving and wooden ceilings, to the geometric patterns of recessed lighting and the graphic design of various exhibition panels.
<fig id="fig4-0022009411422367" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>The Pavilion of Yugoslavia at EXPO 58, the Gallery of Art.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422367-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The tone, however, somewhat changed as one entered the Gallery of State and Social Organization. Although politically the most important and the largest in size, this part of the exhibition lacked the visual appeal of the rest of the pavilion. This is not to say that it received less attention than the other three galleries; on the contrary, much effort was invested in making the exhibits distinctive and personable. Moreover, Richter made sure that the design of each panel was as attractive as possible, applying various graphic tricks to rescue them from looking too dry. But the problem was not in the skills of the designer, but in the very concept: apart from a few medieval manuscripts (displayed, ostensibly, to illustrate Yugoslavia’s long history of civilization and thus to counteract the stereotype of uncivilized backwaters, a long-standing complex inherited from the past), all other exhibits were two-dimensional panels with slogans and statistics, and no amount of inventive design was sufficient to transform them into a more engaging experience. To make it worse, the text, which contained numerous grammatical and typographical errors, was written only in French and English, while completely omitting Flemish, the language of the larger of the two Belgian ethnicities. (In protest, Flemish nationalists at one point defaced parts of the exhibition with stickers.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009411422367">29</xref></sup> It was no wonder, then, that few visitors were ready to spend their time deciphering the tasteful but dry black-and-white boards: in the end, what should have been the most important section of the pavilion remained the least attended, many visitors simply walking past it or missing some of its key components.</p>
<p>Part of the problem was that the Gallery of State and Social Organization attempted to achieve too much, ultimately lacking a clear focus. A few dominant themes nevertheless emerged, occupying prominent spots on the floor. One was the historical struggle for national independence and its extension through Yugoslavia’s independent foreign policy. Several panels were devoted to these themes, particularly focusing on the material from the Second World War. The country’s efforts at modernization and overcoming the underdevelopment also received considerable attention, but their elaboration through statistics and diagrams remained rather uninspired. Probably the most extensive were attempts to present the reformed, decentralized, and democratic nature of Yugoslav socialism, stressing its participatory character and care for the well-being of everyone. These displays were among the most gripping, revealing that much effort was invested in putting a ‘human face’ to abstract political concepts, featuring photographs of real people as they participated in self-management at work and in the community. One of the prominently displayed panels showed a large portrait of a presumably typical worker, a certain Antun Frntić from Zagreb, and listed his positions as a member of the Workers’ Council at his factory, a delegate at the Council of Producers in his municipality, and a delegate at the Council of Producers of the Federal People’s Assembly. (His photo, by the way, caused much confusion among the visitors, because many mistook him for Tito.) As the Belgian paper <italic>Le Soir </italic>concluded from this display, Frntić’s ‘energetic and smiling face’ revealed a citizen who is ‘more experienced in management than some old capitalist.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009411422367">30</xref></sup> Slogans, such as ‘In my own hands,’ ‘Where I live, there I take part in government,’ and ‘Where I work, there I am in charge,’ made sure that the visitors did not miss the message.</p>
<p>Richter’s design trickery was particularly inspired on panels that threatened to be the least attractive: those showing explicit political slogans. Through their careful placement, usually fully integrated with the pavilion’s architecture, through inspired selection of accompanying imagery that circumvented any overt ideological symbols, and through the use of modern typography, these panels recast political slogans into highly aestheticized poetic messages, eschewing the off-putting sense of overt propaganda. An example was a long vertical panel displayed within the void of the main staircase, which read ‘The Yugoslav peoples fought for freedom and social justice for centuries.’ Set against the backdrop of seagulls flying freely in the sky, this message probably rang true to most Western visitors, who were still patently aware that Yugoslavia successfully escaped Soviet domination. Moreover, the conspicuous selection of the image, which alluded to an unlimited individual freedom and looked nothing like the stereotypical socialist propaganda, only further strengthened the distinction from the Soviet pavilion. Similar poetic imagery was employed on the panel that carried one of the most significant political messages of the show, the concluding sentence of the new Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Adopted simultaneously with the opening of EXPO, the Program proclaimed a return to the original ‘revolutionary creative sprit of Marxism.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009411422367">31</xref></sup> Alluding to Marx’s ‘ruthless criticism of everything existing,’ it ended with an emphatic statement of anti-dogmatism, shunning the ossified, quasi-religious role that Communist parties played in the Soviet bloc: ‘Nothing that has been created so far should be so sacred that it cannot be overcome, that it cannot be replaced with something more progressive, more liberated, and more humane.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009411422367">32</xref></sup> Set against a large photograph of an infinite seascape, this sentence was prominently featured on a free-standing panel in the middle of the Gallery, reinforcing the rhetoric of unbound liberty and cementing the Yugoslav claims to authentic Marxism.</p>
<p>The theme of liberation – national, cultural, and class – tied the exhibit into a coherent narrative for those willing to spend the time deciphering it. The story went something like this: despite their ancient cultures, Yugoslav peoples were for centuries oppressed by foreigners. After suffering great losses, they finally achieved their liberty, which now allows them to build socialism to the benefit of each individual. But in order to do so, they must first overcome backwardness, induced by the centuries of foreign occupation, and are now making great strides in modernization. The socialism they are building is not based on a dogma imposed from the outside, but an experimental system unbound by any preconceived notions and open to improvement. Yugoslav peoples believe that everyone should have the right to develop in similar freedom and on their own terms, and are friendly and open to cooperation, as long as it is on equal grounds.</p>
<p>This narrative provided a context for the remaining three galleries. The Gallery of Economy on the ground floor testified to the successful modernizing efforts of the socialist society, providing a symbolic basis for all other achievements. The Gallery of Art illustrated the recent great strides in the development of a free, modern culture. The Gallery of Tourism cast the country as a hospitable, attractive destination. All three, however, provided a considerably more engaging experience than the Gallery of State and Social Organization, while at the same time serving parallel, more pragmatic purposes. The Gallery of Economy at the ground level thus advertised coloured metals as one of the country’s strongest export articles, showing mineral specimens in attractive display cases. If the accent on the production of raw materials seemed a bit colonial, a few industrial products, including a cinema projector and several pieces of electronic equipment, hinted at Yugoslavia’s developing technological prowess (also stressing the peaceful use of nuclear power, the perennial Cold War theme). Conspicuously absent, however, were any consumer products. In light of the country’s recent reorientation to the development of consumer industries, it seems rather puzzling that the show did not take a chance to stress that fact, all the more so because Yugoslav industrial design was undergoing a veritable renaissance in the late 1950s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009411422367">33</xref></sup> A possible explanation was that the Commissariat took to heart EXPO’s proclaimed goal of avoiding commercial competition, even though the development of a socialist consumer industry and culture was as much a political point as a commercial opportunity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009411422367">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Through a rigorous selection of the best modernist pieces, the Gallery of Art advertised not only the flourishing of the national culture, but also the liberation from the constraints of Socialist Realism, still a potent message to make, even though Socialist Realism had already been officially abolished in the Soviet bloc since Stalin’s death. Back home in Yugoslavia, realistic representation and heroic pathos were still alive and well – although demoted from the officially sanctioned dominant position – but in Brussels they were carefully avoided. Instead, the displayed artworks, including those at the show <italic>Fifty Years of Modern Art, </italic>covered a range of poetic and thematic approaches, ranging from a mainstream modernism to the recently discovered ‘naïve’ art, a genre that had long fascinated modernist critics and whose Yugoslav version was now relentlessly promoted by Bihalji-Merin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009411422367">35</xref></sup> The bulk belonged to a ‘moderate’ modernism, which focused on exploring its own aesthetic autonomy, enabled by the recently acquired artistic freedom. Years later, some Yugoslav critics would name this art ‘Socialist Aestheticism’ to imply that it virtually replaced Socialist Realism as an ‘official’ state art, while renouncing the socially transformative ambitions of the avant-garde.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009411422367">36</xref></sup> The paradox of this selection was that it completely excluded the artists from Richter’s own circle around EXAT 51 (which, by the time EXPO opened, had already reached its peak and dissolved). Obviously, EXAT’s radical abstraction, while no longer as divisive as it had been at the beginning of the decade, was not yet sufficiently accepted to be shown as stand-alone art and could only be mediated through the more utilitarian architecture or design.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009411422367">37</xref></sup>

<p>Finally, the Gallery of Tourism at the top floor indicated that, despite the idealistic proclamations, commercial interests could not be ignored. The exhibition included artefacts aimed at culturally minded tourists, including pieces of traditional folk garb, replicas of medieval frescoes from Serbian and Macedonian monasteries, and, most impressively, a full-size copy of a golden medieval sarcophagus from the Dalmatian city of Šibenik. Despite the fact that the black and white rendition of the large-scale photos of natural landscapes and historical cities somewhat diminished their effect, the pavilion’s hosts repeatedly reported that this was still the best visited section of the show. Ultimately, however, it was a victim of its own success, since the interest it generated could not be satisfied: Yugoslavia had no tourist office in Belgium, there were no tourist agents present at the pavilion to book trips, and any attempts by interested visitors to contact hotels and agencies in Yugoslavia remained hopelessly unanswered.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009411422367">38</xref></sup> It was only three months into the show that the Tourist Association finally sent a representative to Brussels, by which time the season was already reaching its end.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009411422367">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the often spotty archives of former Yugoslavia, the material about the Brussels pavilion is one of the rare instances of great abundance, especially regarding the reception. Besides the preserved visitors’ books and exhaustive press clippings, this material includes numerous reports, from the day-to-day accounts by the pavilion’s hosts, to those by the members of the Commissariat. It is these reports that offer the most detailed picture of the reception, revealing both the exhibition’s strengths and its numerous problems. They also reveal how the perception of the exhibition was filtered through visitors’ preconceptions and biases, both positive and negative and often decidedly political.</p>
<p>If there is one point about which all the reports agree, it is that the pavilion was an architectural success.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009411422367">40</xref></sup> That success is particularly significant in the broader context of EXPO, which architectural historians remember with mixed emotions. The exhibition marked modernism’s worldwide victory, including its revival in the socialist world. But this was now a modernism that showed signs of compromise of its once lofty principles for the sake of extra-architectural motivations and purposes: overt commercialism or political propaganda. (However different in their ideological messages, the gargantuan pavilions of the two superpowers were strangely similar in their imperial, classicized monumentality.) The Belgian section was especially reviled for its abundance of brightly-colored ‘space-age’ ornament that became known as the Expo Style or the Atomic Style.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009411422367">41</xref></sup> It was in this context that Richter’s design emerged as one of the few achievements hailed for their architectural quality, alongside, for example, Le Corbusier’s <italic>poème électronique </italic>built for Phillips, Egon Eiermann and Sep Ruf's Pavilion of West Germany, or Sverre Fehn’s Pavilion of Norway.</p>
<p>Indeed, as a building, the pavilion was an unqualified success with the architectural and cultural elite. The prestigious British journal <italic>Architectural Review </italic>ranked it among the ‘six outstanding pavilions’ at the whole exposition; for the French daily <italic>L’Express, </italic>it fared even better, among the top four.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009411422367">42</xref></sup> Gurus of modernism, such as Alfred Barr Jr. of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Jean Cassou of the Paris Museum of Contemporary Art, praised the building, as well as the art show displayed inside. Students of architecture flocked to see and study it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009411422367">43</xref></sup> Belgian press described the pavilion as a ‘palace in steel, glass, wood, and marble whose elegance lies in its restraint.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009411422367">44</xref></sup> Many visitors and journalists commented that, in the visual noise of EXPO, it offered a welcome point of calm and repose.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009411422367">45</xref></sup> One journalist particularly highlighted the building’s photographic appeal, noting how it attracted amateur-photographers always in search of good shots.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009411422367">46</xref></sup> This positive reception, however, frequently revealed stereotypical views of Yugoslavia, manifested in a perpetual surprise that a socialist and Balkan country was able to produce such a modern and sophisticated structure. Many visitors wanted to know about the architect and were surprised to hear that he was not educated in Germany or the United States, but in Zagreb. As one of the hosts put it, ‘People were surprised that we build such modern and beautiful architecture. Many even asked if we were allowed to build in such a way in the country, too, and emphasized the difference between our and Russian architecture.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009411422367">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>The overwhelmingly positive reception of the pavilion building was in itself a political message that further strengthened the already existing views of Yugoslav modern art as a symptom of the country’s break from the Soviet orbit. Starting from such a frame of mind, it was not much of a leap to interpret other qualities of the building in political terms, too. The completely open ground floor and the fact that there were no doors were understood as analogous to Yugoslavia’s open borders and its emergent international policy of ‘peaceful active coexistence.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009411422367">48</xref></sup> Modesty and restraint were seen as manifestations of a focus on human values instead of megalomaniac representation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009411422367">49</xref></sup> Even the pavilion’s position, away from other socialist countries, was seen as a political statement. As <italic>Le Soir </italic>proclaimed, ‘Yugoslavia did in Brussels as it does in its international relations. Parting ways with the Soviet sector … it chose its place next to Portugal, Switzerland, and Great Britain. Next to its inoffensive friends’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009411422367">50</xref></sup> The fact, however, that the position of the pavilion was not chosen in order to stress ‘parting ways with the Soviet sector’, but merely as a result of availability, illustrates to what degree the existing political notions predetermined the perception. Western left-wing media, such as the Belgian Communist paper <italic>Drapeau Rougue </italic>and the British <italic>New Statesman, </italic>were naturally sympathetic with the political messages of Yugoslav exhibition. But some centrist papers were too; to quote again <italic>Le Soir</italic>’s reporter, this time commenting on the exhibition of the political system: ‘It’s a miracle that all of that could have been lethally boring and aggressive – but it’s not. Who knows what Mediterranean grace corrects that dogmatism, grace combined with sincerity … It’s clear, it’s determined. Like Tito’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009411422367">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Conversely, political presumptions could also lead to negative perception, as was the case with the relatively infrequent members of Yugoslav anticommunist emigration. The sharpest politically motivated criticism came from Soviet visitors, which was no surprise in light of Yugoslavia’s recent renewed rift with the USSR. It was the new Program of the League of Communists (also prominently displayed at the Gallery of State and Social Organization) that had caused this rift by stressing the possibility of independent paths to socialism. The Yugo-Soviet relations, which had only thawed two years before, now became frosty again, which was clearly revealed in the comments from the Soviet visitors. The most tendentious among them aimed directly at the obvious lack of ideological signs in the pavilion, questioning whether Yugoslavia was still a socialist country at all. Others focused on the aesthetics; as one of the hosts summarized, ‘In most cases, Russian visitors were dissatisfied … ‘It’s empty, where are the machines?’ In the Gallery of Art, they regularly asked, ‘Is this kind of art close to the people?’ ‘What was this supposed to say?’, etc. Several times they asked what Bakić’s ‘Bull’ [a large semi-abstract bronze exhibited outside] was supposed to represent: a pig, a hippopotamus, or an inflated bag?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009411422367">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pavilion’s success with educated Western elites – critics, artists, architects, and intellectuals – was also counterbalanced by a much cooler popular reception. Many ordinary Yugoslavs who came to Brussels thought that it was ‘empty’ and ‘too modern.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009411422367">53</xref></sup> Some foreigners, too, observed that the elegant but cool building conveyed nothing of the country’s ‘vibrancy’ and that it was more suited to a quiet Switzerland than the colorful Yugoslavia, obviously frustrating the stereotypical views of the Balkans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009411422367">54</xref></sup> Ultimately, however, it was the attendance that proved the most disappointing, as fewer than 10 per cent of EXPO’s 45 million visitors ventured towards the pavilion. Of course, its position was rather secluded and it could not directly compete with the enormous pavilions of the two superpowers, filled with all kinds of technological wonders. But Czechoslovakia demonstrated that, through sheer ingenuity and smart planning, a small country with no cutting-edge technology – lacking even Yugoslavia’s automatically positive political perception – could create a spectacular exhibition capable of attracting huge crowds. Unlike Czechoslovakia’s <italic>Grand Prix</italic>, Yugoslavia’s Gold Medal – one of a total of 35 – was awarded by the international jury solely on the account of the elegant pavilion building and the art exhibition; as the jury noted, the pavilion’s ‘didactic quality’ was utterly disappointing.</p>
<p>But the most devastating estimate came from the Yugoslav side itself. Among the many official reports, one stands out for its sheer length and an acute criticism of all the weaknesses of the pavilion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009411422367">55</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the archived version does not bear the name of its writer, but it must have been someone very closely involved both with the pavilion’s organization and its daily workings, possibly the head host or even one of the Commissariat members. This reporter especially highlighted the lack of a proper concept attuned to a large popular gathering and the many missed chances to advertise the country in more pragmatic terms. He also mentioned a whole range of organizational problems, from the lack of tourist representatives, to nepotism in selecting the hosts, most of whom were insufficiently prepared and some only spoke English in a French- and Flemish-speaking country. He described the perpetual problems with the functioning of the national restaurant, which was organized at the last minute and, apparently, without any desire from the Yugoslav hospitality industry to exploit an excellent business opportunity. In the context of the pavilion’s central theme, it was particularly ironic that, based on the problematic functioning of the restaurant, he came to a conclusion that ‘self-management perhaps does not work abroad.’ But his criticism did not spare the otherwise highly praised building and its architect either. Functional issues were the lesser evil in this respect: from the stale air on top floors (which caused some visitors to faint in the summer heat) and no fences around water pools on the ground floor (because of which some 60 visitors took an unexpected bath), to a dysfunctional projection room and the stench that emanated from the restrooms. The greater problem, according to the reporter, was Richter’s tyrannical aesthetic control, which, in the vacuum created by an under-defined concept, hijacked the exhibition, eliminating everything that contradicted its own rigorous principles, including color photos. Richter allegedly even fought to remove the basic state insignia from the show; the national flag was only hung after the opening.</p>
<p>The Pavilion’s successes and failures were thus inextricably intertwined: the rarefied atmosphere created by Richter’s aesthetic control was as much a source of praise as it caused trouble. It was also a symptom of the deeper problems with the exhibition, since it could only become so domineering in the absence of a well defined general concept. It was in this context that the exhibition of dolls in folk costumes, introduced as a solution to an unenthusiastic popular response, represented a particularly telling gesture. An ad hoc, last-minute remedy, these humble dolls revealed in a single stroke the weaknesses of both the years of high-level planning and of Richter’s uncompromising aesthetic. At the same time, their immediate success also revealed the persistence of the stereotypes about Yugoslavia and its folksy, traditional culture. But it was the very choice of this particular remedy that spoke most eloquently, reverting to the very formula the organizers were trying to avoid all along. It was a familiar formula, anxious to anchor a modern identity – still volatile and under construction – to its traditional, pre-modern roots. And while the dolls could obviously be interpreted in terms of the ‘brotherhood and unity’ of Yugoslav peoples, the formula, in its essence, was carried over from the interwar period, when the monarchy used the exhibition pavilions to explore its dichotomous identities by juxtaposing the modern and the traditional, the ‘civilized’ and the ‘primitive.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009411422367">56</xref></sup> It was as if, under pressure, socialist Yugoslavia’s repressed Other had no choice but to resurface, even if in such an ephemeral form as a collection of dolls.</p>
<p>At the same time, the pavilion revealed another split: between the notions of a politically engaged avant-garde, which strives to take an active role in the transformation of society, and an apolitical ‘autonomous’ modernism, which is merely interested in exploring its own aesthetic potential. Richter’s activist, avant-garde ethos was blunted through the removal of his most heroic gesture, the suspension mast, and further flattened through the lens of Cold War politics. His allusions to a direct link between self-management and avant-garde aesthetics were all but apolitical; but they were generally overlooked and the pavilion was reduced to a mere sign of Yugoslavia’s independence from the Soviet Union. This was the same operation that recontextualized much of the modernist art in the West during the Cold War and allowed such previously socially engaged artists as Jackson Pollock to be recast as America’s cultural ‘weapons’ in its struggle to capture the ‘hearts and minds.’ Paradoxically, at the same time, Yugoslav political establishment adopted the ideologically neutral modernism, later dubbed ‘Socialist Aestheticism,’ as its own herald of cultural prestige. But the work of the more radical artists, like Richter and his EXAT colleagues, could only be exhibited in Brussels in an applied form, as part of architecture and design, not as self-sufficient artworks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Richter’s success in Brussels opened the doors for his international career as a bona fide artist and, arguably, for a subsequent acceptance of abstraction in the country, while the officialdom happily continued to exploit art as a source of external legitimation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009411422367">57</xref></sup> If there was ever any doubt about what kind of art should be shown abroad, by 1960 it became a calculated political strategy to send the most cutting-edge art to the West, while reserving the more conservative works for the East (i.e., the Soviet Union; by this time there was already a fruitful artistic exchange with Poland and Czechoslovakia).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0022009411422367">58</xref></sup> In this context, it is no wonder that Richter’s abilities continued to provide a substitute for a well-rounded concept of foreign cultural propaganda. On at least two occasions, in Turin in 1961 and in Milan in 1963, the architect was given free reign in designing the national pavilions, both times condensing the Brussels formula to self-management plus a highly aestheticized environment. Although much smaller in size than in Brussels, these pavilions were perhaps the most aesthetically radical designs with which Yugoslavia ever presented itself internationally.
<fig id="fig6-0022009411422367" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>The Pavilion of Yugoslavia at EXPO 58, the exhibition of dolls at the Gallery of Tourism.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422367-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The successes and failures of Yugoslavia’s presentation at EXPO 58 highlighted the multiple intersections at which the country stood at the time: between the ideological blocs of the Cold War, between political and economic systems, and between modernity and tradition. In many ways, that was a position that Yugoslavia would continue occupying for the remaining three decades of its existence. The Brussels show may thus be seen as the first synthetic symbolic proclamation of all of its components to an international audience: a perpetually experimental socialism that sought to reinterpret the authentic spirit of Marxism; an independent foreign policy that refused to side with either of the Cold War opponents; openness to international cooperation on equal terms; a culture relatively autonomous of direct political intrusion; and concerted efforts at modernization. That all of these messages were successfully sublimated through the pavilion building was as much a testimony to the remarkable vision of its architect as to the failure of the state to convincingly present itself.</p>
