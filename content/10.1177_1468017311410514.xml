<p>• <italic>Summary</italic>: The purpose of this article is to explore the tensions that emerge when two very different discourses – the ‘democratic’, participatory discourse of FGC and the legalistic, bureaucratized discourse of conventional child welfare practice – attempt to integrate. We present the findings of a qualitative study, where we conducted 74 interviews, involving 26 adult family members/caregivers (three youth); six child protection workers; and three FGC coordinators. By listening to the voices of participants, we explore the complexities and tensions that exist at the nexus of (at least) two competing discourses, when the FGC process takes place within the child protection bureaucratic structure.</p>
<p>• <italic>Findings</italic>: Our findings show how participants’ voices were co-opted by the more forceful child protection discourse, itself shaped by legal, bureaucratized, and neoliberal discourses. This research shows how in each case participants’ experience of power was subjugated, even though, in each instance, the case was perceived to have had a successful outcome by the social worker and FGC coordinator.</p>
<p>• <italic>Applications</italic>: If those involved in administering and delivering family group conferencing continue to at least be aware of how power operates in this context, then the possibility exists to realize FGC's broader social justice and transformative goals. Further, a reflective practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017311410514">Schön, 1991</xref>) can mitigate the possibility of cooptation from particular bureaucratic, legal, and neoliberal discourses which dominate at different times, and which are incompatible with the inherent values and objectives of the FGC.</p>

<body>
<p>Family Group Conferencing (FGC) is a decision-making process in child protection that first emerged in the 1980s in New Zealand, and has since been taken up in many locations around the world (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017311410514">Holland &amp; Rivet, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017311410514">Sundell &amp; Vinnerljung, 2004</xref>). A fundamental principle of FGC is the engagement of families in decision-making about the safety and welfare of children. However, as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017311410514">Connolly and McKenzie (1999)</xref>, the intent to strengthen and preserve the family is a recent historical development in child welfare practice. With the implementation of FGC by government agencies, principles of family empowerment and participation become juxtaposed against conventional child welfare practices that focus on the rescue and protection of children. The result has been described as ‘one of the most complex and sensitive aspects of social work practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017311410514">Healy &amp; Darlington, 2009</xref>, p. 420).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to explore the tensions that emerge when two very different discourses – that is, the ‘democratic’, participatory discourse of FGC, and the legalistic, bureaucratized discourse of conventional child welfare practice – attempt to integrate. We present the findings of a qualitative study conducted in British Columbia, Canada, of the experience of FGC participation among family members, social workers, and FGC coordinators. By listening to the voices of participants, we explore the complexities and tensions that exist at the nexus of (at least) two competing discourses, when the FGC process takes place within the child protection bureaucratic structure. In particular, we are interested in how family members describe their experience of voice and participation – not only in the FGC meeting itself, but in the FGC preparation and care plan implementation phases as well.</p>
<p>A secondary purpose of the article is to expand the scope of research on FGCs, which has largely focused on satisfaction surveys and short-term outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468017311410514">Maloney &amp; Ney, 2008</xref>). As reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017311410514">Isaacs, Maloney, and Ney (2007)</xref>, the generally positive findings that have made up the bulk of FGC research become more complex when outcomes are assessed over time (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017311410514">Sundell &amp; Vinnerlung, 2004</xref>) and qualitatively (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017311410514">Holland &amp; O'Neill, 2006</xref>). Qualitative analysis can reveal subtle but important areas for further investigation that may be missed by forced-choice survey methods.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1468017311410514"><title>Background</title>
<sec id="sec2-1468017311410514"><title>Participation, power, and voice in FGC practice</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017311410514">Connolly and McKenzie (1999)</xref> describe the difficulties faced by child protection workers in balancing the rights and demands of parents with the protection of children. The authors acknowledge that much child protection work takes place under increasing public scrutiny, and involves often ambivalent if not adversarial relationships with parents and families. Risks involved in implementation of FGCs in child protection include, first, that partnerships with families may increase risk to the child; and second, that the partnership ‘may be used as rhetoric to mask the very real coercive power that responsible authorities have over families judged to be irresponsible’ (p. 12). From this latter view, the balance of power is tipped toward the state, and notions of collaboration and full and equal participation may become sites of problematization.</p>
<p>These challenges of FGC practice have more recently been corroborated in research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017311410514">Holland, Scourfield, O'Neill, and Pithouse (2005)</xref> showing that despite social worker commitment to the ideals of FGC practice, ‘it can be difficult [for social workers] to change the power relations and to trust the families to formulate their own plans’ (p. 65). The authors also concluded that ‘there can be a fine line between a professional outlining her concerns at the start of a meeting and imposing an agenda and preferred solution on the meeting’ (p. 61). Their research further found that a common view held by social workers was that the FGC should serve the purpose of confronting parents with ‘reality’ and with their responsibilities. In light of such disparities between theory and practice of FGC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017311410514">Pennell and Burford (2008)</xref> summarize the current challenge is to ‘mainstream the practice into child welfare with fidelity to its core principles’ (p. 6).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017311410514">Healy and Darlington (2009)</xref> also explored the ‘inherent tensions’ involved in working from a participatory framework in child protection (p. 420). Their qualitative study, based on interviews with 28 child protection workers in Australia, found differences in implementation of participatory practices depending on whether workers were located in governmental or non-governmental practice sites. For those working in the governmental domain, statutory obligations predisposed workers to pre-define the problem, and then utilize participatory practices to negotiate alternatives for dealing with the concerns. In contrast, workers located in non-governmental domains were more predisposed to involve families in both problem definition and resolution. Similar to us, the authors say they were unable to locate significant discussion in the social work literature on how to reconcile child protection obligations with principles of participatory, collaborative practice.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311410514">Merkel-Holguin (2004)</xref> argues that FGC holds democratizing potential to promote ‘the sharing of power for decision making between family, kin, professionals, state and the community, while balancing responsibility and accountability among these groups’ (p. 155). But she poses the question: ‘Are entrenched and powerful systems ready to support a practice model as empowering as family group conferencing?’ (pp. 156–157). She observes that bureaucracies can ‘sabotage’ family group conferences, quoting work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017311410514">Nixon, Merkel-Holguin, Sivak, and Gunderson (2001)</xref>:<disp-quote>
<p>Family group conferencing has often been misunderstood as augmenting professional decision making rather than driving decisions themselves. The ambition to fit family group conferencing within the procedures, time scales, and assumptions of bureaucracies has relegated family group conferencing to secondary planning form or a rubber stamp for professional ideas. (p. 160)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017311410514">Pennell (2003)</xref> suggests that variations, or ‘model drift’ in FGC practices may be in part due to efforts to ‘exert control, meet regulations, contain costs, and avoid litigation’ (p. 16). In the next section we describe the tenets of discourse theory that will be used as a methodological tool to explore how FGCs may be co-opted by ‘powerful systems’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468017311410514"><title>Discourse</title>
<p>This study focuses on the experience of empowerment and engagement in FGCs within the larger context of child welfare practice. We use the principles of critical discourse analysis (CDA) to understand the meanings that shape talk, actions, and institutions, and how they do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017311410514">Brevir, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468017311410514">Garrity, 2010</xref>). CDA exposes how discourse reproduces particular practices by those who have social power, while legitimizing the structure of institutions within which they operate. The FGC literature previously cited raises doubts about successfully implementing a collaborative decision-making strategy within a system that is more powerful and ideologically dissimilar. Concerns that bureaucracies may ‘sabotage’ or contribute to ‘model drift’ is important. The language cited above that explains the FGC as fitting into the ‘procedures, time scales, and assumptions of bureaucracies’, or striving to ‘exert control, meet regulations, contain costs, and avoid litigation’ refers to discursive practices within child protection discourse that is constituted from the larger, dominant legalistic, bureaucratic, and neoliberal discourses. Because these expectations are often disguised in the language of administration, they have an invisible power, and as such are capable of mystifying the places where authority can be exercised in the name of that discourse. In this study, we explore tensions that exist precisely where the less powerful FGC discourse of collaboration and participation meets the more powerful discourse of child protection.</p>
<p>A primary tenet of this article, then, is that law, bureaucracy, and neoliberalism are highly privileged discourses that administer power and codified knowledge, which in turn shape how we think and what we do. Analysis of the participant stories that follow will reveal how these discourses conceal and reproduce power of the conventional, dominant child protection system. The findings have significant implications: they suggest that the FGC, when it is an intervention administered within the child protection system's mandate, is potentially neither neutral nor collaborative – dominant discourses have the ability to silently disempower those who participate in an FGC, and, ultimately, reproduce social inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017311410514">Tew, 2006</xref>). In sum, the stories presented below will show how, in some instances, an FGC becomes shaped by privileged discourses that are culturally produced and endorsed but in opposition to the principles and values of collaborative decision-making.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1468017311410514" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>The current study is part of a larger qualitative project looking at FGC process and outcomes in British Columbia. The methods used for recruitment, interviewing, and data reduction are informed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017311410514">Creswell (1998)</xref>, who describes the qualitative researcher as someone who ‘builds a complex holistic picture, analyzes words, reports detailed views of informants, and conducts the study in a natural setting’ (p. 15). Consistent with qualitative research strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017311410514">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 1998</xref>), the objective was not to amass findings that could be deemed representative and generalizable to other populations; rather, we focused on gathering rich descriptions of particular cases, with an eye to the articulation of contradiction and complexity.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1468017311410514"><title>Recruitment</title>
<p>Participants were recruited through the Ministry of Child and Family Development (MCFD – the British Columbia government administrative body for child protection) in New Zealand for in-depth interviews. Participants include social workers, family group conference coordinators, and caregivers and family members. Recruitment took place at the time of referral to the FGC process within two different health districts, one urban and one rural. Referrals were organized into nine different pods, with each pod consisting of parents or caregivers, any extended family involved, and the social worker(s) and FGC coordinator associated with the case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1468017311410514"><title>Interviews</title>
<p>The interview schedule included one pre-FGC interview, one immediately after the FGC, and one follow up after six months. This schedule was generally successful except when short notice precluded scheduling a pre-FGC interview, or when we were unable to locate individuals for the six-month follow up.</p>
<p>Seventy-four interviews were conducted as of February 2010. Interviews lasted between 30 minutes and two hours, and family members and caregivers were given an honorarium for their time. Interviews with family most often took place in their homes, while interviews with social workers and FGC coordinators took place at the MCFD office. Interviews were semi-structured, using the following questions as guidelines: ‘What are your hopes or expectations for the upcoming FGC? What are your concerns, if any?’ ‘Did the FGC meet your expectations? Were your concerns addressed? What was the meeting like for you? Do you have any recommendations?’ ‘What are your thoughts on the plan that emerged from the FGC? Is it being implemented, and if not, why not? What role do you see the FGC has played in how things are going for your family? Do you think the FGC is a useful process? Why or why not?’ Interviews were recorded and transcribed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1468017311410514"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>Data reduction and theme identification was achieved using an emergent, iterative approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017311410514">Patton, 2002</xref>). We began with a global reading of interview transcripts and a preliminary identification of themes. This was followed by a return to the FGC literature, which informed the next reading and further refinement of themes. Reading and analysis was conducted both across and within pods, with close attention to exceptions and contradictions. We next located a number of excerpts that illustrated the theme, which were then subjected to critical discourse analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468017311410514">Van Dijk, 1993</xref>). Among the themes identified, that of ‘participation, power and voice’ is presented here.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1468017311410514"><title>Findings</title>
<p>Interviews were conducted with 26 adult family members/caregivers, including three youth; six child protection workers; and three FGC coordinators. Of the nine pods, one was dropped after the pre-FGC interviews because the FGC did not take place. All other pods included at least two successive interviews (pre- and post-FGC), with one pod generating a series of four interviews over a one-year time period. Not all pod members were interviewed multiple times, but efforts were focused on follow-up with key family members and social workers.</p>
<p>In the following section, care has been taken to protect the identity of participants as many of the families and social workers were still working together at the time of writing. In addition to changing identifying details, we also provide somewhat ‘thin’ descriptions of the cases and the people involved. Thus, some quotations purposefully lack context. The initials ‘IN’ indicate the interviewer, ‘SW’ indicate social worker, and ‘CC’ indicate FGC coordinator throughout. Most family participant voices are indicated by the initials ‘PT’ except where more information (e.g. Mother) is given.</p>
<p>The interviews were rich in detail, complexity, and contradiction. Generally across pods, we found that very few narratives indicated a consistently positive experience for families through the three stages of pre-FGC, FGC, and post-FGC. That does not mean family members were not satisfied with various aspects of the process, and in fact most articulated the value of having everyone in the same room together to discuss a plan. It does mean, however, that even when family members said they were happy with the process or outcome of the FGC, there were other aspects that did not go as well. The themes of voice, participation, and power, although not solicited in interviews, continued to surface and were consistent with the current FGC literature. While there are minor examples of these themes scattered throughout the data set, we have chosen three stories in which they are dramatized. Though family dynamics may in part explain the themes that emerged for family members, the analyses below use a constructionist/Foucauldian approach to spotlight and illustrate the tensions between the discourse of participation and the discourse of child protection, and how they shape the subjectivities of participants.</p>
<sec id="sec9-1468017311410514"><title>Three stories</title>
<sec id="sec10-1468017311410514"><title>Story 1</title>
<p>The first story involves a young single mother who, at the time of our first interview, had her three children taken into government care and was working to have them brought home again. The excerpt below is taken from our pre-FGC interview with her, and she is expressing anxiety about speaking out in the upcoming FGC.<disp-quote>
<p>[IN:] So, what’s making you nervous about it right now?</p>
<p>[PT:] Um, just cause I’ve never been to one before and I don’t know what could happen.</p>
<p>[IN:] What to expect, right?</p>
<p>[PT:] Ya. I’ve been working really hard with the Ministry to get my kids back in my care. It’ll be kind of hard if I get all three of them back at once.</p>
<p>[IN:] So, have you shared these concerns you have about, you know, all the kids all at one time?</p>
<p>[PT:] I tried to talk to my worker but then she just tried to make it sound like I didn’t want them back and I didn’t care about them and that kind of just got me mad and I said, well, if I didn’t care I wouldn’t be here today talking to you, with you in your office. And I just started yelling at her and it was like, you have no right to tell me, the mother of my kids, that I don’t care about them. So. And she wrote that down that I was yelling at her.</p>
<p>[IN:] Ah.</p>
<p>[PT:] Ya. I’m not too sure how good that will look on me when it comes to the time when my kids might get returned … She was saying I have an anger problem. But, like, the only time I ever really got mad was when she just kept on saying ‘you don’t care about your kids, that’s why they’re in care’. It’s like, well, I made my mistakes and I’m here today trying to fix my mistakes.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The mother's power in negotiating a plan for the safety and care of her children prior to the FGC is co-opted at the point when the social worker accuses her of not wanting them back at all. The trajectory for negotiating a gradual return is not only closed, but there is further loss of power when the yelling is documented. The ‘yelling’ becomes reified within the child protection discourse, where its meaning is on its way to becoming an ‘anger problem’ – no longer an assertion of personal frustration and power. At the same time, from the social worker's perspective, she is required to be vigilant about potentially risky behaviours, and we see how this vigilance compels the social worker to be suspicious. Within this discourse of children protection, a mother's ‘anger problem’ will need to be controlled before her children can safely be returned. The participant is learning the discursive practice of child protection: a mother with an ‘anger problem’ is unlikely to have her children returned. This operation of power is the source of the mother's nervousness as she anticipates the FGC.</p>
<p>Does the FGC intervention provide the mother with voice and power in decision-making? Yes and no. Let us review this complication.<disp-quote>
<p>[IN:] What do you think you need to be able to do to get yourself understood in that kind of a space [the FGC]? What would be helpful for you?</p>
<p>[PT:] Usually, like, I’m ok talking to people but I’ve got to say what I have to say first instead of everyone saying what they have to say, because then it just bugs me when everyone talks before me and says how they feel and then if they’re talking about me and how they feel about me then I just, like if it’s bad or if they think it’s bad, I just kind of get mad about it. Ya. Like, I’m just learning, well like, before I knew how to talk to people about how I felt, but with the father of my three kids every time I told him how I felt or showed him how I felt, I’d get beat up for it. So, I’m kind of getting back into the stage where I gotta know that it’s ok without getting smacked or something.</p>
<p>[IN:] So you kind of have some experience being able to do that with [current boyfriend] but you’re still nervous a little bit about being able to do it at this conference.</p>
<p>[PT:] Ya.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A theme for this participant is a history of attempts to voice feelings and concerns, which are met with negative consequences: physical violence from a previous boyfriend, and accusations of not wanting her children from her social worker. In her attempts to be heard, she raises her voice and loses her temper, which then perpetuates further negative consequences. Her strategy for managing the ensuing anxiety about speaking at the FGC is to speak first, before others have a chance to say negative things about her, thereby mitigating the chance that she will lose her temper. The next excerpt is taken from the post-FGC interview:<disp-quote>
<p>[IN:] So, just in a very general sense, how was the conference for you? What worked for you and what didn’t work for you in a very general sense?</p>
<p>[PT:] Well, everything went better than I thought it was going to be.</p>
<p>[IN:] When we spoke last time you were a little concerned that you might not be heard at the conference. How was that for you in the end?</p>
<p>[PT:] Good, ‘cause, um, when it started they asked me what my concerns were and what I was looking forward to. I thought that was kind of cool ‘cause they asked me first because I’m the mother of the kids.</p>
<p>[IN:] So, what was that like for you, then? What did that say to you when that happened? What did that mean to you?</p>
<p>[PT:] It kind of meant a lot because then I knew I was going to be heard because I was the first person.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The participant's experience of the power rendered as the first person talking is consistent with other research in mediation that shows how those who speak first have power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017311410514">Kolb, 1993</xref>). So at this point, we have the impression that the FGC was successful in terms of facilitating her voice. She felt heard and empowered. But let us examine more carefully how this occurs during family time.<disp-quote>
<p>[IN:] Was there anything else that you recall that happened that was useful for you?</p>
<p>[PT:] I think the time where you get to spend with just your family, without the social worker, to try and set up the family plan and that, I think that was useful too.</p>
<p>[IN:] What was it about that private time that allowed you to sort that out that you couldn’t sort out in another way?</p>
<p>[PT:] Well, we could have done it with the social workers and the workers there but I think the whole reason they have it just as family time is ‘cause if, like, there starts to be yelling and that, the workers don’t see it. And that’s the point I was getting to and then I just gave up and told [boyfriend] he could speak on my behalf because I just don’t really like it when I have to yell just to be heard. So then [boyfriend] kind of spoke up and he said well this is what she wants, and this is why she wants it. And then they kind of heard it.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the meaning this participant makes of private family time is that it functions to protect the family from the surveillance of the social worker. As the private family time proceeds, she finds herself near the point of yelling again. This time, though, she abandons the yelling behaviour: ‘I just gave up.’ Although she knows that ‘yelling’ is a behaviour to be controlled, she has not learned a way to express herself using her personal voice, so she traces a new ‘line of flight’: she surrenders her voice to her boyfriend. This strategy is successful, as she says, ‘then they kind of heard it’. So, the mother, realizing the importance of not showing anger, asks her boyfriend to speak for her to protect herself from becoming angry. She has come to know, at some level, the power of the bureaucratic discourse – where rationality, control and certainty are privileged – there is no room for expressions of anger. Family dynamics aside, we see here how the bureaucratic discourse makes its way into the otherwise protected confines of ‘private family time’, shaping the talk and interactions of family participants. But we wonder, at what cost? The FGC experience of voice is complicated: she turns to her trusted partner to voice what is deeply important to her while she demonstrates a limited view of her own power and voice in the context of an FGC experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1468017311410514"><title>Story 2</title>
<p>This was not the only story to show how dominant discourses find their way into the FGC process, shaping peoples’ experiences of power and voice. In our second story, a mother who had had her children removed due to her drug use relates her experience of the FGC. According to interviewees, the social worker claimed at the start of the FGC, with no prior disclosure to the mother or FGC facilitator and in front of all the family members in attendance, that the mother had failed her last drug test. Although the mother and family members expressed shock and asked to see the test, the social worker said it wasn't possible to produce, but that she was sure of the finding. The agenda for the meeting was changed on that basis: instead of a plan for the child to be returned, plans were made for the mother to have supervised visits because she was ‘using’. The following excerpt is from an interview with a family member:<disp-quote>
<p>[PT:] I don’t feel like anything got accomplished at the conference. I feel like the conference went sideways, like half an hour in.</p>
<p>[IN:] Because …</p>
<p>[PT:] Why do I feel it went sideways? Well, I think it went sideways from the moment the social worker showed up with the idea of … claiming that [the mother’s] drug test has shown that she had used, and she didn’t have the results with her. Um, she didn’t have the number in her head of what had gone up and I feel as though [the mother] was blindsided with that information. I feel that it was inappropriate to bring that to the table without having the document with her or the exact figure.</p>
<p>And what turned out is that she’s reading it wrong. So she came to the table and told us all that [the mother] essentially is using drugs. And [the mother] actually got a copy of that, without having to go through the Freedom of Information Act, from [social worker’s] supervisor, and handed that over to her doctor and her doctor stated that is being read wrong, that it is showing that she is not using any cocaine whatsoever and hasn’t. So, the meeting went according to the fact that [the mother]’s drug test has gone up. So, all these supervised visits and all this stuff which we don’t necessarily need to have any more because [the mother]’s already proven to date that she’s not using.</p>
<p>[IN:] And you said you had a sense in the meeting that it didn’t make sense…</p>
<p>[PT:] No, it didn’t make sense at all … Because the supervisor wasn’t there and because the paper, the results weren’t there and nobody had an opportunity to look at them. We were going on what the social worker was saying which was, ‘well, I’m sorry but there’s an increase’. And the meeting went a completely different direction because of it. The meeting wasn’t about, you know, what we wanted it to be about, it ended up we had to backtrack. We had to say, oh ok, well now we’d better make sure that there’s supervised this and that and all the rest of it, because obviously this is what they’re saying. But we didn’t need to do that. The whole meeting was a waste of time.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In follow-up interviews with the FGC coordinator, it was confirmed that the social worker had misread the test, as the participant here describes. The matter was dropped and planning resumed for a shift from supervised visits to return of the children.</p>
<p>The lack of disclosure on the part of the social worker prior to the FGC meeting can be seen as a power play, driven by a forensic discourse (a discourse embedded within legal discourse) that requires constant vigilance on the part of child protection workers. What is also interesting, however, is how the social worker draws from the discourse of science, numbers, and ‘fact’ to strengthen and legitimize her requirement to administer protection and control, and ultimately to retain supervision of the children. The family, protesting and frustrated throughout the FGC, said they knew the mother wasn't using drugs because someone had been with her every day for the past number of months and she was reporting regularly to MCFD. But the family knows that their ‘story’ of proof is no match against ‘scientific’ proof; in this venue, numbers have more power than words. The family cannot defend their personal experience against the claim by the social worker, for there is a ‘document’ with ‘results’ of a ‘drug test’. This measure of truth will command authority – more authority than the voices of the family. Their eye witness testimony and common sense are not strong enough to prevail at the FGC, and the agenda is changed in favour of the social worker's perspective. Here we see how the discourses of bureaucracy (which values efficacy), law (the use of forensic techniques which rely on facts for evidence) and child protection (which values control and outcome) collude to make a strong and compelling case. Collaboration and empowerment are not possible here. This exchange demonstrates how voice has been co-opted by both bureaucratic and legal discourses that are complicit in their reliance on ‘scientific evidence’ to determine truth and ‘[drive] decisions’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017311410514">Nixon et al. (2001)</xref> have suggested. Further, within the discourse of collaboration and empowerment, the ethics of transparency, respect, and accountability have been violated.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1468017311410514"><title>Story 3</title>
<p>In the third narrative, parents were referred to an FGC to plan for more support for care of their two young children. Our pre-FGC interviews with the social worker for the case revealed a desire to have more involvement by relatives. The FGC meeting ended with the parents signing papers giving those relatives shared custody and guardianship. The following excerpts are taken from the follow-up interview with the mother a number of months later.<disp-quote>
<p>[IN:] In the FGCs do you feel that you had the power to say what you needed to say? Were you given space to speak?</p>
<p>[Father:] They let us talk but I don’t think it mattered.</p>
<p>[IN:] So you got to talk, but you don’t feel like you were heard?</p>
<p>[Father:] Ya.</p>
<p>[IN:] How about you? What was that like for you?</p>
<p>[Mother:] I just felt like I was on trial, I suppose. My parenting and my being a parent was on trial, about what kind of parent I am. If I was a good parent or not. Like all these everyday negative things were brought up if I did this wrong, I did that wrong and blah blah blah and here’s what we’re going to do about it … And they did put up on the board what they thought we were doing right, but there was more negative emphasis on it than there was positive. It wasn’t here’s what they’re doing right and here’s how we can support them in the things they aren’t doing so well.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here the mother shows that she understands that the FGC was to have brought attention to and built upon her strengths, but complains how it failed to do so. In fact, her reference that ‘I felt like I was on trial’, suggests that the legal discourse has somehow found its way into the conference. She senses that it is specifically her identity as a mother that is ‘on trial’, repeated in her words ‘my parenting and my being a parent was on trial’. And though this mother comes to the conference acknowledging her limitations as a parent, she is also quite certain that the FGC failed to empower her, and she is insightful about how it failed to do so: the focus was on building a case about her wrongful parenting and did not focus on ‘what they're doing right and here's how we can support them in the things they aren't doing so well’. She is clear that the emphasis on deficits, not strengths, has been humiliating if not disempowering.</p>
<p>Further on, she comments that she and her husband did not feel part of the decision-making process:<disp-quote>
<p>[Mother:] it was sort of like, ok here’s our [Ministry’s] solution to what’s wrong.</p></disp-quote>And, again, she has insight into how this unfolded:<disp-quote>
<p>[IN:] So you don’t feel like you really had any input into that solution?</p>
<p>[Mother:] Well, I just don’t think that everything was looked at, like every solution was looked at, of what – it doesn’t have to be this extreme of turning over half custody of my kids … You know, I wasn’t expecting it to be as difficult as it was emotionally, and I sort of went in there with a lighter view of hope I guess, and came out with feeling less.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>We see here how a dominant agenda set by the social worker diminishes a sense of hope and power for participants. One wonders why other solutions were not explored. In any case, she protests but cannot resist: her power as a mother has been co-opted. Accepting this lack of agency on the part of the mother, we see how neoliberal and legal discourses collude to shape this hopeless experience for her: expediting the care plan (by having the parents sign joint custody papers at the FGC) saves money and resources and is a discursive act that is constituted from a neoliberal discourse of efficiency; at the same time, agenda setting and focus on a legal outcome (joint custody) are discursive acts constituted by the legal discourse where social control is represented in legal contracts to protect the children. We see in this next excerpt the mother's sense of hope consequently severely diminished:<disp-quote>
<p>[IN:] You came out with less hope than when you went in?</p>
<p>[Mother:] Just all these negative things came down and the weight hit … and it was like, I felt almost depressed. Like, you know, I’m such a terrible person and a terrible mother. All these negative things.</p>
<p>I know what they were saying, you know, had some sound to it. But I guess I suppose I could say that my perception was different. I didn’t see it as heavy as they nailed it down. You know, they sealed and nailed the coffin shut. Like there was no word that I could get in there. But it [family situation] wasn’t as bad as they made the picture to be … There was no way to escape, you know.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The participant uses a powerful metaphor – ‘they sealed and nailed the coffin shut’ – to describe her experience: she reveals, along with a loss of hope, her loss of agency in both the decision that was made, as well her ability to make a future decision about the care of her children. The seriousness of this loss of agency becomes apparent as she describes her disempowered bodily experience: ‘things came down and the weight hit… and it was like, I felt almost depressed’. Disempowerment is not just a psychological experience – it is bodily. And should this experience be sustained, the ‘depression’ could be used as another justification for social control: children must be protected from depressed mothers. For the mother, this FGC is not collaborative, and it certainly is not empowering.</p>
<p>As a follow up, she is asked what she would have wanted the FGC to look like:<disp-quote>
<p>[IN:] What would you have wanted it to look like?</p>
<p>[Mother:] Well I don’t know. I guess sort of the same thing but not so legal. So, sort of the co-parenting and the helping us out. More help.</p>
<p>[IN:] But not a legal …</p>
<p>[Mother:] Not a binding relationship like, well, they [relatives] have the power over us and they’re just going to make these rules and we just sit back on our butt.</p>
<p>[IN:] You said also you didn’t like the legality of the current arrangement with your [relatives]. What is it that you don’t like about that?</p>
<p>[Mother:] I suppose to be 100% honest, it’s the fact that I feel like I’ve lost my children, I’ve lost power over them, I’ve lost control over them. I’ve lost the right to say anything over my children. It was like all of a sudden ‘we’re making up this rule and you can’t cuddle [three-year-old child] when he goes to bed. You have to just stick him in there and send him off to bed.’ And [child] keeps telling me, ‘Mommy stay with me I’m scared. I don’t want to go to sleep alone. I don’t want to be alone.’ I think, well I have to leave you alone because that’s the way the [relative’s] rule is.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>And now we see the connection between lack of participation in the FGC and the loss of power to participate in parenting: the powerful discourse of child enforcement and social control has trickled into the relationship between a mother and child. Here, for the mother, the power of the legal discourse is omnipotent: she takes the legal contract literally – she no longer has ‘care and control’ of her children. She experiences how the legal decision of joint custody takes away her ability to engage in everyday acts of mothering: she protests this parenting rule that she cannot cuddle her son when he goes to bed, though feels powerless to do otherwise. But the legal discourse's ability to exert power and limit the mother's voice does not stop here, as the following excerpt demonstrates.<disp-quote>
<p>[IN:] So you’re going to return to another FGC, I understood you to say. [nods yes] So is that an issue you can return to and have a discussion about, do you think?</p>
<p>[Mother:] I’m not really sure. I mean, from the sounds of it, it sounds like it’s going to be a long time before I get that control back of parenting .… I don’t think I’m going to have any power to wave anything around.</p>
<p>[IN:] Why? [Mother:] Because I suppose, in some small manner, it feels like a trial, that when the glove goes down [the social worker] has the last say as to what happens legally .… And if I say, you know, I’d like my children back blah blah blah, this is what I’d like the solution to look like, you know, she has the power to veto and say, well I’m saying you’re not getting your children back until you do this and this and this.</p>
<p>[IN:] And what is the ‘this and this and this’? Like what are they expecting you and [Father] to do before you get your children back?</p>
<p>[Mother:] I am still in the process of sort of trying to find that out.</p>
<p>[IN:] By the way, let me just ask you, did anybody in the process suggest that you get legal advice before signing the custody papers?</p>
<p>[Mother:] No.</p>
<p>[IN:] You didn’t get legal advice.</p>
<p>[Mother:] No.</p>
<p>[IN:] And nobody suggested it. Ok.</p>
<p>[Mother:] Ya, I wish now that I had had legal advice before I had actually – I sort of felt that I had to sign it and there was no alternative. The gavel was down, and that’s what I’m doing.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The way the legal discourse has come to have power in this conference is important: co-optation of the FGC has resulted in a poorly situated legal process. For the social worker, it provides a tool to exert social control to protect the child. But for the mother, the FGC as a quasi-legalistic process wields a powerful influence (‘I sort of felt I had to sign it’), while at the same time denying her the protection of her rights that a more fully ‘legalistic’ process would have (i.e. with legal counsel). She did not know this coming into the FGC, but she does now. She would likely now agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017311410514">Connolly and McKenzie's (1999)</xref> observation that the FGC rhetoric can be used ‘to mask the very real coercive power that responsible authorities have over families judged to be irresponsible’ (p. 12). From her perspective, there is more at risk within the parameters of the FGC than there would have been in the status quo system: there are no legal safeguards for her here. Outcome is privileged over process. As a result, her experience of this FGC has been coercive, not collaborative and her voice has been smothered by a legal discourse administered by the social worker.</p>
<p>Her interpretation of the situation is confirmed in the same-day interview we did with the social worker:<disp-quote>
<p>[SW:] it’s great that [mother] has made some changes to empower herself but I think this is permanent – it has to be a permanent arrangement with the kids being overseen by the [relatives]. And I have told the parents that if there were any concerns about incidents in the future regarding the kids, and the care of the kids that I would ask the [relatives] to look at sole custody. And that sits very difficult for the parents because they feel that oh, we’re not involved with the kids because the kids are not [in the same living space]. I think that that’s becoming better. They’re getting more comfortable with the fact that, you know we’re still involved, and it’s just a piece of paper, so I see them as more relaxed around that but I know that at the next FGC that will bring up a lot of pain again. But nothing can change in my eyes.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The words ‘and it's just a piece of paper’ speak volumes about the contradictory meanings made of the action of signing shared custody papers: the parents’ experience of disempowerment is lost on the social worker. As well, we learn that any future concerns about ‘incidents’ and/or ‘care’ of the children is threatened with a more severe legal manoeuvre (joint custody to sole custody). This could explain the mother's lack of confidence and nervousness in nurturing her children. The social worker also appears to mistake the parents’ acquiescence about the situation (that is, their sense of lack of power to change it), instead being under the impression that ‘they're getting more comfortable’. In this case, the social worker seems to have no cognizance of the parents’ loss of voice, and that the FGC process has brought them a sense of disempowerment that is exactly contradictory to the philosophy and aims of FGCs.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1468017311410514" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Family group conferencing exists in a political context that is, at different times, favourable, unfavourable, or indifferent to its practice. Dominant discourses and ideologies (i.e. the way the child protection system ‘thinks’), as well as institutional arrangements (i.e. the way the child protection system ‘works’), shape how the FGC is implemented.</p>
<p>In this article we explore how this co-optation can happen. By tracing the trajectory of power we describe three stories that demonstrate how FGC coordinators and child protection workers participate in the administration of an FGC to serve the larger project of social control and how the collaborative process that is intended to empower participants is marginalized. We show how FGC coordinators are often absent in their ability to balance power, while the child protection worker actively sets the agenda and administers the dominant discourses that override the FGC participatory discourse. We reveal ways that FGC participants describe themselves as disempowered, lacking trust, and disenfranchised. We have also seen in these stories how participants’ voices were co-opted by the more forceful child protection discourse, itself shaped by legal, bureaucratized, and neoliberal discourses: in each case participants’ experience of power was subjugated, even though, in each instance, the case was perceived to have had a successful outcome by the social worker and FGC coordinator.</p>
<p>In Story 1 the participant spoke of her struggles to be heard during the FGC preparation and thereafter; her experience was mixed, but ultimately she never found an internal voice to assert herself during the family group conference. We saw how the bureaucratic discourse co-opted her voice during this process. In Story 2, the power of a forensic/legal discourse – that values fact, certainty, and scientific evidence – brought legitimacy to results of an (inaccurately interpreted) drug test. The drug test had such authority, it was able to co-opt the eye witness testimony and consensus from the family, leading to supervision actions. And finally, in Story 3 we see how legal and neoliberal discourses collude to shape actions that privilege avoidance of litigation, an interest in expediency, and containment of costs: for this to happen, we saw a change in legal custody during the FGC – guised as ‘family support’ – which violated the individual rights of parents who relinquished custody of their children. In sum, the study reveals the capacity of dominant discourses to leak into and then override a subjugated discourse. We have demonstrated how this subjugation denies voice and participation. Ultimately, a child-centred practice is lost. Failure to mobilize a politics of FGC then allows other political actors (those with power like supervisors, child protection workers, and even FGC coordinators) to unknowingly appropriate the FGC and employ it towards their own instrumental and administrative ends.</p>
<p>Our conclusions are made recognizing the day-to-day challenges social workers face when trying to engage these practices: increasing scrutiny of their actions (in a risk management world); media vigilance (especially when something goes wrong); and increasing demands for greater efficiency and shrinking budgets. But we are resolute that, if those involved in administering and delivering family group conferencing continue to at least be aware of this politics, then the possibility exists to realize FGC's broader social justice and transformative goals. Further, a reflective practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017311410514">Schön, 1991</xref>) can mitigate the possibility of co-optation from particular bureaucratic, legal, and neoliberal discourses which dominate at different times, and which are incompatible with the inherent values and objectives of the FGC. Professionals (administrators, child protection workers, and family group conference coordinators) who are involved in implementing this intervention can become savvy actors who are capable of navigating this political world.</p>
<p>We leave this work on a positive note. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311410514">Ferguson (1984)</xref> forecasts that ‘[t]he bureaucratization of society is not an irredeemable inexorable fate but rather an ongoing social and historical process, one that generates its own contradictions, that requires continuous maintenance by those in power, and that can be resisted’ (p. xii). We concur with her notion of agency, as it reminds us to be mindful of the fuller effects of discourse on our way of being and the choices we make. This notion of agency extends to the FGC itself. The FGC is not an event, fixed in time and place; it is always reinventing and re-describing itself, either as an act of resistance or to comply with ever changing discourses.</p>
<p>As we hope these stories make apparent, for FGC to live up to its transformative potential, there needs to be a deeper understanding of the political context within which the FGC is situated and through which it operates so that FGCs may be more effectively implemented as a strategy of collaborative decision-making.</p>
