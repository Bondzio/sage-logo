<abstract>
<p>Based on a qualitative study of 48 teenage mothers living in the Denver metropolitan area, this research examines the loss of multiple attachments, including mothers, siblings, and other extended family members and friends, among African American and Latina girls who become young mothers. Through life history narratives, this article explores the isolating effects of teen motherhood on the relational world of young mothers and the transition to “forced autonomy” that emerges out of the relationship strains in the teen mothers’ lives. Faced with ruptures in significant childhood attachments and strains in the mother–daughter bond, young mothers develop strategies of accommodation to cope with the disruptions to connectivity and the demands of forced autonomy that are the result of early motherhood. These findings are interpreted through the frame of self-in-relation theory as this theoretical perspective has been informed by the scholarship on race and ethnicity. In reengaging the discourse on race, class, and gender, our findings contribute to the field in a number of significant and related ways: first, through an investigation into relationship loss and repair among teen mothers; second, by addressing the conditions under which teen mothers gain acceptance in their families; and third, in applying self-in-relation theory to the experience of adolescent girls of color whose relational lives are disrupted by the stigma and adversity of teen motherhood.</p>

<p>Teen parenthood is prevalent in the United States, with one in every six U.S. girls becoming a mother before age 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891243212459073">Perper and Manlove 2009</xref>). Today, African American girls are twice as likely, and Latina girls nearly three times as likely, to become teen mothers as are white girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891243212459073">Hamilton, Martin, and Ventura 2010</xref>). Beginning in the 1970s, research on African American and Latina teen mothers has tended to focus on the cultural acceptability of young motherhood, stressing the high status of motherhood and the value of children in African American and Latino/a communities, even under conditions of hardship and stress. To explain the trends in early pregnancy among African American and Latina teenagers, scholars have frequently stressed the cultural validation and social support networks provided by the teenager’s family and extended kinship relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891243212459073">Erickson 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891243212459073">Geronimus 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891243212459073">Stack 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891243212459073">Sudarkasa 1997</xref>). In contrast to the prevailing research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891243212459073">Elaine Bell Kaplan’s (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891243212459073">1997</xref>) groundbreaking ethnography of Black teenage mothers revealed a different and much harsher portrait of the lives of teen mothers. Challenging the perception that these young women were supported by their families and communities, she found instead that they “were deprived of every resource needed for a human being to function in society,” including “love and respect and the ability to securely connect with others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891243212459073">Kaplan 1997</xref>, 10). In particular, her work illuminated the strains in mother–daughter relationships and the often unresolved conflicts that early motherhood created within Black families.</p>
<p>Our research returns to the study of relationship impoverishment among teen mothers of color. Some 30 years after Kaplan first conducted her research, much of the work in this area continues to ignore the relational and psychosocial consequences of early parenting, focusing more heavily on predictors of early motherhood and the socioeconomic and health hardships that teen mothers face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891243212459073">Driscoll et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891243212459073">Furstenberg 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891243212459073">Henretta 2007</xref>). These studies, while important, offer little in the way of a relational analysis of teen mother’s lives as they transition from adolescence and childhood into young adulthood and early parenting. At the same time, the literature on relationships and girls’ development, while extensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891243212459073">Brown and Gilligan 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891243212459073">Gilligan 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891243212459073">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891243212459073">Jordan and Hartling 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891243212459073">Jordan, Surrey, and Kaplan 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891243212459073">West 2005</xref>), has, as Kaplan pointed out in her work, rarely addressed the emotionally impoverished conditions in which teen mothers struggle to become parents. To fill what we see as an important gap in both the teen mother literature and relational theory, our work brings together the study of teen parenting and an exploration into relational development among African American and Latina adolescents.</p>
<p>Based on an analysis of life history narratives, the findings of our research suggest a complicated and relationally difficult transition to parenthood for African American and Latina girls who, as teen mothers, experience rejection and a loss of acceptance within the family and the larger relational community. Faced with ruptures in significant childhood attachments and strains in the mother–daughter bond, young mothers develop strategies of accommodation to cope with the disruptions to connectivity and the demands of forced autonomy that are the result of early motherhood. Using a relational paradigm of women’s development, these findings are interpreted through the frame of self-in-relation theory as this theoretical perspective has been informed by the scholarship on race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>As a study of teen pregnancy among young women of color, our research, in reengaging the discourse on race, class, and gender, contributes to the field of teen pregnancy in a number of significant and related ways: first, through an investigation into relationship loss and repair among teen mothers; second, by addressing the conditions under which teen mothers gain acceptance in the family; and third, in applying self-in-relation theory to the experience of adolescent girls of color whose relational lives are disrupted by the stigma and adversity of teen motherhood. Overall, our research brings a contemporary qualitative lens to the study of teen pregnancy and breaks new ground in interrogating the complex ways in which teen mothers negotiate the disruption in relationships and the rebuilding of emotional support systems in response to loss and separation.</p>
<p>Our analysis thus addresses a number of important findings that illuminate the relational world of teen mothers and the socioemotional dynamics that influence the psychosocial development of adolescent girls whose lives are transformed by early motherhood. Among the most important of our findings are those that relate to the relational losses that result from teen pregnancy and the attending separation from adult mothers and other early childhood attachments. Accordingly, we review the foundational principles of the self-in-relation paradigm and how this feminist approach to girls’ psychological development has been informed by the literature on race and ethnicity.</p>

<title>The Self-In-Relation: Race, Ethnicity, and the Relational Paradigm</title>
<p>Beginning with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891243212459073">Nancy Chodorow (1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891243212459073">1978</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891243212459073">Jean Baker Miller (1976)</xref>, the relational paradigm of girls’ growth and development emerged in response to the male-centered models of psychosocial maturation that highlighted the importance of separateness, individuation, and autonomy for healthy transitions into adulthood. In challenging the traditional psychosocial models of development, in which girls, because of their connectivity, were consistently represented as less mature, less developed, and less moral than boys, feminist scholars sought to reinterpret the connective aspects of girls’ development, showing that connectivity enhances rather than undermines a girl’s sense of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891243212459073">Gilligan 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891243212459073">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891243212459073">Jordan and Hartling 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891243212459073">Jordan, Surrey, and Kaplan 1991</xref>). Among the most transformative works in this field was Carol Gilligan’s groundbreaking text <italic>In a Different Voice</italic>, in which she explained that while separation, autonomy, and independence are the typical paths toward adulthood for boys and young men, connectedness and interdependency are normative for girls and young women:
<disp-quote>
<p>Relationships, and particularly issues of dependency, are experienced differently by women and men. For boys and men, separation and individuation are critically tied to gender identity since separation from the mother is essential for the development of masculinity. For girls and women, issues of femininity or feminine identity do not depend on the achievement of separation from the mother or on the progress of individuation. . . . Thus males tend to have difficulty with relationships, while females tend to have problems with individuation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891243212459073">1982</xref>, 8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Gilligan continued to develop and expand her work on relationality, her research with adolescent girls over the past three decades has confirmed the centrality of relationships to girls’ development and women’s sense of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891243212459073">Gilligan 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891243212459073">Gilligan, Lyons, and Hanmer 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891243212459073">Gilligan and Machoian 2002</xref>). Her work, along with that of Lyn Mikel Brown, has focused on adolescence as a particularly difficult transition for girls, who must balance the needs of attachment with the development of an authentic self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891243212459073">Brown and Gilligan 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891243212459073">Gilligan 2011</xref>). According to Gilligan, for girls, maintaining relationships often means playing out the scripts of “womanhood” as defined by patriarchy, resulting in the suppression of feelings, thoughts, and actions to avoid exclusion and isolation. Further, in responding to essentializing interpretations of the self-in-relation paradigm, Gilligan strongly emphasizes the role that patriarchal socialization and expectations play in reproducing gender binaries through which relationality and an ethic of care become the domain of women, and autonomy and moral agency the domain of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891243212459073">Gilligan 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Following Gilligan and Chodorow, the self-in-relation school has produced a plethora of scholarship that has reframed girls’ development through the values of connection and attachment. Central to this theoretical model is the role that empathic attachment plays in a girl’s relational world, and especially the importance of the mother–daughter bond:
<disp-quote>
<p>Here we are describing the girl’s open relationship with the mother and the mother’s open relationship with the daughter as the beginning stage for the development of the self-in-relation. The second key aspect of this relationship is the child’s increasing capacity for mutual empathy, developed in a matrix of emotional connectedness. . . . Through the girl’s awareness and identification with her mother as the “mothering one” and through her mother’s interest in being understood and cared for, the daughter as well as the mother becomes mobilized to care for, respond to, or attend to the well-being and development of the other. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891243212459073">Surrey 1991</xref>, 56)</p>

<title>The Intersection of Feminist and Race Perspectives on the Self-In-Relation</title>
<p>Feminist race scholars, in problematizing this self-in-relation perspective, have highlighted the importance of other caretakers, in addition to the biological mother, for the emotional development of daughters. In their work on Chicana/o family structure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891243212459073">Segura and Pierce (1993)</xref> stressed the significance of cultural specificity, elaborating on the importance of nonexclusive mothering in the Chicana/o family. In particular, their research stresses the value of familism (extended family networks, including grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts, and siblings) and <italic>compadres</italic> (godparents) in the socioemotional development of both daughters and sons in Mexican American culture.</p>
<p>Similarly, Patricia Hill Collins, drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891243212459073">Rosalie Troester (1984)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891243212459073">Carol Stack (1974)</xref>, discusses the multiple forms of mothering that have traditionally defined African American families where children are mothered by “bloodmothers,” “othermothers,” and “fictive kin” who participate in the caretaking of children and thus inform the development of daughters. As Collins explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>In many African American communities, fluid and changing boundaries often distinguish biological mothers from other women who care for children. Biological mothers, or bloodmothers, are expected to care for their children. But African-American communities have also recognized that vesting one person with full responsibility of mothering a child may not be wise or possible. As a result, othermothers—women who assist bloodmothers by sharing mothering responsibilities—have been central to the institution of Black motherhood. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891243212459073">2000</xref>, 192)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Taken together, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891243212459073">Segura and Pierce (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891243212459073">Collins (2000)</xref> strongly suggests that the relational selves of African American and Latina girls emerge out of a complex social network of caretakers that includes mothers as well as extended family members (grandmothers, aunts, sisters) and nonbiological kinship ties. Thus, the personality development of Latina and African American girls is shaped by the social bonds of connection and relationality that characterize diverse family structures. The self-in-relation perspective, as conceptualized by feminist race scholars, provides a good starting point from which to consider the effects of teen parenting on both the mother–daughter bond and other significant attachments that inform the development of the relational self among young women of color. Our study highlights the experiences of Latina and African American teen mothers, focusing both on differences between them as well as the substantial similarities that arose in our analysis.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study is based on in-depth interviews with 18 African American and 30 Latina young women living in the Denver metropolitan area. The vast majority of the respondents were born in Colorado or in other parts of the United States. Between 2008 and 2009, participants for the study were recruited from two sites: a school for teen mothers and a city hospital clinic where young mothers and their children received medical services. These sites served different populations. Participants from the school were typically younger, and although they had fewer personal and family resources than the clinic participants, they received greater outside support from the school in the form of child care, bus passes, career counseling, parenting clinics, and basic medical and psychological services. By comparison, participants from the clinic were frequently older (18 or 19 years old), more often stayed at home or worked for pay rather than attending school, and received less support from public services.</p>
<p>We recruited participants through flyers that were posted at the sites and given to participants to share with friends. School or clinic staff also handed out flyers and described the study to teens they identified as eligible. To be eligible for the study, participants must have had a child before turning 20. Nearly all participants were enrolled in the study through onsite recruitment, and each respondent was given a $35 gift certificate for her willingness to participate in the study. Our participants gave birth to their first child at ages ranging from 14 to 19; the average age at first birth was 17. The average age of their oldest child was 1½ years. At the time of the interview, most participants had babies or toddlers, but a few had older children. Almost all of the respondents were living with their children and most were living with other adults, including parents, siblings, and/or other extended family members. A small number of respondents who were no longer adolescents were living either on their own or with partners.</p>
<p>Because our sample was drawn from a regional high school and a metropolitan hospital, our respondents came from a diverse number of geographic areas in the Denver metropolitan region and were not concentrated in any one neighborhood. Although we cannot provide a descriptive context of the living conditions and neighborhoods of our respondents as other qualitative studies have done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891243212459073">Edin and Kefalas 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891243212459073">Kaplan 1997</xref>), the interviews revealed that the vast majority of the participants were living in low-income households where resources were scarce and where teen pregnancy had caused economic hardship for the families of the teen mothers. Further, given that the participants were in school and/or seeking medical care, the study is limited to teen mothers who took some initiative in obtaining resources and furthering their life goals.</p>
<p>Following a semistructured interview guide, we collected life history narratives from the young mothers. During the course of the interviews, we asked respondents to describe their experiences with early pregnancy and teen mothering. The open-ended questions focused on which relationships were most important to them and whom they turned to for emotional support and guidance throughout their pregnancy and transition to parenthood. We also asked the participants to talk about what was most difficult for them in their lives and how they viewed and understood their relationship to their children. The interviews lasted between 45 minutes and an hour and a half and were conducted under conditions of confidentiality. Once the interviews were completed, they were transcribed and imported into the NVivo qualitative software package. Both authors read entire transcripts and identified important themes that emerged from the data.</p>
<p>Each participant spoke with one or two interviewers from our research team, which consisted of two female faculty members and one male and two female students. One of the student researchers had been a teen mother. With the exception of one student interviewer, all of the researchers were white. Members of the research team were a decade or more older than the participants and came from a diversity of class backgrounds. Establishing rapport sometimes took time, perhaps because of the age and racial/ethnic differences between the majority of the research team and the respondents. For the most part, however, the young mothers were eager to talk and share their life experiences with us, some having few other places where they could openly and honestly share their feelings and perspectives on the paths their lives had taken and the challenges they had encountered along the way. As the interviews progressed, we became aware of the deep emotional responses that our study engendered among many teen mothers, as they recalled and relived the fears, tensions, and joys of early motherhood. We thus realized that our participants had placed trust in us as researchers and that we had a responsibility to represent the emotional complexities of their demanding lives. Throughout the data-gathering phase of the project, the research team met regularly to review the interview process for biases and assumptions and to discuss our emotional responses to the life stories of the teen mothers.</p>

<title>Early Motherhood, Maternal Loss, and the Disruption in Multiple Attachments</title>
<p>In bringing together the impact of race, class, and gender on teen mothers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891243212459073">Kaplan (1997)</xref> found that the path to early motherhood was marked by maternal conflict, family strain, and community impoverishment. Thus, she concluded that early motherhood was a survival strategy among isolated and unwanted young Black women who sought love and connection. By comparison, our findings suggest a somewhat different emotional trajectory, in which relationship impoverishment was a result, rather than a cause, of teen pregnancy. Although a portion of the teen mothers described disruptive connections with their mothers and other significant family and community members prior to becoming pregnant, the vast majority of respondents indicated that the break with their emotional and social support system occurred in response to teen motherhood. This is not to say that the young women in our study did not talk about strict parents with whom they argued or overworked mothers who had little time for their children. Such narratives, however, were framed within an overall positive view of the mother–daughter/family culture that changed as a result of the daughter’s pregnancy.</p>
<sec id="section5-0891243212459073">
<title>Strains in the Mother–Daughter Relationship</title>
<p>Because few of our respondents had planned to become pregnant, and because over half of the participants did not believe it would actually happen to them, they described being both surprised and scared when their pregnancy became real. In the following account, an African American participant who gave birth during her senior year in high school recalled both the shock she felt when she realized she was pregnant and the fear of her mother’s response, even though they had previously shared a close relationship:
<disp-quote>
<p>It was a shock. I was like, “What?” It was kind of like I had to sit down. I didn’t cry. I wasn’t, like, sad, but it was just like almost how everybody says, “Oh my God, my life is over!” . . . Oh, I was so scared. . . . I didn’t tell my mom right away, but we were at K-Mart and my mom was like, “You don’t need pads [sanitary napkins] yet.” I was like, “No,” and she was like, “Oh, all right.” So then she just acted like nothing was wrong. And then we got home, she was like, “Go pee in this cup!” I was like, “OK.” And I did it, like nothing was gonna happen. And then next thing I heard, she was yelling at somebody, like to the dad, and she was saying, “My daughter’s pregnant and you need to get over here right now, if you don’t do what you’re supposed to do then you will never see another day!” OK, I thought, “Oh my God, this is bad!” She wasn’t OK.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A Latina teen mother who also became pregnant during her senior year of high school described her conflicting feelings about the pregnancy and her reluctance to tell her mother:
<disp-quote>
<p>I thought I wasn’t gonna be pregnant till I was, like, 30. I didn’t want to be pregnant until I was 30. I didn’t want to have a kid. I wanted to finish my studies first. . . . I didn’t tell my mom until three months into the pregnancy. She felt sad. She was disappointed. Probably because I’m her only daughter and because she wanted me to finish my studies and get married before I had a baby. It was really hard telling her and it changed our relationship, though she is a little better now that my son is born.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As these accounts reveal, the responses of the participants’ mothers ranged from anger to sadness and disappointment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891243212459073">Kaplan (1997)</xref>, finding similar results, argued that the anger of adult mothers can best be understood within a framework of class relations. According to Kaplan, within poorer families, adult mothers felt that a teen pregnancy dashed their aspirations for their daughters, through whom they had hoped to fulfill their own dreams for a better life and upward mobility. In a somewhat related finding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891243212459073">Edin and Kefalas (2005</xref>, 65) concluded that in the poor neighborhood of Philadelphia in which their study took place,
<disp-quote>
<p>it is not the news of the pregnancy itself that provokes the greatest regret, but the realization that one’s child will not be the rare exception to the neighborhood rule—the one who avoids early pregnancy, finishes high school, completes college, gets married, moves to the suburbs, and has children—in that order.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, the accounts of teen mothers in our study suggest that at the heart of the adult mother’s anger is fear for their daughter’s future and loss of social mobility. Thus, the disruption in the mother–daughter bond for both African American and Latina respondents is tied to the harsh economic and social conditions in which the teen mother’s family lives and that affect other important familial relationships. Accordingly, the disappointment and anger expressed by mothers is also found among other women in the family, including grandmothers and sisters, who similarly viewed the pregnancy as a catastrophic change in the life course of the teen mother.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0891243212459073">
<title>Rejection and Loss within the Larger Family</title>
<p>In comparison with the African American respondents, for the Latina teen mothers, the withdrawal of a grandmother’s support was especially disruptive, since these extended family members formed a significant part of the teen mother’s kinship network. Many of the Latina teen respondents reported that the loss of their grandmother’s love was particularly difficult for them. Because, as Segura and Pierce suggest, “a Chicana may experience herself, thus, not only as an extension of her mother but also her grandmother” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891243212459073">Segura and Pierce 1993</xref>, 77), the daughter’s break with the grandmother compounded her separation from her mother. In the following account, a Latina participant who gave birth to her first child at the age of 15 spoke of the rejection by her grandmother, from whom she tried to conceal the pregnancy:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s very interesting because my grandma on my dad’s side, she’s very religious, very Catholic. She was wondering how it happened and she was so upset. I just found it so weird, because she’s really Catholic and she’s telling me to get an abortion. And I already knew what I was going to do, but I didn’t really want to tell her because my grandma, I didn’t want to hurt her. And then I guess my dad told her. I guess she was really upset, because I visit her every summer and that visit, she just scolded me the whole time. She was just like, “You have just messed up your life. You’re so young. You could still have all this, a life ahead of you, and you’re having a baby.”</p>

<p>It is significant to note that, in this and other instances, the responses of the grandmothers were rooted in fears for the granddaughter’s future. In the case just cited, the fears were great enough to override the grandmother’s strong Catholic belief system. Given the role of the church and religion in the Latina/o community, we had expected religion to be an important factor in both the Latina mother’s and grandmother’s anger at the daughter. In fact, the narratives revealed little concern over the violation of religious and social mores among women in both Latina/o and African American families, although such concerns were often the cause of relationship abandonment on the part of male family members. In a small but significant number of cases, the participants spoke of rejection by the men and boys in their families, whose anger and disappointment had moral overtones. Here, a young Latina woman describes the loss of her grandfather as a result of her pregnancy:
<disp-quote>
<p>The only one who made me feel really bad was my grandpa. He was like, “Oh well, you’re pregnant, you’re really young, you know it’s wrong.” . . . For a really long time I was my grandpa’s only grandchild. I was really close to him. So I kind of took it hard, because I was close to my grandpa, but I was younger. And then once I got pregnant, it kind of changed. . . . We really don’t talk any more. . . . I can’t talk to him like I used to talk to him, ’cause I am not his little girl any more.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, an African American respondent, who was 19 at the time of the interview, poignantly recalled how both her father and brother distanced themselves from her when she became pregnant at 16:
<disp-quote>
<p>When my dad found out, he was heartbroken, you could tell. My dad’s one of those people that keeps his emotions inside, so he really doesn’t talk to you or express anything but you could tell he was really heartbroken. . . . My big brother was mad, because he was like, “I knew you was pregnant!” so he didn’t talk to me for a while. . . . He wanted me to be such a lady or so much—you know. I don’t know what it was. But my big brother, it hurt him. I’m pretty sure why it hurt him, I’m his little sister. He didn’t want nobody to get his little sister pregnant. And my dad, because my dad has always been quiet our whole life as far as expressing his love or his feelings for us. But I could tell he didn’t want no one to get his daughter pregnant.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Narratives such as these reveal a sense of shame on the part of teen mothers, whose rejection by fathers, grandfathers, and brothers is related to concerns over sexuality and promiscuity. The disappointment on the part of significant family members led the girls to feel as if they had let their fathers, grandfathers, and brothers down by becoming pregnant and thus shaming the family. In the previous quote, the brother’s rage is fueled by the loss of respectability that his sister’s pregnancy represented, as she was no longer considered “a lady” in his eyes. In these cases, the daughters were made to feel particularly bad by the men in the family who, through withdrawal and distancing, communicated their disapproval and hurt.</p>
<p>Within families, then, the impetus for the break with the daughter tended to vary with gender. For both African American and Latina mothers, grandmothers, and sisters, anger at the daughter focused on lost opportunity and a doomed future. In comparison, for fathers, grandfathers, and brothers, anger and disappointment were usually linked to concerns over family respectability and the moral violation associated with teen pregnancy. Here again, our findings differ somewhat from those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891243212459073">Kaplan (1997)</xref>, who found that respectability, as it relates to teen pregnancy, was of particular importance to Black middle-class mothers, though working-class and poor mothers also voiced moral condemnation.</p>

<title>The Loss of Friendship</title>
<p>In turning to relationships outside the family, moral condemnation proved to be a source of rejection and disruption within teen mothers’ peer cultures. Contrary to media representations of teenage girls forming “pregnancy pacts” or social networks that encourage early parenting, the findings of our study indicate that many of the young women who became pregnant found themselves socially isolated by their peers and former close friends who, rather than supporting the pregnancy, expressed disapproval and withdrew from the relationship. In one case, a Latina respondent recalled how difficult it was for her to attend school once her pregnancy became known, with the other girls referring to her as a “slut” and “gross.” Another respondent reported that many of her close girlfriends stopped talking to her when she became pregnant. A third participant described how things changed with her best friend:
<disp-quote>
<p>My friend was so mad when I told her. She was my best friend. She was so mad, and I could never hang out with her anymore. It’s hard to go to the movies or just be together. We had been best friends forever. I was really surprised, but she was so mad at me, and now she is not my best friend any more.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The rejection and/or condemnation of African American and Latina teen mothers on the part of their friends is illustrative of the wider social/sexual dilemmas facing adolescents in a society that both sexualizes and stigmatizes teenage girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891243212459073">Lamb and Brown 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891243212459073">Schalet 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891243212459073">Tolman 2002</xref>). Deborah Tolman’s work on girls’ sexuality confirms that the “so-called Madonna-whore split is surprisingly alive” within teenage culture, and that “the threat of being labeled a slut still looms large for teenage girls, despite the pressure to be sexual in relationships with boys” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891243212459073">Tolman 2002</xref>, 11). For African American and Latina girls, the effects of sexualization are intensified by the dominant culture’s portrayal of women of color as highly sexualized and young women of color as sexually available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891243212459073">Collins 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891243212459073">Davis 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891243212459073">Lamb and Brown 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891243212459073">Rubin, Fitts, and Becker 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891243212459073">Tolman 2002</xref>). In becoming pregnant, teen mothers are particularly vulnerable to the destructive aspects of negative stereotyping, both within the larger society and among their peers, as the following account of an African American participant suggests:
<disp-quote>
<p>I get so much negative, like I guess when people see that I have a young face and I have two kids with me, they automatically think that I’m either a slut and I just sleep around, I probably don’t know who my babies’ dad is, I probably don’t take care of them. I found out that when I was pregnant, walking around with a big stomach and you’re 15 you get dirty looks, even from your friends. I just stopped caring.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This account illuminates the young mother’s awareness of the racial stereotyping surrounding teen mothers of color and the assumptions that are often made about the teen mother’s lack of morality. At the same time, this account also suggests that teen mothers are further stigmatized by their friends who, in many cases, appear to have adopted the negative attitudes of the larger society.</p>

<sec id="section8-0891243212459073">
<title>The Break with the Child’s Father</title>
<p>The loss of friendship and negative labeling that teen mothers experienced is further deepened by the loss of the baby’s father as a romantic partner and emotional connection. At the time of our interviews, nearly 70 percent of the respondents in our study were no longer in this relationship, although in a number of cases the father maintained a connection to the child for whom he provided some type of informal economic support. For the most part, however, pregnancy led to a rupture between the young mother and the father, even if the father had at first been encouraging and supportive of the pregnancy. Here a 17-year-old Latina respondent discusses the feelings of romantic rejection and abandonment that often accompany pregnancy and early mothering:
<disp-quote>
<p>Me and her dad had been together for three years and I knew I was young but I felt like, “OK, I’m OK to take care of a baby.” So we planned on having her. He was really happy. We both wanted to have a girl. We were both really excited. . . . But I could say that when she was first born, he didn’t want to be in her life at all, really. The first month he was there, he was really excited and all that. The second month, he just started . . . he actually likes to party a lot and stuff, so he started going out and partying. I was telling him I needed him to be there with me, and he didn’t want to. So the third month, I broke up with him, when she was three months old.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a number of cases, the break with the father also led to strains with the father’s parents, who, prior to the pregnancy, had been a source of connection and attachment for the participant, frequently assuming the role of fictive kin or godparents. In the following account, a Latina respondent explains the hurt and anger she felt when the paternal grandparents questioned her sexual morality and the paternity of the child, at the same time that the baby’s father began to pull away:
<disp-quote>
<p>I met all his family and they treated me fine, but when it was time for my daughter to be born, his [the father’s] father was, like, “Let’s get a DNA test.” I was, like, “You guys are stupid. Your son was the first person I ever slept with. I got pregnant the first time I did anything, and you guys are gonna sit there and tell me something?” And what really made me mad was they never got the DNA test, and then when I had my daughter, they came in the room and they were like, “Oh. She looks just like our family!” It made me mad and hurt my feelings so much, and basically they were trying to say—I don’t know, somebody who would sleep with everybody. That’s not how I am.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many participants told us that, as in this example, the father’s family urged him to deny or question his paternity of the child, perhaps to escape the responsibilities of early parenthood. Although the father’s family sometimes changed their attitude after the birth of the child, the initial questioning of the young mother’s integrity and sexual restraint nevertheless created a lasting rupture in her relationship with the father’s family.</p>

<title>Coping With Loss and Empathic Abandonment: Teen Motherhood and the Development of Autonomy</title>
<p>Thus far in our analysis, we have considered the ways in which parenthood shapes the relational world of teen mothers, particularly as pregnancy and early motherhood place strains on the socioemotional bonds in the adolescent girl’s life. Our discussion now turns to the ways in which young mothers manage this crisis of attachment. Confronted with both social adversity and the loss of connectivity, the teen mothers in our study sought strategies of accommodation to repair and sustain significant attachments, while also forging pathways to independence and autonomy. In particular, the findings indicate that, for the teenage daughter, repairing her relationship with her mother became an important goal for meeting economic, social, and emotional needs. Because the majority of the young women were living with their mothers during pregnancy and after the birth of their child, finding ways to reconnect and rebuild the mother–daughter bond were deemed essential by the respondents who, even with the tensions in the maternal relationship, often saw their mother as the one person who mattered most to them during this difficult time. Our findings here confirm that, as in past generations, maternal attachment remained central to the young mother’s sense of self in her transition to early parenthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891243212459073">Apfel and Seitz 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891243212459073">Edin and Kefalas 2005</xref>). In the following account, a Latina respondent who first became pregnant at the age of 15 offers this perspective on both the conflict and attachment that characterized her mother–daughter relationship:
<disp-quote>
<p>The first couple of months, it was easy to hide. I didn’t gain too much weight and she [my mom] always made sure I’d eat and stuff, make sure everything was OK. Towards when I started to show, she didn’t want to tell anyone and we had arguments. From there I just moved out. . . . After that, we stopped talking for a while, but then I went back and tried to make everything OK. . . . My mom’s my mom and she’s always going to be there. If he [the father] hadn’t taken responsibility, that was his choice. But my mom was always going to be there. If I needed her help, she was going to be there.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In most cases, it was after the birth of the child that the mother–daughter bond began to be repaired. This finding, which differs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891243212459073">Kaplan’s (1997)</xref> work, is consistent with the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891243212459073">Edin and Kefalas (2005)</xref>, who found that, while adult mothers were disappointed and even “mourned” their daughter’s pregnancy, they nonetheless forgave them and became a source of emotional as well as economic support both during pregnancy and after the birth of the child. Although our findings are similar to those of Edin and Kefalas, the narratives of our respondents also suggest that forgiveness and acceptance on the part of mothers (well as other significant family members) is not unconditional. Rather, relationship repair was often contingent upon the daughter’s ability to function independently as an adult: to care for herself and her child while coping with the absence of maternal empathy. This finding is consistent with the research on the socialization of African American girls more generally, whose upbringing is impacted by a “mandate for strength” that stigmatizes neediness and vulnerability while rewarding emotional resilience and independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891243212459073">Hill 2009</xref>, 737). Thus, in order to stay in the relationship with their mothers, the daughters reported that they typically withheld their feelings of sadness and rejection, as one African American respondent explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s not like we can talk like this [the interview] and I can express how I feel. Because I appreciate everything my mom does for me, because she could have easily kicked me out when she found out I was pregnant and not have cared. But, at the same time, it’s like we don’t have anybody else, we have to deal with each other. It’s like, oh God, we’re just different, that’s all.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This response on the part of the teen mothers illuminates the turning point in connectivity that adolescent girls experience as they learn to silence themselves in order to stay in relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891243212459073">Gilligan 2011</xref>). For teen mothers, communicating their feelings often placed them at risk for damaging the fragile ties they had begun to establish with their mothers by taking charge of their lives and suppressing their emotional injuries. While many of the participants reported that they were working hard to repair the relational ruptures that their pregnancy had caused, they were also aware that staying connected was contingent upon self-sufficiency and, in many instances, a silencing of the self to avoid conflict and strain.</p>
<p>Choosing these strategies of accommodation, while not without emotional consequences for the teen mother, nevertheless appears to have positive outcomes that help to sustain the relational self through the crisis of disconnection and forced separation. This finding complicates the self-in-relation perspective on maternal “empathic failure and relational violations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891243212459073">Jordan and Hartling 2002</xref>, 49). The existing research suggests that, when faced with situations in which relational survival relies on the suppression of emotional authenticity, girls who adopt these strategies may question their self-worth and turn away from “growth fostering relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891243212459073">Jordan and Hartling 2002</xref>, 50). Our findings suggest a somewhat different outcome for teen mothers, whose accommodating strategies result in relationship repair through the emergence of a relation-based autonomy that contributes to rather than undermines the self-esteem of the teen parent. In the months following the birth of a child, many mothers were able to regain the approval and affection of their family by demonstrating emotional strength and by acting independently. One African American respondent, who had become a mother in her early teens, described the disconnection and reconnection to her mother in this way:
<disp-quote>
<p>Me and my mom was close, was cool, but the way she reacted [to the pregnancy] just broke me to pieces. But now she’s fine. It all changed a lot after she [her daughter] was born. They were telling me, “You’re doing the right thing by going to school, taking your daughter to day care, what’s best for you, looking for a job, wanting to go to college.” They saw that I changed a lot and they saw that I’m doing the right thing. . . . I struggled. I don’t think anybody would have went through what I went through. They hardly saw me from struggling to being a strong person. So everything changed after that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As this account helps to illustrate, the teen mother understands her transition to motherhood as a shattering of the mother–daughter bond and the struggle to repair the broken ties through a process of painful but growth-building autonomy. Here, as elsewhere in the study, respondents report that such transitions, while emotionally difficult, resulted in the reestablishment of significant ties to mothers, as well as sibling and other extended family members, who became more supportive as the teen mother sought to manage the emotional, financial, and time constraints of early mothering. Thus, the development of teen mothers reflects a model of psychosocial maturity in which some measure of autonomy and independence is achieved through relational adjustments that reflect the changes in connectivity that were brought on by early parenthood.</p>
<p>In addition, the relational adjustments that the daughters seek and the efforts that are made to repair the mother–daughter bond and other significant attachments reflect a wider cultural phenomenon within communities of color. As previous research has established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891243212459073">Segura and Pierce 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891243212459073">Sparks 2002</xref>), young girls of color, when faced with the rejection, devaluation, and racism of the dominant culture, frequently turn to family and community networks for emotional support. In response to losing these attachments that make survival possible in a racist culture, the adolescent mothers in our study sought ways to reconnect and reestablish a relational network among family members that could, at least in part, provide an emotionally supportive and self-affirming environment.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be pointed out that, in the absence of other empathic ties, teen mothers often turned to their own children for the more traditional empathic bonds that typify “growth in relationship.” In this regard, the majority of teen mothers in our study developed deep emotional connections to their babies and toddlers, often seeking to ameliorate the loss they experienced with their own families. An African American respondent, 17 years of age and now a mother of two, offers this reflection on the relational dynamic that developed over her first two years of mothering:
<disp-quote>
<p>It was difficult adjusting, but now I really enjoy it . . . seeing them grow up. Being able to see their first steps and each milestone, like the first time they laugh, the first time they walk. Just knowing they couldn’t do any of that stuff without you guiding them. Just knowing they love you. Like, my kids have been with me through everything. They don’t just up and leave and turn their backs on me. They’re right there, all the time. I don’t know how many times my toddler comes up to me and just hugs me and wants me to hold her. It’s nice. They need you.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because teen mothers, even those who attended school, had so little time to develop new friendships, the relationships with their children often replaced the connections not only to family but to peer culture as well, helping to ameliorate the loneliness and isolation of teen parenting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0891243212459073" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings of our research provide a number of important insights on teen motherhood and adolescent development among young women of color. Perhaps most significantly, the research found that teen pregnancy leads to relationship impoverishment among adolescent girls who, in entering early motherhood, cope with the loss or deterioration of nearly all of the significant attachments in their lives. Accordingly, teen mothers in our sample experienced ruptures in connectivity to mothers, fathers, siblings, and grandparents, as well as ties to friends, the baby’s father, and the baby’s paternal grandparents.</p>
<p>In response to the emotional hardships that teen pregnancy created, African American and Latina teen mothers sought out ways to repair the mother–daughter bond (and other significant emotional ties) by accommodating the loss of empathic attachment through the development of independence and autonomy. Although this strategy may result in the suppression of feelings and emotional needs, such adaptations appear to increase rather than diminish the self-worth of the teen mother who, through accommodation, regains the love and approval of her familial social support system, even as the empathic ties with the adult mother remain compromised. This relational adjustment to attachment and loss does not appear to impede the establishment of relational ties between the teen mother and her own child. Rather, the research points to a more nuanced understanding of the impact of a young girl’s autonomy on connectivity. In this regard, the findings suggest that the weakening of the mother–daughter bond, and the attendant emotional loss for the teen mother, may positively impact the need for and establishment of other empathic bonds that are found within the relational dynamic of teen mothering.</p>
<p>In situating our research within the larger paradigm of self-in-relation theory, our findings suggest that in emphasizing the importance of relationships for girls’ development, the role of autonomy and independence has perhaps been underexplored within feminist scholarship. Since the bulk of the research on the self-in-relation theory began in the 1980s and culminated in the 1990s, the studies over the last decade have tended to reproduce the earlier findings, stressing the value of relationality over autonomy for girls’ development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891243212459073">Gilligan 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891243212459073">Gilligan and Machoian 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891243212459073">Jordan 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891243212459073">Jordan and Hartling 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891243212459073">West 2005</xref>). While our findings confirm the importance of relationships for girls’ sense of self and the significance of the self-in-relation approach, they also suggest that relationality and autonomy, rather than opposing principles of gender development, may represent competing needs that are resolved through a difficult but valuable negotiation between separation and connection.</p>
<p>In drawing these conclusions from our analysis, however, it is important to point out that, for the teen mothers, separation and autonomy were not attained without cost. Upon completing the in-depth interviews, we were struck, as was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891243212459073">Kaplan (1997)</xref> decades ago, by the deep sense of isolation and loneliness that many of these young women experienced. Although the majority of the respondents had, to varying degrees, succeeded in reestablishing ties to their mothers and other significant attachments, their everyday lives were informed by the pressures of teen parenthood and the knowledge that maintaining relationships depends on self-sufficiency and emotional strength in coping with the ongoing stigma of teen motherhood. While a few young women reported that they would not change their lives if they could, the vast majority of the respondents spoke of how difficult their lives had become and a longing for the childhood they had left behind. Thus, for these teen mothers, pregnancy and childbearing were clearly experienced as an abrupt shift from adolescence to adulthood, an emotionally stressful transition in which the gain in autonomy was tempered by the threats to attachment and connection.</p>
<p>While our findings, like those of earlier research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891243212459073">Edin and Kefalas 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891243212459073">Schultz 2008</xref>), suggest that teen mothers develop a positive sense of self and are able to gain some positive outcomes from early motherhood, such findings must be placed within the larger context of forced autonomy in which the strains and emotional pain of relational and social adversity underlie this path toward independence and self-reliance. The findings on autonomy and a positive sense of self should also be approached with caution in light of the research on the mental health risks for African American women who learn to silence themselves and repress their emotions in order to fulfill cultural expectations surrounding the socially constructed image of the “strong Black woman” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212459073">Beauboeuf-Lafontant 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891243212459073">Hill 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, in looking toward future research on teen pregnancy among young women of color, our study raises some important questions surrounding the trend in early motherhood among African American and Latina girls. As our study confirms, teen mothers gain few cultural, social, or economic benefits from early motherhood and suffer the loss of attachment and connection. The question thus remains as to why the rate of teen pregnancy among African American and Latina girls has remained relatively high. While our work interrogates the consequences of teen motherhood among adolescent girls of color rather than its causes, research on the latter is needed.</p>
<p>Two areas of research that warrant further exploration are decision making around sexual relations among adolescent girls and the related issues of sexual coercion and sexual violence in teenage populations. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891243212459073">Luker (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891243212459073">Tolman (2002)</xref> point to the effect of sexual pressure on adolescent girls, even as they are unsure of their own desires and wants. Thus, as Luker points out, having sex is often a passive “nondecision” that, especially when paired with “nondecisions” around contraception, can lead to early pregnancy. Because the lines between pressure, coercion, and violence are often blurred for these young women, Luker, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891243212459073">Sherraden, Gonzalez, and Rainford (2006)</xref>, suggests that scholarship on teen mothers should address the impact of nonconsensual sex on teen pregnancy. This impact may be particularly important for young women of color who, like adult women of color, are more at risk for sexual violence than are whites. Future research, including our own, therefore should consider the ways in which sexual decision making, sexual coercion, and sexual violence inform the relational and social lives of young African American and Latina women who become pregnant.</p>
