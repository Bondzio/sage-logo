<p>This paper provides an empirical evolution of adult HIV prevalence rates, foreign aids for HIV/AIDS programmes, and the amount of government spending on health care. It talks about the role of aid in the international community, the appropriate approaches for addressing it and the role of foreign aid. A relationship between AIDS and HIV prevalence could suggest that donor states are more focused on humanitarian grounds rather than their private security needs otherwise leading to disproportionate share of funds than their prevalence rates would suggest. The role of the government in providing health care has also been debated as developing countries have to adopt Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) to receive funding. While the proponents support SAPs for bringing their economies and political systems in line with developed states, opponents complain that they make health care inaccessible to the needy and also, instead of benefitting the countries receiving the aid, SAPs help donor states to access recipient states’ markets and natural resources. Also, the paper highlights that the role of foreign aid has come under scrutiny by contributing to corruption among public officials, encouraging dependency relationships between developed and developing states and discouraging African governments from funding services on their own, displaying unresponsiveness to the needs of people. To study the relations between different variables, the author focuses on 15 target countries through PEPFAR (President Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) and comes out with some findings. First, ‘need’ is an important factor but it is not the only criterion to get the funding, thus splitting the difference between those who argue for security-based approach and those who believe in humanitarian grounds. Second, there may exist additive relationships between foreign and domestic health spending, leading to freeing up of domestic money for other health issues and thus to overall rise in all areas of health. Third, governments may have encouraged providing more of health services because of the AIDS pandemic for having greater access to health services. However, the paper also suggests that definite conlusions cannot be made about relationships between AIDS, foreign assistance and domestic health spending. It can be started to disentangle relationships for plotting important avenues for future.</p>
