<abstract>
<p>Objectives: This article reports the outcome of a pilot study of a cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) intervention—<italic>Vida Alegre</italic> (the contented life)—designed for use with depressed immigrant mothers living in communities with small but rapidly growing Hispanic populations. Method: The study used a pretest/posttest/follow-up design to examine whether exposure to the intervention reduced symptoms of depression. Results: Although based on a small, nonrandomized sample, the results are promising at pretest/baseline, the average Center for Epidemiology Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) score was 25; at posttest and follow-up, the average CES-D scores were 12 and 11.3, respectively. Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests showed that the pretest and posttest scores are significantly different (<italic>Z</italic> = –2.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>r</italic> = .67), indicating a decline in depression. A content analysis of transcripts from three focus groups indicates the usefulness of intervention. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that an existing CBGT can be modified to address immigrant issues.</p>

<p>The past decade has seen a remarkable growth of the Latino population in the United States. Between 2000 and 2009, this population grew by 12.8 million, reflecting 35.9% growth over the past decade. Now numbering 48.4 million, Latinos make up more than 16% of the total population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1049731511424168">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). In contrast, the much larger non-Hispanic population grew by 12 million between 2000 and 2009, an increase of just 4.9% (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). Such a comparison reveals a striking reality: Hispanics accounted for more than 50% of the overall population growth and much of this new growth reflects natural increase rather than immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731511424168">Fry, 2008</xref>). As a result, much of the Hispanic population is young. For example, in 2010, Latinos accounted for one in four of kindergartners expected to graduate from high school in 2023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1049731511424168">Nasser &amp; Overberg, 2010</xref>). Many of these children come from immigrant families. As of 2005, nearly one fourth (23%) of Latino children live in immigrant families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049731511424168">Hernandez, Denton, &amp; Macartney, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of an aging American society, this young, burgeoning population is poised to play a critical role in future labor markets and in the broader society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731511424168">Buki &amp; Piedra, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731511424168">Fry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1049731511424168">Piedra, Andrade, &amp; Larrison, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1049731511424168">Piedra &amp; Buki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1049731511424168">Ridings et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1049731511424168">Sullivan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1049731511424168">Tienda &amp; Mitchell, 2006</xref>). However, that future role will depend largely on the prioritization of services that support the well-being of this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731511424168">Fry &amp; Gonzales, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1049731511424168">Morales &amp; Bonilla, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1049731511424168">Ridings et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1049731511424168">Sullivan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1049731511424168">Tienda, 2011</xref>). Among such services, adequate and timely mental health services are essential, especially in areas of the country that have experienced a rapid growth of the Latino population.</p>
<p>The rapid increase of Latino immigrants in communities unaccustomed to such populations complicates service access. Despite the fact that Latinos remain concentrated in urban centers and their surrounding metros, over the past two decades the population has spread to nearly 3,000 of the nation’s 3,141 counties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731511424168">Fry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049731511424168">Lichter &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049731511424168">2009</xref>). Their relocation into small towns and rural areas of the Northeast, Midwest, and the South has led to the emergence of “new growth” communities—those with small but rapidly growing Hispanic populations—in many states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731511424168">Cunningham, Banker, Artiga, &amp; Tolbert, 2006</xref>). Many of these communities have benefited from an economic revitalization because of this demographic shift. However, the situation has created new challenges for Hispanic newcomers and receiving communities alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049731511424168">Lichter &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). Many of these communities lack the service infrastructure and the bilingual providers necessary to meet the service needs of a growing Latino population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731511424168">Arroyo, 2004</xref>; See for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731511424168">Aranda, 2001</xref>; Buki &amp; Piedra, 2011).</p>

<title>Underutilization of Mental Health Services Among Latino Immigrants</title>
<p>Although studies indicate high levels of depression among Latinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049731511424168">Lewis-Fernández, Das, Alfonso, Weissman, &amp; Olfson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1049731511424168">Snowden &amp; Yamada, 2005</xref>), there exists worrisome underuse of mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1049731511424168">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1049731511424168">Young, Klap, Sherbourne, &amp; Wells, 2001</xref>). One study found that the average depression level based on the Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression Scale (CES-D) for non-Hispanic Whites is 9.50, 11.97 for Mexicans, and 12.20 for Puerto Ricans, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1049731511424168">Torres Stone, Rivera, &amp; Berdahl, 2004</xref>). For those Latinos who access some kind of depression treatment, half receive it in a primary care setting and fewer than 13% receive adequate guideline-based care, half the rate compared to non-Latino Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049731511424168">Lagomasino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1049731511424168">Wang et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, despite available treatment guides, service disparities exist among Latino subgroups. Among Latinos with mental disorders, fewer than 1 in 11 contact mental health care specialists and among Latino immigrants fewer than 1 in 20 use mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1049731511424168">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001</xref>). When mental health care appears to be discretionary for Latinos who may need preventive services or who are symptomatic but have not been diagnosed with a disorder, Latino immigrants use mental health services at a substantially lower rate than Puerto Ricans and U.S.-born Latinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731511424168">Alegría et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, non-English-speaking Latinos are less likely to receive mental health services than those who speak English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731511424168">Alegría et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1049731511424168">Sentell, Shumway, &amp; Snowden, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1049731511424168">Sentell, Shumway, and Snowden (2007)</xref> found a dramatic difference in receipt of needed mental health care based on English language abilities. In a sample of 2,999 Latinos who spoke only English, 17% reported the need for mental health services. Of this group, 43% reported that they had received needed mental health services. Similarly, among 2,365 Latinos who did not speak English, 17% reported the need for mental health services. However, for those who spoke no English, only 8% of Latinos respondents received such services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1049731511424168">Sentell et al., 2007</xref>). These findings underscore the paradox that suggest that although recent Latino immigrants tend to have better mental health than the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731511424168">Breslau, Kendler, Su, Gaxiola-Aguilar, &amp; Kessler, 2005</xref>), long stays in the United States are associated with worsening mental health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1049731511424168">Stone &amp; Balderrama, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1049731511424168">Stone, Viruell-Fuentes, &amp; Acevedo-Garcia, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, recent Latino immigrants experience heightened vulnerability to mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731511424168">Beeber, Lewis, Cooper, Maxwell, &amp; Sandelowski, 2009</xref>) because of the kinds of work they encounter in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731511424168">Martínez Pincay &amp; Guarnaccia, 2007</xref>). On average, such immigrants have lower levels of education than the general population and tend to work in low-wage jobs without health insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731511424168">Andrade &amp; Viruell-Fuentes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1049731511424168">Pew Hispanic Center, 2010</xref>). These socioeconomic disadvantages translate into a significant discrepancy in earnings, higher exposure to occupational and environmental hazards, and low levels of service access across the life course (Andrade &amp; Viruell-Fuentes, 2011; for a detailed review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1049731511424168">Vega, Rodriguez, &amp; Gruskin, 2009</xref>). Moreover, low wages magnify negative life events and chronic stress, which can contribute to disabling symptoms of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731511424168">Beeber, Perreira, &amp; Schwartz, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In new growth communities, risk factors are intensified. Nearly a third of Latinos in these communities are uninsured, and they have less access to social “safety nets” than their counterparts who live in major Hispanic centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731511424168">Cunningham et al., 2006</xref>). The lack of health insurance fosters an overreliance on public health clinics and emergency rooms, neither of which specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues, especially for patients with limited English proficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1049731511424168">Vega &amp; López, 2001</xref>). Moreover, while new growth areas attract immigrants without skills, an exodus of highly educated Hispanics also characterizes these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049731511424168">Lichter &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). Such a trend reflects a significant loss of human capital from areas where bilingual professionals are urgently needed.</p>

<title>Maternal Depression Among Immigrants</title>
<p>Immigrant mothers demonstrate particular vulnerability to depression, which can have serious consequences for their children as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731511424168">Dennis, Parke, Coltrane, Blacher, &amp; Borthwick-Duffy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1049731511424168">Ornelas, Perreira, Beeber, &amp; Maxwell, 2009</xref>). One study found that maternal depression played a greater role in the development of problematic behaviors among Latino youth than exposure to community violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731511424168">Aisenberg, Trickett, Mennen, Saltzman, &amp; Zayas, 2007</xref>). Often, stressors associated with child care responsibilities in an unfamiliar culture are unanticipated and exacerbated by the loss of social capital that comes from migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1049731511424168">Ornelas et al., 2009</xref>). In Canada, researchers found that compared to native-born mothers, immigrant mothers reported a three to fivefold increase in depressive symptoms and lower levels of social support after giving birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1049731511424168">Stewart, Gagnon, Saucier, Wahoush, &amp; Dougherty, 2008</xref>). Unlike their native-born counterparts, immigrant mothers worried about the lack of help and advice from family or friends in caring for their young children. Another study found that the loss of significant relationships and personal time contributed to maternal depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731511424168">Ahmed, Stewart, Teng, Wahoush, &amp; Gagnon, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although studies indicate that Latino immigrants understand clinical depression and can recognize its affective, behavioral, and interpersonal dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731511424168">Cabassa, Lester, &amp; Zayas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731511424168">Martínez Pincay &amp; Guarnaccia, 2007</xref>), evidence also exists that many Latino immigrants attribute depression to situational stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731511424168">Cabassa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731511424168">Cabassa, Hansen, Palinkas, &amp; Ell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049731511424168">Karasz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049731511424168">Karasz, Sacajiu, &amp; Garcia, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049731511424168">Karasz &amp; Watkins, 2006</xref>; Martínez Pincay &amp;Guarnaccia, 2007). Many immigrants attribute social isolation and fatigue to the disruption caused by immigration. Those without legal immigration status are particularly vulnerable to the impact that social exclusion and marginalization has on situational stressors. Consequently, many understandably mistake clinical depression as a normal response to a profound life change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731511424168">Martínez Pincay &amp; Guarnaccia, 2007</xref>). Therefore, in this study, an existing cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049731511424168">Muñoz, Aguilar-Gaxiola, &amp; Guzmán, 2000</xref>) intervention was modified to (a) help depressed immigrant mothers regulate emotion by modifying thoughts and behavior in coping with life stressors and (b) assist them with the disruptive effects of acculturation on family relationships.</p>

<title>The Development of Vida Alegre</title>
<p>In Spanish, <italic>Vida Alegre</italic> means “happy [contented] life.” For many immigrants, the promise of such a life serves as a source of hope in the face of daunting hardships. However, when Latino immigrants require mental health services, they encounter traditional treatment models ill suited to their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731511424168">Engstrom &amp; Piedra, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049731511424168">Imberti, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049731511424168">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1049731511424168">Piedra &amp; Engstrom, 2009</xref>). In particular, these models neglect the cultural and linguistic requirements of Latino clients, particularly those from communities characterized by recent growth in their Hispanic population and by the lack of a professional bilingual workforce. The situation requires the modification of existing treatment models to meet the needs of these emerging communities, as well as thorough testing of these new procedures.</p>
<p>Migration to a new country catapults the migrant into a life transition that affects both the individual and his or her family, and can extend across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1049731511424168">Piedra &amp; Engstrom, 2009</xref>). Scholars have long-observed tensions between immigrant parents and their native-born children that compromise important relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731511424168">Addams, 1910</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731511424168">Chapman &amp; Perreira, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731511424168">Chung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731511424168">Ishibashi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1049731511424168">Piedra &amp; Engstrom, 2009</xref>; Portes &amp; Rumbart, 2001, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1049731511424168">2006</xref>). In many cases, there is cause for concern; studies have found negative health behaviors and mental health problems with increasing levels of assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731511424168">Coatsworth, Maldonado-Molina, Pantin, &amp; Szapocznik, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731511424168">Ebin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049731511424168">Miranda, Estrada, &amp; Firpo-Jimenez, 2000</xref>). One agency noted that when Latino immigrants do present for mental health services, they are often prompted to do so by problems associated with acculturation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731511424168">Caldwell, Couture, &amp; Nowotny, n.d</xref>.).</p>
<p>Scholars have also observed that the pace of intergenerational acculturation—the process by which immigrants and their children learn the language and normative lifestyles of a new culture—affects the parent–child relationship in unforeseen ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1049731511424168">Piedra &amp; Engstrom, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1049731511424168">Portes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1049731511424168">Portes, Fernandez-Kelly, &amp; Haller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1049731511424168">Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1049731511424168">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1049731511424168">Portes &amp; Zhou, 1993</xref>). Ideally, acculturation occurs at similar rates for both immigrant parents and their children, enabling children to maintain family and communities ties.</p>
<p>When acculturation rates differ, schisms in relationships occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049731511424168">Hwang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1049731511424168">Piedra &amp; Engstrom, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1049731511424168">Waters, 1996</xref>). For example, when children learn English and adopt U.S. culture and values at a faster rate than their parents, family tensions may escalate and undermine parental authority. In a context of limited community supports, the diminishment of parental capacity to guide children yields particularly cruel results. Scholars have found that such children, when confronted with important life choices, have little more than their peer group for support, and are particularly vulnerable to the adoption of adversarial attitudes and lifestyles associated with downward social mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1049731511424168">Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1049731511424168">Waters, 1996</xref>). Therefore, it is useful to adapt mental services to address how the immigrant experience affects life choices and relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1049731511424168">Piedra &amp; Engstrom, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Predictably, the underuse of mental health services leads to exacerbation of problems, despite the fact that preventive care might have been effective in treating the issue at an earlier, less critical stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731511424168">Gonzalez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1049731511424168">Snowden, Hu, &amp; Jerrell, 1995</xref>). Scholars contend that because Latino immigrants tend to attribute depression to situational factors, nonpharmacological interventions such as talk therapy are seen as logical remedies (Karasz &amp;Watkins, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731511424168">Martínez Pincay &amp; Guarnaccia, 2007</xref>). By reaching immigrant populations with mental health needs before their outcomes worsen, it may be possible to improve the mental health of both long-term immigrants and subsequent generations. Therefore, we hypothesized that immigrant mothers’ exposure to Vida Alegre—a 10-week CBGT intervention tailored to the immigrant experience—would result in fewer depression symptoms.</p>

The research team used the CES-D to measure levels of symptoms associated with depression at three points in time: before the intervention (T1), at the end of the intervention (T2), and again 3 months later (T3). In addition, we collected demographic and focus group data to contextualize the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731511424168">Jani, Ortiz, &amp; Aranda, 2009</xref>).

<title>Study Site: Champaign County, Illinois</title>
<p>For this study, we recruited participants from three cities in Champaign County in Illinois: Champaign, Rantoul, and Urbana. Champaign County is one of the 10 Midwest counties that have experienced the fastest growth of the Latino population since 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731511424168">Fry, 2008</xref>). In Champaign County, this population grew from 5,203 (3%) to 8,356 (4%) between 2000 and 2009, reflecting nearly a 44% increase in a 5- to 7-year period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1049731511424168">Pew Hispanic Center, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these numbers reflect a growing population, existing health and social services have not kept pace. HelpSource, the website that provides a “centralized guide to human services in East Central Illinois,” lists only two resources for assisting the Latino population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049731511424168">HelpSource, 2011</xref>). First, the website posts a Spanish-language version of a family resource guide that indicates the few programs with Spanish-speaking staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049731511424168">HelpSource, 2005</xref>). Second, HelpSource hosts a comprehensive directory of human and social services in Champaign County (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049731511424168">HelpBook Online, 2011</xref>). Yet, a directory search of “Latino” and “Hispanic” generated zero results. A search on “immigrant” resulted in one organization and “Spanish-speaking” produced three organizations.</p>
<p>In Champaign County, there exists a shortage of bilingual mental health services. At the time of this study, the local federally qualified health care center (FQHC)—the primary health care provider for the uninsured with more than 40% of its patients Latino—could not find a single bilingual mental provider to hire for nearly 2 years, despite having both the desire and the funding to hire such a person (A. Goldberg, personal communication, March/April, 2010 ). Instead, this FQHC relied on medical interpreters largely untrained to interpret mental health concerns. Consequently, the dearth of bilingual providers in the existing service structure required that this intervention develop an alternative pool of providers—bilingual graduate students—as part of its implementation, which will be discussed as part of the research procedures.</p>

<sec id="section8-1049731511424168">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were Spanish-speaking mothers, 21 years or older, recruited from health and social service agencies in Champaign County and by word of mouth (a process in which one participant referred another) between December 2009 and February 2010. Initially, we used traditional mental health terminology such as using the terms <italic>depression</italic> or <italic>mental health</italic> in recruiting materials and discovered that this approach led to very low recruitment rates (.03%) in December. Given this initial low rate of recruitment and studies that underscore that Latinos fear being labeled “insane” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731511424168">Martínez Pincay &amp; Guarnaccia, 2007</xref>), all recruitment and treatment materials were revised to deemphasize depression as a mental illness and highlight the intervention’s aim to help mothers cope with life stressors. In addition, we consulted with community leaders who recommended that we emphasize the expressive benefits (social support, help with managing strong emotions) and the instrumental benefits (child care, snacks, financial reimbursement) of participating. We also used meta-messages that appealed to commonly held beliefs that immigrants will take risks “to live a good life.” Consequently, we were able to recruit an additional 29 participants over the next 2 months. However, because the materials were revised, they naturally reached a broader audience.</p>
<p>All potential participants were assessed by a member of the research team. A woman was invited to participate if she was a mother and Spanish language dominant with a current or previous history of depression (inclusion criteria) and she did not meet any of our exclusion criteria (currently suicidal, homicidal, psychotic, or substance abusing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1049731511424168">UIUC IRB, 2009</xref>). During the assessments, 30 potential participants were screened, using the Major Depressive Episode Screener (MDES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049731511424168">Muñoz, 1998</xref>) to indicate whether the woman was currently experiencing an episode of major depression or had had such an experience in the past. Screening questions were adapted by Ricardo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049731511424168">Muñoz (1998)</xref> from the diagnostic interview schedule, which is in the public domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1049731511424168">Robins, Helzer, Croughan, &amp; Ratcliff, 1981</xref>). Although not intended to yield a diagnosis, the MDES asks about the presence of symptoms that are considered to be part of a clinical depression and that a professional looks for to decide whether a person is suffering from major depression. Of the 30 women screened, just over a third were excluded because (a) they were not Spanish-language dominant (<italic>n</italic> = 3) or (b) they were not currently depressed and did not have a history of depression per the MDES (<italic>n</italic> = 8). After signing an IRB-approved consent, 19 participants were enrolled in one of the three 10-week CBT groups.</p>

<sec id="section12-1049731511424168">
<title>CES-D (Spanish-version)</title>
<p>CES-D is a 20-item self-report instrument used to assess depressive symptomatology in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1049731511424168">Radloff, 1977</xref>). Although the CES-D is not a diagnostic instrument and cannot be used to give a diagnosis of depression, evidence shows that people receiving treatment for depression score significantly higher on the CES-D compared to those not in treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049731511424168">Mahard, 1988</xref>). In addition, the CES-D has stronger correlates with other depression measures than with instruments that test cognitive, physical, or social functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1049731511424168">Shinar et al., 1986</xref>). The CES has good internal reliability, ranging from .88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1049731511424168">Orme, Reis, &amp; Herz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1049731511424168">Thombs, Hudson, Schieir, Taillefer, &amp; Baron, 2008</xref>) to .90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731511424168">Clark, Mahoney, Clark, &amp; Eriksen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731511424168">Conerly, Baker, Dye, Douglas, &amp; Zabora, 2002</xref>). The Spanish-language version of the CES-D also shows strong internal consistency and convergent and discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049731511424168">Mahard, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1049731511424168">Roberts, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>The instrument uses a 4-point scale (0–3) for each item to reflect how often respondents experienced symptoms of depression during the past week. By adding together the 20 items, a score ranging from 0 to 60 is generated, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptomology. Typically, a score of 16 serves as the cutoff point distinguishing “normal” range (&lt;16) from “considered” cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731511424168">Comstock &amp; Helsing, 1976</xref>).</p>

Participants were asked about different components of the interventions and what activities they found most helpful. They were also asked to suggest areas for improvement. These focus groups also provide a way to improve the intervention by recasting and contextualizing the findings from the quantitative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731511424168">Caracelli &amp; Greene, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731511424168">Greene, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<sec id="section15-1049731511424168">
<title>Manual selection and program adaption</title>
<p>As a starting point, the Vida Alegre manual used the <italic>Group Therapy Manual for Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Depression</italic> (Spanish-language version; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049731511424168">Muñoz et al., 2000</xref>), available online at no cost for public use. A team of researchers developed the interventions through the Depression Clinic at San Francisco General Hospital, the county hospital for the City and County of San Francisco, which serves many low-income Spanish-speaking residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1049731511424168">Muñoz &amp; Mendelson, 2005</xref>). Widely tested and available in Spanish, this manual has strong empirical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731511424168">Cuijpers, Muñoz, Clarke, &amp; Lewinsohn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1049731511424168">Muñoz &amp; Mendelson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1049731511424168">Organista, Muñoz, &amp; Gonzalez, 1994</xref>). For this study, structural and procedural alterations were made to suit a “new growth” community service context. Structurally, the study used a manual-based, service-learning model designed for a 16-week semester system to prepare four bilingual students to act as cotherapists in implementing the intervention. Procedurally, the original manual was changed to emphasize the effect of the experience of migration upon the thoughts, activities, and interpersonal relationships of recent immigrants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049731511424168">
<title>Manual modifications</title>
<p>The Vida Alegre manual retains the three-part structure of the original manual, which addresses how mood is affected by (a) thoughts, (b) activities, and (c) social contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049731511424168">Muñoz et al., 2000</xref>). However, we did make modifications to fit a university service context and increase its validity for use with immigrant mother in a new growth community. First, the 12-week intervention was shortened to 10 weeks to permit the facilitator trainings, the intervention, and a focus group to occur within a 16-week semester. Such a modification is intended to enable bilingual graduate students to reach an underserved population with minimal disruption caused by semester breaks and to test whether such a structure could yield results worth replicating in other institutions with a semester sytem. Second, the first session was changed to provide an orientation to the intervention and to the therapeutic process. Such orientations have been found useful for Latinos unfamiliar with a therapeutic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1049731511424168">Organista, 2000</xref>).The Vida Alegre manual also draws on scholarly contributions made since the original manual was published. For example, in the orientation session, the manual uses published quotes from Latinos describing their understanding of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731511424168">Martínez Pincay &amp; Guarnaccia, 2007</xref>). In addition, we substituted the A-B-C-D method for restructuring problematic thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731511424168">Ellis &amp; Grieger, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731511424168">Granvold, 1994</xref>) for the <italic>Si, pero</italic> (Yes, but) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1049731511424168">Organista, 1995</xref>). In the A-B-C-D method, a person identifies an activating event (A), the beliefs (B) associated with it, and the emotional consequences (C) for the associations. By seeking to dispute (D) the beliefs about an event, a person can change the feelings it generates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1049731511424168">Organista (1995)</xref> found that this four-step process needed simplification for Latino clients and opted for a two-step approach in which a person affirms one part of a negative statement and then disagrees with its significance. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731511424168">Bucay (1999)</xref>, an Argentinean psychologist writing on the power of the linguistic structure “<italic>Si, pero”</italic> to shape cognition, lends international support for Organista’s observations.</p>
<p>In the second part of the manual (activities), we added short (10–15 min) stretching and meditation exercises for the facilitators to model in their groups. By leading participants through these short exercises rather than just listing them among a range of activities (walking, reading, etc.), participants can see firsthand how engaging certain activities can change one’s mood. Meditation practice is consonant with cognitive therapies and has been shown to reduce the symptoms of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731511424168">Broderick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1049731511424168">Schreiner &amp; Malcolm, 2008</xref>) by increasing awareness of the present moment and helping people shift their attention from negative self-referent information to objectively attending to and processing all available information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1049731511424168">Schreiner &amp; Malcolm, 2008</xref>). In doing so, depressed individuals reduce their role in maintaining dysfunctional cognitive schemas by accepting emotions nonjudgmentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731511424168">Baer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731511424168">Hayes &amp; Kelly, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The most extensive change to the manual occurred in the third section (social contacts), which was completely rewritten to reflect the acculturation process that immigrants go through and that often affects relationships. This third section includes three sessions focused on the migration experience and provides tools for coping with the acculturation tensions that almost inevitably arise and that can negatively affect relationships. In particular, the concept of emotional bidding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731511424168">Gottman &amp; DeClaire, 2001</xref>) was used to assist immigrant mothers to respond constructively to their children’s verbal expressions for connection.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731511424168">Gottman and DeClaire (2001)</xref> describe the “bid” and the “response” as fundamental units for emotional connection. A <italic>bid</italic> refers to any expression—a question, a gesture, a look, a touch—that conveys the message: “I want to connect with you.” For every “bid,” one of three “responses” is possible: turning toward, turning away, or turning against. Like pieces of a puzzle, the bid and the response generate patterns of relating in a relationship. In keeping with the literature on cultural adaptation of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731511424168">Bernal, Jimenez-Chafey, &amp; Rodriguez, 2009</xref>), we modified Gottman and Declaire’s work to reflect cultural differences in expression and miscommunication that arise between parents and children who experience different rates of acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049731511424168">Hwang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1049731511424168">Piedra &amp; Engstrom, 2009</xref>). Finally, the revised manual—<italic>Vida Alegre: Cómo Lograr el Control sobre sus Emociones</italic> [Vida Alegre: How to Gain Control over Your Emotions]—was edited and translated into Spanish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1049731511424168">Piedra, Cintrón, Guardini, Marquez, &amp; Sink, 2011</xref>). This final version was used to train group facilitators and to guide the intervention.</p>

<sec id="section18-1049731511424168">
<title>Treatment preparation: Therapist training</title>
<p>This study trained four bilingual graduate students (three females, one male), enrolled either in a master of social work (MSW) program or in a clinical psychology program, to cofacilitate Vida Alegre groups. All four students possessed conversational Spanish-language skills, as assessed by the first author, who is bilingual, through an initial interview conducted in Spanish. Because the training required reading (but not written) proficiency, each student’s literacy was assessed by reading out loud a selected case study and discussing the meaning of the selected narrative in English with the first author. To facilitate the groups, written literacy would not be necessary; therefore, writing skills were not accessed.</p>
<p>Each facilitator received approximately 10 hr of training using the Vida Alegre manual prior to the intervention (1 hr per week) and 10 hr of supervision (1 hr per week throughout the study). All trainings and supervision were provided by the first author who is bilingual and holds her doctorate in social service administration. In addition, she is a licensed clinical social worker with nearly 20 years of direct practice experience and 10 years of experience teaching direct practice to MSW students. During the 10-hr CBT training, the students reviewed the manual (which will be used with participants), the intervention’s theory of change, core tenets of cognitive theory (schemas, attribution thinking, reframing), and guidelines for group management. In addition, published and unpublished case materials were translated and used to illustrate key concepts. These materials make up the training curriculum and are available from the first author upon request. Throughout the training, the Socratic method was used to help facilitators learn content and develop clinical analytic skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731511424168">Granvold, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1049731511424168">Overholser, 2010</xref>). During each training session, therapist-trainees were quizzed orally to determine verbal mastery of the material.</p>

<title>Treatment procedures</title>
<p>All participants were invited to attend a group that met for 10 weekly 1-hr sessions. The study ran three groups at two central locations that offered ample parking and allowed us to provide on-site child care. During the group sessions, participants were taught to recognize how their thoughts, behaviors, and social interactions affect depressed mood, and to make changes to improve mood. The style of treatment blended both didactic and supportive approaches. For all these group meetings, child care and snacks were provided for all participants and their children. Small monetary incentives ($5 for T1 and T2, $10 for the focus group T2b, and $5 for the 3-month follow-up T3) were provided only when data were actually collected.</p>

<p>This study used a multifaceted approach to monitor content and process fidelity. Whereas content fidelity ensures that intervention activities proceed according to the theory and goals underlying the research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731511424168">Dumas, Lynch, Laughlin, Phillips Smith, &amp; Prinz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049731511424168">Moncher &amp; Prinz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1049731511424168">Waltz, Addis, Koerner, &amp; Jacobson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1049731511424168">Yeaton &amp; Sechrest, 1981</xref>), process fidelity safeguards similar intervention/content delivery to all participants across the groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731511424168">Dumas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049731511424168">Moncher &amp; Prinz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1049731511424168">Waltz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1049731511424168">Yeaton &amp; Sechrest, 1981</xref>).

During the study, the following weekly activities were taken to increase content and process fidelity: (a) team meetings with the first author; (b) submission of group notes; and (c) completion of behavioral checklists. No formal check of fidelity through audio taping of sessions was conducted.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Due to the small sample size, nonparametric techniques were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1049731511424168">Pallant, 2001</xref>). Among nonparametric techniques, we conducted a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess the magnitude of the change in the CES-D test scores at different points in time. Similar to the paired samples <italic>t</italic> test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test examines whether we can reject the null hypothesis that no significant difference exists between the pretest and posttest scores and the pretest and follow-up scores. However, unlike other nonparametric statistics, the Wilcoxon test also assesses the magnitude of any difference that might occur. Statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) was used to produce the Wilcoxon test, which calculated the number of positive and negative differences, the <italic>Z</italic> score, and the associated probability level. The outcome thus allows an analysis of the direction and magnitude of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1049731511424168">Saltzman, Paternoster, Waldo, &amp; Chiricos, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Focus group data were used to enhance the quantitative data and provide a way to contextualize the findings from the CES-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731511424168">Caracelli &amp; Greene, 1997</xref>). A bilingual research assistant (RA) transcribed all data collected from the focus groups. Later, the first author and another bilingual RA checked the accuracy of the transcripts. A general induction method was used to interpret the focus group data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1049731511424168">Thomas, 2006</xref>). Although there are some tentative thoughts about the how the content in the manual might be perceived by the participants, the intervention was newly tested in a different service context—a new growth area—and therefore little is known about what aspects resonated with the mothers and what parts needed revision. Specifically, data from the focus groups were analyzed for patterns, themes, and content consistent with issues associated with using the intervention to reduce depression and promote the regulation of positive thoughts and mood. After reading through all the transcripts, an initial coding chart was developed by the first author that includes analytic domains, definitions of the domain, and examples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1049731511424168">Ryan &amp; Bernard, 2003</xref>). This initial coding chart was then be critiqued and further developed by a research team that included the first author and two bilingual RAs until consensus was reached. The final domains, definitions, and examples in the final coding chart reflect the consensus of the team. Using the final coding chart as a guide, all transcripts were coded by the three researchers independently. Although the interrater reliability of the coders was high (95%), all transcripts were read out loud (in Spanish) in team meetings and discrepancies were discussed and usually found to be a question of how language was being used to convey a particular meaning. In some cases, the research team replayed the audiotapes to better understand the participant’s intent in her choice of words by listening to how the words were spoken.</p>

<title>Demographics of Treatment Completers</title>
<p>Among 19 Latina mothers enrolled in the study, 11 women completed the intervention. Among the eight treatment noncompleters, two women never attended a session and six women dropped out after the second session. Among treatment completers, the majority (73%) attended 8 or more sessions out of 10. The women attended one of three groups held either at the School of Social Work in Urbana, IL (one group had five participants, the other two) or at a day care center in Rantoul, IL (<italic>n</italic> = 4). Four women attended the group held in Rantoul. Three months after the intervention concluded, we were able to reach 10 of 11 treatment completers and none of the women dropped out. This number represents 52% of the participants (<italic>n</italic> = 19) whom we originally enrolled in the study and 91% of the participants (<italic>n</italic> = 10) who were treatment completers.</p>
<p>Although the majority of the women (63%) had lived in the United States for more than 5 years, Spanish was the primary language for all but one, who spoke a Mayan dialect and Spanish as a second language. Most of the participants were from Mexico (<italic>n</italic> = 9, 81%). One woman was U.S.-born of Mexican descent, but had grown up close to the Mexico–U.S. border and was Spanish-language dominant. Another was from Guatemala. Their level of education ranged from 6 to 12 years, with an average of 9.67 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.29). All participants were of childbearing age, ranging from 23 to 39 years (<italic>M</italic> = 31.09 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.76), and had an average of 2.45 children below 18 years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049731511424168">Table 1</xref>

<title>Data Screening</title>
<p>Prior to analysis, each test score as well as the differences between test scores (pretests vs. posttests and posttest vs. follow-up tests) were screened for outliers using SPSS. The screening revealed two cases (Cases #2 and #9) with differences between pretest and posttest scores greater than three standard deviations from the mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1049731511424168">Swogger, Walsh, &amp; Kosson, 2008</xref>). Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests were conducted to determine whether the presence of these two outliers significantly altered the results. Since no significant difference was observed, in the following sections we only present the result of the test with all 11 cases.</p>

<title>CES-D Scores: Baseline and Posttreatment</title>
<p>At pretest/baseline, the average CES-D score was 25 and ranged from 9 to 44. At posttest, average CES-D score was 12 and ranged from 0 to 26. The statistic of Wilcoxon signed-ranks test showed that the pretest and posttest scores were significantly different (<italic>Z</italic> = –2.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>r</italic> = .67). The large <italic>Z</italic> score indicates a low probability that the change is due to chance and shows that there was a significant negative change in CES-D scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1049731511424168">Saltzman et al., 1982</xref>). Based on an average number of eight sessions, the results indicate that the participants showed a significant decrease in their depression scores after participating in the intervention. In addition, despite the presence of a small sample size, which usually decreases statistical power, we found large effect size (<italic>r</italic> = .67). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511424168">Cohen (1988)</xref>, values of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5, respectively, serve as indicators of small, moderate, and large effect sizes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731511424168">Table 2</xref>

<title>CES-D Scores: 3 Months Posttreatment</title>
<p>Three months after the end of the Vida Alegre intervention, we found little difference in CES-D scores. The mean score of CES-D was 12 and 11.3 at posttest and at follow-up, respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049731511424168">Table 3</xref>

<title>Outliers</title>
<p>For some participants, we observed that levels of depression symptoms had worsened at follow-up. For example, compared to the other women, participants #2 and #3 showed large fluctuations in CES-D scores. At the pretest, participant #2’s CES-D score was 44; at posttest, her score had dropped to 5. However, at follow-up, her CES-D score had risen to 20. Similarly, participant #3 showed a high CES-D score at pretest (29) and a dramatic drop at posttest (5). At follow-up, her score had risen back to 16. Even so, in both cases, the follow-up scores showed that the participants’ symptoms were not as severe as before the intervention (represented by the baseline scores).</p>
<p>Similarly, but in the opposite direction, participants #9 and #10 started the study with low CES-D scores at pretest. Because the mood screener indicated a history of clinical depression, both women were allowed to participate, even though they initially scored 9 and 12, respectively. Throughout the study, both participants used their group time to reflect on serious psychosocial stressors. The week of the posttest, participant #9 experienced a particularly traumatic event and her posttest score of 26 reflected her current emotional state. Three months later, her score remained elevated, at 28, and she attributed her mood to the ongoing aftermath of the trauma. In contrast, participant #10 began the study with a low CES-D score, and although there were changes in the negative direction—posttest and follow-up CES-D scores were 3 and 9, respectively—she remained nondepressed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1049731511424168">
<title>Focus Groups</title>
<p>A content analysis of the transcripts of the three focus groups we conducted indicated that the participants found the CBGT groups beneficial. Specific benefits include (a) the sense of community and support the group provided; (b) the personal attention; (c) comfort in learning that others experience similar dilemmas; (d) the use of the manual; and (e) the chance to learn how to feel better and improve their relationships with significant others. The women in all three focus groups reported that they would participate again and that they would refer a friend to the groups. A few women reported that they would recommend the group to their husband or partner. In addition, they expressed that the group addressed many difficulties they had with their children or their partner that contributed to their depressed mood. Two cognitive techniques that held particular resonance was the <italic>Si, pero</italic> (Yes, but) method and the idea of recognizing and responding to the emotional bidding of their children. The mothers underscore its particular relevance for maintaining dialogue with older children. Consideration of their own childhood experiences, combined with an appreciation of the way immigration has affected their children’s development, led the mothers to feel more empathy towards their children. They especially appreciated the use of a manual that they could refer to later in the week, between sessions, and the child care that permitted them the space to “focus on themselves.” The participants also noted that the group format created a way for participants to form relationships that could extend beyond the group.</p>
<p>Despite the benefits of attending the group, transportation remained a serious obstacle. Although some women used carpools to get to group meetings, such arrangements remained tenuous depending on the commitment of the driver and the reliability of the vehicle. Even so, in communities that lack public transportation systems, like Rantoul, such arrangements play a major role in service access. Given the effort taken to attend group and the perception that attendance provided a clear benefit, a number of women noted that they wished the group was longer than an hour—they recommended an hour and a half—and that the group sessions would be ongoing (past the 10-week mark).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1049731511424168">
<title>Discussion and Applications to Practice</title>
<p>As hypothesized, participation in the intervention was associated with lower levels of depression. Moreover, among treatment completers, group attendance was high despite the challenges that transportation posed for a number of participants. An analysis of the focus group data corroborated the findings from the quantitative analysis. The participants found the intervention sufficiently useful that they would attend again and refer others to the program. The specific ways in which the participants described the helpfulness of the intervention—help with regulation of mood and family relationships—were congruent with the goals of the study.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one notable implication merits particular attention. Initial findings from this study indicate that Vida Alegre can serve as a career foundation for bilingual social work students. Through curriculum innovations and service-learning opportunities, institutions of higher education could simultaneously meet community needs and fill gaps in the workforce by training bilingual students to work in the Latino community. Unlike many other interventions, Vida Alegre targets bilingual graduate students as the primary service providers. Such an approach harnesses university resources to meet a community need and creates a much-needed training opportunity for bilingual students interested in working with Spanish-speaking populations. Indeed, one unexpected outcome of this study was an immediate increase in bilingual mental health services in the Champaign County <italic>after the intervention ended</italic>. Two of the four student therapists went on to complete their advance social work field placement at the local FQHC. As a result, we were able to offer after-care referrals to participants (the majority of whom were uninsured). Given that this was the first time the School of Social Work had placed MSW students as mental health interns at the FQHC, it is unlikely that the students would have sought such a placement without the training they had received through Vida Alegre. Even more strikingly, the same FQHC that had been unable to hire a bilingual social worker, despite having funding to make such a hire, offered to hire one of the interns as a full-time staff member upon graduation.</p>
<sec id="section30-1049731511424168">
<title>Study Limitations and Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>Although this study demonstrated feasibility—participants exposed to the intervention experienced a sustained reduction in depressive symptoms—limitations presented themselves. First, the high drop-out rate led to a small sample size that limited our ability to control other variables that might contribute to lower levels of depression, such as taking psychotropic medication or seeking out other forms of therapy. In addition, the high drop-out rate suggest that future studies with this population must include a better tracking system for participants, as a subgroup of women would have move and/or changed her number before the intervention ends.</p>
<p>Second, because the study aimed to establish feasibility, this study does not include a comparison group; therefore, threats to internal validity cannot be dismissed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731511424168">Carroll &amp; Nuro, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1049731511424168">Rounsaville et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1049731511424168">Tebes et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, a study with a larger sample and a randomized experimental design is needed to further test the strength of the intervention.</p>
<p>A third limitation rests on the use of bilingual students; the replication of this intervention is limited to communities that can draw upon institutions of higher education within close proximity. For those communities without such institution, training models need to be developed that equip members of the Hispanic community to work as paraprofessionals or peer counselors. Fourth, despite overcoming a number of obstacles that affect service access—the lack of bilingual providers, the availability of child care, and the lack of culturally tailored services for immigrants—Vida Alegre was unable to overcome the problem of transportation. Although the lack of transportation may negatively bias the effect of the intervention, in a real-world sense, transportation remains a formidable obstacle across services sectors.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, though based on a nonexperimental design and a small sample, the results are promising, especially if issues of retention can be addressed in a future trial. Many service agencies struggle to find bilingual providers and most cannot provide support services in Spanish to facilitate treatment adherence. Although this intervention cannot be generalized to all communities that lack bilingual mental health services, this study does highlight the potential to for those communities that neighbor institutions of higher education to meet a need. A recent report by the Pew Hispanic Center further underscores this potential. In 2010, the enrollment of Hispanic students in higher education rose by 24%, making them the largest minority group on campuses in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049731511424168">Fry, 2011</xref>). This study demonstrates that an existing CBGT can be modified to address immigrant issues and shows that bilingual graduate students (an untapped resource in new growth communities) can implement such an intervention.</p>

<sec id="section31-1049731511424168">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite the difficulties that language barriers pose, this study indicates that these problems might be surmountable, even in communities with scarce bilingual human resources. In the context of a nation on the precipice of a sweeping cultural change, where language—specifically, Spanish—plays a central role in health and social services, such services will have to become more linguistically and culturally accessible to meet the needs of the growing Latino population. Moreover, as the demand for Spanish-language proficiency continues to outstrip available resources, an opportunity exists for social work educational institutions to meet this emerging cultural and linguistic reality. Because this nation’s future prosperity remains linked with the well-being of its Latino population, the time and resources must be invested in building the capacity of social workers to respond to their needs.</p>
