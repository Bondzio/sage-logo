<abstract>
<p>Telemental health is the use of information and communications technologies and broadband networks to deliver mental health services and support wellness. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the efficiency and utility of telemental health, certain barriers may impede its implementation, including the attitudes of mental health service providers. The current study draws on the technology acceptance model (TAM) to understand the role of mental health service providers’ attitudes and perceptions of telemental health (psychotherapy delivered via videoconferencing) on their intention to use this technology with their patients. A sample of 205 broadly defined mental health service providers working on 32 First Nations reserves in the province of Quebec completed the questionnaire adapted to assess TAM for telepsychotherapy. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling provided evidence for the factor validity and reliability of the TAM in this sample. The key predictor of the intention to use telepsychotherapy was not mental health providers’ attitude toward telepsychotherapy, nor how much they expected this service to be complicated to use, but essentially how useful they expect it to be for their First Nations patients. If telemental health via videoconferencing is to be implemented in First Nations communities, it is essential to thoroughly demonstrate its utility to mental health providers. Perceived usefulness will have a positive impact on attitudes toward this technology, and perceived ease of use will positively influence perceived usefulness. Cultural issues specific to the populations receiving telemental health services may be more efficiently addressed from the angle of perceived usefulness.</p>

<p>There is considerable unmet need for mental health services across Canada among those living in remote and rural locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363461513487665">Barbopoulos &amp; Clark, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461513487665">Health Canada, 2004</xref>). Mental health problems in the labor force cost Canada about $33 billion a year in lost business production alone. This does not include the costs of treatment and health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363461513487665">Wilkerson, 2004</xref>). More than six million people live in remote and rural locations in Canada, including First Nations, Inuit, and Metis communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363461513487665">Statistics Canada, 2006</xref>). To connect clients and mental health service providers, the Canadian government has promoted telehealth over the last 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461513487665">Health Canada, 2004</xref>). Originally known as closed-circuit two-way television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1363461513487665">Wittson &amp; Benschoter, 1972</xref>), telemental health is conceptualized as the use of telecommunications technologies and broadband networks to deliver health services and support wellness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513487665">O’Donnell et al., 2010</xref>). It encompasses a wide range of services, including promotion and prevention through web-based applications, telecare lines, remote diagnosis and treatment, and the use of videoconferencing to access and deliver mental health care at a distance in real time in two-way interactive sessions using videoconferencing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363461513487665">Germain, Marchand, Bouchard, Drouin, &amp; Guay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461513487665">Health Canada, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363461513487665">Richardson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Numerous telehealth projects and studies in the general population have demonstrated that prevention and treatment delivered through telemental health systems such as videoconferencing appear to be as effective as face-to-face treatment for a variety of mental health problems; these include treatment for memory disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363461513487665">Poon, Hui, Dai, Kwok, &amp; Woo, 2005</xref>), psychotherapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363461513487665">Allard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363461513487665">Bouchard et al., 2000</xref>), psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363461513487665">Frueh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363461513487665">Germain, Marchand, Bouchard, Guay, &amp; Drouin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363461513487665">Morland et al., 2010</xref>), addressing anxiety in cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363461513487665">Shepherd et al., 2006</xref>), psychotherapy for eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363461513487665">Mitchell, Myers, Swan-Kremeier, &amp; Wonderlich, 2003</xref>) or the treatment of depression in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363461513487665">Nelson, Barnard, &amp; Cain, 2006</xref>). In fact, some children and adolescents have expressed a preference for videoconferencing sessions over face-to-face care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363461513487665">Elford et al., 2001</xref>). The therapeutic alliance between client and mental health service providers, considered by some a key factor for effective treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461513487665">Simpson, 2009</xref>), is not compromised when videoconferencing is used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363461513487665">Allard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363461513487665">Reese &amp; Stone, 2005</xref>). However, two important observations can be noted from overall telehealth projects and studies. First, few studies have focused on First Nations or other Aboriginal communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363461513487665">Gibson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363461513487665">Gibson, Kakepetum-Schultz, Coulson, &amp; O’Donnell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363461513487665">Gibson &amp; O’Donnell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363461513487665">KO, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363461513487665">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363461513487665">Muttitt, Vigneault, &amp; Loewen, 2004</xref>). This observation is surprising given the great need for mental health services in these communities and the fact that telemental health has been clearly identified as an important tool by the Canadian government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461513487665">Health Canada, 2004</xref>). Second, despite the positive research findings and potential utility, telemental health has not yet been widely adopted in Canada to deliver psychotherapy services and it is still underused with clients in underserved rural and remote areas, including Aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>Telehealth projects and studies have shown that this technology can facilitate effective and appropriate delivery of health services for individuals living in remote and rural First Nations communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363461513487665">Gibson et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363461513487665">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363461513487665">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363461513487665">Gibson &amp; O’Donnell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363461513487665">KO, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363461513487665">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363461513487665">Muttitt et al., 2004</xref>). Qualitative studies have highlighted three main advantages of telemental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363461513487665">Gibson et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363461513487665">2011</xref>). First, telemental health may be a tool to enable greater continuity of mental health care for community members and greater access to mental health service. Second, telemental health allows the patient to remain in his or her home community when accessing mental health services. Finally, community members appear to feel comfortable with the use of this technology, as indicated by their comments that telemental health (as opposed to in-person sessions) may actually facilitate disclosure and allow them to talk more openly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363461513487665">Brasfield &amp; Clement, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363461513487665">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363461513487665">KO, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond these advantages, some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363461513487665">Gibson et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363461513487665">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363461513487665">Muttitt et al., 2004</xref>) have identified disadvantages or challenges that impede telemental health implementation. Concerning hardware, barriers such as the costs of installation and maintenance of videoconferencing equipment can be very high in locations where landline connections do not exist. Moreover, ongoing technical support and staff training are often unavailable. The barriers specific to psychotherapy include both legal and ethical issues such as privacy, security, and confidentiality, and safety concerns when the client is in a crisis and the therapist is not physically there to help. Another potential barrier to the adoption of telemental health is the willingness of mental health service providers to use this technology, which is likely to be influenced by their attitudes toward delivering psychotherapy with telemental health tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461513487665">Davis, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Attitudes and perceptions regarding telemental health as a means of receiving mental health services are commonly assessed by the technology acceptance model (TAM), developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461513487665">Davis (1989)</xref> based on the theory of reasoned action. The model outlines two categories of beliefs that influence attitudes toward and intention to use a technology: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1363461513487665">Figure 1</xref>, these beliefs lead to attitudes and intentions toward using new technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363461513487665">Day, Demiris, Oliver, Courtney, &amp; Hensel, 2007</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-1363461513487665" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Technology acceptance model by Davies (1989).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1363461513487665-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>More precisely, perceived usefulness is defined as “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461513487665">Davis, 1989</xref>, p. 320), while perceived ease of use is “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461513487665">Davis, 1989</xref>, p. 320). Attitude toward use is a general feeling of favorableness or unfavorableness toward the specific information system under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461513487665">Davis, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The TAM is considered a robust model for understanding factors influencing how a technology is used and accepted by individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363461513487665">Lee, Kozar, &amp; Larsen, 2003</xref>). It has come to be one of the most widely used models to describe why a technology is adopted, notably because of its clarity and simplicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513487665">King &amp; He, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363461513487665">Mezni, Gagnon, Desmartis, &amp; Duplantie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1363461513487665">Yang &amp; Yoo, 2004</xref>). However, while meta-analyses of the use of the TAM have demonstrated the validity of its main constructs in the larger spectrum of applications on information technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513487665">King &amp; He, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363461513487665">Legris, Ingham, &amp; Collerette, 2003</xref>), slightly different versions of the TAM have been validated with different technologies. Indeed, TAM relationships are not replicated with every technology tested, and the predicted effects vary in studies with different types of users and systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513487665">King &amp; He, 2006</xref>) including the relationship between attitudes toward other forms of cybertherapies and telehealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363461513487665">Bertrand &amp; Bouchard, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, telehealth projects are promising but existing studies have theoretical and methodological limitations. One recent study in Canada utilized TAM-like questions to explore health service providers’ attitudes toward and perceptions of the clinical use of telemental health (Simms et al., 2011), but did not specifically address Aboriginal communities. Investigations focusing on Aboriginal communities’ perceptions have used exclusively qualitative research methods with data from 5 to 56 in-person and telephone interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363461513487665">Gibson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363461513487665">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363461513487665">Gibson &amp; O’Donnell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363461513487665">Muttitt et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, these interviews used structured interview guides to collect demographic and introductory information and attitudes toward technologies for community health and wellness but were not based on the TAM. Finally, no study has looked at the <italic>providers</italic> of mental health services in Aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>The current study draws on the TAM to understand health service providers’ attitudes toward and perceptions of telemental health (psychotherapy delivered by videoconferencing). Our general hypothesis, based on the TAM, is that mental health service providers who perceive greater usefulness and perceived ease of use of telepsychotherapy would report positive attitudes toward use of this technology and would use this technology more frequently. To reflect the reality of First Nations communities, mental health service providers were broadly defined as people considered by the community to be involved in the delivery of mental health services, as opposed to only certified professionals (e.g., psychologists, doctors).</p>

<sec id="sec2-1363461513487665"><title>Sample</title>
<p>The researchers were invited by 32 First Nations communities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363461513487665">1</xref></sup> in the province of Quebec to provide a workshop on the promotion of responsible gaming to broadly defined mental health service providers (i.e., people considered by the communities and their leaders as involved in the delivery of mental health services, ranging from nurses and psychologists to community elders). With approval from the Ethics in Research Board of the University of Quebec in Outaouais, workshop participants were invited to complete a survey on attitudes toward telemental health. From a total of 266 workshop participants who had never used videoconferencing to deliver psychotherapy, 205 completed anonymously and confidentially a consent form and a questionnaire about telepsychotherapy (response rate of 77%).

<sec id="sec3-1363461513487665"><title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>The Telepsychotherapy Acceptance Questionnaire was used to measure perceptions of the use of telepsychotherapy (telemental health applied specifically to psychotherapy and delivered through videoconference) as a means to provide mental health services (see Appendix). This questionnaire, originally written in French and translated into English for this study, was adapted from the questionnaires of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461513487665">Davis (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363461513487665">Venkatesh (2000)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363461513487665">Venkatesh and Davis (2000)</xref>. The two modifications were: (a) formulating the items referring to First Nations communities and using conditional tense (e.g., “If my community would have access to telepsychotherapy through videoconference, I would refer my clients to that service”); and (b) applying the items to the context of telepsychotherapy (e.g., “If my clients should receive psychotherapy through videoconference<italic>…</italic>”). All the items use a 7-point Likert scale ranging from “<italic>strongly disagree</italic>” to “<italic>strongly agree</italic>” with a middle neutral point, except for the measure of attitudes toward the use of videoconferencing, which used bipolar semantic differential scale items, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461513487665">Davis (1989)</xref>. This measure assessed attitudes toward a behavior: “Globally, I believe that receiving psychotherapy through videoconference for my clients would be…” with responses rated on 7-point bipolar scales (good–bad; wise–foolish; favorable–unfavorable; beneficial–harmful; positive–negative) with a neutral value in the middle. The internal consistency of the scale ranged from .85 to .92 in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513487665">King &amp; He, 2006</xref>), and the Cronbach’s alpha in the current sample was .94.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1363461513487665"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>The factorial validity of the Telepsychotherapy Acceptance Questionnaire (TAQ) was examined through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).<sup>2</sup> The a priori CFA model hypothesized that: (a) answers to the TAQ could be explained by four factors: perceived usefulness (4 items), perceived ease of use (3 items), attitude toward videoconference (5 items), and intention to use (2 items); (b) each item would have a nonzero loading on the factor it was designed to measure, and nonsignificant loadings on all other factors; (c) the four factors would be correlated; and (d) uniquenesses would be uncorrelated. Given that one latent variable (intention to use) has only two indicators per construct—and that this configuration was suboptimal and creates a locally underidentified latent construct (although the overall model may be overidentified)—we used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363461513487665">Little, Lindenberger, and Nesselroade’s (1999)</xref> suggestion to circumvent this problem. These authors suggest placing equality constraints on the loadings of both indicators (fixing both loadings to 1, or placing equality constraints and fixing the variance to 1) to help locate the construct at the true intersection (centroid) of the indicators. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363461513487665">Little et al. (1999)</xref> note that this procedure results in a decrease in the fit of the measurement models.</p>
<p>These analyses were performed with M<italic>plus</italic> 6.1 program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363461513487665">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010</xref>), using robust maximum likelihood estimation (MLR). This estimator was used because the number of categories of the Likert-type scale of the TAQ (i.e., 7) could be considered as reasonably continuous without any loss of information, as suggested by several scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461513487665">Beauducel &amp; Herzberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363461513487665">DiStefano, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363461513487665">Dolan, 1994</xref>). In addition, the full-information MLR estimator was used to correct for the small amounts of missing data present at the item level of the Telepsychotherapy Acceptance Questionnaire (0.49% to 6.83%; M<sub>missing</sub> = 1.72%; SD<sub>missing</sub> = 2.13%).</p>
<p>The hypothesized technology acceptance model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461513487665">Davies, 1989</xref>), illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1363461513487665">Figure 1</xref>, was tested with M<italic>plus</italic> 6.1 program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363461513487665">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010</xref>), using the full-information MLR estimator. The indirect effects (mediation effects) were tested following recent recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363461513487665">Fritz &amp; MacKinnon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363461513487665">Kenny, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363461513487665">MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, &amp; Sheets, 2002</xref>): (a) the predictor (P) was significantly related with the mediator (M) (the a path); (b) M was significantly related with O (the b path); and (c) the P–O relationship was significantly reduced when M is simultaneously entered in the equation. The significance of the indirect effects in the latent variable model was examined using the bias-corrected (BC) bootstrap 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) method recommended by MacKinnon and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363461513487665">MacKinnon, Lockwood, &amp; Williams, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363461513487665">Williams &amp; MacKinnon, 2008</xref>). If this interval excludes zero, the indirect effect obtained can be considered as statistically significant. In the present study, the bootstrap analysis was computed with a sample size of 1,000 bootstrap samples as recently suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461513487665">Cheung and Lau (2008)</xref> and Lau and Cheung (2012).</p>
<p>Assessment of model fit was examined using various fit indices. First, the Chi-square statistic (χ<sup>2</sup>) was estimated. However, because this test is known to be oversensitive to sample size, minor departures from multivariate normality, and minor model misspecifications, scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363461513487665">Bollen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363461513487665">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>) have suggested relying on additional indices that are less dependent on sample size. Consequently, five additional fit indices were used (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363461513487665">Byrne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363461513487665">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363461513487665">MacCallum, Browne, &amp; Sugawara, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363461513487665">Marsh, Hau, &amp; Grayson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363461513487665">Marsh, Hau, &amp; Wen, 2004</xref>; Schermelleh, Moosbrugger, &amp; Muller, 2003): The comparative fit index (CFI; values ≥ .90 are adequate and ≥ .95 are preferable), the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI; values ≥ .90), the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR; values ≤ .08 are adequate and ≤ .05 are preferable), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA values ≤ .10 are adequate and ≤.08 are preferable), and the 90% confidence interval of the RMSEA (values less than .05 for the lower bound and less than .08 for the upper bounds or containing zero for the lower bound and less than .05 for the upper bounds (right side) provide respectively acceptable and good model fit). Finally, scale score reliability was computed from the CFA standardized parameter estimates, using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363461513487665">McDonald’s (1970)</xref> ω<italic> = </italic>(Σ|λi|)<sup>2</sup> / ([Σ|λi|]<sup>2</sup> + Σδii) where λi are the factor loadings and δii, the error variances.</p>

<p>The a priori CFA model resulted in a significant chi-square (χ<sup>2 </sup>= 157.39, <italic>df</italic> = 72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and acceptable goodness of fit indices (CFI = .956, TLI = .944, RMSEA = .076; RMSEA 90% CI: .060–.092; SRMR = .031). Nevertheless, examination of the factor loadings revealed that 1 item from the <italic>perceived ease of use</italic> factor should be deleted (nonsignificant and lower than .30). An alternative model was thus reestimated (without this item) and results provided a significant chi-square (χ<sup>2 </sup>= 154.30, <italic>df</italic> = 61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and an acceptable goodness of fit indices (CFI = .950, TLI = .936, RMSEA = .087; RMSEA 90% CI: .070–.104; SRMR = .065). The standardized factor loadings and latent intercorrelations of this model are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1363461513487665">Figure 2</xref> and they are all significant and substantial. Finally, results revealed that the scales exhibited modest to acceptable internal consistency coefficients (ω) ranging from .64 for perceived ease of use to .98 for attitude toward videoconference. The intercorrelations between the variables were calculated with Pearson correlations and were all significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1363461513487665">Table 3</xref>).

<p>The hypothesized technology acceptance model, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1363461513487665">Figure 1</xref>, resulted in a significant chi-square (χ<sup>2 </sup>= 154.59, <italic>df</italic> = 62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and acceptable goodness of fit indices (CFI = .950, TLI = .938, RMSEA = .086; RMSEA 90% CI: .069–.103; SRMR = .065).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363461513487665">3</xref></sup> In this model, perceived ease of use accounted for 83% of the variance of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness accounted for 59% of the variance of attitudes toward videoconference, and this model accounted for 68% of the variance of intention to use. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1363461513487665">Figure 3</xref>, there were significant direct effects of: (a) perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); (b) perceived usefulness on attitudes toward videoconference (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); and (c) perceived usefulness on intention to use (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). However, there was no significant effect of perceived ease of use on attitudes toward videoconference, and of attitudes toward videoconference on intention to use. Additional results revealed indirect effects of perceived ease of use (with perceived usefulness as mediator) on intention to use (β = .82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, BC bootstrap 95% CI: .652 to .977). Nevertheless, there were no significant indirect effects of perceived ease of use (with attitudes toward videoconference as mediator) on intention to use (β = −.02, <italic>p</italic> = .71, BC bootstrap 95% CI: −.148 to .101), and of perceived usefulness (with attitudes toward videoconference as mediator) on intention to use (β = −.05, <italic>p</italic> = .52, BC bootstrap 95% CI: −.194 to .097). Therefore, these findings provide support for the alternative technology acceptance model and the key role of perceived usefulness.

<p>This study draws on the TAM to understand how health service providers’ attitudes toward and perceptions of telemental health (psychotherapy delivered by videoconferencing) influence their intention of using telemental health services with their patients residing in First Nations communities. The general hypothesis based on the TAM was confirmed and significant support was found for a theoretical model fitting the factorial structure of the TAM. More precisely, four important relationships emerged from the two main factors of TAM, <italic>perceived usefulness</italic> and <italic>perceived ease of use</italic>. First, perceived ease of use of videoconferencing for psychotherapy purpose had a positive and direct effect on perceived usefulness among mental health providers to patients from First Nations communities, as expected from models by Davis and Venkatesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461513487665">Davis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363461513487665">Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>). Moreover, the proportion of variance demonstrated that perceived ease of use was a strong predictor of perceived usefulness. In other words, technology that is considered easy to use would be perceived as more useful.</p>
<p>Second, our results showed that perceived usefulness positively and directly influences attitudes toward videoconferencing and intention to use videoconferencing. These findings confirm the pivotal role of perceiving a technology as useful in order to use it. According to the TAM and the theory of reasoned action, both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use should predict attitudes toward videoconferencing for clinical purposes. However, this study found that for mental health providers only perceived usefulness significantly predicted attitudes. The role of perceived usefulness on attitude toward telepsychotherapy has already been supported in numerous studies, conducted with the general population, that underlined the strong link between individuals’ feelings toward technology and how much telemental health is considered credible and satisfactory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363461513487665">Burnett &amp; Taylor, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363461513487665">Burnett, Taylor, &amp; Agras, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363461513487665">Clarke, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363461513487665">Delaplain, Lindborg, Norton, &amp; Hastings, 1993</xref>; Mclaren, Blunded, Lipsedge, &amp; Summerfield, 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363461513487665">Richardson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, perceived ease of use influenced intention to use videoconference only indirectly through perceived usefulness. This finding is consistent with the TAM model and a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363461513487665">Bertrand and Bouchard (2008)</xref>, which also identified perceived usefulness as a mediator between perceived ease of use and intention to use cybertherapies. Globally, the two cognitive constructs in the original models from Davis and Venkatesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461513487665">Davis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363461513487665">Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>)—perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use—predicted the intention to use videoconference with patients from First Nations communities, but according to different (direct or indirect) paths. A direct path was found between perceived usefulness and attitude, as well as between perceived usefulness and intention of use. An indirect path was found between perceived ease of use and intention of using telemental health.</p>
<p>The most important finding is that attitude toward telepsychotherapy was not a significant predictor of intention, and only perceived usefulness predicted intention to use videoconferencing technology to provide psychotherapy services to patients from First Nations communities. The first implication of this finding would be for future implementation of telemental health services: among health care providers working in First Nations and other Aboriginal communities, the essential prerequisite for using telepsychotherapy is finding it useful. Attitudes toward telepsychotherapy are not significant predictors and technological challenges only have an indirect impact, through perceived usefulness. Usefulness will foster a positive attitude. To foster implementation of this technology among mental health care providers, therefore, it is important to document the advantages for the patients, such as receiving treatments provided by the therapist one wants and not only the one available on site; not having to go where the therapists are or wait for them to fly to the village; reduction in time spent traveling; and the possibility to benefit from brief and specific input or support from another or expert therapist during the course of a psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363461513487665">Gibson et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363461513487665">2011</xref>). The use of videoconferencing equipment might also be extended to support other telehealth and community-based programs. The scope of telemental health services and the selection of providers actually involved in the delivery of telehealth should be broadened to include social workers, family counselors, psychologists, spiritual counselors, traditional healers, and others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363461513487665">KO, 2006</xref>). Finally, offering telepsychotherapy services should be available also in the “rural to urban” direction (i.e., from First Nations people to patients living in urban areas) and not only from urban centers to remote communities.</p>
<p>The second implication is that perceptions of ease of use and usefulness should be considered separately and successively. This is consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461513487665">Davis (1989</xref>), who suggests that users adopt a technology first on the basis of the tasks it can perform for them, and then consider the level of difficulty associated with its operation. This also appears to be the case with other cyberpsychology tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363461513487665">Bertrand &amp; Bouchard, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Telemental health is particularly appealing because it can provide better access to mental health services in remote areas to underserved populations. However, the applications of telemental health are potentially much broader. Telemental health could lead to radical modifications in how mental health services are provided, because the delivery of mental health services need not rely on geographical proximity. For example, telemental health could be used to deliver mental health services to patients in urban areas by therapists located in rural areas (e.g., on a First Nations reserve). Therapists and patients sharing similar cultural values or characteristics could be part of a mental health network in which services are delivered without the limitations and barriers imposed by geographical distance.</p>
<p>A few inherent limitations to this study must be highlighted. The study used a convenience sample of mental health service providers selected from 32 First Nations communities. A second limitation pertains to the broad definition of mental health providers. We included anyone actually providing mental health services, which reflects the reality of services in First Nations communities, but including a high proportion of nonprofessionals creates heterogeneity and may influence the findings related to participants’ intention of using telemental health, and compromise the generalization of our results to samples consisting only of licensed professionals.</p>
<p>This study, using a quantitative research method based on the TAM, sought an understanding of how the attitudes and perceptions of people providing mental health services to First Nations patients may lead to positive intention of using telepsychotherapies delivered through videoconferencing systems. The findings highlight the fundamental constructs playing a role in intentions of delivering psychotherapy through videoconference, and indicate that perceived usefulness may be the key to implementation of empirically validated treatment that could be delivered from anywhere, including from communities sharing similar cultural heritage and challenges.</p>

<bio>
<p><bold>Johana Monthuy-Blanc</bold> is an associate professor at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières. In 2009, she obtained a PhD in Human Movement Sciences (psychology specialty) from the University of Montpellier 1, France and a PhD in Education (psychoeducation specialty) from the Université de Sherbrooke, Canada. From 2008 to 2010, she was a course lecturer at the University of Aix-Marseille II in France and the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. In 2010 and 2011, she was a postdoctoral researcher at the Canada Research Chair in Clinical Cyberpsychology at UQO, where she worked on the current publication. Her current research interests are: (a) understanding eating disorders from a developmental psychopathological approach; (b) ecological momentary assessment as a measurement method and therapeutic tool for eating disorders; (c) virtual reality applied to eating disorders as preventive and therapeutic intervention; and (d) self-concept and body image as personality traits or emotional states to understand factors associated with eating disorders in adolescents, patients and athletes.</p>
<p><bold>Stéphane Bouchard</bold> received his PhD in 1995. He now holds the Canada Research Chair in Clinical Cyberpsychololgy and is a professor at the Université du Québec en Outaouais (UQO), where he teaches cyberpsychology and cognitive behavior psychotherapy. As a scientist-practitioner, his research focuses on clinical applications of cyberpsychology and the treatment of anxiety disorders. His current research projects involve: (a) developing virtual environments to treat complex anxiety disorders; (b) randomized control trials on the efficacy of telepsychotherapy or immersion in virtual reality to treat anxiety disorders, pathological gambling, eating disorders, or assess neuropsychological disorders; and (c) conducting experimental studies to understand why telepsychotherapy or virtual reality are effective treatment tools. His research lab holds <italic>Psyche</italic>, the only six-sided total immersion system dedicated to mental health research (see w3.uqo.ca/cyberpsy for more details).</p>
<p><bold>Christophe Maïano</bold> received his PhD in Human Movement Sciences at the Université Montpellier 1, France. He is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychoeducation and Psychology at the Université du Québec en Outaouais (UQO) and a researcher associated with the Canada Research Chair in Clinical Cyberpsychology of UQO. Most of his research is centered on the assessment of multidimensional self-conceptions and related concepts in adolescents with or without intellectual disabilities and on studying the development and impact of self-conceptions on the adaptation and mental health problems of these youths (including obesity, eating disorders, and depression). His research is based on an interactionist sociocognitive perspective and has looked at the influence of social contexts (social comparisons, stereotypes, significant others, peers, schools, etc.), and more importantly the athletic context, on the construction and development of positive general and physical self-conceptions in adolescents with and without intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p><bold>Monique Séguin</bold>, PhD, is a professor of psychology at the Université du Québec en Outaouais and a researcher in the McGill Group on Suicide Studies. She received her PhD in 1993. Among other projects, she leads a research project assessing the implementation of a program promoting responsible gambling and mental health in First Nations and Aboriginal communities, where the current data was collected. She is currently Codirector of the Clinical Axis of the Research Québec Network on Suicide and is responsible for the Mental Health Axis of the CSSS Gatineau. She has collaborated as an expert consultant with the French National Research Institute (INSERM) in Paris and received the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention Research Award.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1363461513487665"><title>Use of new technologies</title>
<p>The following questions will help us understand your opinion about your clients/patients ever getting help for a gambling addiction <bold>or any other mental health issues</bold>, through videoconference. Psychotherapy through videoconference (i.e., <bold>telepsychotherapy</bold>) consists of the client being in one city while his therapist is delivering the therapy from another city. Both can communicate through videoconference (live through a television instead than face to face). This videoconference system allows the client to have access to a specialized therapist and have live communication through a camera and television.</p>
