<abstract>
<p>This essay seeks to reflect upon, rescue, make sense of, incorporate my “I” in my research experiences with Chilean survivors of political imprisonment. In an attempt to free and recover my “I”—quiet until today—to re-think, remember, and to build while I am standing in the middle of the process, I will tell some “moments” and situations I experienced during my research with some of the members of this Chilean group. I will use storytelling, counter-story-telling, performance texts, and short stories associated with the concepts of “victim,” “trauma,” “study subject,” “ethical aspects,” and “initial researcher background.” This is an attempt to move me past my “thin”—previous form to making research—to “thick description-as-inscription.” I am thinking about, and developing the Framing the research question. Finally, I will develop some recommendations that might be useful for researchers who are interested in working and addressing these issues.</p>

<body>
<p>Conducting research on former political prisoners is a major challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452853">Zapata, 2008</xref>). It is much more difficult than one might initially imagine. At least it was so for me. Doing this requires commitment, empathy, strength, proximity, time, patience, and acceptance of what one is beginning to understand. It is not easy because it involves dealing with human pain and the effects of mistreatment that show how miserable human beings can behave. On the other hand, it is rewarding to see how one person can continue with their plans and dreams of life, raise a family, and move on without hate and keep their political beliefs and party intact.</p>
<p>Initially there was no doubt that their experiences produced effects that marked both the lives of the researchers and the victims who lived through their experiences with political imprisonment and torture. One part of the researcher “witness” activities involves, the life stories or testimonies. Researchers suffer from exposure to victims’ trauma and finally a part of your self will never be the same.</p>
<p>I present stories that are written in the first-person voice, from my personal point of view. I do the observing and the writing. This is a minimalist, performative social science venture into storytelling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800412452853">Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 1998</xref>). This is an attempt to create a ritual space “where people gather to listen, to experience, to better understand the world and their place in it” (Jenkins, 1999, p. 19, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412452853">Denzin, 2001</xref>). Storytelling seeks the truth of life’s victims by evoking memories, feelings, and the meanings of facts that are reconstituted in the telling, when remembered and where there are connections between the stories that are told.</p>
<p>I am using a thick description as performative writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412452853">Denzin, 2001</xref>). I am attempting to rescue the meanings and experiences that I experienced during my first attempt to conduct research on the victims. Both the reader and the writer can interpret the stories I have told. I attempted to provoke readers to relive the experience through my eyes. This essay seeks to meet audiences in a shared field of experiences, emotions, and actions. Part of my life can be found in these words.</p>
<p>Below are some moments I found significant.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077800412452853">
<title>Scene 1. First Contact</title>
<p>Santiago de Chile, downtown, midday, summer, 2005.</p>
<p>I am in a socialist political place in Santiago de Chile. The office is on the first floor in an old building. The place is dark and everything is old and very somber. I made contact with the political secretary, a kindly woman who knew through my uncle Eloy, an old radical member of, and president of, the radical party in northern Chile. He had a cordial primarily telephone relationship with this woman. She was about 50 years old when I knew her. I remember that her face was like the face of a woman who had been born in the capital. She had a tanned skin, long straight black hair, and a fresh facial expression. When I met her, she knew about my needs, and I explained the primary goals of my PhD project. She immediately called a man, and she told me that he was the best contact for my project.</p>
<p>This man was a member of the socialist party in Santiago de Chile and was the president of a group of ex-prisoners in Chile. I remembered that I was quite nervous, and worried because I had never been able to give faces to the victims. I felt like a child in the middle of the conflict. Crime and punishment was a concept that developed in my mind. This was a new type of contact and relationship with people with whom I had not had previous contact. At that time, I had a project in Spain and my annual scholarship was ending. For these reasons, I was worried about finishing a number of steps in a short period of time: (a) making contact with people who could help me obtain a sample of subjects, (b) gain their confidence, (c) conduct my in-depth interviews (develop in Spain with my advisor from Spain), (d) search for a good sample, (e) organize a good trip to find sample subjects in northern, central, and southern Chile, (f) who would respond to my research questions.</p>
<p>When the secretary contacted me by phone, she handed the phone to a man who spoke with me. In a cordial, but cautious, attitude, the man who had contacted through my uncle gave me information about the activities of, and some phone numbers and addresses of, leaders in Santiago. I remember that while the man was giving me this information, he was wondering how was my uncle, and how about my life in Spain was going. The man on telephone spoke with me in smooth and easy manner. I remember his quiet and calm voice. I could sense an attitude of distrust and suspicion, which was offset to some degree by his warm and familiar voice. In his reality, who was I? From his point of view, I might be an infiltrator, a member of the opposition and possibly opposed to their ideals and political interests. Who was I? What were the real reasons for an unknown girl who was “not a direct victim” being interested in doing this research? This was something unusual for those years. Today I ask myself again . . . who was I to him?</p>
<p>I remember the phone conversation. I was attempting to gain the confidence of the man with whom I spoke. How could tell him that my intentions were to conduct a study that I hoped would contribute to Chilean psychology? How could I explain to him that my initial motivations were not political motivations?</p>
<p>How could I tell him that I had deep fears, because when I was a child I had heard the government saying that they were “dangerous” people?</p>
<p>These notions were in my mind, and they contrasted with the voice of the man with whom I was talking. I imagined a thin man, above 60 years of age, wearing glasses, dressed in black, sitting in a dark room with a small window through which the noontime sunlight came in. I never met him.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1077800412452853">
<title>Scene 2.Where I Am? Where I Am Going?</title>
<p>Linares, unknown location, afternoon, summer day</p>
<p>I remember that it was a fresh summer night, as nights usually are in south-central Chile. I could hear the noise of the leaves rustling in the wind. It was a place unknown to me. I arrived there with my backpack on a bus from Santiago. It was a small town called Linares. I knew where I was going, where I went, and had no idea what I was going to find . . .</p>
<p>Luckily, I found the only taxi that was currently available in the bus station. I asked the taxi driver to take me to the address I pointed to in my notebook. The taxi driver asked me “What I was doing it?” in a place like that at 8:00 p.m. at night. I wondered the same thing. He replied that he would meet with the group of former political prisoners, there was a national meeting of representatives . . . First silence occurs . . . then I heard him say in a low voice, almost imperceptibly, “and that still meets.” I saw one of my ghosts pass by.</p>
<p>After crossing several streets, the driver left me at the door of what appeared to be a school. To my surprise, when I arrived there everything was closed and the lights were turned off. I thought that I had the wrong address. Anyway, I got off the taxi. Uncertainty . . .</p>
<p>The minutes pass . . . 10 minutes, 15 . . . 30 . . . Confusion, concern, disorientation . . . What shall I do? Can I return to Santiago? Can I find a bus? Maybe I should not have come . . . I feel cold, I start to worry. I arrived at night, with no more than an address. I am being punished for this. Am I going to one of the residences?</p>
<p>Everything was very dark, the streets where the school was on which we were to meet were very dark. It seemed as if an area of large parcels with streets were impassable to pedestrians, where trucks and vans lived in the same places as farmers working in fields, but did so by day. It was night and Pamela was scared . . .</p>
<p>While I wait, I look around me and see a small store in town, very modest, which was inserted into a small house made of light material that is typical of small towns in southern Chile. They are usually familiar places where the majority of customers know each other. Such stores also handle a lot of information and assist visitors if the owner is willing to do so.</p>
<p>Such places are familiar to me. I ask the man who was sitting behind the desk at an inn whether he knew some of the people whose names I had recorded in my notebook. I told him I was visiting a national meeting of former political prisoners. The man told me that he had not been informed about the event. I asked if I could make a phone call from his phone . . .</p>
<p>At that moment I turned around and saw a man who was above 65 years of age and who had a thin build and a height of approximately 1.60 meters. The man had smooth grey hair. It fell on his face at an angle that partially covered the side of the glasses he used. I can remember that although his clothes were of a youthful style, he wore a black shirt with bright colors and drawings of palm trees, very light summer trousers and sandals—his face reflected fatigue and age.</p>
<p>I was impressed by the sadness and resignation I saw pain in his eyes, which contrasted with his speech and his active and jovial posture and attitude. His appearance was appealing to me because the man had an “atypical” look and appeared bohemian by Chilean standards. I smiled at him as he turned toward me when he said to me, “Hey, I heard that come-to-the-meeting-message. I am a barber, and I had to close my hairdresser shop to come here. I have traveled many hours from the south . . . we are going to the same place. I do not understand why there is nothing. But let’s ask.” Whom shall we go to ask? I thought to myself, if no one! Despite the situation, Pamela breathes and takes a first breath . . .</p>
<p>*I then learned that the man had been severely tortured.</p>

<sec id="section3-1077800412452853">
<title>Scene 3. The Test for Confidence</title>
<p>Contacted/knowledge: Impact. With one foot inside and one outside.</p>
<p>The same man from the south who is ahead of me makes some calls.</p>
<p>He calls someone and tells her that he is with a girl from the north by the name of Pamela. We then cross the street, and he said over the telephone that the national leaders are gathered in the establishment. We are asked to please wait a few minutes.</p>
<p>We now wait in front of the school. In the distance we suddenly see a man coming toward us while shining a flashlight. The place was dark. It was a rough concrete building, and it had a high fence at the entrance. You could see a corridor with the windows of offices and classrooms. All of the lights were turned off. It looked like an abandoned schoolhouse. In reality, it was a public boarding school for male students, which was closed for vacation. The man is coming toward us and, and he will shine his flashlight in my face. I could not see his face. The situation became uncomfortable for me. I became nervous. I did not know whether I should be there. When he arrived at the gate watching us, he made a comment with his warm and friendly voice: “We are so, because the cops are hidden (Chilean police) and are bothering us again.” Pamela was in shock! The police are still persecuting them? I could not contain the question. Frightened . . . we entered.</p>
<p>We walked down the dark hallway and the background was a half-open door that revealed a light inside. I walked in and I meet more than 20 people gathered together, sharing in their community . . .</p>
<p>When I first saw them, I noticed something in the expressions in their eyes. I saw a group of unknown people without being intrusive, but their eyes were a strange thing for me. This was not an uncomfortable situation. I watched them calmly and was friendly. However, they all had a certain look that was their common denominator. I thought it might be a byproduct of age. Most of them were elderly. Maybe it was due to the amount of time they had to spend travelling from their home cities, or fatigue, or cold . . . but it was something more I could not put my finger on at the time. The passage of time and reflection added to the impact of seeing those eyes. I think that almost six years after this experience, I was able to interpret that there are emotions and experiences that shape a person’s life and which are tattooed on their bodies and faces. Those tattoos spoke of sadness, resignation, complicity, companionship, and more . . . Pamela opens her eyes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077800412452853">
<title>Scene 4. The “Acid Test”/Trust</title>
<p>We are there, in a large and cold room, with a great deal of illumination, and there are many older couples. Their average age must be above 60 years. There is a lady and a man, and both are very warm with me. They are my hosts and are responsible for introducing me to his “comrades” who attended the meeting.</p>
<p>The Dinner . . .</p>
<p>I sit at a table for dinner. I am surrounded by six or seven people. On my left side is a man who avoids my gaze but observes my words and my body movements. On the other hand, one young woman was of about 40 years old. She looked quite different than the other people. She was tall and big, looked very neat, her hair was quite blond, which is atypical in Chile, and had large clear eyes that were framed in blue eye shadow with long lashes and mascara, which was demarcated. She wore several rings, pendants, and necklaces of gold fantasy.</p>
<p>I find myself there in the middle of a large group of people, all of whom are strangers . . . I’m scared because I heard that the police were “annoying,” not knowing where I would sleep that night because they said they had everything organized. As regards their concern with the national leadership, if they were excessively worried, I would not get the material I needed for my thesis. I must finish my thesis!</p>
<p>They served me a bowl of spaghetti with tomato sauce and ground beef. Dessert was melon or watermelon for everyone. I love watermelon. I love spaghetti with sauce, but I noticed that my stomach felt tight and I could not eat anything. A tense moment! Eating in front of a group of people you are observing and inspecting, and who have a distrustful but friendly attitude is quite difficult.</p>
<p>I remember that my stomach was literally “stuck.” It felt like a plastic bag that was close to empty. I could not swallow food. The blonde woman who was quite expressive asked me to talk about my project. Her speech denoted a lot of character while also exhibiting a collaborative attitude.</p>
<p>I told her about my research . . . if only I could do it . . . but after a few seconds of starting to talk about my project, she interrupts me and tells me with a demanding attitude, “eat food, do not forget that in Chile and around the world there are many people who do not have to eat at home and they die of hunger! . . .” I try to eat something, I really try, but find it difficult, all of them follow with their eyes focused on my plate and on me. It was more or less a bowl with about half a kilogram of spaghetti. I was unable to eat all of the food at once.</p>
<p>They never asked me whether I had a political affiliation. I think that I understood that my motives were more social than political. I tried to be a “comrade,” but they never invited me to join their groups and they never asked me to participate in political activities.</p>
<p>Afterward, the blond lady approaches me and asks to speak with me. She begins to talk. She was a victim of abuse and mistreatment by government officials on duty during the Pinochet era when she was underage. When I met her, she was engaged in testifying against one of her abusers.</p>
<p>She was the first person in the group to have been offered a chance to testify.</p>
<p>Pamela had passed the “Acid Test.” . . .</p>

<sec id="section5-1077800412452853">
<title>Scene 5. The Pamela . . . /The “I” Missing/Transformation. Small Loss</title>
<p>But who was I? What was I doing here with people I had never seen before in my life? What were my true motivations for entering a world in which I was “foreign” to the status of “victim”?</p>
<p>“I”</p>
<p>I was born in 1976 during the period of military dictatorship. My birthplace was the town in northern Chile known as Arica. I lived there most of my life. My father is aged 70, my mother is aged 60, my brother is aged 39, and I am aged 35. My father was a public employee who was 10 years older than my mother who was in charge of the housework and took care of her children. With the support of my father, she set up a clothing store for girls and boys. My mother remembers that when I was born, my father had been out of work for some time. He once worked as government accountant. We always lived in the same apartment located on a main avenue of the city, where we lived among middle-class working people and officials of the armed forces.</p>
<p>My family has been, and remains, a traditional Catholic family. My mother was born in southern Chile. Her grandparents emigrated from Palestine and arrived by boat at the city of Valdivia in 1890. They may have been fleeing World War I. Her mother died when she was barely two years old, and left my mother and her brothers under the care of their families. At 10 years of age, my mother learned about a Catholic religious community in her city, and she asked for the permission of her family to allow her to move to Santiago to live at a boarding school. There she studied in elementary school and high school before migrating north with one of her sisters, where she met my father. My father was the youngest of three brothers. He lived with his parents until he got married. His father was a well-known railroad public employee.</p>
<p>My parents have different political ideologies. Chile is not a good place to discuss politics. At home it was forbidden to discuss politics, but my mother always took care to tell my brother and me not to talk about politics for fear that bad things happen to us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my father listened in silence and may have been motivated by the fear that existed during the years of the dictatorship.</p>
<p>My mother told us that when she was pregnant with my brother in 1972 (before the coup d’etat) she spent long hours in line waiting to buy a pound of meat and some milk. She took turns with my father. She told us that when she was eight months pregnant she sat on a suburban bus in the city and saw a soldier, who seemed to be crazy, get on her bus and point his gun at people for no reason. She remembers a few seconds of being helplessly immobile. She suddenly turned, and sees that all of the bus passengers were gathered together at the bottom of the bus except for herself. She also told me that one day she was sitting on another local transport system. In Chile it is known as a “collective,” a type of public service large-car transportation that has a fixed route. Passengers can ride on any street on the route of the line. She told us that she was scared when she spoke with a woman whom she had known for many years. She asked my mother whether my father was a socialist. She recalls that the situation scared her and always thought that this lady might report my father—who is not a socialist—if she had wanted to do so.</p>
<p>I remember that one of my classmates had a military father he would see on the street during the day. Her father did not have to work. When I was growing up, I spoke with some people who speculated that this man belonged to the Pinochet government’s intelligence agency, which was in charge of collecting information about opponents of the regime. As I write this, there comes to mind memories of my neighbors who attended military events honoring the flag, which included firing shots into the air twice a day. I remember that all of my family members attempted to be at home during such occasions. We felt safe when we were at home. In writing this last memory, I stop and I realize that I was not so far from the facts as I had thought.</p>
<p>Sometimes my mother scolded my brother at a reunion party for young radicals. She asked and demanded that he not attend. My fears of censorship left me struck by the reality that was going on around us. I understand his alertness to this day whenever we meet on the street when a cop is present. I now understand why I was never “interested” in the subject of politics.</p>
<p>In a “world” where Pinochet was depicted as being a “good father” who took care of us and looked after our welfare, who were the bad guys?</p>
<p>For all of the above reasons, and I am sure for many other reasons, nothing in my background explains how I came to be investigating what I am now investigating, because this is not common in Chile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452853">Zapata, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Given all of this, I always remained asleep to this reality. Before my postdoctoral activities in the Center of Qualitative Inquiry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I had never realized the importance of situating myself in a biographical standpoint, as a process to include me in the research issues from inside an interpretive community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800412452853">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2011</xref>). But I never felt the freedom to do so, in a world dominated by the rigor of empirical evidence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800412452853">Zapata-Sepúlveda, López-Sánchez, &amp; Sánchez-Gómez, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>I can tell that my “disinterest” and “misinformation” are some of the different types of impact are byproducts of harsh experiences with state violence that occur in some societies.</p>
<p>People who commented on my research interests said,</p>
<list id="list1-1077800412452853" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>“That ugly topic you decided to work on.”</italic> said a friend of a lifetime.</p></list-item>

<p>Silence . . . more silence . . . I’ve met Chileans around the world in aircraft, universities, and other places where I have shared my thoughts with some of them . . .</p>

<title>Scene 6. Trauma</title>
<p>Valdivia, unknown location, afternoon, summer day</p>
<p>“Lady Death.” Have you seen death pass in front of you?</p>
<p>You can experience the death without having lived through the experience? Some people say yes, I say yes too. I had never seen death. But it was there, walking in front of my eyes . . .</p>
<p>I once interviewed a man in the city of Valdivia. He was working with one of his sons in the car-repair shop that was a part of his home. Upon reaching home he received me with a very kind attitude, but he appeared to be was somewhat nervous and restless possibly due to the situation.</p>
<p>After the man opened the door, he immediately invited me to come into his living room. He served me an apple. At the same time, he tells me that he is worried because he has a teenage son who is embroiled in legal troubles and “missteps.” During the interview I can sense see that the man deviates from the issues at hand with ease and often does not remember what he was talking about. Sometimes I felt that I was paying attention, and expressed my need to talk about the issues that have interested him. At one point, he begins to recount his experience in prison, something that was not investigated during the interview. But I listen carefully to what he says.</p>
<p>Sometimes I felt that he was not paying attention. He expressed a need to talk about the issues that have interested him. At one point, he begins to recount his experience in prison, something that was not investigated during the interview. Listen carefully to what he says.</p>
<p>He recounts in detail a situation in which he experienced a live mock execution in prison. “I was there, hooded, we were bound, my face was covered by a bandage, they were pushing us, hitting us and using the worst offensive words against us . . . I cannot see anything . . . . . . We are but a few. When we reached a place in the outer part of the prison, the voices that guided us up there told us that they were giving us a minute to think about our families because we would never see them again . . . I thought of my mom and I began to mourn in silence . . . I was scared . . . I feel the first shot . . . And a blow of the fall of one of my colleagues. Again . . . And again . . . I thought I was dead . . . suddenly I removed the hood, and they tell me that if I turned around to look at them, then they would kill me.</p>
<p>Worse than an animal . . . insults telling me to run fast to repent before they treated me badly. They shoot from behind . . . I do not know how I can run because I can’t feel my body! I only remember that I started to run and shook a lot. When I got home to see my mother, the home was a very humble home made of wood and had a low window. I open the window and fall inward like a sack of potatoes. When I realized that I was still alive, I feel that I had peed and had feces in my pants. I cry a lot.”</p>
<p>He is filled with sorrow, he looks at the ceiling and contains the tears. I find myself there, not knowing what to say. But, can I speak about anything . . .?</p>
<p>I have no words . . . I accompanied him with my expressive silence, and I could feel his suffering. This was a very difficult task for me.</p>
<p>As I listened I thought that this man could have been my father. I think of the sacrifices of a close relative or a loved one. I feel sad, his story is touching, intimate, sincere . . . I see death for the first time . . .</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>I want to express in these short stories the importance of respect for those who have suffered the long-term effects of imprisonment and torture. These stories also highlight the value of recognizing the background of new research. I do not believe that the omission of the “I” of the researcher is a good option, particularly for Chilean researchers. In fact, people who are interested in studying trauma and loss in victims of political violence and torture should use qualitative inquiry techniques. This should be integrated in order to analyze and understand the phenomenon in depth. “Officially” I have not been a victim. I do not belittle the experiences of the victims. I grew up in the Pinochet period, a matter that should be clarified and incorporated into research. The social impact of the human rights atrocities committed by the military in Chile between 1973 and 1990 is part of my life.</p>
<p>I want like to propose some considerations regarding the victims. I want to encourage new researchers to examine major details that are obvious but necessary.</p>
<p>The initial distrust exhibited by the victims was obvious. They did not know who was conducting the research, and they might have been risking further traumatization by being forced to remember. When I first encountered the trauma of the victims, they showed me what they kept behind their damaged sense of safety in the world, or basic trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412452853">Herman, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In the same sense, victims of political violence and torture may be in conflict between attempting to deny horrible events and wanting to proclaim them aloud, which is the central dialectic of psychological trauma. For this reason, extreme sensitivity to the experiences of the victims is essential. Trauma manifested and made evident in their eyes (e.g., Scenes 2 and 3).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800412452853">Lindersmith, Strauss, and Denzin (1999)</xref>, said that the pain is rooted in the body. People with different physical constitutions have different capacities to withstand pain and different thresholds for feeling pain. Their eyes reflect the pain of the repressive experiences that have occurred in their lives. These authors say that just as with other perceptions, pain has a private coloration but its meaning is deeply social in nature. Just as with other meanings, we act upon them. It is likely that during this first contact I connected with this social sphere of their pain behind their eyes.</p>
<p>The living body is the point of reference for the individual’s social and emotional experiences in the social world. It is also the symbolic and physical extension of the person in social situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800412452853">Lindersmith, Strauss, &amp; Denzin, 1999</xref>). The body is also a source of information about the individual (Stone, 1962, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800412452853">Lindersmith, Strauss, and Denzin, 1999</xref>). In this sense, I interpret their identities in terms of them being survivors and Chilean Political ex-prisoners. Their eyes reflect their life histories.</p>
<p>The woman in Scene 4, was in the middle of her complaint process. The perpetrator was attempting to escape being held accountable for his crimes. He attacked her credibility, attempted to get people to not listen to her arguments and tried to blame her for everything (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412452853">Herman, 1997</xref>). All of this made her initially distrust me, which was a result of the difficult times she had experienced after deciding to break her silence.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412452853">Levine (2008)</xref> said that the specific trauma for the victims involves many factors. These factors include genetic makeup, the individual’s history of trauma, family dynamics . . . Trauma concerns loss of connection—to themselves, to their bodies, to their families, to others, and to the world around them. Research on victims is necessary.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800412452853">Marcus (1998)</xref> wrote about beliefs, trauma, coping, individual and collective experiences, and ways of seeing the problem and much more that provokes and demands that understanding be based on multiple disciplines. We analyze the social and political context of the time and consider the context in which the research was developed. I do not recommend that victims recall traumatic experiences, because this can trigger unpleasant reactions. I recommend that researchers take extensive “field notes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800412452853">Richardson, 1998</xref>) on what victims say. Possibly the most important ethic code for working with the victims is to avoid causing provocative psychological or physical harm.</p>
<p>Ethics code are necessary as informed consent, no deception, privacy and confidentiality, and accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800412452853">Christians, 2011</xref>). Participants, not theoretical models, must establish the limits. Participants are free to talk about what interests them, regardless of what issues researchers want to address. Victims must be respected.</p>
<p>As in Scene 6, the research always concerns their memories of their captivity and where they are telling his history the fact is shared. At this moment, the act of remembering is a performance moment between the victim and the researcher. The topic is necessary about memory and researcher needs to understand torture from both personal and collective perspectives.</p>
<p>Victim recall of memories serves two functions: first, making sense of past experiences in terms of their present lives. This act of guilt is a form of reconciliation with the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800412452853">Ricoeur, 2006</xref>), and an act of redress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800412452853">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Freire states that remembering refers a process of bringing to mind a particular event, feeling, or action from one’s past experiences and the process of reassembling memories in the present. This process involves reflection, meaning thinking about memories of the past, and considering their meaning in the context of present circumstances. For the author, this is a transformative process (Freire, 1970, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800412452853">Denzin &amp; Giardina, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The researcher needs to know before starting any research what the participants want to forget. If they want to forget it, is better to not work with them. If they want to give testimony, you are allowed to continue. This is an additional ethical aspect you must consider in your research project.</p>
<p>Questions about the perceived impact on their children and family members can be refused by participants. Researchers can expect parents to find it difficult to perceive these effects. The inclusion of minor children in the research, or other relatives such as spouses or grown children must be authorized by the parents, and they must explain the contents to their children. Researchers must respect confidentiality. Each family is free to choose to accept or refuse to participate.</p>
<p>The confidentiality of data and the anonymity of participants should be guaranteed. The researcher should give written assurances before starting work. Students should use word files and transcribers when required. They should change the names of participants and prevent the data from being made public. They should assess the person who has spoken of his experiences. This mediates the collection of information and influences for the assessment of the case. It is important to assess whether or not the participants are ready, have the necessary psychological aptitude, and whether or not they have previous experience discussing their experiences in other projects.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412452853">Herman (1997)</xref> stated that the hold traumatic reality or the victims requires a social context that affirms and protects the victim and that joins victims and witness in a common alliance. This alliance can support their trauma, and their active participation in Human Rights groups are a criteria for contacting them.</p>
<p>My “I rescued” reflects upon how the impact of political repression in Chile affected my family and myself. My parents and myself experienced fear for years during my childhood. This is a “normal reaction” for any parent who is responsible for children. Being unable to buy food, facing job insecurity, living with deaths and disappearances affects the social way of seeing, interpreting, and relating to the world.</p>
<p>The linguistic acts WAS and ARE performative. They include words that concern pain for the suffering that they experienced (Butler, 1997, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412452853">Denzin, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>I think the nature of the research topic is so strong that the research act is itself a performance. Collins suggested that the meanings of lived experiences are inscribed and made visible in these performances (Collins, 1990, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412452853">Denzin 2001</xref>). Denzin said that “performance ethnography simultaneously creates and enacts moral texts, texts that move from the personal to the political, the local to the historical and the cultural” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412452853">Denzin, 2001</xref>, p. 14). Researchers should take special care with these works and create spaces for doing more than making torture into an object of voyeurism, or fetishism, custodialism, or paternalism. Nobody should think or say “Oh, those poor people!”</p>
<p>Qualitative inquiry projects involving victims must be also moral, allegorical, and therapeutic projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800412452853">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2011</xref>). Researchers must not forget this when creating and defining forms to approach.</p>
<p>Finally, the following quotation provides a moral stance for working with victims: “The social sciences . . . should be used to improve quality of life . . . for the oppressed, marginalized, stigmatized and ignored . . . and to bring about healing, reconciliation and restoration between the researcher and the researched.” (Stanfield, 2006, p. 725, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800412452853">Denzin &amp; Giardina, 2010</xref>)</p>
<p>This, above any other reason . . .</p>
