<title>EZ Read 400 Flexi</title>
<p>This new addition to the Biochrom EZ Read 400 microplate reader portfolio allows users to preselect the filters best suited for absorbance measurement needs. In addition to four standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) filters of 405, 450, 492, and 620 nm, EZ Read 400 Flexi model users can choose up to four additional filters within a wavelength range of 400 to 750 nm for preinstallation. ADAP 2.0 Basic software is supplied as standard for reader control for endpoint, kinetic, and multi-wavelength measurements, as well as easy export into Microsoft Excel. For more sophisticated applications, optional ADAP 2.0 Plus software allows users to design methods for instant data analysis using standard curves or cutoffs. Designed with ELISA applications in mind, the reader is remotely operated via the Windows 7–compatible ADAP 2.0 software.</p>

<title>Roboline</title>
<p>This small, quiet, and compact liquid handler offers open programmability and a fast drag-and-drop function to automate a single task or an entire application. Roboline can pipette combination of columns, rows, single wells, or entire plates, and the closed environment protects reagents and samples from contamination. The fully electronic air displacement pipetting operation produces error-free results and is capable of forward pipetting, reverse pipetting, multiple dispensing, and diluting volumes from 5 to 200 µL using liquid level sensing for error-free, small-volume pipetting.</p>
<p>In addition, the Roboline can reduce repetitive strain injuries and decreases exposure to harmful or toxic solutions.</p>

<title>Eon Microplate Spectrophotometer</title>
<p>This new microplate spectrophotometer is monochromator based, and like BioTek’s Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer, Eon’s monochromator-based optics allows flexible, filter-free 200- to 999-nm wavelength selection in 1-nm increments and spectral scanning for 6- to 384-well microplates. An optional cuvette port expands functionality to cuvette-based assays and also aids in assay miniaturization to microplates or the 2-µL volumes used with BioTek’s Take3 and new Take3 Trio Micro-Volume Plates. Other features include four-zone temperature control with incubation up to 65 °C and walk-away automation when paired with BioTek’s BioStack Microplate Stacker or third-party robotics. Linear, orbital, and double orbital shake modes are customizable for easy assay optimization in biofuel research, cell proliferation, cytotoxicity studies, and other applications. Eon is powered by the new Gen5 2.0 Data Analysis Software.</p>

<title>Typhoon FLA 9500 and Typhoon FLA 7000 IP Biomolecular Imaging Systems</title>
<p>According to GE, its new Typhoon FLA 9500 is designed for imaging of multifluorescent-, chemifluorescent-, radioisotope-labeled and colorimetric samples and the Typhoon FLA 7000 IP for the dedicated study of radioisotope labeled samples.</p>
<p>The Typhoon FLA 9500 is a versatile, high-throughput laser scanner considered ideal for a multiuser environment. With a pixel resolution of up to 10 µm and a linear signal response over five orders of magnitude, the system provides precise quantitation in gels, blots, tissue sections, and arrays. A scanning area of 40 × 46 cm enables simultaneous imaging of 20 samples, facilitating comparison of blots and reducing workload and waiting time. The FLA 9500 can concurrently image two two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) for differential expression studies and has optional near-infrared excitation for imaging IRDye and other infrared dyes.</p>
<p>The Typhoon FLA 7000 IP is an entry-level scanner that enables high-speed, sensitive detection and quantitation of radioisotope-labeled samples. The model can scan over 10 image plates in an hour, generating 16-bit images at up to 25-µm pixel resolution using storage phosphor screen technology. With identical function to the Typhoon FLA 7000, upgrade paths for fluorescent capabilities are available.</p>

<title>CheckExtractor</title>
<p>The automated CheckExtractor extracts DNA from sample material and is suitable for different types of sample vessels containing sensitive materials, such as swabs, blood, and urine. Up to 288 samples can be processed per day, and a touch-screen enables intuitive operation. The sample vessels and reagents are scanned automatically via barcodes, making it possible to closely observe the extraction status of all samples at any time. The individual steps in the analysis process are managed and partly controlled by the Laboratory Information and Management System (LIMS). The CheckExtractor also enables automated PCR setup and with the oCheck product line.</p>

<title>HP D300 Digital Dispenser</title>
<p>This standalone instrument uses HP Direct Digital Dispensing technology to rapidly deliver picoliter to microliter volumes of drug compounds. Available exclusively through Tecan, this device can cut titration times from hours or days to just minutes. Based on HP inkjet technology, the Digital Dispenser is the result of an agreement between Tecan and HP to commercialize this new technology for use in drug discovery research. According to Tecan, it provides fast and reliable performance across a large dynamic range, eliminating the need for serial dilutions. Using disposable dispense heads to help avoid the possibility of cross-contamination, the instrument offers noncontact digital dispensing from 13 pL to 5 µL, delivering any dose to any well and virtually eliminating waste of valuable compounds. It combines walk-up convenience, ready-to-run performance, and flexible, intuitive experiment design software.</p>

<title>CV2000 Automated Aliquoting Liquid Handler</title>
<p>This second-generation platform enhances laboratory efficiency through workflow automation. The CV2000 can accurately dispense liquid volumes from 100 to 875 µL and process up to 1000 samples per hour. With its robotic arm and rotary height sensors, it fits easily into automated workflows. The system is compatible with a wide variety of sample management software but can also be used as a standalone instrument. The system effectively manages samples to boost efficiency and productivity with zero cross-contamination.</p>
<p>Fully compatible with multiple rack formats, the CV2000 system allows users to change the loading and dispensing routine to suit specific needs. A unique tip preservation system allows the instrument to only discharge used tips, reducing waste while eliminating contamination. Capable of holding up to 300 samples and accommodating both 45- and 90-mL urine containers, the system can automate the process of aliquoting urine from primary samples to analyzer racks. Furthermore, the CV2000 system creates a batch report that is compatible with downstream analysis instrumentation, which is used to process the urine samples.</p>
