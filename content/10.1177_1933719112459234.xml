We also evaluated whether the severity of endometriosis can influence serum and/or FF concentration of these metalloproteinases. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 30 patients: stage I/II endometriosis (n = 10), stage III/IV endometriosis (n = 10), and control (infertility due to tubal and/or male factor; n = 10). Blood samples for the analysis of MMP-2 levels were obtained during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The FF samples for the analysis of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were obtained on the day of oocyte retrieval. The concentrations of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were determined by zymography. No intragroup or intergroup difference was observed in MMP-2 or MMP-9 levels in FF. Significantly higher MMP-2 levels were detected in the serum of infertile women with stage III/IV endometriosis compared to women with stage I/II endometriosis. In conclusion, no differences were observed in the follicular levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 between infertile patients with and without endometriosis. However, the levels of MMP-2 were significantly higher in the serum of infertile women with advanced stages of endometriosis. Taken together, the present results demonstrate that advanced pelvic endometriosis severity is related to higher serum MMP-2 levels but does not influence follicular MMP-2 or MMP-9 levels in periovulatory follicles obtained from stimulated cycles.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>endometriosis</kwd><kwd>MMP-2</kwd><kwd>MMP-9</kwd><kwd>female infertility</kwd><kwd>follicular fluid</kwd><kwd>serum</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1933719112459234"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endometriosis is an inflammatory disease mediated by estrogen, which affects about 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age.

All patients evaluated in the study were submitted to the same COS protocol.</p><p>Each patient received a daily subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mg leuprolide acetate (Lupron), starting 10 days prior to the initial ultrasound examination before ovarian stimulation. Two hundred to 300 units of recombinant FSH were administered daily (Gonal-F; Puregon) during the first 6 days of ovarian stimulation. Ultrasonographic monitoring of the cycle was started on the seventh day of stimulation and performed daily or every other day. The gonadotropin dose was adjusted according to the observed follicular growth. Administration of gonadotropins and GnRH agonist was discontinued when at least 2 follicles exhibited a mean diameter of 18 mm, at which time 250 µg of recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was administered (Ovidrel) at 22:00 hours. About 34 to 36 hours after hCG administration, each patient underwent oocyte retrieval under intravenous sedation with propofol (Diprivan, Astra-Zeneca, Cotia, Brazil) and fentanyl citrate (Fentanyl, Janssen-Cilag, São Paulo, Brazil).</p></sec><sec id="section4-1933719112459234"><title>Collection and Processing of FF and Blood Samples</title><p>The entire content of the first follicle with a mean diameter ≥15 mm from the first punctured ovary was aspirated individually.

At the end of the run, the gel was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in a 2% solution of Triton X-100 and then incubated at 37°C for 16 hours in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mmol/L CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The gels were stained with 0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and then destained with 30% methanol in 10% acetic acid. The gelatinolytic activities were detected as unstained bands and observed by contrast with Comassie Brilliant Blue. The concentration of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was determined by densitometry using the ImageJ software version 1.42q (Wayne Rasband National Institutes of Health, Washington, DC). The MMP-2 was identified as the 72 kDa band and MMP-9 as the 92 kDa band.</p><p>To start our study we performed zymography in order to determine whether MMP-2 and MMP-9 would be identifiable in FF. Since the methodology for the evaluation of these enzymes in FF is still recent and its standardization has not been fully established, we first determined whether phenanthroline, a gelatinase inhibitor, was able to prevent degradation of the gel by the enzymes. The gel was divided into A and B portions, with phenanthroline being placed in gel A but not in gel B. Phenanthroline was mixed with a 2% solution of Triton X-100 and gels A and B were incubated for 16 hours. After the gels were stained and destained, the appearance of bands degraded by the enzymes MMP-2 and MMP-9 was observed in the gel that did not contain phenanthroline, indicating activity of the metalloproteinases. No degraded area was observed in the gel to which phenanthroline was applied, indicating the absence of activity of the metalloproteinases.</p></sec><sec id="section6-1933719112459234"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>The statistical analyses were performed using the GENMOD procedure of the SAS 2003 software (2002/2003, SAS-Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).

With the patient series analyzed, the test power of the results reached 75%. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing evidence for an increase in circulating MMP-2 levels in relation to the severity of endometriosis.</p><p>Matrix metalloproteinase 2 may play a very important role in the formation of endometriosis, because MMP-2 is able to degrade collagens (types 4, 5, and 10), which are the main components of the extracellular matrix and basement membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112459234">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112459234">17</xref></sup>This MMP has also been implicated in tumor cell invasion and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112459234">16</xref></sup> and in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112459234">18</xref></sup> It has been shown that uterine endometrium from women with endometriosis expressed a higher level of MMP-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112459234">18</xref></sup> In a previous study, Huang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112459234">17</xref></sup> showed that women with infertility related to endometriosis had higher MMP-2 levels in their sera and peritoneal fluids than patients without this disease, in agreement with our results. However, in contrast to the present study, in the study of Huang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112459234">17</xref></sup> the severity of endometriosis was not evaluated. These authors also demonstrated a correlation between MMP-2 concentrations and steroid hormones in sera and peritoneal fluids of the patients with endometriosis-associated infertility, suggesting that estradiol might upregulate MMP-2, resulting in the formation of endometriosis. Thus, we propose 2 possible explanations for the finding of increased circulating MMP-2 levels in infertile patients with moderate and severe pelvic endometriosis observed in the present study (1) greater tissue remodeling may occur with disease progression, with a consequent higher local and systemically identifiable MMP-2 activity; (2) the higher aromatase activity in ectopic tissue may increase the production of MMP-2 which, in turn, may facilitate invasion and progression of the disease, being positively correlated with the advanced severity of endometriosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112459234">19</xref></sup></p><p>The present data differed from those reported by Salata et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112459234">9</xref></sup> who did not observe a difference in serum MMP-2 or MMP-9 levels between infertile women with minimal endometriosis (stage I, n = 15 patients) and infertile women with severe endometriosis (stage IV, n = 22 patients). In the cited study, the authors evaluated the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the serum of these 2 groups of women with endometriosis using the same methodology as employed in the present study. However, in a study of MMP levels in serum and plasma collected into tubes containing citrate, heparin, and EDTA, Gerlach et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112459234">14</xref></sup> demonstrated that the sample containing EDTA and serum showed artificially increased pro-MMP-9 and MMP-9 activity compared to the other collection methods, so that a real estimate of this MPP could not be obtained. Our group carried out tests of MMP-9 activity according to the above procedure in the serum of the women included in the study, which confirmed that the methodology used is not appropriate for this evaluation in serum. For this reason, data regarding MMP-9 quantitation were not presented in the current study. In summary, our findings demonstrate that a systemically identifiable increase in MMP-2 levels occurs with advancing stage of pelvic endometriosis, possibly reflecting the local increase in the activity of this enzyme.</p><p>In the present study, we evaluated for the first time the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the FF of infertile patients with pelvic endometriosis submitted to ovarian stimulation for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

We detected higher MMP-2 levels in the serum of infertile women with pelvic endometriosis III/IV compared to women with endometriosis I/II, a fact that suggests a positive correlation between advanced stage of the disease and systemic levels of this metalloproteinase. Taken together, the present findings demonstrate that the advancement of severity of the disease is related to higher serum MMP-2 levels but does not influence the follicular levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in periovulatory follicles obtained from cycles stimulated with gonadotropins.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank the staff of the Laboratory of
