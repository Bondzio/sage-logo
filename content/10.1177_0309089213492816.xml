      <abstract>
        <p>Deborah, a respected leader, judge, and prophet who gives orders to Barak, a military
          commander, is similar in many ways to Moses—indeed, far more similar than either
          traditional or modern commentators acknowledge. Moreover, the story of the battle at Mount
          Tabor has remarkable parallels with the crossing of the Sea of Reeds. Nonetheless, Deborah
          is typically linked with Miriam and her story regarded as at best an aberration in the
          predominantly patriarchal world of ancient Israel. A full examination of the parallels,
          however, yields a reading that significantly raises the status of Deborah and sees her as
          an avatar of Moses himself.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The story of Deborah tells of a single battle between the forces of Israel and the
        Canaanites at Mount Tabor in the period of the Judges, around the eleventh century
          <sc>bce</sc>. Deborah and Barak lead the Israelite troops against the Canaanite forces
        under Sisera and defeat them, while the Kenite woman Yael assassinates the fleeing Sisera.
        The story is told in prose form in Judges 4; Judges 5 is a victory song that extols Deborah,
        Barak, and Yael and includes some details not present in the prose version of the story.</p>
      <p>The story of Deborah has much in common with the story of the Israelites crossing the Reed
        Sea in Exodus 14–15. In both stories, the Israelites defeat a better-armed force equipped
        with chariots, in both the Israelites are led by a prophet, and both are followed by a
        victory song. The similarities were noted by the rabbis of the Middle Ages who paired the
        weekly Torah reading that contains Exodus 14 and 15 (‭חלשב‬) with the story of Deborah as
        the prophetic reading. Notably, the two songs are among the oldest preserved texts in the
        Bible. Moreover, these are the only biblical pairings of a narrative poem with a prose
        narrative of the same incident. Deborah and Moses are also connected through the Kenites,
        descendants of Moses' father-in-law. But the most important connections may be between
        Deborah and Moses as prophets and leaders:</p>
      <list id="list1-0309089213492816" list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>Deborah, like Moses—but unlike the other ‘judges’ in the book of that name—actually
            works as a judge, offering decisions for those who come to her.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Deborah, like Moses, is a prophet who channels the word of God.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Like Moses in his tent, Deborah has her own regular location for rendering
            judgments—the tree of Deborah.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Like Moses, Deborah orders a military leader into action, presenting herself as the
            voice of God, but stays behind the troops at the top of a hill to inspire rather than
            fight.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>In the paired battles—at the Reed Sea and at Mount Tabor—the opponents drive chariots
            that are disabled by a sudden rush of water.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Both Moses and Deborah sing victory songs.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>While there are other judges and prophets and military leaders who might be compared with
        Moses in various ways (Samuel, for instance), there are no other matchups as extensive as
        this one between Deborah and Moses.</p>
      <p>In substance and tone, the story presents Deborah as a respected leader. In an unambiguous
        demonstration of trust, a military leader and his army regard Deborah as the voice of God.
        They accept her orders in battle and a victory song extols her leadership. Deborah's
        superiority is reinforced by the final verses of the victory song, a bitter rebuke of the
        vanity and weakness of Canaanite women compared to Israelite warrior women.</p>
      <p>While all of the separate points of comparison I have listed have been noticed in the very
        large body of Deborah commentary, the connections between Deborah and Moses have rarely been
        mentioned, let alone developed. In fact, these connections often seem to be dismissed or
        deflected. For example, Deborah always numbers among the women prophets in the Bible and is
        regularly paired with Miriam, rather than with Moses, as singers of victory songs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089213492816">1</xref></sup> A tendency to limit or
        de-emphasize Deborah's significance characterizes a very large part of the critical
        literature, both ancient and modern. I think, though, that Deborah should be compared with
        Moses, not Miriam, as a representative of God, as a symbolic rallying point for Israelite
        forces and as a military leader, a reading supported by the many parallels between Deborah
        and Moses, by the rhetorical force of the narrative in ch. 4 and by important elements of
        the victory songs, Judges 5 and Exodus 15. I find no reason to think that the authors of
        either the poem or prose account wished to present Deborah in any other light than as the
        avatar of Moses in her time.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2-0309089213492816">
      <title>2. Deborah and Moses as Judges</title>
      <p>Moses’ role as a judge is first hinted at in Exod. 2.14, where the squabbling Hebrews ask,
        ‘Who made you a prince or judge (‭טפש‬) over us?’ The answer comes later, in Exod. 18.13:
        ‘Moses sat as magistrate (‭טפשל‬) among the people’ (<sc>jps</sc> translation). In answer to
        his father-in-law's question about why Moses is taking up all his time at this task, Moses
        replies, ‘It is because the people come to me to inquire of God. When they have a dispute,
        it comes before me, and I decide (‭יתטפש‬) between one person and another, and I make known
        the laws and teachings of God’ (18.15–16). His father-in-law advises Moses to set forth the
        laws, assign others to judge the minor disputes, and take upon himself only those they
        cannot resolve. Moses apparently takes this advice, for he is not depicted in a judging role
        after this point.</p>
      <p>Deborah is introduced in Judges 4.4–5 in this way:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>Deborah, wife of Lappidoth, was a prophetess; she judged (‭הטפש‬) Israel at that time.
          She used to sit under the Palm of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of
          Ephraim, and the Israelites would come to her for judgment (‭טפשמל‬). [I have used my own
          translation here, for, as we shall see, there is some dispute about the meaning of ‭הטפש‬
          and ‭טפשמל‬]</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Though nothing further is said about Deborah's role as a judge, even this short description
        is notable, for Deborah appears to be the only actual judge in the book of Judges. This
        oddity has suggested to some that the term ‘judge’ should be understood throughout the book
        of Judges as ‘chief’ or ‘leader’, and that indeed is how some versions translate
            ‭טפש‬.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089213492816">2</xref></sup> The
          <sc>jps</sc> translation, for example, says that Deborah ‘led Israel at that time’ (rather
        than ‘judged Israel at that time’) and that the Israelites would come to her ‘for decisions’
        (rather than ‘for judgment’). Perhaps the <sc>jps</sc> translation is intended to suggest
        that she was making decisions about political matters. It may be, though, that this
        translation is splitting hairs: leaders, no matter how little suited they may be to serve as
        judges of legal matters (think of Samson, for instance), were the ultimate arbiters of
        disputes by virtue of their status as chief. In this sense, all of the judges in the book of
        Judges took the role that Moses’ father-in-law had recommended, at least in a technical
        sense. But finally, only Deborah is depicted as acting in that role, so only Deborah truly
        follows Moses in the role of judge.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3-0309089213492816">
      <title>3. Deborah and Moses as Prophets</title>
      <p>We have also seen that Deborah is identified as a prophetess. In this, too, Deborah is
        unique among the judges. Other women are called prophetess, including Miriam, Moses’ sister.
        But it appears that Miriam, who does not perform any prophet-like actions, is given the
        title as a matter of respect. Deborah, on the other hand, speaks for God, as does Moses.</p>
      <p>In Judg. 4.6–7, Deborah summons Barak—a power she may have as judge or chief or prophetess,
        however any of those titles might be defined—and speaks to him this way:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>The L<sc>ord</sc>, the God of Israel, has commanded: ‘Go, march up to Mount Tabor, and
          take with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun. And I will draw Sisera, Jabin's
          army commander, with his chariots and his troops, toward you up to the Wadi Kishon; and I
          will deliver him into your hands.’ (<sc>jps</sc> translation)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>The beginning of this passage, translated here as ‘The L<sc>ord</sc>, the God of Israel,
        has commanded', is actually a Hebrew idiom in the form of a rhetorical question: ‘Has not
        the L<sc>ord</sc> commanded …?’ (‭הוהי הוצאלה‬). This phrasing suggested to the medieval
        commentator Rashi that the command Deborah refers to had already been issued by Moses, back
        in Deut. 7.1–2:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>When the L<sc>ord</sc> your God brings you to the land that you are about to enter and
          possess, and He dislodges many nations before you—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites,
          Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, seven nations much larger than you—and the
            L<sc>ord</sc> your God delivers them to you and you defeat them, you must doom them to
          destruction. (<sc>jps</sc> translation)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Moses, then, has already issued the command to defeat the Canaanites. This, for Rashi, is
        what Deborah is implying: Deborah is not merely quoting Moses here—she is, after all, giving
        a very situation-specific set of instructions about Mount Tabor, Sisera, and the Wadi
        Kishon, and in doing so, she is continuing what Moses started, taking up his mantle as judge
        and prophet. Finally, Deborah uses the language of all the prophets, including Moses, when
        she employs the first person to relay God's commands to the people: ‘I [the L<sc>ord</sc>]
        will draw Sisera toward you'. Rashi appears to be trying to downplay Deborah's prophetic
        abilities by suggesting that the true prophecy was already given to Moses. But it seems just
        as logical to see the connection as a demonstration that Deborah is Moses’ successor.</p>
      <p>When Deborah relays God's marching orders to Barak, he resists: ‘If you go with me, I will
        go; if not, I will not go’ (Judg. 4.8). Is Barak challenging Deborah's power here? It may
        seem so, simply because he does not immediately accept her command. His resistance might be
        sexist, an unwillingness to take orders from a woman. As we will see, this view has been put
        forward as evidence that Deborah is an aberration, only reluctantly accepted in a sexist
        society. But this view is hard to maintain, given that Barak has instantly responded to
        Deborah's command to appear before her. It is also hard to maintain given the substance of
        the exchange. Barak may seem to take a blustering tone, but what he appears to be saying is
        that he is afraid to go alone or that Deborah, a recognized prophet, is needed to inspire
        the troops. Think of the many things he could have said had he wished to indicate that he
        did not accept her authority.</p>
      <p>We have been comparing Deborah to Moses, but here it is Barak who resembles Moses when God
        commands him to go to Pharaoh and Moses replies, ‘Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh?’
        Occasionally, when God calls a prophet, the prophet-to-be initially resists the
            call.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089213492816">3</xref></sup> Moses is an
        extreme case of resistance, turning God down repeatedly through two chapters of Exodus (3
        and 4). In the story of Deborah and Barak, the resistance is brief—but still, if it is Barak
        who takes the part of Moses here, then it is Deborah who takes the role of God! Even in this
        instance, there is an interesting parallel between Deborah and Moses: when Moses asks God
        for help speaking to Pharaoh, God says, ‘See, I place you in the role of God to Pharaoh,
        with your brother Aaron as your prophet’ (Exod. 7.1). The details are suggestive rather than
        precise: it is the echo of yet another event in the life of Moses that makes it relevant to
        our estimate of Deborah's stature.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec4-0309089213492816">
      <title>4. Moses and Deborah as Military Leaders</title>
      <p>Deborah's response to Barak's resistance is to agree to go with him: ‘“Very well, I will go
        with you”, she answered’ (Judg. 4.9). In Exodus, when Moses resists God's call, God's
        response is like Deborah's: ‘I will be with you: that shall be your sign that it was I who
        sent you’ (Exod. 3.12). Moses, not comforted by God's rather cryptic reassurance, continues
        to resist the call. Moses may still hope to get out of the job of confronting Pharaoh as God
        wishes, but for Deborah and Barak, the moment of confrontation is imminent—there is no time
        for any more dithering. Deborah continues her reply to Barak by saying, ‘“However, there
        will be no glory for you in the course you are taking, for then the L<sc>ord</sc> will
        deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman”. So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh’ (Judg.
        4.9). Deborah's criticism is a stinging rebuke, particularly if Barak had sexist motives for
        his initial resistance. Indeed, her reply is a confirmation that sexism is an issue that
        this story is meant to address explicitly.</p>
      <p>Let us return to the ‘resistance’ exchange, keeping in mind the notion that the story
        evidently wants to put issues of sexism on the table. It now seems credible to argue that
        Barak <italic>does</italic> mean to say that he is reluctant to accept the military
        instructions of a woman—or at least that Deborah hears it that way and looks for an
        opportunity to strike back. Barak is clearly saying, in any case, that he will accept the
        command if Deborah goes along. This could mean that Barak wants to see how confident Deborah
        is in her own pronouncements: will she put herself in harm's way? Deborah's response—'there
        will be no glory for you'—accepts the challenge and creates a dilemma for Barak: will he
        take her along and forgo the glory? Barak could be saying, on the other hand, that Deborah
        is an inspiration to the troops and needs to be there to help them face the challenge of the
        Canaanite chariots, the WMDs of their time. If that is his meaning, then the troops must
        already be aware of Deborah's prophetic powers. In this reading, Deborah's reply of ‘no
        glory for you’ is either a misplaced rebuke—she thinks he is sexist but he is not—or a
        straightforward prophecy. Deborah's role in the battle in any case is to inspire, not to
        fight, and as we shall see, that is a Mosaic connection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089213492816">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>I rather like the idea that Barak is calling on Deborah to play Moses, but that Deborah
        takes umbrage at the way he says it. The ambiguity here seems almost designed to provoke
        discussion about gender perceptions in society, and that, too, is very appealing. In any
        case, despite the rebuke and the ‘no glory’ prediction, Barak accepts Deborah's answer and
        off they go. Does this development help us understand Barak's resistance? She has seemingly
        offered him a choice: if he goes alone, he gets the glory, but if she goes, he does not.
        Barak is evidently willing to forgo the personal glory so much sought after by military
        leaders if only he can have her along. I think that this sways the interpretation of the
        earlier exchange toward the view that Barak readily accepts her prophetic authority and has
        simply expressed himself brusquely or defensively or even carelessly when he challenges her
        to come with him. In all, this is a clever bit of narrative, repaying slow reading and
        careful reconsideration of how each nuance inflects a reader's interpretation.</p>
      <p>What is Deborah's role in the battle? She goes with Barak to his home, Kedesh, where he
        musters his troops and then marches them up to Mount Tabor—'and Deborah also went up with
        him’ (Judg. 4.10). Sisera learns that Barak is there, and sure enough, he brings his
        chariots and troops to the Wadi Kishon. Deborah gives the command to join battle: ‘Then
        Deborah said to Barak, “Up! This is the day on which the L<sc>ord</sc> will deliver Sisera
        into your hands: the L<sc>ord</sc> is marching before you”’ (Judg. 4.14). Deborah does not
        appear again until the next chapter, the Song of Deborah. Her role in the battle may thus
        have concluded when she gave the order to fight: it is enough, presumably, that she came
        along to represent God's presence, confirmed her prophecy, and sent the seemingly reluctant
        Barak off to do his duty. Unlike the other judges, she does not engage in single combat. She
        might indeed have done so, but it is Yael who dispatches Sisera and fulfills the prophecy
        that the Lord would deliver him to the hands of a woman.</p>
      <p>Other judges call troops to battle, as Deborah does. Ehud, in the story that precedes
        Deborah's, sounds the call to battle and shouts, ‘Follow me, for the L<sc>ord</sc> has
        delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hands’ (Judg. 3.28). The story does not
        indicate that God spoke to Ehud about this matter. Rather, Ehud has just come from killing
        Eglon, the king of Moab, and calls upon the Israelites to attack while the Moabites are
        leaderless. Ehud seizes the role of leader, and like a good leader ascribes their good
        fortune to the Lord. The situation is a bit different with Gideon, in the story that follows
        Deborah's, for the Lord sends a message directly to Gideon about the battle he is to lead.
        Still, Gideon is not identified as a prophet. A prophet, explicitly so designated, sets up
        the story (Judg. 6.8). An angel appears to Gideon (6.11–12) to say that the Lord is with him
        and that he is a valiant warrior. This angel is then identified as the Lord (6.14) who tells
        Gideon that he will defeat the Midianites. Later, Gideon calls the troops to action: ‘Come
        on! The L<sc>ord</sc> has delivered the Midianite camp into your hands’ (7.15). Both Ehud
        and Gideon, unlike Deborah (and Moses), take part in the fighting.</p>
      <p>Moses is involved in a number of battles, as well as one instance of hand-to-hand combat
        when he kills the Egyptian overseer (Exod. 2.12). In the wars and battles, though, he
        remains in the rear. In Exod. 17.8–9, ‘Amalek came and fought with Israel'. Moses directs
        Joshua to choose men and fight, while Moses, holding the rod of God in his hand, stands at
        the top of a hill—like Deborah at the top of Mount Tabor. In more than one of the battles
        during the exodus, Moses is not mentioned at all. Several scuffles are collected in Numbers
        21: with the Canaanite king of Arad, with Sihon and the Amorites, and with Og, king of
        Bashan. God does address Moses in the last of these, assuring Moses of Og's defeat—but no
        details are provided. A protracted battle occurs in Numbers 31 when God tells Moses to take
        vengeance on the Midianites. Moses sends the troops out and assigns Phinehas to go with them
        as the religious leader (Num. 31.6), but Moses himself stays behind ‘at the camp in the
        steppes of Moab, at the Jordan near Jericho’ (Num. 31.12).</p>
      <p>The battle that most connects Moses with Deborah, though, might not be considered a battle
        at all: the parting of the Reed Sea.</p>

      <title>5. The Reed Sea and Mount Tabor</title>
      <p>'Now the Israelites went up armed out of the land of Egypt’ (Exod. 13.18). They will not
        use these arms in their first engagement, though. When Pharaoh suspects that the Israelites
        are not returning to Egypt, ‘He ordered his chariot and took his men with him; he took 600
        of his picked chariots and the rest of the chariots of Egypt, with officers in all of them’
        (Exod. 14.6–7). How many chariots all together? Deborah and Barak face 900, as we shall see.
        In both battles, the chariots are rendered useless in any case.</p>
      <p>At the Reed Sea, ‘Moses held out his arm over the sea and the L<sc>ord</sc> drove back the
        sea with a strong east wind all night, and turned the sea into dry ground’ (Exod. 14.21).
        The Israelites pass through and the chariots follow. ‘At the morning watch, the
          L<sc>ord</sc> looked down upon the Egyptian army from a pillar of fire and cloud and threw
        the Egyptian army into panic (‭םירצמהנחמתאםהין‬). He locked the wheels of their chariots so
        that they moved forward with difficulty’ (14.24–25). Now God tells Moses to raise his arm
        once again: the waters flow back and drown the Egyptians, and ‘not one of them remained’
        (‭רחא ךעםהב ךאשנ אל‬) (14.28).</p>
      <p>At Mount Tabor, Sisera brings 900 iron chariots to the nearby Wadi Kishon. Barak charges
        down the mountain with his men, but it is the Lord who wins the battle: ‘The L<sc>ord</sc>
        threw Sisera and all his chariots and army into a panic (‭הנחמח לכ תא…םהיו‬)’ (Judg. 4.15).
        Barak's army pursues them, and of course, ‘not one of them remained (‭ךחא ךע ךאשנ אל‬)’
            (4.16).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089213492816">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>At the Reed Sea, the cause of the panic appears to be that the chariot wheels lock,
        rendering them useless. What causes the panic at the Wadi Kishon? Chariots could be fearsome
        weapons. At the start of the Iron Age, around 1200 <sc>bce</sc>, advanced cultures that
        could produce iron had a huge advantage over those with only bronze or softer metals. An
        iron chariot would repel bronze weapons, making it a veritable Sherman Tank in those days.
        But because of their rigid axles, chariots were also limited to fairly flat ground: a
        riverbed, a wadi, during the long dry season, for example. At the Reed Sea, we may imagine
        that the wheels bog down in a spot that is not completely dry, a mere hint of the ensuing
        flood as the sea closes. Does something similar happen at the Wadi Kishon? If we look at
        Judges 5, the Song of Deborah, that is clearly the case:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>O LORD, when you came forth from Seir,</p>
        <p>Advanced from the country of Edom,</p>
        <p>The earth trembled,</p>
        <p>The heavens dripped,</p>
        <p>Yea, the clouds dripped water. (Judg. 5.4)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>God comes up from his home area in Seir/Edom to the south, bringing an out-of-season
        rainstorm, the effects of which are described a few verses further on:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>The stars fought from heaven,</p>
        <p>From their courses they fought against Sisera.</p>
        <p>The torrent Kishon swept them away,</p>
        <p>The raging torrent, the torrent Kishon. (Judg. 5.20–21)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Just as the Lord controls the sea at the start of the exodus, so the Lord controls the
        water here, bringing a rainstorm that renders Sisera's chariots useless when the dry bed of
        the Wadi Kishon is suddenly transformed into the ‘torrent Kishon'. Psalm 77 depicts a great
        rainstorm at the Reed Sea as well:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>The waters saw you, O God,</p>
        <p>The waters saw you and were convulsed;</p>
        <p>The very deep quaked as well.</p>
        <p>Clouds streamed water;</p>
        <p>The heavens rumbled;</p>
        <p>Your arrows flew about;</p>
        <p>Your thunder rumbled like wheels;</p>
        <p>Lightning lit up the world;</p>
        <p>The earth quaked and trembled. (Ps. 77.17–18)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>While there is no explicit connection in this psalm between the storm in Judges 5 and rain
        at the Reed Sea, we do find here another example of the way that the two events were linked
        to miraculous (or at least unexpected) rain. Ginzberg points out in <italic>Legends of the
          Jews</italic> that the rainstorm of Judges 5 was a traditional way of explaining the
        ‘panic’ of Judges 4 and thus Sisera's defeat at Kishon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089213492816">6</xref></sup> Modern critics, however, point out the
        peculiarity that ch. 4 does not mention the rainstorm and even says that Barak pursued the
        chariots away from the Kishon (4.16), though how foot soldiers pursue chariots is difficult
        to imagine. It seems clear to most commentators that ch. 5 is earlier than ch. 4, but it
        does not necessarily follow that the writers of ch. 4 had ch. 5 at hand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089213492816">7</xref></sup> Though we cannot say whether ch.
        4 assumes that the reader has knowledge of the details in ch. 5, the absence of a rainstorm
        in ch. 4 and the oddity of the pursuit of the chariots suggests not. This mystery is not our
        present concern (nor is the interesting question of how the victory songs, Judg. 5 and Exod.
        15, were connected to their corresponding prose narratives).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089213492816">8</xref></sup> The final forms of the two stories, however
        they may have been formed, reveal astonishing parallels in the ways that the Israelites
        defeat their enemies and in the roles taken by their prophetic leaders, Moses and
        Deborah.</p>
      <p>To review the parallels that we have noted: first, the Israelites, lacking advanced
        weapons, are threatened by chariots in both stories—more than 600 Egyptian and 900 Canaanite
        chariots. In both stories, the same idiom is used to describe the defeat of the chariots:
        God throws them into a panic. God wins victory by controlling water—drying up the Reed Sea
        and then letting the waters back to drown the Egyptians in the first case and bringing a
        rainstorm to fill up a dry riverbed in the second. There is a similarity, though not a
        well-developed parallel, in the detail of God looking down on the Egyptians from the pillar
        of fire and cloud in Exodus, while in Judges, the stars fight against Sisera.</p>
      <p>The conclusion of the battle in Judges 4 appears to have no parallel in the ‘battle’ at the
        Reed Sea: the Canaanite general, Sisera, trusts Yael to hide him (revealing, perhaps, an
        attitude toward women learned from his mother, whom we shall soon meet), but she
        assassinates him while he sleeps. There is, nonetheless, another sort of connection between
        the two stories: Yael herself. Yael is the wife of Heber the Kenite. The Kenites are
        identified as the family of Moses’ father-in-law (Judg. 1.16), who tagged along on the
        exodus (Num. 10.32). If Deborah represents Moses, then perhaps Yael represents
            Jethro.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089213492816">9</xref></sup>

      <title>6. The Songs of Moses and Deborah</title>
      <p>The songs of Moses and Deborah appear to be among the oldest compositions in the Bible and
        a considerable body of fascinating scholarship has mined the songs for historical
        information from the premonarchic period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089213492816">10</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Both songs are generally held to be older than the prose narratives that precede them and
        in both, the songs differ in significant ways from the prose versions. These are also the
        only instances of paired prose and poetic renderings of the same incident in the Bible. We
        have already noted that both poems commemorate a victory and depict God as a warrior who
        fights for his people by controlling water. Finally, it is Moses who sings the song at the
        sea: ‘Then Moses and Israel sang this song’ (Exod. 15.1). Miriam shows up in 15.20 and sings
        the first lines—though this is likely an indication that she sang along with the others, in
        some way leading the women, or that she and the women repeated the song after the initial
        rendition. In Judg. 5.1, ‘Deborah and Barak sang'. It simply does not make sense to link
        Deborah with Miriam, as so many commentators do.</p>
      <p>The differences between poem and prose versions are greater in the Deborah story. In ch. 4,
        the enemies are King Jabin and his general Sisera. In ch. 5, the initial problem is the
        interruption of caravan traffic (an uncertain but tantalizing historical reference). But
        Sisera appears at the end of the poem without any explanation of who he is or why he arrives
        at Yael's tent, so perhaps this is not a significant difference and the Canaanites are
        understood to be the enemies from the start. Another difference is the location of the
        action: in ch. 4 it is Mount Tabor, while in ch. 5, ‘Taanach, by Megiddo's waters’ (5.19).
        The Wadi Kishon is a common element. Megiddo is a few kilometers south of the Kishon River
        and Taanach is a few kilometers south of Megiddo. Mount Tabor is some 15 kilometers
        northeast of the Kishon River. We might speculate about whether other riverbeds might have
        been called Kishon in biblical times, but it is more likely that the poem and story are
        simply not very particular about the locations—surely the ancient tellers and writers knew
        their own geography.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089213492816">11</xref></sup>
        There are also differences in the identification of the participating tribes. In ch. 4,
        Deborah is located in the area of Ephraim, Barak is from Naphtali, and Zebulun joins their
        force. In ch. 5, Ephraim, Benjamin, Zebulun, Issachar, and presumably Naphtali are the
        combatants, while Reuben, Gilead (probably Gad), Asher, and Dan are criticized for staying
        aloof. These differences suggest that the story traveled independently of the written poem
        and changed, as oral tales do, to suggest the alliances of the moment. Given these
        differences, are we justified in assuming that the storm in ch. 5 is the cause of the panic
        in ch. 4? Here again, the story and the poem seem to have had separate lives. The tellers of
        the story that became ch. 4 may have forgotten the cause but remembered the panic. Without
        the poem to help us out, we would be left with a vision of a different sort of miracle.</p>
      <p>The differences between Exodus 14 and 15 are fairly slight. Both prose story and poem use
        similar images, for example of the water inundating the Egyptian chariots, and the Egyptians
        being ‘hurled’ into the sea. Both prose and poem have the fascinating image of ‘waters piled
        up’ and ‘standing straight like a wall'. There are some mismatches, like the anachronistic
        references in the poem to the fear of those living in Edom, Moab, and Canaan when they hear
        the tale. These two versions seem to have been linked much earlier and more firmly than
        Judges 4 and 5.</p>
      <p>The end of the Song of Deborah offers a portrait of Sisera's mother waiting for him to
        return from battle. This account is drenched in dramatic irony. We have just been through
        the graphically described violent assassination of Sisera by Yael. We know Sisera is not
        coming home. No pity is spared for Sisera's mother—the poem takes enormous delight in her
        ignorance of the truth, her arrogance, and the anticipation of her ultimate distress:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>Through the window peered Sisera's mother,</p>
        <p>Behind the lattice she whined [gazed?]:</p>
        <p>‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?</p>
        <p>Why so late the clatter of his wheels?’</p>
        <p>The wisest of her ladies give answer;</p>
        <p>She, too, replies to herself:</p>
        <p>They must be dividing the spoil they have found:</p>
        <p>A damsel or two for each man,</p>
        <p>Spoil of dyed cloths for Sisera,</p>
        <p>Spoil of embroidered cloths,</p>
        <p>A couple of embroidered cloths</p>
        <p>Round every neck as spoil.’</p>
        <p>So may all your enemies perish, O L<sc>ord!</sc> (Judg. 5.28–31a)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Far from taking a ‘damsel’ or two, Sisera and his army have been completely destroyed by
        two women, Deborah and Yael. The chariots are gone, there are no scarves for mothers and
        wives, and Sisera's head has been crushed by a woman. The contrast between the strong women
        of Israel and the weak ones of Canaan could not be more poignant and stark.</p>
      <p>The Song of Deborah covers a number of themes—the power of God, the political relations
        among the Israelite tribes, the great battle itself— but the image of women is dominant. The
        poem begins, appropriately enough, with praise for God, but moves quickly to praise for
        Deborah, a mother in Israel, who brought deliverance. Yael is ‘the most blessed of women'.
        The final scene contrasts them with the weak and arrogant women of Israel's enemy. In both
        the prose story and the poem, a central concern is the tension over women's roles. Deborah's
        reply to Barak that a woman will get the glory of victory assumes that it will be shameful
        to Barak if a woman is the hero of the tale. The story of Deborah does not project a world
        turned upside down, but the world as it actually is: fundamentally patriarchal, but not
        totally so—at least not for the Israelites at this particular time. That the story and poem
        bring the gender issue to consciousness seems to me to be, in itself, a positive development
        in the status of women. Deborah can be the Moses of the moment—many more such leaders will
        be needed as time goes on—without hesitation or embarrassment, and in fact with much pride,
        as the conclusion of the poem exclaims.</p>

    <sec id="sec7-0309089213492816">
      <title>7. Is Deborah Comparable to Moses?</title>
      <p>The long tradition of Deborah commentary and criticism swirls around the question of how a
        patriarchal society could produce or tolerate a woman—or even the story of a woman—with the
        power that Deborah evidently has. The approaches to this question include flat denial that
        she was in fact a prophet or judge—or even a ‘nice’ person. The medieval interpreter Rav
        Nachman was offended by Deborah's haughtiness in calling the military leader Barak to her
        rather than going to see him. He says that Deborah, usually translated ‘bee',’, was actually
        a hornet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089213492816">12</xref></sup> Others claim
        that she derived her power from her husband, Lappidoth or Barak (whom the rabbis suggested
        were the same person); or that the story was written by a woman (assuming that a man would
        never write such a story); or that Deborah did have power, but it was an aberration, an
        anomaly in social development, a mistake, or at least a rarity, and that we should not
        unduly elevate Deborah or assume that the story tells us anything about wider social
        acceptance of powerful women.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089213492816">13</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Daniel Block, for example, limits Deborah's role to delivering God's judgment by calling
        Barak and then, perhaps needlessly, accompanying him to the battle. ‘That was her role, no
        more and no less.'<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089213492816">14</xref></sup> Block
        lists seven characteristics of the stories of Israel's deliverers. Of the seven, six appear
        in the Deborah story, and on the basis of one absence—that her story does not have a line
        specifically saying that God had raised her up as a deliverer—Block argues that Deborah is
          <italic>not</italic> a real deliverer. Block suggests that the biblical author saw Deborah
        as <italic>almost</italic> a deliverer, but deliberately held back on the grounds that she
        does not lead the troops or appear in the battle itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089213492816">15</xref></sup> Block's objection may be answered by
        comparing Deborah with Moses, as we have done above, noting that while the other Judges may
        have gone to war, Moses did not.</p>
      <p>James Kugel offers a warning ‘not to conclude too much’ from the tough portrayals of
        Deborah and Yael.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089213492816">16</xref></sup> Barak,
        Kugel argues, needs Deborah only to tell him the right moment for battle, since the Lord did
        not give this information directly to Barak, as he had done for Ehud and Gideon. If Deborah
        is a judge—Kugel prefers the translation ‘leader'—it is because ‘the Book of Judges seems
        repeatedly to delight in God's surprising choice of divinely inspired leaders: the hoodlum
        son of a prostitute (Jephthah), a somewhat overzealous womanizer (Samson)’ and so
            on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089213492816">17</xref></sup> Thus, the Lord's
        choice of Deborah paradoxically tells us that women are <italic>not</italic> regarded as
        suited to power. Similarly, the choice of Yael to kill Sisera, for Kugel, is to make
        Sisera's defeat the more ignominious, not to raise the stature of women.</p>
      <p>Others have, nonetheless, maintained that the story betokens ‘an egalitarian conception of
        the roles of the sexes’, not excluding military matters;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089213492816">18</xref></sup> that Deborah was clearly a judge in the
        judicial sense as well as the ‘chieftain’ sense;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089213492816">19</xref></sup> that ‘mother in Israel’ is comparable to
        ‘God of Israel';<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089213492816">20</xref></sup> that
        God chooses whom God likes and patriarchy be damned;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089213492816">21</xref></sup> and that the plain sense of both the prose
        and poetic accounts show Deborah to be an extraordinary and powerful person.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089213492816">22</xref></sup> This view questions whether
        the story is really telling us that Deborah was married to a man named ‘Lappidoth’, noting
        the possible meaning of ‘Lappidoth’ to be ‘torch’ and the resulting reading of the idiom
        ‘wife of Lappidoth’ (‭תוךיפלתשא‬) as ‘woman of torches’ to suggest that she was a fiery
        woman. Finally, this perspective on the story points to the clearly superior position of
        Deborah over Barak in ch. 5.</p>
      <p>This is the camp where I wish to pitch my tent, adding the idea that Deborah parallels
        Moses. I have argued that Deborah is in a different and higher category than her fellow
        judges because, unlike them, she renders judgment and is a prophet. She is thus more like
        Moses than like Gideon or Jephthah or the other Judges. In military matters, she works as a
        strategist, not a warrior, again like Moses and not like the other judges. In her battle
        against the Canaanites, rushing water disables chariots, a striking echo of Moses at the
        sea. And finally, both Deborah and Moses sing victory songs. Incidental connections
        abound—in God looking down from above and sending the charioteers into a panic, in the
        connection to Moses’ in-laws, the Kenites, in the very pairing of prose and poetic
        narratives—to confirm the association.</p>
      <p>Reading Deborah as a genuinely powerful woman also seems true to the literary and
        rhetorical force of the story and song. It is needless to argue that the rest of the Bible
        and the Israelite society it represents are strongly patriarchal; to be sure, the power of
        Deborah and Yael did not translate into higher status for women as a whole. But that does
        not mean that the story deliberately limits or undercuts Deborah, as so many critics argue.
        To suggest that Deborah was controlled by Lappidoth or Barak, that she was not really a
        judge, that Barak did not respect her, that she was in the same league as Miriam, and so on,
        all require that both the participants in the story and the narrators as well be
        unreflective about the supposed anomalousness of Deborah's position. To the contrary, both
        story and poem are brilliantly and self-consciously constructed in plot, style,
        anticipation, and dramatic irony. Neither song nor story betrays any sense that Deborah's
        position is inappropriate or dangerous to the social order, that patriarchy is under siege,
        or—and this is the key element—that anything very unusual is happening. James Kugel, who, we
        noted above, cautions against drawing any larger conclusions about the exalted status of
        women from the story of Deborah, nonetheless does not seek to undermine the glory of
        Deborah's actions: she was certainly a hero, even if she did not lead a feminist
            revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089213492816">23</xref></sup></p>
      <p>As for the problem of history and the dominance of patriarchy, it may well be, as Susan
        Ackerman agues forcefully, that there were periods of transition when patriarchy was somehow
            suspended.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089213492816">24</xref></sup> The
        stories of Deborah require two such periods—one close to the twelfth century when the song
        was composed, and another in the monarchical period when the prose version was written. This
        seems fine to me, though Ackerman speaks only of the ‘decentralized’ period of the judges as
        transitional, not the monarchical era when the Deuteronomistic History developed. However, I
        wonder how the people living in a ‘transitional age’ know that it is transitional. I suspect
        that one's own time always seems normal and taken-for-granted, and I am happy to think that
        there were at least some stretches of time when it could be taken for granted that a strong
        woman could be robed in the garment of Moses.</p>
      <p>Moses says that God will raise up another prophet like himself in the future (Deut.
        18.15–18). It seems highly likely to me that Deborah was seen as that prophet, the Moses of
        her time.</p>

        <p>On the question of social conditions for women, Fewell and Dunn argue that the story's

          or leaders are exceptions, aberrations, or anomalies and that Deborah should be seen as a
          ‘prophetic functionary'. It is not, in Ackerman's view, that women did not have power for
