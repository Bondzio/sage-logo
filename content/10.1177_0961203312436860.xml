<abstract>
<p>The mechanisms underlying leukocyte recruitment in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are unclear. Leukocytes from SLE patients display increased integrin expression, but whether this results in an increased capacity to undergo adhesive interactions has not been investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify alterations in the capacity of leukocytes from SLE patients to undergo interactions with various substrates under flow conditions. Blood from SLE patients was examined in a flow chamber assay, and rolling, adhesion and post-adhesion spreading assessed on platelet monolayers or VCAM-1. P-selectin-dependent neutrophil rolling on platelet monolayers did not differ between SLE patients and healthy controls. Similarly, lymphocyte adhesion on VCAM-1 did not differ between patients and controls. However, post-adhesion spreading on VCAM-1 was significantly increased in lymphocytes from SLE patients. These parameters were unaffected by overall disease activity, presence of organ damage or prednisolone usage. However, leukocyte spreading on VCAM-1 was elevated in patients with evidence of active renal disease. These findings indicate that lymphocytes from SLE patients have an increased propensity to undergo post-adhesion spreading, a key preliminary step in leukocyte transmigration. This behavior may contribute to lymphocyte infiltration in SLE patients and may represent a novel biomarker of lupus nephritis.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203312436860" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease in which multisystem tissue damage develops, consequent upon loss of tolerance to self-antigens and the generation of autoantibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312436860">1</xref></sup> In recent years, significant advances in understanding the relationship between Toll-like receptor signaling, Type I interferon production and B cell activation have brought new understandings of the autoimmune response in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312436860">2</xref></sup> In contrast, comparatively little is known about the mechanisms of the inflammatory effector response that stems from these alterations in systemic immunity. In particular this applies to leukocyte recruitment to target tissues, a process which is fundamental to inflammation of target organs in SLE, such as skin, kidney and brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312436860">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is now well established that in order for circulating leukocytes to enter inflamed sites, they must undergo a series of interactions with the endothelium lining the microvasculature at the target site, in which leukocytes first roll, then arrest on the endothelial surface. Subsequently, adherent leukocytes undergo shape changes associated with adhesion strengthening and the preliminary steps of transendothelial migration. These interactions are mediated by adhesive glycoproteins expressed by both circulating leukocytes and endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312436860">4</xref></sup> Under pathological conditions, leukocyte infiltration may stem from alterations in the expression and function of adhesion molecules on either endothelial cells or circulating leukocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312436860">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312436860">6</xref></sup> While endothelial adhesion molecule upregulation has been demonstrated in SLE, the contribution of altered adhesive function of circulating leukocytes to SLE-associated leukocyte recruitment is unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312436860">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312436860">8</xref></sup> The possibility that circulating leukocytes have functional alterations which contribute to inflammation in SLE first emerged in studies of peripheral blood lymphocytes, which demonstrated increased expression of the β2 integrin adhesion molecule LFA-1 (CD11a) in SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312436860">9</xref></sup> This study also showed that in vasculitis-affected SLE patients, expression of the adhesion molecules VLA-4 (α4 integrin) and LFA-1 are elevated on peripheral blood lymphocytes, demonstrating a correlation between leukocyte integrin expression and disease phenotype. Neutrophils from patients with active SLE have also been reported to exhibit increased expression of CD11b/CD18.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312436860">10</xref></sup> However, quantitative increases in integrin expression do not necessarily correlate with increases in leukocyte adhesive function, as integrin function can be regulated by qualitative changes including molecular conformation and clustering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312436860">4</xref></sup> Moreover, interactions leading to leukocyte recruitment take place in the microvasculature, where they must overcome the opposing forces applied by flowing blood. As such, it is unknown whether alterations in leukocyte adhesion molecule expression reported in SLE patients are of functional relevance to leukocyte recruitment in SLE.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of these studies was to investigate whether SLE is characterized by changes in leukocyte adhesive properties that lead to altered interactions under flow conditions. If abnormalities in leukocyte adhesive behavior could be demonstrated in SLE, this might represent a novel biomarker for SLE disease activity, or identify potential therapeutic targets. Our approach was to use a whole blood ex vivo flow chamber assay to assess blood samples from SLE patients and healthy controls, and examine leukocyte interactions on substrates which selectively favor rolling or adhesion interactions.</p></sec>

<p>Consenting SLE patients attending the Monash Medical Centre Lupus Clinic were invited to participate in a prospective data collection project. Disease activity was determined and documented for each patient at the time of clinic attendance using the 2000 modification of the SELENA-SLEDAI (SLE disease activity index) (SLEDAI-2k).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312436860">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312436860">12</xref></sup> To assess renal disease activity, the renal components of the SLEDAI-2k were combined to create a renal SLEDAI (rSLEDAI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312436860">13</xref></sup> Patients with active renal lupus were defined as those with rSLEDAI ≥ 4. Disease-related damage was recorded annually using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage Index (SDI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312436860">14</xref></sup> Patients defined as having SLE satisfied at least four of the classification criteria for SLE proposed by the ACR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312436860">15</xref></sup> Samples for control purposes were drawn from healthy volunteers. This work was approved by the Monash Medical Centre Human Research Ethics Committee.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203312436860"><title>Whole blood collection</title>
<p>Blood was collected into lithium heparin and EDTA blood vacuum collection tubes. Heparinized blood was stored on ice and used for flow chamber assays within two hours. EDTA blood was used to determine peripheral blood leukocyte subset counts.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203312436860"><title>Proteins, antibodies and chemicals</title>
<p>Human recombinant VCAM-1 was purchased from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Type I collagen from rat tail was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). The anti α4-integrin Ab (PS/2) was purified from hybridoma. This antibody was developed against murine α4-integrin but has cross reactivity against human α4-integrin. Polyclonal anti-human P-selectin Ab was generously provided by Dr Rob Andrews (Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Prahran, Victoria, Australia). Anti-human PSGL-1 antibody was purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203312436860"><title>Platelet monolayers</title>
<p>For platelet isolation, Acid Citrate Dextrose (ACD) anti-coagulated blood collected from healthy volunteers was centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. Platelet rich plasma was then collected and mixed with 1 ml ACD. Platelets were washed with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) then pelleted by centrifugation. Isolated platelets were suspended in HBSS at 8 × 10<sup>6</sup>/ml and 250 µl of this suspension was plated onto 3.5 cm petri dishes (Corning, Lowell, MA, USA) pre-coated with collagen (4 mg/ml, 1 h).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312436860">16</xref></sup> Platelet monolayers were incubated at 37°C for at least 60 minutes prior to use.</p></sec>

<p>Human VCAM-1 protein (1 µg in 500 µl HBSS) was plated onto 3.5 cm petri dishes (Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany) and plates were incubated at 4°C overnight. VCAM-1-coated plates were then washed with HBSS and non-specific binding blocked by incubation with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 minutes at 37°C, prior to use in flow chamber assays.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0961203312436860"><title>Flow chamber assay</title>
<p>The whole blood flow chamber assay was performed using a parallel plate flow chamber (Glycotech, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312436860">17</xref></sup> Briefly, heparinized blood was diluted in HBSS (1:10 for platelet monolayers; 1:3 for VCAM-1 experiments) and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes. The flow chamber was placed into a culture dish and observed using an inverted microscope. The diluted blood was then perfused over the adhesive substrate for 5 min at a shear rate of 150 s<sup>−1</sup>. Subsequently, the chamber was cleared of blood using HBSS, and 8–12 random fields (0.23 mm<sup>2</sup>/field) were recorded for 10 s. Leukocyte interactions were quantitated as follows: rolling leukocytes were defined as cells which made transient rolling interactions with the substrate; adherent leukocytes were defined as cells that remained stationary for the entire 10 s recording; adherent cells which became phase dark and had irregular morphology were defined as ‘spread’ cells. Data for all cell types are expressed as cells/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312436860">2</xref></sup>.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec13-0961203312436860"><title>Rolling interactions of SLE leukocytes on platelet monolayers</title>
<p>The initial event in leukocyte recruitment to inflamed tissues is rolling, a phenomenon mediated by specific endothelial adhesion molecules, including P-selectin. Previous studies have shown that platelet monolayers express P-selectin that can support leukocyte rolling interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312436860">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312436860">19</xref></sup> Therefore, we examined leukocyte rolling interactions using platelet monolayers as the adhesive substrate. Platelet monolayers readily supported interactions of leukocytes from SLE blood samples, with rolling being the predominant interaction observed. Rolling of leukocytes from SLE patient samples was almost completely inhibited by either anti-P-selectin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312436860">Figure 1(a)</xref>) or inhibition of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), the major P-selectin ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312436860">Figure 1(b)</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312436860">20</xref></sup> These data confirmed a predominant role of the P-selectin/PSGL-1 pathway in mediating rolling interactions between SLE leukocytes and this substrate. In both SLE patients and controls, almost 90% of the interacting cells were neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312436860">Figure 1(c)</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-0961203312436860" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>SLE leukocyte interactions with platelet monolayers under flow conditions.

<p>SLE and corticosteroids can each influence peripheral blood neutrophil counts. In order to allow comparison of neutrophil interactions independent of variations in blood leukocyte counts, and given that most of the interacting leukocytes were neutrophils, we normalized leukocyte rolling data to the peripheral blood neutrophil count in each sample. Comparison of leukocyte rolling normalized to neutrophil counts revealed no differences between SLE and healthy control subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312436860">Figure 1(d)</xref>). As patients included in this study were recruited from an outpatient clinic, many SLE patients studied had low levels of disease activity. To assess the possibility that inclusion of patients with low disease activity obscured differences between SLE patients and healthy controls, rolling interactions were analyzed in subsets of SLE patients defined as having either inactive (SLEDAI &lt; 4) or active (SLEDAI ≥ 4) disease. Unexpectedly, leukocyte rolling from SLE patients with low disease activity was significantly greater than that of either healthy controls or patients with higher disease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312436860">Figure 1(e)</xref>). In contrast, patients with active renal disease (rSLEDAI ≥ 4 – <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312436860">Table 1</xref>) showed no difference in leukocyte rolling in comparison with patients without active renal disease (data not shown).</p>
<p>Leukocyte rolling in SLE patients was also assessed relative to corticosteroid (prednisolone) use. No significant differences in leukocyte rolling were detected between SLE patients with or without corticosteroid treatment (data not shown). Finally, leukocyte rolling was also assessed relative to the presence or absence of SLE-related irreversible organ damage, as measured by the SDI. Comparison of rolling in SLE patients with (SDI ≥ 1) or without organ damage (SDI = 0) revealed no significant differences between these groups, or relative to healthy controls (data not shown). These data indicate that, overall, P-selectin-dependent rolling interactions of blood leukocytes from SLE patients are not different from those of healthy control subjects.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-0961203312436860"><title>Adhesive interactions of SLE leukocytes on VCAM-1</title>
<p>After rolling, leukocytes must undergo adhesion and spreading as a prelude to transmigration. We therefore developed a flow chamber model to assess the capacity of SLE patient blood leukocytes to undergo adhesion and spreading under flow conditions. Previous whole blood flow chamber studies have shown that recombinant VCAM-1 can support leukocyte adhesion in a flow chamber system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312436860">21</xref></sup> We therefore examined interactions of SLE blood leukocytes on VCAM-1. In SLE blood samples, VCAM-1 was highly effective in capturing leukocytes from flow, with the number of interacting leukocytes varying widely, from 15 to &gt; 160 cells/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312436860">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203312436860">Figure 2(a)</xref>). The majority of leukocytes which interacted with VCAM-1 were adherent, with leukocyte rolling observed only rarely (data not shown), as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203312436860">22</xref></sup> Neutralization of the VCAM-1 ligand, α4-integrin, in SLE samples resulted in significantly reduced leukocyte adhesion on VCAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203312436860">Figure 2(b)</xref>) an effect replicated in healthy control blood (data not shown). These findings indicated that the function of α4-integrin in mediating interactions with VCAM-1 was similar in leukocytes in SLE and control peripheral blood.

<p>We next compared VCAM-1-dependent adhesion between SLE and control leukocytes. As lymphocytes formed the majority of the interacting cells in both controls and SLE patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203312436860">Figure 2(c)</xref>), we normalized VCAM-1-mediated adhesion to the peripheral blood lymphocyte count in each sample. Under these conditions, the number of adherent lymphocytes did not differ between SLE patients and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203312436860">Figure 2(d)</xref>). We also investigated associations between SLE disease activity and VCAM-1-dependent adhesion. Lymphocyte adhesion did not differ between inactive (SLEDAI &lt; 4) and active (SLEDAI ≥ 4) SLE patients or controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961203312436860">Figure 3(a)</xref>).

<p>Solid tissue disease manifestations in SLE, such as skin, joint and renal inflammation, are accompanied by the accumulation of blood-derived leukocytes. The hypothesis that development of SLE tissue lesions is facilitated by inappropriate leukocyte recruitment is supported by observations that tissue damage in murine SLE is reduced by deficiency of recruitment-promoting molecules including the chemokine CCL2 (MCP-1) and the endothelial adhesion molecule ICAM-1, and clinically by disease associations with polymorphisms in the MCP-1 and CD11b genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203312436860">25</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203312436860">28</xref></sup> In addition we have previously described induction of α4-integrin-dependent leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in the microcirculation of lupus-prone mice, associated with disease progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203312436860">29</xref></sup> These findings implicate both leukocyte and endothelial cell-expressed adhesion molecules in pathological leukocyte recruitment in SLE. However, they do not inform as to whether functional abnormalities of such systems are present in patients with this disease. The current studies were designed to determine whether peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with SLE exhibit intrinsic abnormalities in adhesive function that might contribute to pathological tissue leukocyte accumulation. The data indicate that while P-selectin-dependent rolling and α4 integrin-dependent adhesion are unaltered, lymphocyte spreading on VCAM-1 is significantly increased in SLE patients.</p>
<p>It is now recognized that a post-arrest phase of adhesion strengthening, manifest in part as spreading and polarization on the endothelial surface, is critical in sustaining leukocyte adhesion in the face of opposing shear force and represents an essential preliminary step in the process of transmigration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312436860">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203312436860">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203312436860">24</xref></sup> Furthermore, of relevance to the present study which examined α4 integrin/VCAM-1-dependent spreading, outside-in signals transmitted via the α4 integrin have the capacity to mediate this response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961203312436860">30</xref></sup> As such, lymphocyte spreading on VCAM-1 models a key step in the sequence of events leading to leukocyte entry to inflamed tissues. Using this approach, we show that lymphocytes from SLE patients have a greater capacity to undergo post-arrest spreading relative to cells from healthy controls. This finding indicates that there may be specific SLE-related alterations in lymphocyte spreading responses that contribute to pathological leukocyte recruitment in this disease. Interestingly, this change was independent of overall disease activity, corticosteroid therapy or disease-related damage, but associated with the presence of active renal disease, suggesting this phenotype may be intrinsic to SLE and/or lupus nephritis. It is notable that T cells from patients with another systemic inflammatory disease, systemic sclerosis, have previously been shown to have an increased capacity for transendothelial migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203312436860">31</xref></sup> Together with the present findings, these data demonstrate that systemic inflammatory disease can be associated with activating changes in lymphocytes that promote recruitment responses at key checkpoints subsequent to leukocyte arrest on the endothelial surface.</p>
<p>In these experiments we elected to examine SLE peripheral blood leukocyte interactions with specific adhesive substrates, in order to examine rolling and adhesion responses independently. Studies using platelet monolayers were designed to examine leukocyte rolling. This approach is an established method for assessment of P-selectin-dependent rolling, and typically favors recruitment of neutrophils when used with whole blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312436860">21</xref></sup> The contributions of neutrophils and P-selectin to SLE pathology are unclear. Bennett et al. demonstrated that genes associated with granulopoiesis and granulocyte recruitment were among the most highly upregulated genes in SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961203312436860">32</xref></sup> Earlier studies revealed that SLE patient serum contains factors which activate resting neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961203312436860">33</xref></sup> Similarly, some studies point to a contribution of P-selectin in SLE. Urine P-selectin is increased in active lupus nephritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961203312436860">34</xref></sup> Moreover, platelet expression of P-selectin is increased in SLE patients, potentially promoting platelet adhesion to plasmacytoid dendritic cells, leading to enhanced interferon-alpha production by these cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0961203312436860">35</xref></sup> Despite these emerging data, the current studies do not suggest the presence of intrinsic abnormalities in the ability of peripheral blood neutrophils from SLE patients to undergo rolling interactions with P-selectin under flow conditions.</p>
<p>To examine the ability of SLE leukocytes to undergo adhesion, we used VCAM-1 as a substrate, as in preliminary studies this substrate supported the most robust adhesion response in whole blood assays. Under these conditions, no increase in adhesion interactions on VCAM-1 was observed in SLE patients compared with healthy controls, and similarly there was no relationship between leukocyte adhesion to VCAM-1 and disease activity, glucocorticoid therapy or organ damage.</p>
<p>Although these studies were restricted to the examination of platelet P-selectin and recombinant VCAM-1 as substrates, taken together the results indicate that SLE is not characterized by an abnormality of rolling and adhesion interactions of blood leukocytes to these adhesion molecules. In contrast, a significant difference was observed between control and SLE blood in leukocyte spreading, a phenomenon occurring subsequent to rolling and adhesion. A caveat to interpretation of the current results is the use of non-physiological adhesive substrates. An alternative to the use of platelets and recombinant VCAM would be the use of cultured endothelial cells. However, even such cells are not representative of conditions in vivo, and the use of such cells would not have lent itself to development of a lupus biomarker. In addition, restriction of the current studies to platelet P-selectin and VCAM-1 may incompletely represent the situation in vivo, which may be influenced by the simultaneous expression of additional factors or by the tissue in which inflammation is taking place. For example, Norman et al. showed that VCAM-1 was relevant to leukocyte recruitment in the brain, but not the skin, of MRL/<italic>lpr</italic> lupus-prone mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961203312436860">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study focused exclusively on functional changes in leukocytes from SLE patients and demonstrated that VCAM-1-adherent SLE lymphocytes have an increased capacity to undergo spreading. As leukocyte recruitment entails interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells, it remains possible that altered endothelial function also contributes to aberrant leukocyte recruitment in SLE. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated alterations in endothelial adhesion molecule expression in SLE patient biopsies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312436860">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312436860">8</xref></sup> Interestingly, these studies showed a correlation between disease activity and endothelial adhesion molecule expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312436860">7</xref></sup> This is in contrast to the lack of correlation between overall disease activity and leukocyte adhesive function observed in the present study. Given these findings, it is conceivable that in SLE patients, elevations in endothelial adhesion molecule expression in the setting of active disease, in combination with an inherently elevated capacity of lymphocytes to undergo spreading, facilitate lymphocyte entry into target tissues.</p>
<p>The observation of association of increased leukocyte spreading in patients with active renal disease was unexpected. Only a small number of subjects examined had active renal disease at the time of study, but nonetheless it is intriguing that this subgroup, which is associated with a worse prognosis, exhibited the lymphocyte spreading phenotype most strongly. In lupus-prone mice, the recruitment of T lymphocytes is associated with the development of proliferative nephritis, and prevention of T lymphocyte recruitment to the kidney is associated with protection from severe nephritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0961203312436860">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961203312436860">38</xref></sup> These findings suggest pathological relevance of the observed increase in adherent lymphocyte spreading in patients with active renal disease that should be further investigated.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these caveats, the current studies suggest that while there is not a fundamental alteration in leukocyte rolling or adhesion responses in SLE patients on the adhesive substrates examined here, post-adhesion leukocyte spreading, a critical step in the progression to transmigration, is increased in SLE and is associated with active renal disease. Further investigation of the mechanisms of increased leukocyte spreading in patients with SLE is warranted.</p></sec>
