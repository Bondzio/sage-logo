<p>Eleventh- and 6th-grade students from an urban public school district were surveyed concerning vaccination outside the traditional medical home. Survey response rates were 50% for 11th- and 73% for 6th-grade students. Seventy-two percent of 11th-grade students reported that public health clinics were definitely or probably acceptable locations for vaccination; 70% reported this for emergency departments, 65% for school-based health centers, 55% for family planning clinics, and 44% for obstetrics/gynecology clinics. Corresponding percentages for 6th-grade students were 60% for public health clinics, 49% for emergency departments, 39% for school-based health centers, and 36% for family planning clinics. Sixth-grade students were not asked about obstetrics/gynecology clinics. Forty-seven percent of respondents identified a doctor’s office as the “best” setting to receive vaccines, more than identified any other setting. We concluded that vaccination in one or more settings outside the traditional medical home was acceptable to most adolescents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eleven- to 12-year-old adolescents are a targeted age group for tetanus, reduced diphtheria, and acellular pertussis, meningococcal conjugate, and human papillomavirus vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813475703">1</xref></sup> Additionally, 13- to 18-year-old adolescents might require “catch-up” immunization for these and other vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813475703">1</xref></sup> Although the medical home is expected to be the primary setting where most adolescents receive recommended vaccines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813475703">2</xref></sup> barriers to vaccination in the medical home exist. National data indicate that, although 94% of 12- to 17-year-old adolescents report a usual source of care, more than 25% report this source to be a setting other than a doctor’s office.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813475703">3</xref></sup> In addition, adolescents underutilize preventive health care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813475703">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813475703"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813475703">6</xref></sup> and vaccinations are infrequently provided at nonpreventive visits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813475703">5</xref></sup> Even at preventive visits, missed opportunities for vaccination might occur because of delivery barriers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813475703">7</xref></sup> including inadequate insurance coverage for vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813475703">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813475703">9</xref></sup> Barriers to vaccine delivery are likely magnified when delivering multiple-dose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813475703">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813475703">11</xref></sup> or annually recommended vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813475703">12</xref></sup> Finally, vaccine delivery in the medical home will be particularly difficult to achieve for certain segments of the adolescent population, such as uninsured adolescents, who are unlikely to have usual sources of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813475703">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Vaccine delivery to adolescents in health care settings outside the traditional medical home might positively affect immunization rates, particularly for underserved adolescents. Potential settings for vaccination include school-based health centers (SBHCs), public health clinics, emergency departments (EDs), urgent care clinics, family planning clinics, and pharmacies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813475703">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813475703"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813475703"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813475703">17</xref></sup> Obstetrics and gynecology clinics have been shown to serve as a primary health care setting for some female adolescents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813475703">18</xref></sup> and might also be a practical setting for vaccine delivery to adolescents. Organizing health care delivery across multiple, diverse, health care settings has long been described as one promising approach toward improving adolescents’ access to health care in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813475703">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813475703">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although little research has been published on the topic, adolescents’ acceptance may be an important determinant of a setting’s success at improving adolescent immunization rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813475703">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813475703">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813475703">21</xref></sup> Adolescents’ acceptance of vaccination may be particularly important in settings where adolescents typically present for care without their parents, as adolescents are more likely to be engaged in medical decision-making processes in these settings. Prior research on adolescents’ attitudes regarding vaccination outside the traditional medical home has focused on older adolescents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813475703">21</xref></sup> or on adolescents already presenting for care outside the traditional medical home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813475703">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813475703">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The objectives of the current investigation were to describe younger and older adolescents’ attitudes about health care and vaccination in 5 settings outside the traditional medical home. A secondary objective was to assess adolescent characteristics and attitudes associated with acceptance of vaccination in each setting.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0009922813475703">
<title>Setting and Study Population</title>
<p>A survey was conducted from April through May 2008, in 2 high schools and 3 middle schools within a large urban public school district. The 5 schools were selected based on student-body racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity, and intentionally included one high school and one middle school with a SBHC. Among the 5 schools, student-body eligibility for the federal free and reduced lunch program ranged from 47% to 94%. Survey administration targeted all enrolled 6th-grade (n = 539) and 11th-grade adolescent students (n = 590). The school district and the human subjects review board at the University of Colorado approved the study protocol and materials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922813475703">
<title>Survey Design and Administration</title>
<p>Survey questions were developed based on existing literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813475703">24</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813475703"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922813475703"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922813475703">27</xref></sup> and investigators’ findings from focus groups conducted with parents of adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922813475703">28</xref></sup> The survey instrument solicited students’ demographic characteristics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813475703">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813475703">25</xref></sup> usual sources and uses of health care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922813475703">29</xref></sup> characteristics of health care settings important to students,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922813475703">30</xref></sup> and perceptions about health care and vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922813475703">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922813475703">27</xref></sup> The survey also included items assessing perceived facilitators and barriers to acceptance of vaccination in each of 5 settings outside the traditional medical home: SBHCs, public health clinics, EDs, family planning clinics, and obstetrics and gynecology clinics. These settings were identified as potentially promising during prior parent focus groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922813475703">28</xref></sup> Other types of settings, such as pharmacies, were not included because of survey length considerations. Only 11th-grade females were asked about obstetrics and gynecology clinics. Students were also asked to report their first and second choices for their preferred (“best”) place to receive needed vaccines. The survey was piloted in 2 focus groups of 11- to 13-year-old adolescents (n = 17), and a convenience sample of 11- to 17-year-old adolescents (n = 11). As advised by school staff, 6th-grade surveys were offered in English and Spanish; 11th-grade surveys were available in English only.</p>
<p>For each school, a mandatory regularly scheduled 6th- or 11th-grade class was identified for survey administration. Approximately 1 week before survey administration, parents were notified in Spanish and English that their children would be invited to take an anonymous, self-administered, voluntary survey. Parents who preferred their children not complete the survey were instructed to notify school staff. Students were also given an opportunity to opt out of participation at the time of survey administration. The survey included a description of each type of vaccination setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922813475703">
<title>Analytic Methods</title>
<p>Descriptive frequencies were calculated to describe respondents, their health care utilization characteristics, and their attitudes about health care, vaccines, and specific health care settings. For univariate and multivariate analyses, acceptance of vaccination in each of the 5 settings was defined as answering “definitely” or “probably” to the question “if you needed to get a vaccine, would it be OK with you to get it at” the specified setting. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between adolescents’ attitudes and characteristics with acceptance of vaccination in each setting. To facilitate regression analyses and interpretation, 5 composite scales were created (usual source of care, importance of health care and vaccines, importance of setting location and cost, adolescent autonomy, and knowledge and experience with each setting). The validity of item groupings within scales was tested using Cronbach’s α, with individual survey items removed from composite scales if inclusion of these items substantially reduced the Cronbach α.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922813475703">31</xref></sup> Separate models were developed for 6th- and 11th-grade students for each setting. Mixed effects models accounted for clustering of students by school. SAS version 9.2 (Cary, NC) was used for analyses.</p>

<title>Survey Response</title>
<p>Among all enrolled students, overall response rates were 73% (392/539) for 6th-grade students and 50% (296/590) for 11th-grade students. The percentage of students absent on the survey administration date was 19% (100/539) for 6th-grade classes and 39% (231/590) for 11th-grade classes. Thirty-six middle school parents and no high school parents requested that their child not take the survey. One high school teacher refused participation, which excluded twenty-seven 11th-grade students from the sample. Among students in attendance whose parents did not refuse participation, response rates were 97% (392/403) among 6th-grade students and 82% (296/359) among 11th-grade students. Two students who intentionally responded falsely to survey questions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922813475703">32</xref></sup> were excluded from analyses.</p>
<p>No individual characteristics were available for survey nonrespondents. However, the racial and ethnic characteristics of survey respondents were generally similar to the characteristics of the student bodies of the 5 participating public schools (data not shown).</p>

<title>Setting Characteristics Important to Adolescents</title>
<p>Almost all surveyed adolescents reported the following characteristics as “very” or “somewhat” important to them when seeking health care: a setting taking care of “lots” of people their own age (reported by 90%), parents’ approval of a setting (93%), a setting being close to home or school (83%), and a setting not charging any money (80%). Fifty-five percent of 6th-grade and 66% of 11th-grade adolescents reported that it was very/somewhat important that a setting be one they could go to without their friends knowing. More 11th-grade females than males (72% vs 55%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = .003) reported it was very/somewhat important that a setting be one they could go to without their parents knowing. Forty-four percent of 6th-grade students reported it was very/somewhat important that a setting was one they could go to without their parents’ knowing, with no significant difference in response by gender.</p>

More adolescents preferred vaccination in a doctor’s office than preferred vaccination in any other listed setting. Among those who selected a doctor’s office as the “best” setting to receive vaccines, 17% indicated that there was no acceptable “next best” setting.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In a survey of urban 6th- and 11th-grade students, most appeared to be accepting of vaccination in settings outside the traditional medical home. The majority of adolescents reported one or more of these settings to be an acceptable location to receive needed vaccines. However, certain settings were acceptable for vaccination to more adolescents than others, and more 11th-grade adolescents were accepting of each type of setting compared with 6th-grade adolescents. Those who reported a greater level of knowledge and experience with a particular setting were more likely to be accepting of vaccination in that setting. Also, the more autonomous an adolescent reportedly was regarding health care decisions, the greater the likelihood of their acceptance of vaccination in many settings outside of the medical home, particularly among 11th-grade adolescents. When asked to choose the “best” vaccination setting, nearly one half of adolescents chose a doctor’s office, more than selected any other setting.</p>
<p>Based on the findings from this and other studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813475703">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813475703"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813475703">23</xref></sup> adolescents generally appear to be accepting of vaccination in health care settings outside of the traditional medical home, although acceptance varies between different types of settings. In a survey of sexually active 15- to 21-year-old females conducted prior to HPV vaccine licensure, Tedeschi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813475703">23</xref></sup> found that 74% of respondents would accept HPV vaccine and a theoretical HIV vaccine in a Planned Parenthood clinic, 64% would accept these vaccines in a public health clinic, and 45% in a school setting. Rand et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813475703">21</xref></sup> conducted surveys among parents and their 15- to 17-year-old adolescents seen in primary care clinics in Monroe County, New York, and found that most would be willing to have the adolescent receive vaccines in EDs, whereas relatively few found pharmacies an acceptable location for vaccination. In the current study, the vast majority found at least one setting outside the traditional medical home to be an acceptable location to receive vaccines. The current study provides unique information, however, because a general population of adolescents was surveyed, not those already seeking care in any particular health care setting.</p>
<p>Although the vaccination of adolescents in the United States generally requires parent or guardian consent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922813475703">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922813475703">34</xref></sup> based on the limited data available, adolescents appear to be participating in vaccination decisions. A majority of urban 6th- and 11th-grade adolescents in the current study reported being involved in decisions about their health care, and three quarters of 11th-grade adolescents reported that teens younger than 18 years should be allowed to receive a vaccine to prevent a sexually transmitted infection without their parents’ permission. Few other studies on this subject have been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813475703">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0009922813475703">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0009922813475703">36</xref></sup> In a postlicensure survey about HPV vaccination in urban California private and public high schools, 48% of female students reported that they participated in the decision whether or not to receive HPV vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0009922813475703">35</xref></sup>; however, the study was small and most students came from highly educated families, which may limit generalizability of these findings. In a recent national study by Kennedy et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0009922813475703">36</xref></sup> 72% of minor adolescents disagreed with the statement “I should be allowed to get vaccines without [parental] permission.” Although these findings seem in conflict, it may be that many adolescents want to be involved in vaccine-related decisions but do not want the ultimate responsibility of providing their own independent consent for vaccination. Adolescents’ attitudes about vaccine decision-making may also vary based on factors such as the type of vaccine, where the adolescents live (urban versus rural), and their parents’ socioeconomic status and education level.</p>
<p>Most prior work in this area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813475703">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813475703"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813475703">23</xref></sup> has not assessed the attitudes of younger adolescents with respect to vaccination outside of the traditional medical home. This oversight may stem from a belief that, because 11- to 12-year-old adolescents cannot independently consent for vaccination in most circumstances,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922813475703">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922813475703">34</xref></sup> and are unlikely to present for care by themselves, their attitudes about vaccination are not relevant. In fact, their attitudes are nonetheless important, because their willingness to cooperate with the vaccination process may be an important determinant of whether vaccination actually occurs. In the survey reported here, 6th-grade adolescents appeared to be less accepting of vaccination in settings outside the traditional medical home compared with 11th-grade adolescents. Also, 6th-grade adolescents described themselves as less autonomous when making decisions about health care, and reported being less comfortable getting care without their parents’ knowledge, compared with older adolescents. With these attitudes in mind, our data suggest that vaccination in most types of settings outside the traditional medical home may be less acceptable, and have less of an impact on immunization delivery, for younger adolescents compared to those who are older.</p>
<p>In the current study, attending a school with a SBHC increased the likelihood that 11th-grade students would accept vaccination in that setting. In a national survey, 84% of SBHCs reported providing vaccines to adolescents; among those providing vaccines, nearly all reported vaccinating Medicaid-insured and uninsured adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0009922813475703">37</xref></sup> Therefore, it appears that adolescents who attend schools with SBHCs become familiar and comfortable with the idea of receiving vaccines there, and the health centers are well prepared to provide recommended vaccines. However, the impact of promoting adolescent vaccination in SBHCs will likely be limited by the relatively small number of schools, roughly 2000 nationally,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0009922813475703">38</xref></sup> which contain a SBHC.</p>
<p>This study has several important limitations. The survey instrument posed theoretical questions, and therefore might not reflect adolescents’ actual vaccination-seeking behavior in regards to settings outside the traditional medical home. In addition, this assessment was limited to 5 specific settings, but there are other settings, including pharmacies, urgent care clinics, or retail-based clinics, where adolescents could receive vaccines. Participants’ understanding of the structure and function of different types of health care settings might have varied from the intended settings, although a description of each setting was provided in the survey. Students absent from class on the survey administration date may differ from students in attendance; consequently survey respondents could differ from nonrespondents with respect to vaccine-related attitudes. The opt-out method of obtaining parental consent for survey administration, however, has been shown to minimize other types of response bias in youth surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0009922813475703">39</xref></sup> Although the study population was relatively diverse, the findings of this study may not apply to other populations, such as rural or suburban adolescents, or those from different racial or ethnic minority groups. Adolescent attitudes about vaccination in these types of settings may have changed since this survey was administered. Finally, this survey was not designed or intended to explore potential drawbacks to vaccination outside the medical home (such as the fragmentation of immunization records held in multiple locations that can occur when settings do not participate in state-based immunization information systems).</p>
<p>For adolescents with an existing relationship with a medical home, vaccination can be linked with delivery of recommended well-adolescent care. Therefore, vaccination in the medical home is ideal in most circumstances, as long as adolescents use their medical home and high immunization rates are achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0009922813475703">40</xref></sup> However, adolescents without a medical home, or with barriers to care in their medical home, might seek health care in other settings. Current research on adolescents’ perspectives about vaccination in different health care settings is lacking, possibly reflecting an underappreciation of adolescents’ roles in successful vaccine delivery. This study provides an assessment of vaccine-related attitudes in a diverse urban adolescent population, and suggests that most adolescents would be accepting of vaccination in one or more settings outside of the traditional medical home, particularly if the adolescents had some knowledge or experience with a setting.</p>
