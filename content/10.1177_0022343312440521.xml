<p>Adelman, Howard &amp; Elazar Barkan (2011) <italic>No Return, No Refuge: Rites and Rights in Minority Repatriation</italic>. New York: Columbia University Press. 340 pp. ISBN 9780231153362.</p>
<p>Do refugees have a right to return to their prior homeland and homes? If so, is return always feasible or desirable? On the basis of abundant case study material, the authors conclude that repatriation of minority groups almost never succeeds and that when it does, rights are not enough: force is usually necessary. Further, they argue that the entire discourse of repatriation is a recent one. Before the mid-20th century, it was the norm, even an accepted practice, to expel or transfer populations to achieve ethno-national unity and political stability. Only at mid-century, particularly in reaction to Nazi policy, did global condemnation of population displacement emerge, and even then expulsion was condemned but repatriation was not automatically endorsed, nor was it based on the language of ‘rights’. Adelman &amp; Barkan provide detailed examples from Yugoslavia, various Asian and African countries, and Israel and Palestine to establish not only that minority repatriation is unlikely in the absence of military force (by the group or a foreign power) but also that discourses and practices of repatriation largely have the character of ‘rites’ or rituals rather than practical remedies. The idealism inherent in the rites of repatriation rights, they assert, gives minority refugees unrealistic expectations; worse, normative pressure for repatriation precludes the consideration of other more viable and potentially more beneficial political options for those refugees. The authors explicitly exclude from their discussion majority repatriation, which is more successful and typically based on power rather than rights. Some readers will find their conclusions controversial or at least depressing, but a serious analysis, such as this, of the possibilities of minority repatriation is needed and quite valuable.</p>

<p>Alves, Maria Helena Moreiera &amp; Philip Evanson (2011) <italic>Living in the Crossfire: Favela Residents, Drug Dealers and Police Violence in Rio de Janeiro</italic>. Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press. 272 pp. ISBN 9781439900048.</p>
<p>Moreira Alves and Evanson’s fine book discusses insecurity in Rio de Janiero but challenges reductionist ideas that favelas are synonymous with violence. They outline how <italic>favelados</italic> are caught between state and non-state belligerents fighting in urban areas and are routinely demonized in the media. What is reiterated, however, is that residents are not merely passive victims, and despite the violence that occurs, marginal urban areas can equally be places of deeply felt community which contribute to solving problems of insecurity. Important and pressing ideas are explored by interweaving oral histories and personal stories with reflections and insights into local and state politics and the legitimacy of institutions. By doing so, we come to see the resilience of urban residents, but also how institutions governing public security can be associated with violations of the rights of those they are mandated to protect. There is some discussion of the links between violence entrepreneurs and economic and political elites, which according to the authors have particularly damaging effects on democratization, the political process, and public security. This insight is crucial and deserves greater research and policy attention. The book also contributes to our understanding of the making of security policy, highlighting the need to defend equality of citizenship by ‘enforcing already existing legislation’ (p. 214). New approaches to favela securitization are also discussed, including recent successful community policing initiatives. This book speaks to important current debates regarding urban violence in Brazil and other developing democracies. The authors conclude wisely in favour of institutional development in order to remove incentives for violence, reduce insecurity and support alternative livelihoods.</p>

<p>Aradau, Claudia &amp; Rens van Munster (2011) <italic>Politics of Catastrophe: Genealogies of the Unknown</italic>. New York: Routledge. 167 pp. ISBN 9780415498098.</p>
<p>This book explores limits. Aradau and van Munster study the politics of catastrophe as a specific way of securing the future, which is situated at the limits of the knowable and expectable. They first trace how ‘unknowable’ futures such as nuclear wars, large-scale disasters, and terrorism have been rendered governable through insurance, measurements and predictions. Additionally they show how such discursive and non-discursive practices produce modes of knowledge which are accepted as unquestionably truthful and objective. Using a genealogical approach the authors unveil the underlying style of reasoning as <italic>conjectural</italic>, that is based on plausibility. Exploring recent forms of conjectural reasoning the authors also point to the ‘disavowed’ or ‘hidden’ elements of knowledge production: imagination and aesthetics. Scenarios, exercises and vigilantism campaigns are studied as governmentalized modes of the collective construction of sensorial perceptions. These modes of knowledge are not only challenged in terms of their acceptance as objective; the authors also use their exemplifications to finally ask: can the catastrophic event be rendered knowable or will it always come as a surprise? The final chapter is dedicated to this aporetic nature of the catastrophe and reveals it as hybrid. Building on Badiou, catastrophe is conceptualized as <italic>event </italic>which is not based entirely on structural logics of cause and effect since it contains elements of surprise, neither is it foreign to the situation it takes place in. Thus, politics of catastrophe do not follow logics of ‘either...or’, but ‘both...and’ (e.g. both predictable and unpredictable). This is something that those who critically engage with radical uncertainties and security maybe already assumed, but this book turns this assumption into an argument which is nicely developed and illustrated.</p>

<p>Chatty, Dawn &amp; Bill Finlayson, eds (2010) <italic>Dispossession and Displacement: Forced Migration in the Middle East and North Africa</italic>. New York: Oxford University Press. xiii + 298 pp. ISBN 9780197264591.</p>
<p>To what extent has forced migration become a defining feature of life in the Middle East and North Africa? This volume, as promised on its cover, ‘explores this question by presenting research on refugees, internally displaced peoples, as well as “those who remain”, from Afghanistan in the East to Morocco in the West’. It only covers some seven countries, however, and peculiarly includes Afghanistan in the Middle East region. Grouping the studies around four related themes – displacement, repatriation, identity in exile, refugee policy – does create a sense of order, but are these defining features of the region? Any serious attempt at answering this question would require consistently relating nation-level studies to forced migration theory and the larger region, with an eye for commonalities as well as possible idiosyncrasies, including the Palestinian refugee issue, the widely shared language and ethnicity, and artificial borders. While the introduction primarily describes the following chapters, an all-too-short epilogue presents the justification for this book: that the Middle East is a major refugee-producing region of the world and may host more than one-third of the world’s forced migrants. Even if some of these statistics are questionable, the region no doubt has an exceptionally large refugee population. This is not reflected in a leading journal such as the <italic>Journal of Refugee Studies</italic>, for instance – especially for non-Palestinians. Displacement in this region remains strangely understudied. The country-level studies in this book generally constitute valuable contributions to the literature, although some are thin on theory, and provide needed contextual knowledge of contemporary forced migration phenomena. Unfortunately, however, the sum of its parts is not much more than that.</p>

<p>Hoffman, Danny (2011) <italic>The War Machines: Young Men and Violence in Sierra Leone and Liberia.</italic> Durham, NC: Duke University Press. xxiii + 295 pp. ISBN 9780822350774.</p>
<p>Interrelated civil wars in Liberia (1989–2003) and Sierra Leone (1991–2002) have attracted much scholarly attention. Explanatory hypotheses have rested largely on numerical analysis and secondary sources. For obvious reasons (the difficulty of first-hand observation) ethnographic accounts have been harder to find. Hoffman’s book is a major contribution to this second genre. The book covers the civil defence forces in Sierra Leone and a linked Liberian militia group (Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, LURD). Hoffman describes the backgrounds and the causes of these conflicts and avoids moralization. He concentrates instead on war as work and shows that the peculiarities of a wartime division of labour shaped its own social dynamic. He is especially good at linking the civil defence ‘war machine’ to cultural ideas about psychic danger and mystical forces. But he also brings out the war–peace continuum leading war commanders and their recruits away from battle-ground looting towards more sustained and less violent productive activities (in mining, in particular). The ‘war machine’ is thereby shown to be adaptive for an otherwise jobless global periphery, something which NATO commanders wrestle with in Afghanistan. Not everybody will be enthused by his espousal of the controversial French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, but Hoffman thereby avoids the rather more obvious analytical move, of grounding what he describes in the historiography of armed groups in the Upper West African forests. The Deleuzian framework (distantly refracting some of Durkheim’s insights into the ritual dynamics of social order) is, in fact, rather effective in helping focus the reader’s attention (as Hoffman evidently intends) on war as performance. Altogether this is a superb book, and essential reading for anyone seeking to understand these two tangled and protracted conflicts.  </p>

<p>Jones, Clive &amp; Sergio Catignani, eds (2010) <italic>Israel and Hizbollah: An Asymmetric Conflict in Historical and Comparative Perspective.</italic> New York: Routledge. x + 202 pp. ISBN 9780415449106.</p>
<p>In this edited volume the various authors trace Israel’s turbulent relationship with Lebanon, and later Hizbollah, since before the inception of the state of Israel and slightly beyond the 2006 second Lebanon war. This structure, in which the first chapters are dedicated to periods before Hizbollah came into existence, is useful because it helps to explain both what circumstances created Hizbollah and how Israel historically has viewed the Lebanon from which Hizbollah was born. These two are not interchangeable, as Clive Jones demonstrates in what is arguably the book’s best chapter, ‘“A reach greater than the grasp”: Israeli intelligence and the conflict in south Lebanon 1990–2000’. Here he shows that the erroneous conceptual understanding the Israeli military had of Lebanon and Hizbollah laid the groundwork for the military losses the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and their allies in Lebanon sustained. Other chapters worth mentioning are Uri Bar-Joseph’s ‘The hubris of initial victory: The IDF and the Second Lebanon War’ and Mats Wärn’s ‘Forever at the crossroads: Hizbollah’s combined strategies of accommodation and resistance’. The strength of this edited volume is the fact that it gives a wide range of perspectives on the troublesome relationship between Israel and Hizbollah, and a wide overview of the existing literature and theories in the study of this relationship. The weakness of the book is that, with honorable exceptions, little new research is presented. It is thus a valuable resource for those readers seeking to learn a lot about the Lebanese–Israeli imbroglio while obtaining an understanding and overview of the existing literature, but it has less value for researchers already well versed in the conflict.</p>

<p>Leatherman, Janie L (2011) <italic>Sexual Violence and Armed Conflict</italic>. Cambridge: Polity.</p>
<p>Despite the recent upsurge in interest in the issue of wartime sexual violence, few books have been devoted entirely to this topic. The author seeks to understand what drives individuals to commit sexual violence by drawing on theories of constructivism and systemic factors like gender inequality and the social construction of gender and hegemonic masculinity. The chapters outline types of sexual violence, targets of such violence, and spaces where sexual violence occurs. The book concludes with a critique of neoliberal globalization, a discussion of the effects of sexual violence in armed conflict, and a discussion of the various strategies used to deal with sexual violence in armed conflict. Rather than presenting one argument, the author discusses various structural and contextual elements that are useful to consider when mapping the complexities of wartime sexual violence. This book covers a lot of ground on an important topic. However, it unfortunately suffers from some shortcomings shared by most of the literature on sexual violence. First, the focus of the book is on those cases where sexual violence has been rampant and/or important for the conflict dynamics. This does little to increase our understanding of what explains the <italic>variation</italic> in sexual violence across contexts. Second, the focus of the book is wide-ranging and could have been narrowed and concentrated more explicitly on sexual violence. Broad discussions of gender inequality, civilian victimization, and structural violence can sometimes divert attention from the main focus. Third, some parts are rather inaccessible to readers outside constructivist and feminist literatures/terminology. It is occasionally difficult to follow exactly how the author thinks the broader structural factors explain sexual violence, as questions of agency, causality, and mechanisms connecting broad phenomena to observable behaviors sometimes remain ambiguous.</p>

<p>Lebow, Richard Ned (2010) <italic>Why Nations Fight: Past and Future Motives for War</italic>. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. xii + 295 pp. ISBN 9780521192835.</p>
<p>This elegant and effortlessly thoughtful volume completes the trilogy opened by <italic>The Tragic Vision of Politics</italic> (2003), which was followed by <italic>A Cultural Theory of International Relations</italic> (2008). The key idea behind this intellectual journey is to challenge the well-established pattern of political thinking about causes of war shaped by assessments of material interests and power and to bring into focus such an immaterial and non-measurable category as culture. A short and convincingly critical overview of prevalent theories, including political realism and rational choice, paves the way for a proposition that departs from the habitual evaluation of conditions and concentrates on four generic motives: appetite, spirit, reason and fear. A date set on 94 interstate wars (from the 1648 Franco-Spanish to the 2008 Russian-Georgian) is analyzed for supporting the conclusion that spirit (honour, standing and revenge) has generated more than 70% of wars, while material gain – the key variable in Marxist and liberal conceptualizing – accounts for only 9%. It is possible to question both the typology and the interpretation of cases, but the point that ‘spirit is the principal cause of wars across the centuries’ (p. 18) cuts sharply across the habitual mental schemes connecting wars to poverty and the environment. It is uncertain whether Lebow’s argument is applicable to civil wars, but his cultural reference point is the history of ancient Greece, which was rich in conflicts of this sort. The joy of reading this book comes not only from savouring so much original thought but also from listening to how Homer and Thucydides engage in learned conversation with Bueno de Mesquita and Stephen van Evera. They concur that war is in decline and in ill-repute but is still deeply imbedded in our culture.</p>

<p>Schwartz, Stephanie (2010) <italic>Youth in Post-Conflict Reconstruction: Agents of Change</italic>. Washington, DC: United States Institute of Peace Press. xvi + 218 pp. ISBN 9781601270498.</p>
<p>Large youth cohorts, or ‘youth bulges’, have been found to increase the risk of political violence such as small-intensity armed conflict, terrorism and rioting under conditions of social, economic and political exclusion. However, youth also represent a significant economic, political and social resource, and recent research has been focusing on ways to break the general adverse relationship between youth bulges, marginalization, and political violence, and identify options for encouraging large youth cohorts to engage positively in development. To this end, Stephanie Schwartz’s book is a very welcome addition to the literature on youth and violence. Schwartz forcefully argues that we need to pay attention to the roles that youth may play in post-conflict reconstruction. Most importantly, she identifies and discusses strategies that may contribute to break the cycle of violence. The book offers a framework for analyzing youth and post-conflict reconstruction, and systematically compares three post-war societies: Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Kosovo. Schwartz discusses how domestic policy, NGO programming, international interventions, and cultural context affect young people’s role in post-conflict societies. She demonstrates how youth may be a force for positive change if they are given opportunities through demobilization and reintegration programs and initiatives to provide education and employment and support political participation. But she also warns about the potential for post-conflict instability in the absence of such opportunities. This book will help change the perception of youth being primarily a threat (or a victim) to one of youth representing an opportunity.</p>

<p>Sciubba, Jennifer Dabbs (2011) <italic>The Future Faces of War: Population and National Security</italic>. Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger. vii + 233 pp. ISBN 9780313364945.</p>
<p>The Future Faces of War provides an excellent overview of the emerging political demography field, and the multifaceted ways that population change and structure affect issues relevant to national security. Sciubba has a background both as scholar and practitioner, and an explicit aim of her book is to encourage policymakers within the security field to integrate demography into their assessments. The chapters of the book deal with various demographic aspects that have received recent attention as potential security issues. Two of the major concerns in the security establishment, particularly in the USA, have been over age structure: the challenge of large youth bulges that may feed insurgencies and terrorism in developing countries, and the diametrically opposite concern that population ageing, particularly among US allies in Europe, reduces economic growth and thus the ability to maintain a strong military capability. Sciubba deals with both in a sobering way, demonstrating the importance and relevance of demographic factors while also emphasizing the political leverages that governments have. Later chapters deal with transitional age structures (and particular challenges and opportunities that arise in countries that undergo these transitions), migration and internally displaced persons, urbanization, and other challenges such as HIV/Aids, gender imbalances (with particular relevance to India and China), and finally, differential growth rates between ethnic and religious groups. One issue which is only dealt with in passing is the neo-Malthusian concern that high population densities and strong population growth will lead to scarcity of resources like freshwater and arable land. This is defendable, however, given the limited empirical support for neo-Malthusian conflict scenarios, although the topic still resonates strongly in parts of the security establishment.</p>

<p>Selvik, Kjetil &amp; Stig Stenslie (2011) <italic>Stability and Change in the Modern Middle East</italic>. London &amp; New York: IB Tauris. xii + 292 pp. ISBN 9781848855892.</p>
<p>There is clearly an irony involved in reading a book from 2011 that presents the Middle East as a stable region in which regime change is an anomaly. This is nowhere clearer than in the conclusion, where it is stated that ‘continued regime stability seems the most likely scenario in the short term’ (p. 262). Then again, who can blame the authors? The Arab spring took almost everybody by surprise. The irony inherent in the book’s publication date does not affect its quality. It is well written and, despite its conclusion, gives the reader an in-depth understanding of why several regimes were toppled in 2011. The book is comprised of five parts: Historical background; Society and state; The quest for legitimacy; Institutions and power; and Scenarios of change. Within each of these sections one finds chapters focusing on such things as class, ethnicity, Islamism, etc. Each of these chapters contains a case study – countries put under the microscope in these include Oman, Egypt, Iran and Saudi Arabia. In total, due to all these well-presented aspects of the Middle East, the book gives the reader a broader and deeper understanding than most other the-Middle-East-in-300-pages projects. Perhaps the most important finding is that due to a lack of legitimacy, most Middle East rulers have taken to destructive survival politics, sacrificing the well-being of the state and its citizenry for the sake of regime stability. Since the book contains all the components needed to understand why the Arab spring took place, it should be no difficult task to update a revised version considering the post-spring reality.</p>

<p>Stewart, Rory &amp; Gerald Knaus (2011) <italic>Can Intervention Work?</italic> New York: WW Norton. xxvi + 236 pp. ISBN 9780393081206.</p>
<p>In <italic>Can Intervention Work? </italic>Stewart &amp; Knaus demonstrate that the answer to this question is <italic>yes</italic> and illustrate the circumstances under which successful intervention is possible. Stewart begins with the example of Afghanistan to address the reasons an intervention might fail. Here, he argues that ambiguous intervention goals expressed in buzzwords such as ‘rule of law’ or ‘an accountable state’ translate poorly into an executable plan and are a major constraint on effective intervention. This constraint is linked to an underlying problem: participants in intervention, while smart and well intentioned, are not expected to have the country-specific expertise needed to engage in contextualized, nuanced decisionmaking. Additionally, approaching intervention as a battle against ‘ideological evils’, such as communism or terrorism, forces a victory-at-any-cost mentality. A moral imperative to intervene must not extend to futile missions and we cannot be afraid to withdraw when necessary. With this in mind, Stewart contends that the solution is for country experts to reoccupy the policy space and to approach intervention with discretion. Knaus echoes and expands Stewart’s argument with examples from Bosnia. After enumerating the ways Bosnia can be considered an intervention success, Knaus demonstrates how excitement over this success led policymakers to be overconfident in the prospects for future interventions. There are lessons to be learned from Bosnia, but they have been overextended and misinterpreted. Rather than generalizing tactics, interventionists must accept limitations, apply appropriate resources, and proceed flexibly through trial and error. This book should interest policymakers and scholars of intervention. However, because the authors approach the topic ‘not as academics, but as participants’ in interventions, the resulting conversational tone also gives the book mainstream appeal.</p>

<p>Williams, Paul D (2011) <italic>War &amp; Conflict in Africa</italic>. Cambridge: Polity. xiv + 306 pp. ISBN 9780745645452.</p>
<p>One may wonder why Paul D Williams has chosen such a nondescript title and cover photo (an African soldier armed with sunglasses and a rifle) for his exceptionally succinct and useful <italic>War &amp; Conflict in Africa</italic>. The book is divided into three main sections, each dealing with an aspect of African conflicts: ‘contexts’, ‘ingredients’ and ‘responses’. The context section summarizes quantitative research on conflicts in Africa and, countering attempts to present war as exceptional, argues that armed conflict is an element in a continuous state–society interchange in an increasingly globalized world. ‘Ingredients’ encompass clusters of theories designed to explain war and conflict in Africa, including neopatrimonialism, (natural) resources, sovereignty, ethnicity, and religion. Williams subscribes to a new trend within conflict studies where analytical frameworks emphasizing political institutions and historical context is (once again) given more attention. Structural factors such as natural environment, religion and economic development are recognized as enabling factors, but not explanations per se. The last section, ‘responses’, discusses various kinds of external interventions aimed at resolving, preventing or mitigating the consequences of African conflicts: organization-building, peacemaking, peacekeeping, and aid. Williams deftly maneuvers through this minefield of moralist ideologies and paternalistic institutions. Of course, it is problematic, as also Williams acknowledges, to generalize over conflicts in such a vast and heterogeneous continent as Africa: unavoidably his analyses fit some countries better than others. <italic>War &amp; Conflict in Africa</italic> is, however, an accessible and inspirational companion for anyone who wants to survey the state of the field within this line of research.</p>

<p>Yergin, Daniel (2011) <italic>The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World</italic>. New York: Penguin. ix + 804 pp. ISBN 9781594202834.</p>
<p>The turn of global economic fortunes at the start of the second decade of the second ‘oil century’ has created the demand for rethinking many assumptions underpinning the common-sense idea of ‘energy security’ – and there is hardly an expert better equipped for this task than the author of this solid volume. A reader would be right to take for granted that it is thoroughly researched and captivatingly readable – it contains more anecdotes than figures in support of the proposition that world energy consumption will grow by 35–40% by 2030 and the mix ‘will probably be not too different from what it is today’, with hydrocarbons providing 75–80% of the overall primary demand (p. 715). This forecast might appear to be trivially conservative but every alternative energy source is examined meticulously and without prejudice, and the climate change theme is re-explored with greater attention than in most current analyses, where it has become distinctly passé. Yergin disproves the evergreen speculations about the ‘peak oil’ and shortages of supply and is not particularly concerned about price volatility, but he takes seriously the challenge of replacing coal – the dirtiest and cheapest fuel – with natural gas, expecting the ‘shale gas’ revolution to spread from the USA to China. He gives the benefit of the doubt to the electric car, but has no doubt at all that the production of electricity is the fastest growing and most demanding issue in the energy complex. The geopolitics of oilfields and gas pipelines has lost much of its explosive power, with the significant exception of Iran, and the pundits of this shrinking quasi-science will play with their ‘power vacuums’ on the margins of politics of technological breakthroughs.</p>
