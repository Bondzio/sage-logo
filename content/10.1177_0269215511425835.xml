<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To evaluate the effect of different intensities of aerobic exercise on elderly people with mild cognitive impairment.</p>
<p><bold>Design</bold>: A randomized trial.</p>
<p><bold>Setting</bold>: Residential care homes for elderly people.</p>
<p><bold>Subjects</bold>: Forty-eight patients were included in the study.</p>
<p><bold>Interventions</bold>: The patients were randomized in three groups. Group A performed aerobic exercise at 40% of heart rate reserve, group B did the same at 60% and group C carried out recreational activities. The duration of the study was three months.</p>
<p><bold>Main measures</bold>: Cognitive level and functional ability were assessed by means of the Mini Mental State Examination and the Timed Up and Go test before the intervention, at the end of it and three months later as a follow-up.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: After completion of the aerobic training programme, the patients’ Mini Mental State Examination scores improved marginally (group A from 19.8 ± 5.1 to 20.6 ± 7.3; group B from 20.8 ± 4.6 to 21 ± 5.4). A similar trend was observed for the Timed Up and Go test scores (group A from 18.8 ± 5.3 to 18.5 ± 5 seconds; group B from 15.4 ± 4.2 to 14.3 ± 5.1 seconds). However, no statistically significant differences were found at any time during the evaluation regarding cognitive level and functional autonomy among the three groups.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: In this pilot study, intensity does not seem to be a determining factor when aerobic exercise is performed by people with mild cognitive impairment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mild cognitive impairment is known as the limit between normal ageing and dementia, characterizing elderly people with cognitive decline, but with normal global operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511425835">1</xref></sup> The widely accepted current diagnostic algorithm for this neurological disorder differentiates two main subtypes of mild cognitive impairment: amnestic (including memory impairment) and non-amnestic (non-memory cognitive domains impaired). Both subtypes can affect one single or multiple domains (language, executive function, visuospatial skills, etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511425835">2</xref></sup> It is known that not all patients with mild cognitive impairment deteriorate to dementia, and some of them even appear to improve over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511425835">3</xref></sup> However, as an early pathological condition, mild cognitive impairment has sufficient specificity to lead to more severe dementing disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511425835">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>A recent meta-analysis showed that patients with mild cognitive impairment evolve to dementia at rates of approximately 10% per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511425835">5</xref></sup> and it is estimated that approximately 15% of them develop Alzheimer’s disease every year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511425835">6</xref></sup> Because of this, researchers have become deeply interested both in identifying mild cognitive impairment risk factors (which help them to elaborate prevention therapies), and in developing new rehabilitation strategies which both reduce treatment costs and have positive effects on the illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511425835">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Physical exercise has been regarded as a useful non-pharmacological intervention strategy, capable of improving memory and executive functions in older people with mild cognitive impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511425835">8</xref></sup> In this regard, it has been stated that exercise could modify the risk factors and pathological mechanisms associated with cognitive impairment and it might even delay its onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511425835">9</xref></sup> Exercise-induced hypertrophy of the hippocampus (which would protect from neuronal degeneration), and exercise-induced production of growth factors (which would enhance neurogenesis) seem to be responsible for the aforementioned positive effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511425835">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although several studies have shown that exercise has beneficial effects on mild cognitive impairment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511425835">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511425835"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511425835">13</xref></sup> no specific parameters for an appropriate prescription in these populations have so far been established. This is especially evident concerning the duration, intensity and type of activity. For instance, although aerobic training has been shown to have some beneficial effects in patients with mild cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511425835">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511425835">15</xref></sup> the degree of exercise intensity level that enhances or reduces its therapeutic properties is not known.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511425835">7</xref></sup> Usually, the proposed training interventions do not offer objective information about the exercise intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511425835">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511425835">16</xref></sup> and the relevance of variations in it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511425835">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511425835">17</xref></sup> This suggests that more information is needed regarding the influence of this parameter on the prescription of aerobic exercise in this population. In fact, it has been recently stated that more controlled studies are needed to establish a protocol of recommendations regarding the systemization of exercise necessary to produce benefits in the cognitive functioning in older people with mild cognitive impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511425835">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, in this context, we aimed to find out the effects of two different intensity levels of aerobic exercise on mild cognitive impairment patients. We set out to provide information that will help to set suitable parameters for an adequate prescription of physical exercise in this kind of population.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269215511425835">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Participants in this study were recruited through a collaboration agreement between the University of Vigo (Spain) and Geriatros S.A, a company for the management of residential care homes for the elderly. Individuals who met the following criteria were included: (a) confirmed clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment according to the consensus of the Spanish Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511425835">18</xref></sup> (b) older than 65 years old, (c) able to stand and walk for 30 m without shortness of breath, (d) independent of the assistance of another person for walking safely, (e) residing in care homes for the elderly throughout Galicia (Spain). Grounds for exclusion were suffering from other pathologies which hindered or prevented the practice of aerobic physical exercise as well as the participation in evaluation tests.</p>
<p>All the participants and their families were previously informed about the characteristics of the aerobic exercise programme. The study was approved by the University of Vigo Ethics Committee and all participants gave their informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269215511425835">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The duration of the study was six months. The first three months were dedicated to the intervention and the last three months to the follow-up. Three groups were created: groups A and B performed aerobic exercise at different intensity levels, while group C did not exercise but carried out recreational activities instead (playing cards, reading newspapers, handicrafts).</p>
<p>With the aim of improving the comparability of the groups the sample was distributed in four strata. This distribution was according to their age and whether they were taking or not taking acetylcholine inhibitors. The patients were randomly allocated from each stratum to the intervention groups. Although the expected effect of the medicine is reduced we decided to take this fact into account when stratifying. Participants were intended to be randomized using a 2:1 ratio to aerobic exercise (for both intensities) or recreational activities.</p>
<p>Groups A and B carried out the same aerobic exercise programme except that exercise intensity was set at 40% of participant’s heart rate reserve (maximum heart rate–resting heart rate) in the first group, while in the second one they exercised at 60% of it. Exercise intensity was calculated through Karvonen’s formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511425835">19</xref></sup> Age-predicted maximal heart rate was estimated by means of the proposed formula put forward by Tanaka et al. for sedentary men and women (211–0.8 × age).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511425835">20</xref></sup> Resting heart rate was measured for a full minute early in the morning after the patient got out of bed.</p>
<p>The exercise programme consisted of three 30-minute sessions a week, supervised by a physiotherapist while the patient exercised individually. The training included a 5-minute warm-up session, 20 minutes of cycling in a recumbent bike at the established intensity for each group and a 5-minute stretching routine to cool down. Heart rate was measured by means of an ergonomic hand pulse sensor that registered the patient’s thumb pulse and reflected it on a screen placed in the middle of the handlebars.</p>
<p>Before the beginning of the intervention, two weeks were dedicated to familiarizing the participants with the exercise routine and the recumbent bike. Cycling time was gradually increased from the first sessions in order to reach 20 minutes of continuous exercise per session.</p>
<p>The sample’s levels of cognitive deterioration and functional autonomy were assessed one week before starting the training programme, at the end of it (12 weeks later) and after the follow-up (six months since the intervention started). All the measurements were carried out by the same team of experts (a neurologist and a physiotherapist) who were familiar with the following tests and who were also blinded to group allocation. Cognitive deterioration was assessed through personal face-to-face interviews by means of the Spanish-adapted version of the Mini Mental State Examination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511425835">21</xref></sup> This tool is composed of 13 elements divided into five sections which represent different cognitive domains (orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, language and copying). Maximum possible score was 35 points.</p>
<p>Once the Mini Mental State Examination was fulfilled, patients’ functional autonomy was assessed by means of the Timed Up and Go test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511425835">22</xref></sup> This test measures the time required for an individual to stand up from a chair with armrests, walk 3 m, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down. Participants performed the task twice: one practice run and the test after resting for 1 minute. Testing took place at each care home facilities.</p>
<p>The adherence to the programme was calculated as the percentage of the total number of sessions that each participant attended during the intervention. The criterion for valid attendance was set up at 70% (that is, 23 out of the 33 possible sessions)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511425835">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511425835">23</xref></sup> in order to guarantee a minimum weekly practice. Those participants who did not reach the established percentage were excluded from the data analysis.</p>
<p>In order to estimate whether this programme and its intensity determined the results obtained in cognitive deterioration and functional autonomy, an analysis of variance was carried out. The training programme showing the greater differences in the analysed variables was identified through a post-hoc analysis (Newman–Keuls Test). An intention-to-treat analysis was used to address the effects of the intervention on all the patients whether or not they completed the study, provided that enough data were available. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical significance was assumed at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Out of the 68 participants who volunteered for the study, two died, three left for medical reasons and 15 were excluded due to insufficient adherence to the programme. Therefore, the final sample that completed the study was composed of 48 participants (21 men and 27 women) with a mean age of 78.3 ± 9.5 years, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511425835">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The obtained results show that after the intervention the average score in the Mini Mental State Examination of groups A and B increased slightly, while the total time needed to carry out the Timed Up and Go decreased. However, no statistically significant differences were found at any time during the evaluation regarding cognitive level and functional autonomy among the three groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511425835">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study shows that there is no difference between the effects of three months of aerobic training whether it is prescribed at a low or at a moderate intensity, over cognitive decline and functional autonomy in elderly people with mild cognitive impairment. Both exercise interventions seemed to have slowed cognitive deterioration slightly and somehow improved functional level. Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed between the effects of these training programmes and the effects of recreational activities.</p>
<p>One important fact that should be discussed is the low initial mean score obtained by the three groups on the Mini Mental State Examination, which could lead us to think that some of the participants already had dementia. Following the recommendations for geriatric assessment on mild cognitive impairment populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511425835">24</xref></sup> the cut-off point was set at ≤23 points because the sample comprised home-care residents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511425835">25</xref></sup> Furthermore, given that most of the patients came from a rural setting and had a low cultural background, the cut-off had to be lowered to 20 in some cases in order to make an accurate assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511425835">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511425835">26</xref></sup> Thus, although the clinical diagnosis was carried out carefully, it could be that some of the patients presented a mild or moderate dementia level.</p>
<p>The number of studies that employ physical activity as a therapy in people with cognitive deterioration is on the rise these days. Nevertheless, the existing evidence is somewhat controversial when it comes to determination of the beneficial effects that physical exercise can have on this neurocognitive disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511425835">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>In fact the results of our study add to this controversy. On the one hand, they concur with the results of Fan Yu et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511425835">17</xref></sup> who proved that although cycling is an aerobic exercise modality that can be successfully performed by these populations, its beneficial effects are yet unclear. On the other hand, the absence of significant differences among the analysed groups is a somewhat surprising fact and in clear contradiction to what has been established by other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511425835">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511425835">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511425835">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>One possible explanation for this situation could be found in the training protocol proposed. In our study, many patients did not reach the average of three sessions per week, which could have been insufficient for getting the adequate stimulus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511425835">5</xref></sup> Therefore, this would have prevented them from achieving a significant change in the performance measures. In addition, the specific duration of the aerobic stimulus may not have been appropriate, especially at the beginning of the programme. Indeed, during the first stage of the study, the participants experienced some difficulties in cycling at a continuous and steady pace during the prescribed time. This problem was not overcome until the last weeks of the intervention, when the patients were able to cycle continuously by themselves. These conditions regarding frequency and stimulus duration suggest that the degree of physical intensity in the employed training protocol might have been insufficient to obtain the expected results from the sample. Baker et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511425835">29</xref></sup> did achieve some positive results from the application of aerobic exercise to this kind of population. However, the physical training proposed was longer, more intense and more frequent. Furthermore, according to Kashihara et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511425835">30</xref></sup> the beneficial effects of aerobic exercise on cognitive ability can only be achieved through a level of intensity which is closer to the anaerobic threshold. Thus, it seems that the accurate exercise intensity should be higher than the one used in the protocol of the present study.</p>
<p>We found no remarkable differences regarding the results of performing exercise at low or moderate intensity. However, the group that exercised at higher intensity did show greater improvement, expressed in percentages. This finding concurs with other studies that propose the idea that populations with mild cognitive impairment obtain greater benefits from exercise if it is practised at moderate intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511425835">31</xref></sup> Perhaps the small size of our sample has made it difficult to ascertain greater differences in the obtained results. In this regard, power analysis shows that 177 participants would be necessary to detect a difference of 20% in this study (90% improvement in the aerobic groups vs. 70% improvement in the recreational activity group; power = 0.80; α = 0.05). A total number of 594 participants would be needed to detect a difference of 10% (90% vs. 80%) between the exercise and the non-exercise groups.</p>
<p>Although ‘moderate intensity’ is not an agreed upon concept and varies according to the different authors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511425835">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511425835">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511425835">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511425835">31</xref></sup> our results confirm that low-intensity aerobic exercises facilitate adherence to training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511425835">15</xref></sup> This could be due to the fact that it is easier to incorporate into the daily routines of community-dwelling people with mild cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is worth noting that the variations in both cognitive and functional autonomy levels were quite similar in the three groups of participants. The absence of differences regarding the cognitive aspect may be explained by the fact that the activities carried out by patients in group C (who attended all sessions) involved mainly cognitive abilities, therefore they may have provided some kind of memory training. In fact, activities of the kind proposed for this group have been shown to have similar effects to exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511425835">32</xref></sup> We also consider the possibility that the intervention period was too short (only three months) to allow the identification of significant changes in cognitive function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511425835">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>As far as the lack of differences in functional autonomy is concerned, explanations are more complex to provide. On the one hand, the test used to evaluate this aspect may not have been efficacious in terms of discrimination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511425835">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215511425835">34</xref></sup> Complementary physical assessment tests would have provided our study with the necessary solidity. On the other hand, research has shown that low-intensity activities have not produced important effects on functional autonomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511425835">7</xref></sup> This fact gives support to the idea that the employed training workload was too short to show significant results. In this regard, more research is needed.</p>
<p>The findings of our study should be interpreted within the context of the following limitations. First, certain problems of internal validity, mainly the small sample size, limited the statistical power analysis. Also the lack of compliance with the exercise programme, alongside the difficulty in reaching a minimum length of time of continuous cycling during the first weeks of the intervention, could reduce the effect of the proposed aerobic stimulus. Finally, given the low average score on the Mini Mental State Examination, and the difficulty related to the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, the possibility that some of the patients could already have dementia cannot be ruled out. This could affect the homogeneity of the sample.</p>
<p>In summary, a slight trend towards slowing cognitive decline and improving functional autonomy was observed after three months of aerobic training in elderly people with mild cognitive impairment. Exercise intensity, whether set at a low or at moderate level, does not seem to have any influence on the results obtained. Given all that, mild cognitive impairment patients may need higher intensity exercise programmes in order to obtain greater benefits from physical activity. Further research, including bigger samples, longer interventions and more frequent exercise sessions, is needed.</p>
