<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Few prospective epidemiological studies on soccer match injuries have collected continuous data using subjects from the same group.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose</bold>: To investigate long-term injury-induced changes during official matches in the professional Japanese soccer league.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Descriptive epidemiological study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Acute injuries during official matches among top-division Japanese professional soccer leaguers were prospectively collected from 1993 to 2007. Injuries preventing player participation for 7 days or more were defined as a reportable injury. Interseasonal variations of injury rate (IR: injuries/1000/player hours) and injury pattern (type, location, circumstances, severity, injury time, positional role, and relationship to weather) were analyzed.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Throughout the study period, 2947 injuries from 3984 matches occurred. Mean annual IR was 21.77/1000 player hours, and annual variance showed gradual decrement throughout the study period. The proportion of injury type and location were not significantly changed. Sprain and contusion as injury type and thigh and ankle joint as location were the most common in every season. Contact-related injuries comprised 73.3% on average and were observed to occur more frequently during the last 15 minutes and extra time of match play. The proportion of foul play–related injuries showed a clear declining trend. The proportion of severe injury showed a sporadic increase from 2001 to 2004. The second, fifth, and sixth 15-minute match segments showed a higher IR. Goalkeepers had a lower IR versus other field players. Matches on rainy days resulted in a lower IR than did those held under other weather conditions.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Long-term surveillance and statistical feedback of injury characteristics to organization members were considered effective in improving safer play awareness among players and for referees to reduce injury incidence, particularly foul play–related injuries.</p>

<p>Active player membership of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) exceeds 270 million as of 2006 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fifa.com">fifa.com</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Increasing international popularity of soccer has led to several epidemiological studies focusing on the incidence of injury under various playing circumstances (training/competition), playing levels, ages, and gender.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546512438695">**</xref> Such studies have estimated injury incidence as higher among professionals versus amateurs and as higher in competition than during training. Various authors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363546512438695">††</xref></sup> have indicated that incidence levels of injury risk during both competition and training among professional soccer players typically range from 16.6/1000 to 34.8/1000 playing hours in competition and 2.1/1000 to 5.9/1000 playing hours during training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512438695">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512438695">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most previous studies focused primarily on match injuries in professional soccer and were limited to short-term domestic league competitions or international tournaments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512438695">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438695">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512438695">18</xref></sup> Long-term data include a report by Elias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512438695">11</xref></sup> reporting 10 years of follow-up data on injuries in under 12 to 19 year old male and female players of the USA Cup soccer team. Although targeting a younger player population, the study covered a wide range of soccer-related injuries incurred during matches. Ekstrand et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438695">9</xref></sup> reported changes in injury pattern among 23 teams in the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) League for 7 consecutive seasons and concluded they were stable during that period. Carling et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512438695">4</xref></sup> reported on injuries during official competition in a prospective study on teams belonging to the French League 1 over 4 seasons. Their study indicated no change in injury incidence during this period but stressed the importance of injury data collection through continuous seasons. In these studies, however, not all teams presented injury data over the entire study period,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438695">9</xref></sup> or only major competitions were subject to the study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512438695">4</xref></sup> To date, no single long-term prospective epidemiological study has been carried out analyzing all official match injuries, including every club within a national-level professional soccer league, based on injury information provided by team physicians using standardized methods, criteria, and categorization for over a decade.</p>
<p>In accordance with the worldwide increasing popularity of soccer, the Japan Football Association (JFA) established its professional soccer league, Japan Professional Football League (J-League), in 1993. Initiated with only 10 club teams, the J-League gradually increased this number and in 1999 established a second division. They were divided and categorized into the First (J-1) and Second (J-2) Divisions. From the inaugural season, the J-League introduced a match regulation mandating team physicians to report all significant acute injuries occurring during official matches to the J-League.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to estimate (1) how injury patterns have changed and (2) how an official injury reporting system affected reduction in long-term injury incidence via epidemiological injury analysis over 15 consecutive seasons in the J-1 Professional Football League.</p>

<title>Subjects and Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0363546512438695">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>This study includes all reportable acute injuries that occurred during official J-1 League matches over 15 consecutive seasons, from 1993 to 2007.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512438695">
<title>Injury Reporting System and Data Collection</title>
<p>Every reportable injury was documented by team physicians (primarily orthopaedic surgeons) on an injury report form (Appendix 1, available in the online version of this article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/">http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/</ext-link>), 1 per injured player after every match. All documented data were received and collected by the J-League within 1 week of injury. This document-based reporting and data collection system and report form have remained relatively unchanged and uninterrupted for more than 15 years, since the very first season until 2007, allowing information to remain available for complete analyses. In 2008, the injury reporting system adopted the F-MARC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512438695">23</xref></sup> report form and was excluded from this analysis.</p>
<p>To maintain reliability throughout the survey period, the J-League Medical Committee met regularly with team physicians before each season to clarify and emphasize the purpose of the system and unify injury definitions and injury criteria. Statistically analyzed annual injury data containing injury incidence, type, location, circumstance of injuries, time of injury, positional difference, and influence of weather on injury occurrence were fed back to team physicians and the J-League annually with recommendations for the promotion of safer and fairer play from a medical perspective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512438695">
<title>Definition of Reportable Injuries, Severity Grading, and Terminology</title>
<p>Reportable acute injuries were defined as those that occurred during matches as a result of play, required attention by a team physician, and resulted in full abstinence from soccer performance for 7 days or more after injury irrespective of team training or match schedules.</p>
<p>Following a meeting of all team physicians in March 1993, a consensus was reached whereby loss of 7 days of sporting time was set as the cutoff period for reportable injury. The decision to make invalid the loss of sporting time from 0 to &lt;7 days was principally to avoid any bias that could arise from independent physician judgment or team circumstances. A 1-week sporting time loss was considered by all team physicians as the most reliable interdoctor cutoff period. Hereinafter, <italic>injury</italic> in this report does not mean all injuries but only refers to reportable injuries.</p>
<p>Injury was graded into 3 levels of severity based on length of absence from play: mild, absence from play for at least 1 week but less than 2 weeks; moderate, absence from play from 2 to 4 weeks; and severe, absence from play for more than 4 weeks. Definitions for reportable injury and severity grading were identical to those used by Junge et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512438695">21</xref></sup> and not the Consensus Statement of Football Injuries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512438695">12</xref></sup> or any other reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512438695">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438695">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438695">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512438695">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512438695">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512438695">19</xref></sup> Team doctors were mandated to report any difference in the days absent until return to full play when different from that first reported to the J-League. Hence, days absent reported in this study are actual and not an estimated figure.</p>
<p>Please note that in this study, injury severity grading was altered after reevaluating days of absence from participating play recorded in the original injury report (Appendix 1, available online). Reinjury was defined as repetition of the same reportable injury at the same location within a 3-month period and reported as an additional comment during diagnosis in the report form.</p>
<p>As the aim of this surveillance was to distinguish the epidemiological status of match injuries from one professional soccer league, injuries sustained during training or national team matches were not included. The same criteria were adapted by Carling et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512438695">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Actual exposure time was based on J-League records. Before 2002, J-1 match winners were determined by the golden goal method. Teams scored their first goal during extra time (two 15-minute half sessions) or, if the game remained goalless after both periods of extra time, a penalty shoot-out determined the winner. It was not until 2003 that all matches ended after the regular 90-minute session, regardless of score. Actual playing time from 1993 to 2002 therefore included extra time (not 90 minutes × number of matches). Time taken when referees stopped the watch for an accident was not included in actual play time.</p>
<p>Injury circumstances included information on whether the injury was related to contact/foul play. Contact play was defined as contact with another player or object, whereas foul play was determined by the referee, when play was periodically stopped and either a free kick or penalty kick was given to the opponent’s team. Time of injury was determined by the team doctors, when play was interrupted by the referee for intervention. Weather conditions during each match were based on official data by the J-League. Air temperature on match day was not evaluated, as no records on ground temperature were available.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512438695">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>When analyzing data, minor provisions were made regarding classification of acute traumatic injury type and location from originally collected data to adopt recommendations of the Injury Consensus Group of the FIFA Medical Assessment and Research Centre.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512438695">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data were analyzed on an annual basis for injury rate, injury type, location, severity, and circumstances. The relationships between time of injury, position, and weather conditions were analyzed by using the sum value of total seasons. Time of injury was divided into 15-minute segments. Positions were not analyzed separately (as individual fielder positions) but as a category, including field players (FPs) and goalkeepers (GKs), because recently play during a match is not always clearly differentiated by position. All J-League matches were played on natural grass turf. Although the relationship between weather and injury incidence was analyzed, turf conditions were not included, as insufficient reliable evaluation criteria (grading of smooth or rough surface) for the first 7 seasons were available.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512438695">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Incidence of injuries (injury rate, IR) was expressed as injuries per 1000 player hours together with the 95% confidence interval (CI).</p>
<p>Analysis involved Poisson regression for injury rates, multinomial logistic regression for annual changes of injury type and location, ordered logistic regression for injury severity, and logistic regression for proportion of injuries that resulted from contact or foul play. For each regression, pairwise multiple comparisons between years (or match periods) were made. Comparison of IR on the relationship between position and weather was expressed as the injury rate ratio (IRR) using the method by Dawson-Saunders and Trapp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512438695">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>A difference of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Injury Incidence and Patterns</title>
<p>Previous studies have reported time loss injury incidences during professional soccer matches as ranging from 40 injuries/1000 player hours to 20 injuries/1000 player hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512438695">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438695">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512438695">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512438695">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512438695">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512438695">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512438695">37</xref></sup> Total IR during competitions in various studies, however, has varied widely, with annual values ranging from 19.11 to 24.37/1000 player hours in our study. These results, however, may be considered acceptable should the difference of reportable injury definition be taken into account.</p>
<p>On the long-term trend of injury incidence and profile, Ekstrand et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438695">9</xref></sup> followed changes of injury patterns in European professional football clubs in the same subjects for 7 consecutive seasons (2001-2008), whereas Carling et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512438695">4</xref></sup> compared injury incidences sustained during official matches across four seasons (2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008, and 2008-2009). Both studies reported injury incidence as stable.</p>
<p>Different from previous reports, the long-term overall IR trend for each season in our study exhibited a gradual decline in all injury rates over several years without any proportional change in injury pattern. There were no match rule changes during 15 seasons, so the significant reasons behind this phenomenon remain uncertain. We tend to believe, however, that this reduction tendency may stem more from the educational consequences of the annual data feedback system not only to team physicians but to all club teams, players, match coordinators, J-League office, and referee committee members. This feedback system further stresses the importance of safer play, resulting in the long-term reduction of injury incidence, particularly foul-related injuries.</p>
<p>A remarkable finding of our study remains that the number of reinjuries was small. According to our definition of reportable injury, minor injuries preventing players from participating in soccer practice for less than 7 days were not reported. Repetition of such nonreportable injuries was therefore not reported. Only significant injuries occurring after nonreportable minor injuries would be judged as reinjury based on the comments of the team physician. We stress, however, the ability of our reporting system to spot significant injuries subsequent to minor injuries that could predict minor injuries as a risk factor to future significant injury.</p>
<p>With regard to injury type and location during professional soccer matches, results of previous studies showed no difference. Common injury types were sprain, strain, and contusions, and common sites of injury were the ankle, knee, and thigh, although some changes in frequency order were present.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363546512438695">‡‡</xref></sup></p>
<p>Injury patterns in our study showed common injuries to be sprain, contusion, and muscle strain. Higher injury incidences were found anatomically in the ankle, knee, and thigh. These profiles of injury pattern and location were stable throughout the study period and were generally compatible with previous reports. The proportion of concussion within head/neck injuries in our study (8.7%) was same as that of a report by Fuller et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512438695">13</xref></sup> (8% in men) that focused on head and neck injuries. A significantly different finding in our study is the higher percentage of lacerations compared with previous studies, despite the exclusion of minor injuries in our study’s reportable injury criteria. We assumed that absent days until full play were judged by team physicians and that players were not allowed to resume full play until the laceration had completely healed, or at least until the removal of sutures, although this may depend on the injured location.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0363546512438695">
<title>Injury Definition and Method of Data Collection</title>
<p>Many authors struggle to define <italic>injury</italic>, particularly reportable injury and its severity. If defined as any injury resulting from soccer play, minor abrasions, even blisters, would be included, reducing data reliability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512438695">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, <italic>injury</italic> has broadly been defined as any injury resulting from soccer that incapacitates players from full participation in imminent training or matches.</p>
<p>However, bear in mind that decisions on length of absence from play, from 0 to a couple of days, have not always been decided from merely a medical standpoint but could include team situations or, in certain cases, a physician’s individual judgment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512438695">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Defining reportable injuries was of greatest concern at the initiation of the J-League.</p>
<p>The present reporting system was established after complete agreement from club teams and team physicians. The decision to define reportable injuries as injuries preventing players from soccer participation for at least 7 days or more was employed to maintain accuracy, secure reliability of data collection, and minimize influence of interdoctor variances. This definition was identical to that of Junge et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512438695">21</xref></sup> All things considered, the most crucial purpose of the J-League injury report system was to keep track of how often and under what circumstances significant injuries occurred, as well as how such injury might be reduced to prevent players from extended absence from soccer play. Hence, minor injuries preventing players from playing for less than 1 week were excluded from mandatory reporting.</p>
<p>We are aware that because of limitations of our reportable injury criteria, absence from play for 7 days or more, excluding certain minor injuries, comprised more than 50% to 80% of all injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438695">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512438695">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512438695">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512438695">17</xref></sup> A previous study reported that such minor injuries should not be neglected as they may lead to more serious manifestations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512438695">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Taking into consideration the limitation mentioned above, we considered our reporting system as otherwise including all significant injuries worthy of injury analysis because complete criteria agreement of reportable injury was obtained by all team physicians. As mentioned earlier, the fundamental purpose of an annually based injury analysis database, including injury incidence and such circumstances (contact and foul play), was to provide conclusive feedback to all soccer-related personnel and instill the importance of safer and fairer play, thereby establishing a strategy to reduce the risk of significant injuries during matches. We are confident that data exclusion of such minor injuries will not affect the reliability and value of this study.</p>
<p>There are many reports on injury incidence during both matches and training. Several such reports, however, depend on data reported not only by physicians but also by athletic trainers, physical therapists, or other nonmedical professional staff. Collection of medically precise injury information, based even on restricted criteria, was considered more valuable versus a large number of cases without precise injury information (quality vs quantity).</p>
<p>A particularly significant feature of our study lies in the fact that data herein have all been reported only by J-League team physicians (primarily orthopaedic surgeons), using the same reporting system for 15 years. Reliability, including precise diagnosis, location, injury circumstance, days absent from play, and any necessary treatment, was determined employing standardized criteria.</p>

<sec id="section19-0363546512438695">
<title>Contact and Foul Play</title>
<p>Soccer is a sport with much collision during play, most obviously during matches. Dvorak et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438695">7</xref></sup> reported that 73% of injuries that occurred during the 2002 and 2006 World Cups were associated with contact play and that 50% to 60% of contact-related injuries were caused by foul play. In our study, contact injuries represented more than 70%, with 20% of all injuries associated with foul play. The proportion of contact-related injuries was stable throughout these 15 consecutive seasons. The difference between our study and previous studies, however, was that foul play–related injuries showed a gradual declining tendency. We believe that this tendency has resulted from a positive effect of the annual feedback system to teams, players, doctors, and J-League officials.</p>

<title>Injury Severity</title>
<p>In most previous studies, injury severity was defined according to days absent from play. Various severity grading systems have been reported, where inclusion criteria of severity grade with respect to the cutoff line for days absent differed from study to study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0363546512438695">§§</xref></sup> We used the same severity grading system of Junge et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512438695">21</xref></sup> as the definition of reportable injury was identical to their study.</p>
<p>It might not be useful to compare proportion of injury severity with previous studies. Dvorak et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438695">7</xref></sup> reported that 78% of all injuries reported during the 2006 World Cup in Germany were minor or slight, preventing players from full participation for 1 to 7 days. The percentage of severe injuries in our study ranged from 3.8% to 22.8%, higher than in other studies, and showed no significant difference during the observation period, except for a sporadic increase from 2001 to 2004. At a consensus meeting with team doctors before each season, we noticed the hesitation of several doctors to allow players to resume full play, particularly in recent years, adding that return to play was by no means allowed until full rehabilitation was completed. Hence, the proportion of severe injuries has increased in recent years. If minor injuries were included as reportable injuries, the total proportion of injury severity in this study would be reduced. From 2001 to 2004, was there a dip in the severity proportion only in 2002. The J-League match schedules were changed during the World Cup Korea/Japan 2002, and we believe players made additional efforts to play safer and fairer during this period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0363546512438695">
<title>Time of Injury</title>
<p>Certain studies have reported a relationship between match time and injury occurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438695">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512438695">17</xref></sup> These studies reported that more injuries occurred during the second half or toward the end of both halves. Ekstrand et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438695">9</xref></sup> speculated that this may be a result of player fatigue. Hawkins et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512438695">19</xref></sup> compared the injury incidence between 45-minute halves and 15-minute segments and reported no significant difference between the first and second halves but between each 15-minute segment. We analyzed the relationship between time at injury and injury incidence by dividing the match into 15-minute segments. Rahnama et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512438695">33</xref></sup> reported the initial 15-minute segment of each half as having the highest amount of mild injuries and the last 15-minute segment as having the highest amount of moderate injuries. There was no significant difference in the actual number of injuries per period among the six 15-minute segments.</p>
<p>Many previous studies reported different results. Observations from our study indicate that the second 15-minute segment and last two 15-minute segments in the second half had a significantly higher IR. We also attribute the higher incidence of injury during these 3 intervals to player fatigue. The incidence of contact-related injury was higher during the last 15 minutes and extra time. Despite higher IR and contact-related injuries during specific intervals, no significant differences were found regarding injury incidence of foul play–related injuries. Although playing attitude among players was not analyzed, the possibility that players might be more aggressive during those intervals should be considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0363546512438695">
<title>Positional Role</title>
<p>The relationship between position and injury occurrence has been reported in several studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0363546512438695">‖‖</xref></sup> Positional classification of players, including the GK, was made with no variance. Only Sandelin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512438695">34</xref></sup> reported less severe injuries among GKs. Results of other studies showed no significant difference among positions or a higher IR between midfielders and defenders. In previous studies, only comparison of IR was reported, not type, location, or circumstances. We assumed that a larger difference in playing role during matches existed only between GKs and FPs. We focused on the relationship between positional role and injury type and their circumstances using 2 broad groups: FPs and GKs. In our study, GKs showed a clear trend for low values in overall injury, except injuries around the head and face during contact play. Based on difference of playing characteristics between GKs and FPs, the same injury did not result in the same severity, and hence we did not compare injury severity between GKs and FPs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0363546512438695">
<title>Relationship With Weather</title>
<p>Certain extrinsic factors, particularly ground surface and weather conditions influencing the shoe-surface interface, are alleged to be associated with occurrence of injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512438695">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512438695">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512438695">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512438695">38</xref></sup> Currently, only 1 study, by Azubuike and Okojie,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512438695">2</xref></sup> has reported the relationship between injury occurrence and weather. Their study reported that more injuries (78.9%) occurred on sunny or hot days, and they concluded that there was a significant association between weather conditions and injury occurrence. The mention of high injury percentage on sunny days, however, is insufficient to estimate weather influence, as no clear data on proportion of weather conditions during the study period were provided.</p>
<p>Our study estimated a lower IR on rainy days versus other weather conditions. We speculate that this stems from softening of the pitch in rainy weather, as speculated by Azubuike and Okojie.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512438695">2</xref></sup> Caution should be exerted, however, when judging the significance of weather and its influence on the occurrence of injury because no grounds for a lower IR under rainy conditions have been ascertained. Ground surface, nevertheless, is influenced by weather condition. Ground surface conditions were not included in the analysis of injury incidence, as no objective or highly interobserver reliable evaluation method for surface conditions is available yet. We did not analyze the influence of air temperature, as the J-League recorded only the maximum temperature local area at kickoff, not temperature on the ground or the stadium during the match. Until recently, weather conditions were not clearly proved to have any strong influence on the occurrence of injury during matches.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0363546512438695">
<title>Importance of Long-Term Injury Surveillance</title>
<p>The most significant implication of our injury surveillance system is not only injury data collection but also the annual feedback on characteristic data to all team physicians, team and J-League officials, and referees. By bringing about a higher awareness of the incidence and circumstances surrounding such injury to all members of the soccer community, we believe that the league was able to confront this high proportion of injury rate and high rate of contact/foul-related injuries. Setting aside medical recommendations for safer and fairer play, we note a self-initiated awareness stimulated by availability of such data. Needless to say, such awareness can only link to the reduction of foul-related injury from a long-term perspective. We once again stress here the efficacy of long-term injury surveillance and feedback system of the data.</p>
