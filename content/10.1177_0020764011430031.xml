<sec id="section1-0020764011430031">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Acculturation is the phenomenon that results when a group with one culture comes into continuous contact with a host culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0020764011430031">
<title>Aims:</title>
<p>To investigate the correlation between acculturation and psychotic symptomatology in a group of immigrants suffering from psychosis and to explore differences in demographic factors related with the acculturation process between individuals with and without psychosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0020764011430031">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Sixty-five patients and 317 non-psychotic immigrants were interviewed using the Immigrant Acculturation Scale (IAS) and a structured questionnaire for demographic data. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) were also administered to all immigrants suffering from psychosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020764011430031">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Total IAS scores, as well as IAS everyday life scores, were positively correlated with GAF scores. IAS everyday life score in the patient group related with religion, marital status, gender and years in Greece, while in the non-psychosis group it was related with gender and years in Greece. IAS wishful orientation/<italic>nostos</italic> (the strong desire for one’s homeland) related with religion in both groups. The IAS identity in the psychosis group did not show any significant relation with any of the variables, while in the non-patient group, it was related with marital status, gender and years in Greece. Age, duration of residence in Greece and higher adoption of Greek ethnic identity were the variables that differentiated the two groups of immigrants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020764011430031">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Acculturation in immigrants suffering from psychosis could be seen as a process that does not correlate strongly with the severity of the symptomatology but is probably influenced by different set of factors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764011430031">Ödegaard’s (1932)</xref> pioneering study that showed an increased rate of first hospital admissions for schizophrenia among Norwegian immigrants living in the USA, as compared to native-born Americans and Norwegians living in Norway, a large amount of evidence has accumulated on the relation between immigration and psychotic disorders. The most widely discussed studies in the last years have reported increased rates of psychotic disorders in immigrants living in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764011430031">Coid et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011430031">Harrison et al., 1997</xref>) and the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020764011430031">Veling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764011430031">Veling, Selten, Mackenbach, &amp; Hoek, 2007</xref>). According to a recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011430031">Cantor-Graae &amp; Selten, 2005</xref>) the mean weighted relative risk for first- and second-generation immigrants from developing countries to western Europe, compared to the risk for natives, was 3.3 (95% CI: 2.8–3.9).</p>
<p>Various hypotheses have been proposed to account for the above findings, such as misdiagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764011430031">Zandi et al., 2010</xref>), selective migration of persons predisposed to psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764011430031">Ödegaard, 1932</xref>), the effect of social exclusion or social defeat on brain dopamine function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020764011430031">Selten, Cantor-Graee, &amp; Kahn, 2007</xref>) or even vitamin D insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764011430031">Dealberto, 2007</xref>). Although the explanation is uncertain, the effect of chronic stress due to the migration process, as conceptualized within the stress-vulnerability model of risk for psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764011430031">Zubin &amp; Spring, 1977</xref>), remains a plausible etiology for the increased rates of psychosis in immigrant populations.</p>
<p>The term acculturation has been used in order to define the ‘the progressive adoption of elements of a foreign culture, ideas, words, values, norms, behaviors and institutions by persons, groups or classes of a given culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764011430031">Sam, 2006a</xref>: 11). Regardless of the model used to study and comprehend acculturation, a considerable amount of stress can arise as a result of immigrants’ continuous and sometimes unsuccessful effort for social integration and acceptance by the mainstream culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764011430031">Berry, 2006</xref>). This effort includes learning the language and lifestyle of the mainstream culture, struggling to come to terms with homesickness and adaptation to the new country, overcoming social discrimination, financial and professional difficulties, or trying to function within a ‘new meaning’ system. Such experiences could lead immigrants to suffer from chronic stress and feelings of frustration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011430031">Bhugra, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the relation between acculturation and mental health has been extensively investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011430031">Bhugra, 2004</xref>), there is only a limited number of published studies concerning the interplay between acculturation and psychosis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011430031">Koneru and de Mamani (2006)</xref> have found that higher level of acculturation was associated with greater severity of psychotic symptoms in a sample of 47 Latino, black and white patients living in the USA. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011430031">Bhugra, Leff, Morgan, and Zhao (2010)</xref> reported that African-Caribbean patients living in the UK were more marginalized than African-Caribbean healthy controls. Interestingly, the same study did not show any difference between Asian patients and healthy controls. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764011430031">Veling, Hoek, Wiersma, and Mackenbach (2010)</xref> have reported that in a sample of first-episode schizophrenic immigrant patients living in the Netherlands, negative identification with their own ethnic group was a potential risk factor for the onset of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Concerning the impact of ethnic identity on the manifestation of psychotic symptomatology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764011430031">Reininghaus et al. (2010)</xref> have found that strong identification with an ethnic minority group may be a potential contributory factor of the high rates of psychosis in the black and minority ethnic population in the UK, the effects of which may be explained by perceptions of disadvantage. A recent study in the Netherlands conducted among ethnic minority and Dutch young individuals with a mental state at risk of psychosis showed that the ethnic minority group displayed higher rates of negative symptoms and also a low level of ethnic group identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020764011430031">Velthorst et al., 2011</xref>). It is interesting that ethnic identity can sometimes become a part of the psychotic symptomatology. There are descriptions in the literature where the individuals that suffer from psychosis report that they want to belong to another ethnic group, or that they do so already but have been ‘misattributed’ to the wrong category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764011430031">Bhugra, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to explore further the association between acculturation factors and psychotic symptomatology in first-generation immigrant patients living in Athens, Greece and, if possible, to investigate the impact of social and demographic factors on the acculturation process, both in psychotic and non-psychotic immigrants.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0020764011430031">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>For the purposes of the study we recruited two groups of first-generation immigrants. The first group consisted of immigrants suffering from a psychotic disorder, mainly schizophrenia (<italic>n</italic> = 57) or delusional disorder (<italic>n</italic> = 8) according to DSM-IV TR criteria. All patients were consecutive admissions to the Transcultural Psychiatry Unit of Athens University 1st Psychiatric Department (<italic>n</italic> = 37) and Dromokaition State Psychiatric Hospital, which is also situated in the Athens area (<italic>n</italic> = 28). Two sites were used in order to have a more representative sample of Athens’ immigrant population.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we recruited a second group that consisted of non-psychotic immigrants. The immigrants were recruited from two medical non-governmental organizations’ (NGOs) polyclinics that provide medical treatment and free-of-charge medications to immigrants without health insurance. The inclusion criteria for both groups were: absence of diagnosed mental or neurological disorder, brain injury and substance abuse; and adequate knowledge of the Greek language (to be able to read and speak in Greek).</p>
<p>All participants were approached after examination by the physician or the psychiatrist and written informed consent was obtained from all individuals who agreed to be interviewed. The study design and methodology was approved by the scientific and ethical committee of Athens University 1st Psychiatric Department and all medical facilities that were utilized for the recruitment of immigrants provided the authors with written permission to conduct the study on their premises.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0020764011430031">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>All participants were asked to complete two questionnaires: (1) the Immigrants Acculturation Scale; and (2) a structured questionnaire for the demographic and clinical data collection.</p>
<p><italic>The Immigrants Acculturation Scale (IAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764011430031">Madianos, Gonidakis, Ploumpidis, Papadopoulou, &amp; Rogakou, 2008</xref>)</italic>. The IAS is a 17-item scale based on the existing cultural and social background of foreign immigrants who live and work in the greater Athens area. Each item raises an issue concerning the behaviour and attitudes of the immigrant that have been related to the acculturation process. Each item has three or four possible answers in a Likert-like scale ranging from 1 (low acculturation) to 3 or 4 (high acculturation).</p>
<p>The IAS construction follows the uni-dimensional acculturation model, so the total score ranges from 17 (non-acculturation to Greek and high adherence to heritage culture) to 63 (highest level of acculturation to Greek and abandonment of heritage culture). The IAS measures three factors/domains of acculturation. The first factor, which includes nine items, reflects certain behaviours concerning daily life practices: the knowledge of Greek language (speaking, writing, reading); the language that is used to communicate with countrymen; mass media use (newspaper, radio, television); preferences in music (Greek or from country of origin); groceries and cooking; destination of vacations; and origin of co-workers (countrymen or Greek). The second factor, which includes four items, is related to wishful orientation, meaning the immigrants’ attitudes towards social contacts and <italic>nostos</italic>, the desire to return to one’s homeland. The four items of this factor/domain refer to preferences about the ethnicity of neighbours, treating physician, children’s spouses and <italic>nostos</italic>. Finally, the third factor refers to the sense of ethnic identity and includes four items: label of identity; participation in an ethnic association; frequency of contact with homeland; and ethnicity of close friends.</p>
<p>For the group of immigrants suffering from psychosis, the following measurements were also utilized.</p>
<p><italic>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011430031">Kay, Opler, &amp; Fiszbein, 1987</xref>)</italic>. The PANSS was used to assess current psychotic symptoms. The Greek edition of PANSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764011430031">Lykouras, Botsis, &amp; Oulis, 1997</xref>) includes three subscales for positive syndromes (PANSS-Pos), negative syndromes (PANSS-Neg) and general psychopathology (PANSS-Gpsy), as well as a smaller component for the evaluation of the possibility for aggressive behaviour (PANSS-Agr). It should be noted that when PANSS was used to measure psychotic symptomatology in patients from different cultural backgrounds, no difference was found on the scale scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011430031">Barrio et al., 2003</xref>). This finding possibly enables the use of PANSS to measure psychopathology in patients from different countries of origin.</p>
<p><italic>The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764011430031">Addington, Addington, &amp; Maticka-Tyndale, 1993</xref>)</italic>. The CDSS measures depressive symptoms in psychotic patients. The scale has been adapted and validated for Greek patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011430031">Kontaxakis et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011430031">Endicott, Spitzer, Fleiss, &amp; Cohen, 1976</xref>)</italic>. The GAF gives an overall measure of functioning. The current version was used, which has proven validity and reliability in the Greek language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764011430031">Madianos, 1987</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0020764011430031">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The SPSS v13 software package was used for the statistical analysis of the study data. Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was utilized for the comparison of mean scores and the χ<italic><sup>2</sup></italic> test was used for the comparison of nominal variables. Pearson correlation was performed in order to explore the relation between psychopathology measurements and acculturation factors in the group of immigrants that were suffering from psychosis. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test with Bonferoni correction and Scheffe post-hoc test were utilized separately for each of the two groups of participants in order to achieve a sensitive analysis of the factors related with the acculturation process in immigrants with and without psychosis. The main reason for using MANOVA was the exploratory nature of the study and the lack of a solid model on the interplay between acculturation and socio-demographic factors. Before a theoretical model is implemented, its necessity and efficiency should be examined. Thus, an evaluation of groupings within the sample might be helpful for the detection of the effect of nesting predictors. In the case that certain variables (when added in MANOVA) turn any kind of grouping to sparseness, then the certain variables must treated parsimoniously. Finally, forward logistic regression analysis was used to explore differences in the acculturation process between the two groups of immigrants. Nagelkerkle <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> was calculated and the Hosmer–Lemeshow test was used to investigate whether the model produced by logistic regression possessed goodness of fit.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Fifteen of the original 80 immigrants suffering from psychosis that were approached were not able to participate (four because their mental state did not enable them to comprehend the questions of the self-administered scales, eight did not have adequate knowledge of the Greek language and three refused to participate). Overall, 65 (81.3%) of the immigrants that were originally approached participated in the study. Accordingly, 33 of the 350 non-psychotic immigrants that were approached were not able to participate (27 because they did not have adequate knowledge of the Greek language, two because of their physical condition and four refused to participate). Overall, 317 (90.6%) of the immigrants that were originally approached participated in the study.</p>
<p>The demographic data of the two groups are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764011430031">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020764011430031">2</xref>. The psychosis group reported more years of education, longer duration of stay in Greece and, as expected, lower percentage of marriage than the non-psychosis group. Also, more individuals suffering from psychosis came from European countries (mainly Albania) as compared with the non-psychosis group where most patients came from Central Asian countries (mainly Pakistan and Bangladesh).</p>

<title>Factors related with the acculturation process</title>
<p>To achieve a sensitive analysis of the study sample, several nested MANOVA were applied. The influence of five social and demographic factors on the acculturation process was investigated both in the psychosis and non-psychosis group. The five factors were: duration of residence in Greece; gender; religion; marital status; and years of education. The outcome of this analysis is presented in terms of variance ratios. The results of MANOVA for the two groups showed similar behaviour: as more nested MANOVA were designed, the additional variables could form multi-fractionization in the sample, in such a way that significant multivariate dense groups were not formed.</p>
<p>Considering the study of IAS everyday life in the psychosis group, the nested religion, marital status, gender and duration of stay in Greece have a confidence interval (CI) of almost 97% (<italic>p</italic> = .032). Although a CI of 97% (in terms of variances) is achieved when gender and marital status are studied (<italic>p</italic> = .01), religion enforces this CI (99%) while duration of stay in Greece reduces this power (96%). The four nested variables give a significance level of 0.032. In the non-psychosis group, the nested gender and years in Greece have a CI of almost 99.9% (<italic>p</italic> = .001). The discriminating power (in terms of variances) is achieved when the variable years in Greece is taken into consideration. Education reduces the CI to 80%. When all five variables were taken into consideration the result was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = .7). More comprehensively, the adaptation to the Greek way of living of the immigrants who suffered from psychosis was stronger when they were married, Christian, and females who had been living in Greece longer. In contrast, for the individuals without psychosis only the duration of stay in Greece and gender were strongly grouped with adaptation to Greek everyday life.</p>
<p>In the study of IAS wishful orientation/<italic>nostos</italic> in the psychosis group, religion has a CI of 97% (<italic>p</italic> = .03). In the non-psychosis group, religion also has an increased CI of almost 99.9% (<italic>p</italic> = .001). Religion, duration of residence in Greece and education had a CI of about 95%, which was marginally significant (<italic>p</italic> = .05). When all five variables were taken into consideration, the result was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = .3). These results imply that the immigrants wish to expand their social contacts beyond people from the same culture, and the lack of desire to return to their country of origin was strongly grouped with Christian religion. This relation was found both in the psychosis and non-psychosis groups</p>
<p>The IAS identity in the psychosis group did not show any significance for any of the variables mentioned or any combination of them. In the non-psychosis group, marital status, gender and duration of residence in Greece have a CI of 97.5% (<italic>p</italic> = .03). When all five variables were taken into consideration then the result was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = .7). The above results imply that while Christian women who were not suffering from psychosis showed strong grouping with Greek ethnic identity, the psychotic immigrants’ ethnic identity direction was not grouped with any of the five studied variables.</p>

<title>Differences concerning the acculturation process between psychotic and non-psychotic individuals</title>
<p>The individuals that were suffering from psychosis had higher mean IAS scores than the non-psychotic immigrants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0020764011430031">Table 4</xref>). Due to the differences in socio-demographic factors between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764011430031">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020764011430031">2</xref>), this result can be attributed to confounding factors such as duration of stay in Greece, marital status and years of education. The measurements of the three IAS subscales, together with years of education, duration of residence in Greece, age, religion and gender as categorical values, were entered as independent variables in logistic regression analysis. The mental health status (psychosis vs non-psychosis) was the dependent variable. Regression analysis showed that the IAS identity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.4, <italic>p</italic> = .001), age (OR = 1.1, <italic>p</italic> = .02) and duration of residence (OR = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .001) were the three variables that could differentiate the two groups. Nagelkerke <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> was 0.3. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = .2), thus indicating that the model had goodness of fit. The regression analysis results indicate that strong adoption of the mainstream culture’s ethnic identity, older age and prolonged residence in Greece were the three variables that could differentiate the group of immigrants that were suffering from psychosis from those that were not.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Considering the first aim of the study, the results indicate that there is not any significant correlation between the acculturation process, as measured by the IAS, and psychotic symptomatology, as measured by the PANSS and the CDSS. On the contrary, the IAS score and especially the IAS everyday life score were positively correlated with the GAF score. One of the important issues in the treatment and rehabilitation of psychotic individuals is the maintenance of their pre-morbid functionality. According to the study’s results, the functionality of immigrants suffering from psychosis is greater when they have achieved a better adaptation to the Greek way of everyday living. Similar to this result, a study conducted in a group of Mexican Americans suffering from psychosis showed that the level of acculturation was a predictor of everyday functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764011430031">Jeste et al., 2005</xref>). There are also reports in the literature suggesting that adaptation to the host culture everyday life could serve as a protective mechanism against stress and mood disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764011430031">Gonidakis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011430031">McLachlan, Smyth, Breen, &amp; Madden, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764011430031">Miller et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering the second aim of the study, each acculturation factor/domain, as measured by the IAS, was influenced by a different set of variables. There were also a few differences between the two groups in these sets of variables, especially religion and gender. Religion was treated as an independent factor, instead of race or country of origin, because there is accumulating evidence that the acculturation process is strongly influenced by the difference in religion between the mainstream and the heritage culture. It has been reported that Muslim immigrants in France have a 2.5 lower probability to receive a job interview callback than a Christian counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011430031">Adida, Laitin, &amp; Valfort, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, in the USA, Muslim immigrants, coming from Arab/Middle Eastern countries, reported a higher level of discrimination than Christians; this finding was moderated by the level of acculturation, meaning that Muslims who reported a high level of adaptation to the mainstream Christian culture experienced the most discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764011430031">Awad, 2010</xref>). The above findings have led to the suggestion that for Muslim immigrants the acculturation process might follow different patterns than those found for Christian immigrant populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011430031">Amer &amp; Hovey, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the last decade there has also been an increasing discussion in the literature on the challenges that immigrant women are facing and the gender-specific factors that influence their adaptation to the culture of their new country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764011430031">Sam, 2006b</xref>). Although the impact of gender in the acculturation process and the immigrant’s mental health has not been clearly defined, it has been reported that women are at greater risk for schizophrenia at least during the first years of immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764011430031">Werbeloff, Levine, &amp; Rabinowitz, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study’s results indicate that although there is not any strong correlation between psychotic psychopathology and ethnic identity, ethnic identify was one of the three factors that could differentiate the two groups of immigrants. It has been reported that a negative identification with the immigrant’s ethnic group may act as a risk factor for psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764011430031">Veling et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011430031">Bhugra et al. (2010)</xref> have also suggested that the high incidence of schizophrenia in the immigrant group is related with a movement away from their traditional culture as compared with healthy immigrants from the same culture. Interestingly, there are also reports of the exact opposite relation, that is, a strong identification with an ethnic minority group may act as a potential contributory factor to the high rates of psychosis in the ethnic minority population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764011430031">Reininghaus et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding the acculturation process, two opposite profiles emerged from the study’s results. The first profile is the highly acculturated married Christian woman and the second is the least acculturated single, non-Christian (mainly Muslim) man who has only recently immigrated to Greece. It should be noted that most of the women who participated in the study came from the Balkan countries, which share many common cultural features with Greece. Also, most of the women had been working as housekeepers or babysitters in Greek families, an occupation that has put them in great proximity with Greek everyday life.</p>
<p>Finally, an interesting finding was that the IAS ethnic identity factor in the group of immigrants suffering from psychosis was not grouped together with any of the five studied social and demographic factors. Furthermore, the individuals suffering from psychosis that were recruited for the purposes of the study were older, have been living in Greece for more years and had more extensively adopted the Greek ethnic identity than the individuals that were not suffering from psychosis. The latter needs further investigation as it is often reported in the literature of healthy individuals that although the acculturation process is progressing over time, ethnic identity often remains stable over the years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764011430031">Phinney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764011430031">Snauwaert, Soenens, Vanbeselaere, &amp; Boen, 2003</xref>). These results could lead to the hypothesis that ethnic identity in psychotic immigrants might be formulated through different procedures than the ones reported in the acculturation literature for non-psychotic immigrants.</p>
<sec id="section16-0020764011430031">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study had several limitations. The first was the representativeness of the sample, which was drawn from only four locations in Athens where immigrants could be reached. Also, all interviews were conducted in Greek, thus excluding from the study the less acculturated immigrants. The reason for conducting all the assessments in Greek and not also in English or the individual’s native language was to avoid further bias related primarily to semantic variations concerning the use of a second-to-Greek common language (such as English) by individuals from different ethnicities and, second, the involvement of cultural mediators. The difficulty with cultural mediators was that they were not available for all the different ethnicities that were included in our study. Employing cultural mediators for two or three ethnic groups and not for the rest would be more problematic than helpful. Although the study results provide important information on the acculturation process in psychotic patients, they cannot in any case be regarded as epidemiological data for the immigrant population in Greece. A general limitation concerning immigrant studies such as this is the generalizability and comparability of the results. This could not be more true than in acculturation research since this complex construct has not been consistently defined across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011430031">Koneru and de Mamani, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A second limitation was the use of the PANSS, CDSS and GAF to measure psychotic symptomatology. There are four major concerns regarding the issue of using questionnaires created for western countries in transcultural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011430031">Bhui &amp; Bhugra, 2001</xref>). Specifically: (a) the instrument may fail to capture the conceptualization of the mental disorder in different cultural groups; (b) the instrument may include items that are irrelevant to the expression of the disorder in cultural groups other than the one for which it was designed; (c) the language barrier, which is not only related with the level of knowledge of the Greek language but also with the semantic differences in the usage of the same language by people coming from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds; and (d) factors such as social stigmatization, the ethnicity, gender and age of the interviewer and the setting of the interview may influence the way in which people respond.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, this study’s findings point to the complex role of culture and immigration in the manifestation of mental illness and they also underline the need for more vigorous research in this area. The use of various measures and definitions for acculturation may be a contributing factor to the contradicting findings in the literature concerning the relation between the acculturation process and mental health. Future studies with larger samples of each ethnic group are necessary to draw more definite conclusions of how acculturation relates to symptoms of psychosis and how this association operates within different ethnicities.</p>
