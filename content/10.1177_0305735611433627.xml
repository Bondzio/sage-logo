<p>This issue marks my last as editor and I would like to express my appreciation to a number of people who have been important to the journal over the past 6 years. Working for <italic>Psychology of Music</italic> has been a particularly collaborative undertaking and I would like to thank the editorial team who have all helped immensely during my tenure. Firstly, as Assistant Editor, Laura Mitchell’s help was invaluable and her dedication and professional approach were absolutely vital in ensuring the smooth running of the journal. Evangelos Hermonides was also a key player and his reliability and expertise as Reviews Editor ensured that the review section thrived. I would also like to thank all the staff at Sage who have helped the journal develop to such an extent that, with this edition, we are now moving to six editions per year. In particular, Louise Skelding, Amy Goggins and Helena Engstrand have been supportive, ambitious and always very friendly, making working with an international publishing house a pleasure. With ever increasing demands on our time, I have been consistently impressed with the time and diligence devoted to the journal by our many reviewers and so I would like to thank them all since their input is the most important cornerstone of the academic journal process. It is a great pleasure to announce that Dr Alexandra Lamont takes over the editorship of <italic>Psychology of Music</italic>. She brings a unique breadth and depth of expertise to the position and I have no doubt that the journal will go from strength to strength under her editorship. There will be a transition period as I complete the review process for articles already in the system and for 2012 Alexandra will be Incoming Editor and I will be Outgoing Editor. It is envisaged that Alexandra will take over full editorship of the journal in 2013.</p>
<p>It has been both a privilege and a pleasure to serve as editor for <italic>Psychology of Music</italic>. Not only has it been a rewarding and enjoyable position but also one of the most stimulating of my academic career and, whilst I will look forward to gaining the extra time in my schedule, I will undoubtedly miss the unique and privileged intellectual engagement that lies at the heart of the editor’s role.</p>
