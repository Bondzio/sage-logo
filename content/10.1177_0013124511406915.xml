<abstract>
<p>Research has found strong linkages between adolescent substance use and attitudes toward school. Few studies of this relationship, however, consider the different dimensions of students’ school attitudes, separating perceptions of the importance of school from the quality of students’ affective experiences therein. Using a sample of 301 urban adolescents, evenly divided into substance users and nonusers, this study examines the relationships between these two dimensions of school attitudes and substance use. Findings highlight a subset of adolescent substance users who see school as the most important place in which they routinely spend time and who differ significantly from other users, but not from nonusers, in their expressed satisfaction with school. Results also call attention to the ubiquity of urban adolescents’ dissatisfaction with their teachers, showing such dissatisfaction as unrelated to their rates of substance use. Implications for school reform, dropout prevention programs, and future research are discussed.</p>

<p>Adolescent substance use predicts a host of negative school-related outcomes, including lower achievement, lower motivation, and more negative attitudes toward school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406915">Williams, Davis, Johnson, Williams, Saunders, &amp; Nebbitt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406915">Zimmerman &amp; Schmeelk-Cone, 2003</xref>). At the same time, negative attitudes to school are also predictive of greater substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511406915">Bryant &amp; Zimmerman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124511406915">Eccles, Lord, Roeser, Barber, &amp; Jozefowicz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124511406915">Hawkins, Catalano, &amp; Miller, 1992</xref>), suggesting a maladaptive cycle that may culminate in the decision to drop out of school (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511406915">Townsend, Fisher, &amp; King, 2007</xref> for a review).</p>
<p>As the drop-out rate has reached epidemic proportions in major urban centers in America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124511406915">Bridgeland, Dilulio, &amp; Morison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013124511406915">Swanson, 2004</xref>), it is particularly important to study the relationships between substance use and school attitudes in urban adolescents, those who may be considered at risk of dropping out because of the schools they attend, the color of their skin, and their socioeconomic status. By exploring patterns of usage and school attitudes among low-income, urban youth from racial minority backgrounds, we hope to raise considerations that can guide effective interventions into the drop-out crisis in America’s cities.</p>
<sec id="section1-0013124511406915">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Work that privileges “student voice” finds that urban youth can be highly critical of their schools. They express dissatisfaction with school conditions, teacher quality, disciplinary policies, and curricular content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124511406915">Zenkov &amp; Dutro, 2009</xref>). The curriculum is an important area of focus because many students who drop out cite boredom with school as their main reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511406915">Fallis &amp; Opotow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013124511406915">Willms, 2003</xref>). In a survey of 467 high school dropouts, “uninteresting classes” was the most commonly chosen item that respondents selected as a major factor in their decision to leave school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124511406915">Bridgeland et al., 2006</xref>). In follow-up focus groups, the respondents described their classes as boring and noted that their teachers did not do enough to make them work hard.</p>
<p>Boredom, of course, is not a condition reserved only for those who drop out of school, and many students who do graduate from high school describe their high school classes as uninteresting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124511406915">National Research Council, 2003</xref>); however, the prevalence of boredom among adolescents is of concern not only because schools should be places of intellectual engagement and stimulation, but also because boredom is associated with other risk factors, such as substance use, which itself predicts lower school achievement and a higher likelihood of dropping out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124511406915">Ellickson, Bui, Bell, &amp; McGuigan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124511406915">Garnier, Stein, &amp; Jacobs, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124511406915">Luthar &amp; Cushing, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124511406915">McCluskey, Krohn, Lizotte, &amp; Rodriguez 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124511406915">Register, Williams, &amp; Grimes, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of studies find strong associations between adolescents’ attitudes toward school and substance use. Students who have positive beliefs about the importance and value of school are less likely to use substance than their peers who see school as less important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124511406915">Roeser, Eccles, &amp; Freedman-Doan, 1999</xref>). Meanwhile, those who frequently cut class or skip school and those who express low motivation are more likely to use alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana than their more engaged peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511406915">Bryant, Schulenberg, Bachman, O’Malley, &amp; Johnston, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511406915">Bryant &amp; Zimmerman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013124511406915">Voelkl &amp; Frone, 2000</xref>). In a 6-year longitudinal study of 1,897 nationally representative youth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124511406915">Bryant and Zimmerman (2003)</xref> found that adolescents who reported higher levels of school interest, school effort, and school bonding were less likely to report concurrent cigarette and alcohol use than their peers. School bonding has also been associated with reduced odds of substance use across adolescence and into emerging adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124511406915">Hawkins, Guo, Hill, Battin-Pearson, &amp; Abbott, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the research on the links between school attitudes and substance use has been quantitative; however, some qualitative research has explored this relationship. In her seminal work on youth culture, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124511406915">Penelope Eckert (1989)</xref> dichotomizes the White students at the suburban Midwest high school she studied into two familiar groups, differentiated by their attitudes toward school: Jocks and Burnouts. Jocks are those who embrace, perpetuate, and succeed in the organizational and normative structures of school, whereas Burnouts reject the institution of schooling. Although Eckert paints a nuanced portrait of the students who belong to these two social categories, she shows how, within school, substance use becomes a proxy for students’ overall attitudes toward school, and these attitudes reinforce and reproduce social patterns along class lines.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124511406915">Jay MacLeod (1995)</xref> also examines how school attitudes and substance use illustrate social reproduction theory for two groups of students, in this case, low-income, urban male participants. The Brothers, a group of African American youth, do not use alcohol or drugs and value school highly, working hard to try to get ahead, whereas the Hallway Hangers, a group of White males, use substances regularly, frequently cut class, and show little appreciation for the institution of schooling.</p>
<p>These two qualitative studies echo the findings in the quantitative research that suggest a tight linkage between substance use and school attitudes; however, they also reveal a gap in the literature. The Hallway Hangers and the Burnouts have negative experiences in school and do not value school as an institution. (In fact, it is not until after they drop out and struggle to find work that some of the Hallway Hangers come to see the potential utility of school and recognize the value of education.) We do not know much about those urban youth who have negative experiences in school but who continue to see school as important. For those youth who have negative experiences in school, what is the relationship between valuing school and substance use? Does valuing school serve as a protective factor?</p>

<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>Our conceptual framework is rooted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124511406915">Bronfenbrenner’s (1979)</xref> human ecological perspective, which recognizes how an individual’s behavior and attitudes in one context impinge on his or her attitudes and behavior in another context. According to national estimates, the percentage of high school students who report using substances in school hovers around 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013124511406915">YRBS, 2009</xref>); however, usage clearly has implications for school performance, and the literature reveals consistent linkages between usage and school attitudes and achievement. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124511406915">Bryant and Zimmerman (2003)</xref> observe, “School-related behaviors [such] as acting out or skipping class are likely to be related to problem behaviors in other contexts such as using substances” (p. 362). Therefore, when seeking to understand adolescents’ lived experiences, it is important to look across developmental contexts and to consider how the youth themselves view the multiple worlds they navigate on a daily basis.</p>

<title>The Current Study and Hypotheses</title>
<p>The present study seeks to understand how urban adolescent substance users and nonusers compare in their perceptions of their schools and their teachers. Guided by extant research, we predict that, in comparison with their nonusing peers, substance users would be more likely to have negative affective experiences in school and that they would be less likely to perceive school as an important place. We also predict that they would have more negative attitudes to their teachers than nonusers. At the same time, we expect that those youth who see school as important will be less likely to use substances than those who see school as a less important place, irrespective of their affective experiences therein or their relationships with teachers. We expect to find strong, bidirectional associations between all three school perception measures and substance use.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0013124511406915">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants included 301 adolescents living in a major East Coast city. The participants ranged in age from 13 to 20, with a mean age of 17 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2). The vast majority (87%) self-identified as African American, 8% described themselves as of mixed race, and the remaining 5% indicated their racial/ethnic background as Other. Female participants made up 61% of the sample. Approximately one third (30%) of the sample reported living below the poverty line; however, there was little variation in reports of socioeconomic status. Most of the participants would be considered low income. Furthermore, consistent with research on the experiences of urban youth, nearly half the participants (49.5%) reported experiencing symptoms associated with posttraumatic stress disorder. Substance use data were purposely collected to create two groups equally divided by substance users (<italic>n</italic> = 151) and nonusers, those who report never having used substances or having not used substances within the last year (<italic>n</italic> = 150).</p>
<p>Based on their home address, we estimate that 75% of the respondents live within the catchment areas of one of four comprehensive high schools in the school district. The population of students at these school sites mirrors that of our study, with the majority consisting of low-income, African American students. At these four schools, which range in size from 700 to 1,767 students, between 97% and 98% of the students are African American and between 75.2% and 89% are classified by the school district as economically disadvantaged. The proficiency rates of the students at these four schools hovers between 5% and 12% on state reading and math scores, and three of the four schools appear consistently on the state’s list of Persistently Dangerous Schools.</p>

<sec id="section6-0013124511406915">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were recruited for the study in a city-run public health care center. Screening questions were asked to determine if the adolescent was eligible to participate; the criteria included age (between 13 and 20), city residence, English fluency, and stable mental health. (Adolescents with severe mental health disturbances, such as psychosis, were not considered eligible.) Following the determination of eligibility, trained research assistants explained the study to the adolescent and his or her parent or guardian. Informed parental consent was obtained for all minors, whereas those adolescents who were 18 years old or older provided informed consent themselves. The consent rate was 90%. Participants were then taken to a room where they were asked to complete a survey, with a range of measures, four of which form the basis for this article. In general, the procedure lasted for 45 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0013124511406915">
<title>Measures</title>
<p><italic>Substance use</italic>. Substance use was measured with the Adolescent Alcohol and Drug Involvement Scale (AADIS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124511406915">Moberg &amp; Hahn, 1991</xref>). The AADIS measures an adolescent’s level of drug and alcohol involvement, and it is considered a highly effective tool for differentiating between those who do not have any substance use disorders and those who have at least one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013124511406915">Winters, Botzet, Anderson, Bellehumeur, &amp; Egan, 2001</xref>). The AADIS has favorable internal reliability (α = .94) and correlates highly with self-report measures of substance use (<italic>r</italic> = .72), with clinical assessments (<italic>r</italic> = .75), and with participants’ perceptions of the severity of their own drug use problem (<italic>r</italic> = .79).</p>
<sec id="section8-0013124511406915">
<title>School perceptions</title>
<p>Three measures were used to explore the respondents’ perceptions of their school, two of which come from the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-2) Self-Report of Personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124511406915">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 2004</xref>). The BASC-2 was used for its ability to measure clinical (maladjustment) as well as adaptive (positive adjustment) dimensions. Reliability is strong with the BASC-2 as it has internal consistency scores of composites with alpha coefficients ranging from the low-to-mid .90s. The Attitude to Teachers Scale (Cronbach’s α = .84), from the BASC-2, is composed of nine items that asses the respondents’ perception of how caring, fair, and helpful their teachers are. Examples include “My teacher trusts me” and “My teacher cares about me.” This measure produces continuous data with higher scores indicating greater levels of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The <italic>affective experiences in school</italic> measure, known as Attitudes to School in BASC-2, consists of seven items, which probe students’ feelings about school. Sample items include “I get bored in school” and “I can’t wait for school to be over.” This measure has high reliability (Cronbach’s α = .85) and, like the Attitude to Teachers Scale, yields continuous data, with higher scores indicating greater dissatisfaction with school. We have changed its name to distinguish it from the third measure we use that also captures students’ attitudes toward school.</p>
<p>The Ecological Interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511406915">Mason, Cheung, &amp; Walker, 2004</xref>) provides data on where respondents spend their time in a typical week, using an open-ended “free listing” technique and the recall method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124511406915">Verma &amp; Saraswathi, 1992</xref>). Previous studies have found that data generated by the Ecological Interview are accurate and valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511406915">Mason et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406915">Mason, Valente, Coatsworth, Mennis, Lawrence, &amp; Zelenak, 2010</xref>). Of all the locations participants list as places where they spent time in the last week, they are asked to identify the place that is the most important to them. They are then asked, “What makes this place important?” In this study, we used a dummy variable to capture those respondents who nominate school as their most important place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0013124511406915">
<title>Relationships with parents</title>
<p>The Relations with Parents Scale also comes from the BASC-2. It is used to measure adolescents’ perception of being important in the family, the status of the parent–child relationship, and the child’s perception of the degree of parental trust and concern (Cronbach’s α = .89). The scale produces continuous data with lower scores indicating greater levels of problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0013124511406915">
<title>Posttraumatic stress disorder</title>
<p>Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were measured with Primary Care–Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PC-PTSD) Scale. The PC-PTSD is a four-item screen (Cronbach’s α = .93) that was designed for use in primary care and other medical settings. The PC-PTSD has a test-retest Pearson’s correlation coefficient of .83 and has an overall diagnostic accuracy of 85% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511406915">Prins et al., 2004</xref>). Although it is not diagnostic, this measure does serve as a solid screener that produces symptom counts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0013124511406915">
<title>Analytic Approach</title>
<p>We identified those students who selected school as the most important place in which they spent time and then tabulated the open-ended responses they gave about why this was their most important place. These responses were first coded according to an open-coding process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511406915">Huberman &amp; Miles, 1994</xref>). Independent of this open coding, SPSS Text Analysis for Surveys 3.0 was used to perform linguistic analyses. The linguistic analysis identified patterns of speech and located related words and ideas taking into consideration the context of where these concepts appeared. It then created categories with closely related concepts, opinions, or attitudes through advanced category building techniques, including concept derivation, concept inclusion, semantic networks, and co-occurrence rules. These categories were then manually reviewed to check for coding errors as well as for category distinction (sharing less than75% of another category as recommended by SPSS Text Analysis 3.0). The resulting categories of “education,” “future,” “friends,” and “teachers,” which were identical to the codes identified through the open-coding technique, were then transformed into dichotomous variables (yes/no) and exported into SPSS17 to apply quantitative analyses to these data. A series of 2 × 2 chi-square analyses was then conducted to test each category’s dependency on substance use.</p>
<p>To understand the differences in the users’ and nonusers’ perceptions of and attitudes toward school, we use <italic>t</italic> tests and chi-square statistical models. We also ran regressions with substance use and affective experiences of school and teacher as the dependent variables, controlling for posttraumatic stress, relationships with parents, age, and gender, all factors previous research has found to be associated with substance use. As affective experiences with school and attitudes to teacher were highly correlated, we combined these measures into a composite measure, testing it as both an independent variable in the substance use model and as a dependent variable in its own model.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We first ran descriptive statistics to examine the respondents’ overall affective experiences in school and attitudes to teachers. The results, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013124511406915">Table 2</xref>, show that the majority of respondents express dissatisfaction with their schools and teachers. Although only 15.2% would be considered “at risk” because of their affective experiences in school, with 4.3% at a clinically significant level that may suggest increased risk for dropping out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124511406915">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 2004</xref>), just above 80% score in the range that indicates dissatisfaction with school. The percentage of respondents expressing dissatisfaction with their teachers climbs to 87%.</p>
<p>As expected, we find statistically significant differences between the users and the nonusers in their affective experiences in school, <italic>t</italic>(258) = −2.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, with the nonusers showing greater overall satisfaction. However, users and nonusers do not differ significantly from one another in their attitudes to teachers, <italic>t</italic>(256) = −1.4, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10. Correlation analyses show a strong relationship between both attitudinal measures and total drug and alcohol use (<italic>r</italic> = .232, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 for school and <italic>r</italic> = .186, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 for teachers) see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013124511406915">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Turning to the Ecological Interview, we find that 93 respondents nominated school as the most important place in which they spend their time; however, just more than three quarters (77%) of these respondents posted attitudinal scores that indicate dissatisfaction with their school and 79% express dissatisfaction with their teachers. In other words, even though they see school as an important place, they may not feel that it is meeting their needs.</p>
<p>The group of 93 participants who indicated that school was the most important location in which they spend their time included 39 users and 54 nonusers. Chi-square analyses show that there is no significant difference between these two groups in the likelihood that they would nominate school as their most important place, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 93) = 3.36, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05.</p>
<p>The reasons the respondents gave for choosing school as their most important place also do not vary greatly. Although one might assume that users see school as important for social reasons, high percentages of users and nonusers alike cite their value of education or the utility of school to their future goals as their main reason for viewing school as important (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013124511406915">Table 3</xref>). In fact, chi-square analyses do not turn up significant differences in the reasons the users and nonusers list for nominating school as their most important place.</p>

<p>Within the subset of respondents who nominate school as the most important place in which they spend their time, the attitudinal difference found previously between users and nonusers disappears. Although users still express slightly more dissatisfaction with school than do nonusers, the difference between their average scores is not statistically significant, <italic>t</italic>(75) = .54, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .50. The difference in the two groups’ attitudes toward teachers also continues to be nonsignificant, <italic>t</italic>(67) = −.48, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10.</p>
<p>Focusing on the 128 users in our sample for whom we had school perception data, we find that those who listed school as the most important place in which they spend their time have significantly better affective experiences in school, <italic>t</italic>(126) = 3.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, than those users who did not list school as their most important place. In fact, the users who nominated school as their most important place do not differ significantly in their affective experiences in school or in their attitudes to teachers from all the nonusers, <italic>t</italic>(54) = 1.15, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05 for school; <italic>t</italic>(49) = .56, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .50 for teachers.</p>
<p>Regression analyses, controlling for age, gender, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and relationships with parents, show that students’ affective experiences with school and teachers are strongly linked to total substance use (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0013124511406915">Table 4</xref>). Greater dissatisfaction with school and teachers is associated with greater usage; however, seeing school as the most important place in which they spend time is not related to substance use. Nonetheless, seeing school as the most important place is significantly associated with a student’s affective experiences with school and teachers, as are relationships with parents and total substance usage (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0013124511406915">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study are consistent with previous research that finds high levels of dissatisfaction among urban adolescents with their schools. The vast majority of our sample finds school to be boring and uncomfortable, and they feel they have negative relationships with their teachers. Even those students who value their education and consider school to be the most important place in which they spend their time may have negative perceptions of the quality of their schooling or their interactions with teachers. In other words, this study adds nuance to our understanding of urban students’ attitudes toward school, differentiating their perceptions of the importance and utility of the place from their affective experiences therein.</p>
<p>In so doing, this study raises considerations for school reform and dropout prevention programs, identifying a touch point that may be commonly overlooked. Nearly one third (31%) of the urban youth in this study considers school the most important place they routinely visit, more important than their homes, churches, after-school programs, or the health clinic in which the study was conducted. These adolescents value school and care about their education. This is not to say that the other two thirds of the participants in the study also do not value their education; they simply chose other locations as the most important places in which they spend time. The finding that such a large share of respondents does rate their schools as their most important location is notable, however, because it cautions against designing dropout prevention programs that seek to improve urban adolescents’ attitudes and change their values. Instead, this finding calls for recognizing the assets that urban youth may possess, leveraging and building on the fact that many of them care deeply about their futures and recognize the role of education in achieving their long-term goals.</p>
<p>The findings of this study also highlight the need to focus interventions not on the individual’s problems or deficits but on the school-level factors with which these youth find fault: the boring curriculum and their relationships with teachers. For the adolescents in this study, dissatisfaction with teachers was widespread, and their levels of dissatisfaction did not vary significantly by substance use patterns. Irrespective of their rates of usage, few of these highly stressed urban youth feel that their teachers care about them or treat them with respect.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the results of this study align with research that finds a strong and bidirectional association between students’ substance use rates and their affective experiences in school. Those who use substances are more likely than those who do not to report negative affective experiences in school and these negative school experiences, in turn, predict greater substance use. Contrary to our expectations, seeing school as important did not relate strongly to usage; however, it was related to more positive affective experiences in school and with teachers, suggesting that it might be a factor that can disrupt or counteract the otherwise tight linkage between substance use and affective experiences in school.</p>
<p>To this end, the findings of this study suggest the need for a finer grained reading of the relationship between substance use and school attitudes by drawing attention to a group of adolescent substance users who value school highly. The identification of this group is important because it appears to be a group that has gone unnoticed in other research. Whereas broad-brush analyses suggest that users have more negative attitudes to school than do nonusers, the Ecological Interview data, in particular, the question about the most important place in which the respondent spends his or her time, show that many users do not differ from nonusers in their valuing of school or their appreciation of education. Interventions designed to target users should be attentive to variation among their perceptions of school and not simply assume that all users have negative attitudes toward school and see little utility in education.</p>
<p>More research is needed on this subgroup of users, so we can understand how their substance use does or does not affect their school outcomes. Follow- up studies as well as research that incorporates student-level achievement and attendance data are warranted. As seeing school as important is associated with more positive affective experiences in school and attitudes to teachers, regardless of substance usage, the question remains does valuing school in any way mitigate the deleterious effects of substance use on school achievement?</p>
<p>The limitations of this study include our lack of student-level achievement and school attendance data. In fact, our sample may very well include youth who have already dropped out of school as well as some who may have graduated from high school. Slightly more than one quarter of our sample reports being above 18 years old, the age at which most adolescents graduate from high school; nevertheless, 14% of the 93 respondents who nominate school as the most important place in which they spend time are 19- to 20-years old. Another limitation is that nominating school as the most important place in which they routinely spend time is not the same thing as seeing school as important. Our sample may include many more adolescents who value schooling and their education, though they may not think of their school as the most important place in their lives.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, our work raises important considerations for intervention and school reform efforts as well as questions for future research. It complicates a traditional view of adolescent substance users as “Burnouts,” who have rejected or given up on school, and shows that we still have much to learn about the connections between substance use and school experiences for low-income, urban adolescents.</p>
