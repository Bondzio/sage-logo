<p>The main theme of this volume is to show how language learners’ identities and subjectivities are formed in different contexts in the era of globalization and in the new millennium. As Higgins clarifies in the introductory chapter, the main point of distinction of this volume is its focus on how L2 identity is constructed within transglobal and transcultural individuals. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957926513486580">Appadurai (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957926513486580">1996)</xref>, she argues that a number of <italic>scapes</italic> including <italic>ethnoscapes</italic>, <italic>technoscapes</italic>, <italic>finanscapes</italic>, <italic>mediascapes</italic>, <italic>ideoscapes</italic> referring to the flows of immigrants, technology, money, media, and ideas inter alia, have spurred the formation of new identity zones.</p>
<p>This volume is divided into three main parts pivoting around three main aspects of globalization, namely (1) the blurring of ethno-national borders because of the rapid flows of immigration and shuttling between countries; (2) the development of intercultural awareness and third spaces through language learning and border crossing; and (3) identity formation through the influence of media and cyberspace.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 is a preamble by Higgins setting the scene for the rest of the book. Part I is devoted to ‘Forming identities within (trans)national ethnoscapes’ and is divided into four chapters. This part of the book showcases studies conducted in North America including Canada and the USA. Chapter 2 is a longitudinal ethnographic and narrative-based case study. In this chapter, Matthew T Prior discusses the linguistic and ethnic hybridity of Etienne, a Vietnamese-Cambodian refugee living in Canada, and his discursive construction of belonging, that is, how he struggles to disentangle himself from being ‘othered’. Not unlike the previous chapter, in Chapter 3 Dawn Allen discusses the identities of five adolescent newcomers to Montreal over a 15-month period when these youths had re-enrolled in an intensive French program, how they experienced linguistic, academic, and social integration, and how some of them continued comparing themselves with their peers back in their own community, showing they were not totally integrated into the new community. In Chapter 4, in a longitudinal microethnographic study, Jane Zuengler examines how immigrant and minority youths in the USA resist attending certain after-school nationalistic events (e.g. the Pledge of Allegiance) in spite of their minority status and lack of power. Using ethnographic approaches and interviews, in Chapter 5 Menard-Warwick explores the identities of six Latina immigrant women at an adult English-as-a-second-language program in California and how their newly developing second language (L2) literacies were (dis)connected from their first language (L1) literacy with which they had lived for a long time.</p>
<p>Part II is entitled ‘Identifying with third spaces among ideoscapes’ and is mainly in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957926513486580">Kramsch’s (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957926513486580">2010)</xref> idea of <italic>third space</italic> and how study abroad and expatriate living (ethnoscapes) provide learners with various ideas and ideologies. In other words, the second part of this volume examines the experience of expatriate living and how such an experience is conducive to a third space development. Hence, in Chapter 6, Jane Jackson discusses how a girl from Hong Kong on a study-abroad program in England attempted to find new identities in her interaction. In contrast, Celeste Kinginger in Chapter 7 shows how Americans in France avoid building up intercultural understanding and the third space. In Chapter 8, Christina Higgins researches through narratives how globalized people in Tanzania identify themselves in the local context.</p>
<p>As the last part of this volume, Part III is entitled ‘Constructing identities in mediascapes’ and is divided into four chapters. This part of the book focuses on the importance of media and cyberspace as a new medium for identity construction not formerly available in traditional language learning contexts. In Chapter 9, Angel Lin and Evelyn Man focus on the lives of working-class youth in Hong Kong who try to affiliate themselves with the English language community by adopting Hip-Hop as their favorite cultural norm. Similarly focusing on Hip-Hop, in Chapter 10, Awad Ibrahim discusses how black immigrants in a Franco-Ontarian high school in Canada developed a discursive space where their English learning was mediated through Hip-Hop culture. In Chapter 11, Yumiko Ohara focuses on L2 identities of learners of Japanese as a foreign language in Hawaii and how her learners favored the Japanese they heard in Japanese popular culture rather than the Japanese in their textbooks. Finally, in Chapter 12, Steven L Thorne and Rebecca Black focus on a number of case studies where internet-mediated interaction is the site of identity construction.</p>
<p>One of the strong points of this book is its focus on language learning, identity formation, and globalization in different language learning contexts including Canada, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Tanzania, the USA, and the UK. Moreover, the studies cover different additional languages including English, French, Swahili, and Japanese, employing different research methods including case studies, narrative analysis, and ethnography. Overall, this volume is a nice collection of chapters written by a number of internationally recognized researchers from various academic institutions across the globe and is highly recommended to researchers in sociolinguistics, intercultural communication, language and identity, literacy and popular culture, multilingualism, globalization, discourse analysis, and technology-mediated education.</p>
