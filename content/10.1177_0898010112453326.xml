<abstract>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The purposes were to identify loneliness in rural women with chronic conditions and to identify the major themes represented in their descriptions of their feelings of loneliness. <bold>Design:</bold> This study was a secondary analysis of data collected during a 22-week computer-based support and health online intervention in which rural women participated in virtual forums that allowed them to share life experiences. <bold>Method:</bold> Quantitative data were gathered from participants’ self-reported loneliness via the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Qualitative data analysis consisted of seeking loneliness themes imbedded in the participants’ online exchanges. <bold>Findings:</bold> High scores on the loneliness scale indicated a high degree of expressed loneliness, with possible scores of 20 to 80. The range of scores for all participants (<italic>n</italic> = 57) was 21 to 68; for those in the upper quartile (<italic>n</italic> = 12), the range was 52 to 68. Loneliness themes identified were longing for loved ones, changing relationships, listening in the background, and impact of rural factors. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Because loneliness has been described as a painful experience and can have long-reaching effects on an individual’s health, it is a factor to be considered in planning nursing care for individuals who may be at risk because of physical and/or emotional isolation.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of a chronic illness forever affects and alters the lives of those living with the illness. It interrupts their hopes and dreams for the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010112453326">Ohman, Soderberg, &amp; Lundman, 2003</xref>) and marks the beginning of a lifelong process of management and adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010112453326">Weinert, Cudney, &amp; Winters, 2005</xref>). In navigating this path, chronically ill persons may feel very alone in their day-to-day struggles, especially those living in rural locations. In a study of the impact of the rural context on women dealing with chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898010112453326">Winters, Cudney, Sullivan, &amp; Thuesen, 2006</xref>), it was found that <italic>distance</italic> was the overarching characteristic of the rural context that influenced the women’s ability to self-manage their chronic health problems. The effect of distance and the specter of physical isolation, especially for those who could no longer drive, was a concern because of the loss of contact with social events and participation in community organizations. Such isolation can be the source of a great sense of loneliness, as was voiced by one study participant: “You know how we talk about being so alone with our health situation. I’ve felt so lonely so many times.”</p>
<p>Since nursing is focused on the alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response to illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112453326">American Nurses Association, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010112453326">2004</xref>), a greater understanding of loneliness as a response to chronic illness will help rural nurses identify and address this phenomenon. To contribute to such an understanding, the perceptions of loneliness as expressed by middle-aged women dealing with chronic conditions who participated in an online support group in rural western United States provided a rich source of data. The purposes of this investigation were to examine the shared conversations of the participants, particularly those who were identified as lonely (i.e., scored high on the UCLA Loneliness Scale), in an effort to seek insights into the rural, chronically ill women’s experiences of loneliness and differentiate the major themes within their expressions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0898010112453326">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Chronic diseases are among the most prevalent health problems in the United States. The prolonged course of illness and disability from chronic illness has resulted in extended pain, suffering, and decreased quality of life for millions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010112453326">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009</xref>). For those in rural areas, these consequences may be magnified by unhealthy psychosocial situations that include long cold winters, limited educational opportunities, and isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010112453326">Leipert, 2006</xref>). Isolation is a recognized consequence of residing in a rural area that can result in decreased communication and interaction with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010112453326">Lee, Hollis, &amp; McClain, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898010112453326">Winters et al., 2006</xref>) and has been identified as a possible cause for loneliness in rural dwellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112453326">Foxall &amp; Ekberg, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Loneliness has been studied from many different perspectives over the past several years. Early research on loneliness provided a foundation to guide future research. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010112453326">Weiss (1973)</xref> proposed a typology of loneliness; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112453326">Peplau and Perlman (1982)</xref> published data on the antecedents of loneliness; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010112453326">Rokach (1998)</xref> suggested six stages of loneliness, all of which have provided valuable perspectives in the development of an understanding of the broad concept.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010112453326">Weiss (1973)</xref> proposed that loneliness was based on the notion that deficiencies in different forms of social relationships would result in loneliness and loneliness-related affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112453326">Heinrich &amp; Gullone, 2006</xref>). Weiss’s typology defined <italic>emotional</italic> loneliness as the absence of a close, intimate attachment to another person, which results in feelings of emptiness and anxiety; whereas <italic>social</italic> loneliness was defined as the absence of a social network of friends of which the person feels a part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112453326">Heinrich &amp; Gullone, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112453326">Peplau and Perlman (1982)</xref> classified the causes of loneliness into two categories. The first was events or changes in a person’s life that precipitate the onset of loneliness. The second targeted factors that predispose individuals to becoming lonely or to remaining lonely over time. An important antecedent of loneliness is related to a person’s desired social needs. Life cycle changes in a person’s desire for social relations may precipitate loneliness, especially if not accompanied by corresponding changes in actual relations, and relationships may be seen as deficient because they fail to meet the person’s basic social needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112453326">Peplau &amp; Perlman, 1982</xref>). Loneliness is not just affected by the presence or absence of relationships; it is also influenced by the quality of social relations that provide for human intimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112453326">Peplau &amp; Perlman, 1982</xref>). Being a part of an intimate relationship may help ease the effect of a stressful life event on a person’s mental health, whereas not having a friend or significant other with whom to share feelings can increase depressive reactions to adverse life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010112453326">Murphy, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Through research and working with clients, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010112453326">Rokach (1998)</xref> determined that loneliness may be situationally determined, or conversely, there may not be an obvious reason. Generally, people do not immediately recognize that they are lonely but reach that determination through experiencing several stages: (a) pain and awareness of a problem, (b) denial, (c) alarm and realization, (d) searching for causes and self-doubt, (e) acceptance, and (f) coping.</p>
<p>Loneliness does not exist in isolation from other life influences; thus, our primary interest was in its relationship to chronic illness. Loneliness can have a major impact on a person’s mental and physical well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112453326">Heinrich &amp; Gullone, 2006</xref>). Researchers have observed that people suffer from loneliness associated with illness and illness-related situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112453326">Cuevas-Renaud, Sobrevilla-Calvo, &amp; Almanza; 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112453326">Fuki, Koike, Ooba, &amp; Uchitomi, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112453326">Fees, Martin, and Poon (1999)</xref> reported a high correlation between loneliness and physical illness. Low self-esteem, decreased optimism, poor quality of relationships, and being hospitalized for chronic health problems are factors associated with chronic illness found to increase the vulnerability of older people to loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112453326">Chen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112453326">Flett, Harcourt, &amp; Alpass, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010112453326">Keele-Card, Foxall, &amp; Barron, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010112453326">Murphy, 2006</xref>). Thus, it can be seen that the relationship between physical illness and loneliness has been investigated. However, findings between studies have been conflicting, possibly because the circumstances surrounding individuals are diverse—for example, urban versus rural environments.</p>
<p>It is widely accepted that loneliness is associated with a person’s social needs. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010112453326">Verwoerdt (1976)</xref>, what is most important is not the quantity of the social relationships but rather the quality, thus accounting for the observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010112453326">Lauder, Sharkey, and Mummery (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112453326">Carnevali (1986)</xref> that loneliness was not necessarily limited to those living in a rural community. Variations in the individual’s type of chronic illness and social network were two factors found in the literature to influence loneliness. Of interest to this investigation was the perspective of loneliness as seen on a day-to-day basis through the eyes of rural women living with chronic conditions.</p>

<sec id="section2-0898010112453326" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study was conducted as a secondary analysis of data collected during the Women to Women (WTW) Project at Montana State University. The overarching goal of WTW was to help middle-aged women successfully adapt to living with chronic illnesses in resource-limited rural areas via a computer-based support and health education intervention. The study was approved by the University Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects. A detailed description of the WTW methodology is provided elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112453326">Cudney, Winters, Weinert, &amp; Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898010112453326">Weinert, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010112453326">Weinert &amp; Hill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898010112453326">Winters et al., 2006</xref>); thus, only an overview will be presented here.</p>
<sec id="section3-0898010112453326">
<title>Criteria</title>
<p>The participants were recruited through health agencies, media sources, and word of mouth. Inclusion criteria included the following: (a) be a woman 35 to 60 years of age; (b) have a diagnosis of one or more chronic illnesses; (c) live at least 25 miles outside a population center of 12,500 or more or on a ranch or farm or in a small town; (d) have the ability to use mail, telephone, and computer communications; and (e) be able to read and write English.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0898010112453326">
<title>Design</title>
<p>WTW consisted of a 22-week computer-based intervention in which the participants were randomized into three groups: an intense intervention group that participated in a virtual support group (<italic>Koffee Klatch</italic>) and online health education discussions (<italic>Health Roundtable</italic>), a less intense intervention group that accessed online independent study health teaching units without access to discussion forums, and a nonintervention or control group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0898010112453326">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Data from 57 women who participated in the intense intervention group were used for the secondary analysis. Ninety-six percent of the women were Caucasian, whereas the remaining 4% were American Indian. Their mean age was 52.2 years. Of the participants, 44% had dependents younger than 18 living at home with them, 5% cared for an adult in their home, and 30% were employed outside of their homes. The majority of the women were married, 3.5% were divorced, and 5.3% were never married. The women had completed on average 14.7 years of school. The mean number of years since the onset of symptoms of their chronic illness was 19.9 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0898010112453326">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>The study used both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The first involved the analysis of participants’ self-reported loneliness via a quantitative measurement tool; the second consisted of a qualitative analysis of participants’ discussions.</p>
<sec id="section7-0898010112453326">
<title>Quantitative data</title>
<p>Loneliness was measured by the UCLA Loneliness Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898010112453326">Russell, Peplau, &amp; Cutrona, 1980</xref>), which was based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010112453326">Weiss’s (1973)</xref> typology of loneliness. It consisted of 20 items, and participants responded to the items by providing a numerical rating on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 4, with 1 = <italic>never</italic>, 2 = <italic>rarely</italic>, 3 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, and 4 = <italic>always</italic>. The total score was obtained by summing all items, resulting in a range of scores from 20 to 80—the higher the scores, the higher degree of self-reported loneliness.</p>
<p>The UCLA Loneliness Scale was a part of a paper/pencil battery of psychosocial measures that was administered at intervals to all participants six times over a 2-year period. The questionnaires were mailed at baseline, 5, 8, and 15 months to assess short-term benefits of the 22-week intervention and also at 18 and 24 months to assess for long-term benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010112453326">Weinert et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Efforts to facilitate successful recognition of the expression of loneliness within the qualitative data included identification of a subset of women who had the uppermost scores on the UCLA Loneliness Scale. This was accomplished by selecting women whose scores were in the highest quartile, which included 12 of the 57 participants. These women were considered the most vulnerable to loneliness. They had expressed a high level of loneliness on the loneliness measure; therefore, it was of interest to explore their conversations with one another to determine whether loneliness was expressed directly, indirectly, or not at all.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0898010112453326">
<title>Qualitative data</title>
<p>In addition to the scores on the UCLA Loneliness Scale that formed a partial basis for the quantitative analysis in this study, the computer exchanges in <italic>Koffee Klatch</italic> were downloaded and entered into the computer program QSR NUD*IST for qualitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010112453326">QSR International, 1997</xref>). The virtual forum, <italic>Koffee Klatch</italic>, allowed the women to interact directly with one another through initiating or responding to postings. The postings or exchanges included the sharing of life experiences, voicing concerns, and offering advice and support—much as they might have done had they been sitting together in a face-to-face group. The women were free to post exchanges on any issue or topic they wished, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The researchers monitored the exchanges but did not actively participate. Each of the exchanges was recorded verbatim in chronological order by date and time, including any responses by other participants. The messages were de-identified, and each person was assigned a number to protect the identity of all of the participants.</p>
<p>Since a secondary analysis of existing qualitative data was the only option available to the investigator, the method used to analyze the content of the computer exchanges for the expression of loneliness was most closely related to the least theoretical of qualitative approaches, qualitative descriptive design. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898010112453326">Sandelowski (2000)</xref>, this approach is an eclectic but reasonable combination of sampling, data collection, analysis, and representational techniques. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010112453326">Thomas (2003)</xref> further described the approach as including a general form of content analysis that consists of three stages: deductive, inductive, and integrative. Deductively the data were coded according to the conceptual framework and the aims of each phase of the project—thus the inclusion of “loneliness” in the coding tree. Inductively, the themes that emerged from the online interchanges were added to the coding schema. Integration was achieved by examining the qualitative data for linkages and relationships among the themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010112453326">Winters, Cudney, &amp; Sullivan, 2010</xref>). This approach was used to ferret out prominent themes and subthemes in the narrative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112453326">Polit &amp; Beck, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis of the exchanges began with review of the items earlier coded as <italic>loneliness</italic> by the WTW research team. In the vast amount of data that included all 57 participants’ exchanges in the WTW study, only three exchanges had previously been coded as loneliness. This necessitated a new review of the exchanges, using the following key words: <italic>loneliness, lonely</italic>, and <italic>lonesome</italic>. Two exchanges included the term <italic>loneliness</italic>, three contained the term <italic>lonely</italic>, and zero exchanges included the term <italic>lonesome</italic>. Of the five exchanges, three were indirectly referred to in a poem. It was evident that loneliness was not directly addressed among the participants, indicating a need for a much more thorough search of the data for subtle expressions. Therefore, a more rigorous review of the data was performed, looking for references in the exchanges that could be representative of a woman’s sense of loneliness.</p>
<p>Postings from the subset of the 12 women with high loneliness scores were accessed and analyzed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010112453326">Thomas’s (2003)</xref> three phases: deductive, inductive, and integrative. The deductive phase necessitated reading each of the women’s postings from start to finish, looking for any references to a sense of loneliness. Initially, all implied expressions, direct or indirect, were recorded. However, exchanges that did not seem to pertain to loneliness were ultimately withdrawn from the content analysis. The inductive phase involved a reexamination of all the exchanges identified as pertaining to loneliness with a view toward identifying themes or patterns. The integrative phase entailed a critical examination of the identified themes and patterns of loneliness while attempting to capture exemplars of each in the narratives.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section10-0898010112453326">
<title>Quantitative: UCLA Loneliness Scores</title>
<p>Reliability estimates for the UCLA Loneliness Scale were assessed using Chronbach’s alpha. Chronbach’s alpha of .94 was demonstrated for the UCLA Loneliness Scale. High scores on the loneliness scale indicate a high degree of expressed loneliness, with possible scores of 20 to 80. The range of scores in this study for all participants (<italic>n</italic> = 57) was 21 to 68; for those in the upper quartile, the range was 52 to 68.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0898010112453326">
<title>Qualitative: Themes of Loneliness</title>
<p>The search for the terms <italic>lonely</italic> or <italic>loneliness</italic> provided very little insight into the phenomenon of loneliness as represented in the exchanges. For the most part, the women did not openly express feelings of loneliness or use the word <italic>lonely</italic>. However, implied expressions of loneliness were exposed during the re-review of the women’s exchanges. The number of postings per woman varied greatly, as did the content.</p>
<p>Three prominent themes in the women’s postings implied loneliness. These were longing for loved ones, changing relationships, and listening in the background without personally posting messages. One other explanation of loneliness was identified, but it was experienced by just one person and appeared to be influenced by the effects of living in a rural community.</p>
<sec id="section12-0898010112453326">
<title>Longing for loved ones</title>
<p>There were eight postings related to yearning for family members. For one woman, it was missing a daughter who had moved. For another, it was a sense of longing for a mother with Alzheimer’s disease who had been moved to a nursing home. One participant wrote about her teenagers’ birthdays, commenting on how fast they were growing up. Another participant’s parents had passed away, she had no children, and she had a sister who lived “a mere 240 miles away.” The following quote demonstrates the loneliness a woman was experiencing without actually stating that she was lonely:
<disp-quote>
<p>I wish I could ride down and visit my daughter, but it wouldn’t be fair to her having me along in the shape I’m in and my daughter is so busy right now that she wouldn’t have time to visit much anyhow.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0898010112453326">
<title>Changing relationships</title>
<p>Another theme was identified that revealed trying times among the women and their spouses as well as siblings. There seemed to be detachment in some of the marital relationships or lack of support. One woman expressed it this way:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is hard when you are married to someone who stays to themselves most of the time. I find that D has changed a lot since we moved up here and I have to stay at home most of the time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The women’s illnesses appeared to be a factor that affected their relationships with their spouses and may have contributed to any loneliness the women experienced. For example, one woman stated, “I think my disease frustrates my husband and so when I am not well he tends to stay away.” When another woman tried to discuss her illness and what her future held, her husband “just grumbled and walked away.” One of the participants commented on how her relationship with her sister had been affected by her illness:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Sister:</speaker>
<p>You have everything wrong with you.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Woman:</speaker>
<p>I told her: “It’s part of my fibro.”</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0898010112453326">
<title>Listening</title>
<p>Rather than post online, some women preferred to “stand back in the shadows” and listen. One such participant described herself as a “reader” who did not post much but loved listening and learning from others. Interestingly, this participant had the highest loneliness score of the subset and had one of the highest numbers of posts by the end of the project—once she began to post, she did so frequently. In fact, at one point she stated, “Please keep writing. I mostly encourage others, but found that this is even powerful. Every time you write, a little more of you gets connected and you don’t feel so alone.” One woman shared that although she read most of the messages and enjoyed them, she really did not know what to say to the group and expressed her sadness by saying, “I cry pretty much about everything.” This revelation engendered a like response from another woman, who said, “I also cry a lot and feel down in the dumps, so you are not alone.” The respondent encouraged her to stay in touch since she and her opinions and support were needed. However, the “reader” posted only four messages, becoming one of two of the group with the fewest number of postings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0898010112453326">
<title>Rural factors</title>
<p>Loneliness was influenced in at least one instance by the rural community to which the participant had moved with her husband. During the day, she was home alone except for her pets and felt like an outcast in the community because she had not been born or raised there. She described her feelings:
<disp-quote>
<p>What hurts me most is that when I go to the school and talk to the secretary she is very sweet, and when she is out of the school she will look the other way, and I have said “hello” to some of the other mothers and they turn away.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Issues pertaining to rurality and loneliness did not appear to be a factor for the majority of the women in the subset. In a discussion that related to rurality and being homebound, one woman opined, “I guess for this group of women it is a good thing we like solitude and we do not mind our own company.”</p>

<title>Other Findings: The Larger Picture</title>
<p>While reviewing the postings for implied expressions of loneliness, it became apparent that it was important to look at the big picture with regard to each participant’s postings. For instance, the woman who was having a difficult time adjusting to rural life was also having difficulty with her husband, and her child had been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. Interestingly, she had posted two poems with references to loneliness, had the second highest UCLA loneliness score in the subset at 64.00, and had posted 218 times—nearly double that of the next highest number of postings.</p>
<p>The participant with the second highest number of postings at 112 had a loneliness score of 52, which was one of the lowest in the subset of 12 participants but was high compared with the total group. She was estranged from her mother and brother, secondary to her illness. The tenor of her postings was a possible reflection of her manner of dealing with her feelings:
<disp-quote>
<p>People are like pressure cookers, they have to have a relief valve somewhere especially if you are a person who tends to keep things inside and left unsaid.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two postings contained the word <italic>loneliness</italic> in text that was not in a poem. In one, a woman wrote of loneliness as though it were an understood part of all of their lives: “Hopefully with the change of the season we can all have a change in our loneliness.” Loneliness, in this instance, was written more as an afterthought than a direct expression of the feeling or experience of it. The other instance when the term <italic>lonely</italic> was actually used was in a response to another woman’s posting. It read thus: “I also cry a lot and feel lonely and not wanted, but that’s just me.”</p>
<p>Analysis of loneliness, as it was expressed in the online forum, provided a firsthand look at how this feeling was experienced by the women in their day-to-day lives. The correspondence among the women was rich in texture, and “family-like” relationships developed over time among several participants. Discussions varied widely from lighthearted subjects to intimate topics. The expression of the feeling of loneliness was somewhat elusive with the term itself actually being used very few times. The women whose postings were reviewed in depth were selected because they were determined to be the most vulnerable to loneliness based on their UCLA Loneliness Scale scores. Careful review of their correspondence confirmed that they were, in fact, lonely, although their expressions of these feelings were often subtle. Overall, it was evident that the experience and expression of loneliness was unique to each individual.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The intent of this study was to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon of loneliness and its relationship with chronic illness as seen through the eyes of rural women with chronic conditions. Perhaps the most important factor associated with loneliness in this research was the relationship between the most vulnerable group of women and their perspectives on loneliness. In spite of their high scores on the loneliness measure, loneliness was not a topic of conversation initiated by the women. Although some were talkative in the online forum, they did not make obvious statements that indicated that they might be lonely. Other women, who spoke in the forum, freely shared many of the frustrations they were experiencing, but none directly addressed loneliness. This observation is consistent with data reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112453326">Carnevali (1986)</xref> that the threatening and alienating features of loneliness may evoke a denial response. People who experience loneliness acutely are unable to talk about it during or even after the episode. The greater the people’s sufferings are, the more obscure and disguised their complaints become (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112453326">Carnevali, 1986</xref>). Also, the stigma associated with loneliness may cause people to be reluctant and embarrassed to admit that they are lonely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112453326">Peplau &amp; Perlman, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Limitations of this research included the small sample size and the time constraints of a 22-week intervention. In addition, because a secondary analysis was conducted, the investigator was restricted to using data that had been previously collected. This research study was also limited because the analysis of the women’s conversations was conducted solely by the study’s investigator in consultation with WTW research team members. Although careful consideration was given to the review of loneliness in the narrative discussions, with just one individual’s perspective represented, it is possible that an important indicator of loneliness could have been missed.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Significant information was identified in this study that holds value for nurses caring for chronically ill individuals in rural and nonrural communities or locales. An important message to be captured from this research was that the women in this study were very lonely by self-report on a questionnaire, but in their day-to-day lives it was not directly discussed or addressed with the other women in the study.</p>
<p>Because loneliness has been described as a painful experience and can have long-reaching effects on an individual’s health, it is a factor to be considered in planning nursing care for individuals who may be at risk because of physical and/or emotional isolation. Yet there is no concrete set of risk factors for loneliness, and the concept is so ambiguous that a universal definition is not available. The consideration of loneliness in nursing care planning is easy to dismiss because of the difficulty in identifying it, the shame associated with reporting it, and the difficulty in resolving it. The identification of loneliness can be an elusive endeavor and, as such, may not appear on the nurse’s radar.</p>
<p>However, loneliness can affect the social domain of one’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112453326">Boiven, Hymel, &amp; Bukowski, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112453326">Heinrich &amp; Gullone, 2006</xref>) and be a negative influence on one’s quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112453326">Mullins &amp; Dugan, 1990</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial for nurses or other allied health professionals to pay close attention to cues from their clients that might signal a sense of loneliness and to provide an atmosphere in which a person can feel free to share feelings. For example, if a cue is expressed by a client, the health care provider might encourage the speaker to continue with short, gentle comments like “uh-huh,” “really?” “tell me more,” and so on or reflect back the speaker’s comment such as, “You keep things inside?” Making an observation (“You look concerned . . .”) may also help the person feel free to express any feelings, such as loneliness. These and other techniques of active listening may be the key to identifying loneliness in individuals at risk.</p>
<p>As was seen in this study, it is to be expected that each client’s presentation or expression of loneliness will be unique. For example, some are talkative and cheerful; in these instances, it would be beneficial to assess the client’s overall risk factors for loneliness in order to determine whether the cheeriness is genuine. Nurses are in a unique position to observe loneliness cues and focus clients toward recognition of loneliness, investigate the cause of loneliness, and propose implementation of interventions directed at its resolution.</p>
<p>Effective interventions were not addressed in this study. However, an intervention supported by data from the larger WTW study was social support. Social support has been widely explored in the literature and is believed to have a direct link to loneliness. The importance of intimacy in people’s lives has been cited in this literature, and some have concluded that deficiencies in intimacy may result in loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112453326">Carnevali, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010112453326">Verwoerdt, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010112453326">Weiss, 1973</xref>). Nurses have the ability to evaluate a person’s social support network and recommend strategies to strengthen that support, especially with regard to intimate contacts.</p>
<p>The nurse must be a bit of a sleuth and be alert for signs of and circumstances associated with loneliness. This is a challenging task because the presentation of loneliness will differ from person to person. Providing holistic care for women with a chronic illness includes addressing the possibility of loneliness, which usually hovers beneath the surface; however, it is necessary to assist women in adapting to such changes in their lives that the illness has imposed. The mystery of loneliness remains largely unsolved; however, further research and awareness of its potential influence on those with chronic conditions can lead to positive changes in the lives of rural women with chronic conditions.</p>
