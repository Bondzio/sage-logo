<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is an increasing emphasis on growth with equity. Promotion of self-employment and micro entrepreneurship are on the priority list of central as well as state planning. For better economic performance state interventions, still continue. The government is playing a balancing role through policy mechanism. Despite enormous efforts, about one-fourth of the population is living below the poverty line. Speed of inclusive growth pattern is quite slow. More than 30 crore people are socially and economically backward. Though most of them are skilled in many arts and crafts but they lack capital support to start any income generating activity. If the financial assistance along with the proper guidance and training is provided to this ill-fated population they can become a useful part of the society and join the main economic stream of the national economy. In this regard performance of Self Help Groups (SHGs) for pooling small savings and developing micro enterprises has really been a fascinating experience. It has, over the last 20 years, become the largest programme in the world providing financial services for self employment to the poor. By promoting income generating activities, it has significant impact on improving the socio-economic status of women and youth belonging to low income groups. SHGs have become familiar in both rural and urban areas. The author’s admiration that SHGs have proved as a magic bullet for arranging micro finance for the low income social groups may not be an exaggeration.</p>
<p>There are thousands of reports, articles and case studies focussing on one or the other aspect of SHGs. These reports, articles and case studies reveal that desired contribution of SHGs has been positive but at the same time there have been a few drawbacks either at the planning stage or at operational stage which have hindered the accelerated growth of SHGs. This book <italic>Banking on Self-Help Groups: Twenty Years on</italic>, reviews the current position of Self Help Groups movement, identifies the policy gaps and highlights the pragmatic steps for further development. It is an evaluation study focussing on cost-effectiveness, sustainability and socio-economic impact of SHG-movement. The author has attempted to answer many questions but still there are number of questions which need further investigation.</p>
<p>This book in hand describes the nature of relationship between the banks and SHGs and refreshes/updates knowledge of the persons interested in the subject. The author feels that the pressure of multiple pull and push factors, working covertly and overtly, cause unavoidable ups and downs in the supply/demand of finance and create painful disturbances for the SHGs. In spite of the best efforts, ails and ills are caused here or there. The author says rightly that it is due to the lack of foresight on the part of both the SHGs and the financial institutions. It may be true that even today the bank assistance to SHGs is granted by the pressure of politicians, bureaucrats, friends, relatives or under-the-table dealings. There is a feeling emerging from the overall country-wide environment that everything or anything can be obtained for a price. This is disappointing for the healthy development SHGs.</p>

<title>Organization of the Book</title>
<p>It contains nine chapters. In these chapters the author has described general position of the prevailing relationship between SHGs and the banking system and pointed out the need for a new direction required for the healthy development of both. In this regard, he has described nature of SHGs, overall performance, non-banking and banking sources of funds, He says that the SHGs are flexible and innovative and can adapt easily. Further, he has rightly pointed out that the political climate of fear and distrust created by constant criticism and political oratory has left bankers with no options but to support safe accounts. Bank employees are indifferent and unwilling to take decisions and files run from one person to another. This compels the SHGs to go for costly private borrowing. If the SHGs are discouraged, as is being done, both economy and the people especially, with lower purchasing power will suffer.</p>

<title>Objective</title>
<p>The book concentrates on facilitating need-based finance for the SHGs against the biased attitude of the banks and financial institutions. The coverage of the book has its focus on making the SHGs aware of the constraints pertaining to the sources of funds, including debts and thus enables them to reduce their forced dependence on the banking system. The author has attempted to enrich them with the knowledge of rules and regulations as well as the procedures and practices of banks and financial institutions, so that they become conscious of their rights and duties and learn to deal with the system most efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>The book also suggests to the credit providers to be hassle-free and consider exclusively socio-economic factors while financing SHGs. The author attempts to describe the nature of microfinance, its sources, limitations and impact on SHGs for poverty alleviation. He rightly defines the microfinance as an extension of small loans to individuals or SHGs who are too poor to qualify for the traditional bank loans, as they have no assets to be offered as guarantee. His study reveals that microfinance has emerged as an important tool for improving and vitalizing the SHGs to join main economic stream. It matters a lot in a developing economy like India to enhance the self-esteem and self-confidence of poor households by helping them to realize their dreams through income generating activities. The basic philosophy of microfinance is that the common citizens have the potential to change the future course of the economy if an enabling environment is provided to them.</p>
<p>It is really heartening that the institutions offering microfinance are not only covering their costs and risks but are also generating decent profits. It is win-win proposition for all the stakeholders and proving a sustainable measure to reduce poverty at grass-root level. It has been an inspiring model to kindle the hopes and aspirations of poor households across the country. However it has a long way to cover to bring rural–urban masses under its umbrella. It points out rightly that there is great need for keeping the politicians and unethical administrators out for the success of this movement. Further, there is need to repeat the cycle of macro-financing to enable first generation SHGs for healthy sustenance.</p>

<title>Policy Implications</title>
<p>Supported by field research, some of his observations pointed out in different chapters do carry weight as sound suggestions for policy reforms. Namely, (<italic>a</italic>) SHGs want need-based funds; (<italic>b</italic>) neither the SHGs nor the social control are responsible for inefficiency of bank employees and the prevailing socio-political agenda but it is the result of the general political moral decay; (<italic>c</italic>) confidence in the ability of the SHGs is proclaimed but not practiced; (<italic>d</italic>) prudential norms for banks accounting have achieved non-availability of available funds to industry; (<italic>e</italic>) functioning of the banks has no relation with productivity of the employees; (<italic>f</italic>) assistance, mostly, reaches a few—usually those undeserving but politically well placed; (<italic>g</italic>) Banks and financial institutions have enough schemes but their implementation is dismal. These perceptions/observations highlighted in different chapters of the book do point out to the need for a change in the current policy scenario so that the gains arising from liberalization are consolidated.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is mushroom growth in the literature on SHGs. This book is an additional number. Typical illustrations and examples make this book reader friendly. It attempts to provide a step-by-step approach for developing qualities and characteristics SHGs must possess; how the need for funds be assessed and fulfilled; how to operate different activities and manage resources smoothly and automatically. It presents a brief eye-view of the procedural, behavioural and strategic issues with humorous illustrations. It shows that every SHG is unique, operating mostly with undocumented rules. The book containing tables, graphs and boxes, would be useful for the bankers, self help groups and policy makers.</p>
