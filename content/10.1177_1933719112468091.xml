<title>Oocytes From In Vitro Stem Cells</title>
<p>Mimicking the female germ cell development in vitro has been a long sought challenge for reproductive biologists and clinicians alike. Its achievement would not only enable a better understanding of the key mechanisms by which oocytes are formed but could also ultimately lead to the overcome of many infertility disorders.</p>
<p>These goals may now be closer to reach, as Hayashi et al have just reported in the journal <italic>Science</italic> (<italic>Sciencexpress</italic>, October 2012) the ability to reconstitute the female germ cell developmental pathway in mice from in vitro primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) to fully functional oocytes.</p>
<p>Hayashi and colleagues had recently shown that embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells from XY mice could be induced into epiblast-like cells (iPSCs), which could in turn be induced into PGCLCs that would undergo spermatogenesis and were capable of generating offspring. Using a similar approach, this time the investigators used XX embryonic stem cells and iPSCs that were induced into PGCLCs, which were then aggregated with embryonic gonadal somatic cells to form reconstituted ovaries in vitro. The authors observed that the PGCLCs in the reconstituted ovary in vitro underwent X chromosome reactivation, imprinting erasure, cyst formation, and exhibited meiotic potential.</p>
<p>Moreover, when these reconstituted ovaries were transplanted under ovarian bursa or kidney corpuscles of recipient mice, Hayashi et al observed that the PGCLCs developed into germinal vesicle-stage oocytes, which were able to give rise to fertile offspring after in vitro maturation and fertilization.</p>
<p>Although some of the most exciting consequences of these findings, such as the production of oocytes for the treatment of infertility, may still be far from being ready to use in humans, the study presented by Hayashi et al constitutes, nonetheless, a major breakthrough in the field. It will certainly further allow the investigation of the mechanisms that rule proper oogenesis, with numerous important biological applications.</p>

<title>Preventing the Inheritance of Mitochondrial Diseases</title>
<p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are associated with devastating diseases that often severely impair the affected individuals’ quality of life and lead to premature death. The clinical manifestations of these diseases vary, commonly affecting the organs and tissues with higher energy requirements, such as the brain, heart, muscle, pancreas, and kidney. In addition, the time of manifestation and severity of the symptoms can also differ, depending on the specific mtDNA mutation and on the heteroplasmy levels (the number of mtDNA copies affected within the same individual).</p>
<p>To date, there is no cure for mitochondria-associated diseases and the treatments available can only alleviate the symptoms and delay the disease progression up to a certain level. Therefore, the urge for strategies that prevent the transmission of these diseases to the offspring is high.</p>
<p>Since mtDNA is exclusively inherited from the mother, Tachibana et al approached the issue by completely replacing the mutated mtDNA of a mitochondrial disease patient’s oocyte with the healthy mitochondrial genome from an oocyte donor using spindle-chromosomal complex transfer (ST). Their results have just been published in the journal <italic>Nature</italic> (<italic>Nature</italic>, advanced online publication, October 2012).</p>
<p>The methodology used by Tachibana and colleagues involved the isolation and transplantation of the nuclear genetic material from a patient’s unfertilized oocyte into the cytoplasm of an enucleated donor oocyte, with healthy mitochondria. The transplanted oocytes were then fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The authors observed that the fertilization rate between the ST oocytes and the controls was similar, although there was a significant increase in abnormal fertilization, as determined by irregular number of pronuclei, in the ST zygotes. Investigation of the issue indicated that human meiotic spindles may sometimes undergo premature activation during the ST manipulations, which may lead to incomplete resumption of meiosis after fertilization and to a consequential abnormal number of pronuclei.</p>
<p>However, among the normally fertilized ST oocytes, blastocyst development and embryonic stem cell isolation rates were comparable to controls.</p>
<p>Tachibana et al also characterized the embryonic stem cell lines derived from the ST zygotes and determined that they presented euploid karyotypes and mtDNA that was exclusively of donor origin.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to verify whether a mismatch between mtDNA and nuclear DNA haplotypes could cause mitochondrial dysfunctions in future ST children, the authors conducted a thorough 3-year follow-up study on monkey ST offspring born in 2009 and concluded that in these animals there were no mitochondrial dysfunctions observed.</p>
<p>Thus, the results presented by Tachibana and colleagues elegantly demonstrate that mtDNA can efficiently be replaced in human oocytes, opening the doors for a new era of germ line gene therapy for inherited mitochodrial diseases.</p>
