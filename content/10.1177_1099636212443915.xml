<abstract>
<p>This paper assesses the impact damage and post-impact compression properties of a foam core sandwich composite reinforced with through-thickness z-pins. Low-speed flat-wise compression tests performed on the sandwich composite revealed that z-pins improved the elastic modulus, crush strength and absorbed energy capacity (by 260–300%). However, these property improvements do not necessarily translate into a reduction in the amount of damage suffered by the z-pinned sandwich composite under localised (point) impact loading. There was no reduction to the impact damage area or an improvement to the post-impact compression properties of the z-pinned sandwich composite at low-impact energies (when damage was confined to the impacted face skin). Z-pins were only marginally effective at reducing the impact damage when the impact energy was high enough to cause core crushing. Z-pins absorbed high-impact energy via splitting, microbuckling and fragmentation during core crushing which reduced slightly the amount of impact damage to the sandwich composite. However, this did not cause a significant improvement to the post-impact compressive stiffness and strength for most energy levels.</p>

<p>Sandwich composites with through-the-thickness reinforcement of the core material offer the possibility of overcoming many of the problems inherent with conventional sandwich materials. Problems with conventional sandwich composites (with an unreinforced core material) include low resistance against through-thickness compression, crushing and impact loads. The low stiffness and strength of the core material provide little resistance against crushing of the sandwich composite when subjected to impact. Furthermore, cracking between the face skins and core can occur under impact loading due to the low interfacial bond strength. Both core crushing and skin-core cracking can reduce the post-impact properties of sandwich composites, particularly the compressive stiffness, strength and fatigue life. A potential solution to the low-impact damage resistance of sandwich composites is stiffening and strengthening of the core material with through-thickness fibre bundles or pins. The through-thickness reinforcement is inserted into the core material at an orthogonal or inclined angle to increase the in-plane and through-thickness properties of the sandwich material without adding significantly to the weight. The through-thickness reinforcement can be inserted into the core in various ways, including 3D (orthogonal) weaving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099636212443915">1</xref>], stitching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099636212443915">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099636212443915">6</xref>], tufting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099636212443915">7</xref>] and z-pinning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099636212443915">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099636212443915">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Through-thickness reinforcement of the core material can increase the stiffness, strength and energy absorption of sandwich composites. For example, Rice et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099636212443915"> 15</xref>] measured an increase of over 2500% to the flat-wise compressive strength of a sandwich composite when its foam core was reinforced with z-pins. Furthermore, recent research by Long and Guiqiong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099636212443915">18</xref>] has shown that the surface indentation strength of foam core sandwich composites under quasi-static loading is increased greatly by z-pins. The large improvement to the mechanical properties and indentation strength of sandwich composites suggest that their impact damage resistance may also be increased with through-thickness reinforcement.</p>
<p>While there is a large body of theoretical and experimental research which proves that the through-thickness reinforcement of sandwich materials increases the core properties under quasi-static loading conditions, there is little published work into the impact and dynamic properties. Vaidya and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099636212443915">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099636212443915">10</xref>] experimentally studied the low-velocity impact response of z-pinned sandwich composites and found that the z-pins reduced the amount of damage. However, the reduction to the amount of impact damage due to z-pinning was not quantified. Fan and Xioa-qing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1099636212443915">20</xref>] found that through-thickness stitching of foam core sandwich composites also increased the impact resistance. In related studies, Vaidya et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099636212443915">10</xref>] and Cartié and Fleck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099636212443915">12</xref>] showed that z-pinning was effective at increasing the crush strength and absorbed energy capacity of foam core sandwich materials under high-speed compression loading. Despite these studies, much remains unknown about the impact damage properties of sandwich composites with through-thickness core reinforcement, including the crush resistance and impact damage mechanisms. Furthermore, no information is available on the post-impact mechanical properties of sandwich composites with through-thickness reinforcement.</p>
<p>This paper presents an experimental investigation into the impact damage properties of a foam core sandwich composite reinforced with z-pins. The sandwich composite used in this study consisted of thin carbon fibre-epoxy face skins covering a thick polymer foam core and is representative of the sandwich material used in aircraft structures which are prone to localised impact loading (e.g. bird strike, hail stones). The sandwich composite was reinforced in the through-thickness (orthogonal) direction with z-pins made of high-strength carbon fibre composite. The effect of z-pins on the amount of impact damage and the post-impact compression properties of the sandwich composite was assessed for two impact energy regimes that created different types of damage: low-impact energy loading which caused indentation damage to the impacted face skin only and high-impact energy loading which caused indentation damage to the impacted skin and crushing of the foam core.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1099636212443915"><title>Sandwich composites</title>
<p>Impact tests were performed on unpinned and z-pinned sandwich composite panels consisting of two face skins of carbon fibre-epoxy laminate covering a low-density core of polymer foam. Each skin was made using unidirectional prepreg tape (VTM 264) stacked in a quasi-isotropic ply pattern with a thickness of 2 mm. The core material was closed-cell polymethacrylimid (PMI) foam (Rohacell Type 71RIST supplied by Evonik GmbH) with a thickness of 6 mm and density of 0.075 g/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099636212443915">3</xref></sup>. The foam had an elastic modulus of 105 MPa, compressive strength of 1.7 MPa and shear strength of 1.3 MPa when measured at a quasi-static loading rate.</p>
<p>The z-pins used to reinforce the sandwich composite in the through-thickness direction were pultruded rods of T300 carbon/bismaleimide (Albany Engineered Composites Pty. Ltd) with a diameter of 0.28 mm, longitudinal elastic modulus of 135 GPa and axial compressive strength of 1.6 GPa. The z-pins were inserted into the sandwich composite using a process similar to the z-pinning of fibre-polymer laminates, which is described in detail by Mouritz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1099636212443915">22</xref>] and Chang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099636212443915">23</xref>]. The process basically involved placing a foam carrier containing the z-pins over the top skin of the sandwich material. The foam carrier provided lateral support to the z-pins which avoided buckling when they were driven into the sandwich composite. The foam also ensured an equal spacing between the z-pins (which were 1.75 mm apart). The z-pins were embedded through both carbon fibre-epoxy face skins (while in the uncured condition) and foam core using an ultrasonic device which generated high-frequency (20 kHz) compressive waves. The sandwich composite was reinforced to the z-pin volume content of 2%, with the pins being arranged in a square grid pattern. The z-pins were inserted in the orthogonal direction, although the fully embedded pins were inclined over a range of shallow angles as revealed by X-ray computed tomography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1099636212443915">Figure 1</xref>). The majority of z-pins were aligned within 5–6° of the orthogonal direction, and the average offset angle was 2.1°. Theoretical analysis by Long and Guiqiong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099636212443915">18</xref>] indicates that this shallow range of z-pin angles is unlikely to significantly change the through-thickness properties compared to all the pins being perfectly aligned in the orthogonal direction. After the z-pinning process was complete, the sandwich composite was cured inside an autoclave at 276 kPa and 120°C for 1 h. A sandwich composite without z-pins was produced under identical conditions as the control material. The laminate face skins were bonded to the foam core during curing without the use of polymer adhesive.

<sec id="sec4-1099636212443915"><title>Impact testing</title>
<p>Impact tests were performed by dropping a 25-mm diameter hemispherical steel tup (1.5 kg) onto the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich composites. Impact tests were performed at increasing incident energy levels up to 50 J. The impact machine was instrumented with a laser photo/diode system to measure the inbound and rebound velocities of the tup, and from this the amount of impact energy absorbed by the sandwich composite specimens was determined. That is, the absorbed impact energy of the sandwich composite specimens was determined from the difference between the incident and rebound energies of the tub, which were measured experimentally. Following testing, the specimens were visually inspected to measure the size and shape of the impact damage region. Impacted specimens were also inspected using X-ray computed microtomography (SkyScan 1172). The tomography was performed using an X-ray source voltage operated at 49 kV and 167 μA, and the specimens were rotated through the X-ray beam in 0.2° steps with an exposure time of 1770 ms. Pixel size of the tomography images was set to 17 µm, and this provided adequate resolution to identify damage to the z-pins (which were 280 µm wide).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1099636212443915"><title>Flat-wise and in-plane compression testing</title>
<p>The through-thickness compression properties of the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich composites were measured using the flat-wise test method specified in ASTM C393. The specimens were 40 mm long, 40 mm wide and 10 mm thick. A compression load was applied at a low-speed displacement rate of 0.5 mm/min until the original thickness of the sandwich composite was reduced by 40% (i.e. compressed from 10 mm down to 6 mm), at which point significant densification occurred due to core crushing and compaction. Ten samples of both the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich composites were tested under identical flat-wise compression conditions. Damage caused to both sandwich materials during testing was monitored using acoustic emission monitoring with the noise being recorded using a single wide-band piezoelectric sensor (WD sensor). The sensor was connected to a 2/4/6 Preamplifier and PCI-2 AE system (Pacific Acoustics Corporation), and the signal was analysed using AEwin software. The compressed specimens were inspected using X-ray computed microtomography after testing.</p>
<p>The in-plane compression properties of the sandwich composites before and after impact were measured using the edgewise compression test specified in ASTM C364. The specimens were 60 mm long, 50 mm wide and 10 mm thick, and they were compressed in the lengthwise direction at a loading rate of 0.5 mm/min until final failure. Five samples of both the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich composites were tested under identical edge wise compression conditions. High-speed photography (X-Stream XS-4) of the sandwich composites during testing was performed at the frame rate of 5000 images per second to identify the failure process, which occurred within a very short period of time.</p>

<p>The effect of through-thickness (flat-wise) low-speed loading on the compression stress–strain response of the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich composites is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636212443915">Figure 2</xref>. The figure also shows the energy levels for the acoustic emission events recorded during compression loading of the materials. The stress–strain curve for the unpinned sandwich material showed a small load drop at the point labeled ‘yield stress’, which coincided with the initiation of low-energy acoustic emissions (most below 10 kJ). Examination of the unpinned specimen revealed that irreversible crushing of the foam core commenced at the yield point, and the plastic collapse of foam cell walls was almost certainly responsible for the acoustic emission events. Low-speed loading of the unpinned sandwich material beyond the yield point resulted in a steady load response until the compressive strain reached 35% when hardening occurred owing to core densification. Occasional low-energy acoustic events were recorded during plastic deformation of the foam core to the unpinned sandwich material.

<p>The low-speed compression stress–strain response of the sandwich composite was changed by z-pinning. The compression modulus and yield stress were increased respectively by 280% and 300% by z-pinning (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1099636212443915">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the absorbed compressive strain energy, which was determined by the total area under the stress–strain curve, was also increased by z-pinning (260% improvement). Large improvements to the properties have been reported for other types of z-pinned sandwich materials under low-speed compression loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099636212443915">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099636212443915">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099636212443915">21</xref>] The improvements to the through-thickness compression properties was due to the much higher stiffness (∼1500 times higher) and higher strength (∼10,000 times higher) of the z-pins than the foam core. Furthermore, the foam core provided lateral support to the z-pins under axial compression loading which resisted buckling, which contributed to the increased strength and energy absorption.

<p>The acoustic emission response of the sandwich composite was also changed by z-pinning. A large number of high-energy acoustic emission events (many above 10 kJ) were recorded over the entire strain range of the compression test. The high-energy acoustic events were caused by failure of the z-pins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636212443915">Figure 2</xref>(b) shows that both low- and high-energy acoustic emissions were detected during elastic deformation of the foam core at low strain. X-ray computed microtomography revealed that some z-pins failed during elastic compressive deformation of the core by longitudinal splitting, kinking and fragmentation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1099636212443915">Figure 3</xref>. The z-pins contained small voids due to incomplete infiltration of the polymer resin during the pultrusion process used in their fabrication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1099636212443915">Figure 4</xref>). It is believed that these voids initiated damage in some of the z-pins when loaded at low compressive strain. Despite this damage, the z-pins improved the compression properties of the sandwich composite over the entire strain range. Microtomography showed that at the end of the compression test the pins were crushed, and the energy required to crush the pins was mainly responsible for the large increase in the energy absorption capacity of the sandwich composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1099636212443915">Figure 5</xref>). The large improvement to the compression properties (particularly the strength and energy absorption capacity) suggests that z-pinning could be an effective method for reducing the impact damage and increasing the post-impact mechanical properties of sandwich composites.

<sec id="sec9-1099636212443915"><title>Impact energy absorption properties</title>
<p>The effect of z-pinning on the impact response of the sandwich composite was quantified using the following properties: absorbed impact energy, impact damage area and post-impact compression properties. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1099636212443915">Figure 6</xref> shows the effect of increasing incident impact energy on the amount of energy absorbed by the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich composites. Two impact indentation regimes – low and high – are shown in the figure where the z-pins had slightly different effects on the absorbed energy capacity of the sandwich composite. The damage under the low-indentation condition was confined to delamination cracking within the impacted face skin and interfacial cracking between the impacted skin and foam core. The damage caused by the high-indentation condition was distinguished by crushing of the foam core in addition to skin damage and skin-core interfacial cracking experienced under the low condition.
<fig id="fig6-1099636212443915" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Effect of incident impact energy on the absorbed energy of the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich composites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212443915-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The low-indentation regime occurred when the incident impact energy was below about ∼25–30 J, and this regime was characterised by the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich materials having about the same impact absorption energy capacity (within the bounds of experimental scatter as indicated by the error bars). Examination of the sandwich specimens following impact loading up to 25–30 J revealed that damage was confined to delamination cracking in the face skin and cracking along the skin-core interface, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1099636212443915">Figure 7</xref>. This figure shows that the amount of delamination damage within the impacted face skin and the extent of skin-core interfacial cracking was less for the z-pinned composite. The smaller amount of skin damage was almost certainly due to the higher interlaminar fracture toughness of the carbon fibre-epoxy laminate due to bridging traction loads generated by the z-pins [for example see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1099636212443915">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099636212443915">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099636212443915">26</xref>]. It is well known that the interlaminar toughening effect reduces the amount of impact damage to monolithic laminates reinforced with z-pins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099636212443915">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099636212443915">27</xref>] and this study found a similar effect for the laminate skins to z-pinned sandwich composites. The smaller amount of skin-core interfacial cracking in the z-pinned sandwich material is attributed to toughening of the interfacial region by the pins. Casari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099636212443915">28</xref>] measured a large increase to the skin-core fracture load (∼2 times higher) due to the z-pinning of foam core sandwich composites. This strengthening is believed to have reduced the size of the impact-induced cracking along the skin-core interface to the z-pinned sandwich composite studied here. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1099636212443915">Figure 7</xref> also shows that the core material to both the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich materials was not damaged significantly when impacted in the low-indentation regime. Microtomography revealed that most z-pins within the core were undamaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1099636212443915">Figure 8</xref>). A small percentage of the z-pins were damaged, and this is consistent with the observation made in the low-speed compression test that elastic loading of the core can cause some pins to fail by splitting and kinking. It appears that under low-incidence impact loads (up to ∼25–30 J) the foam core was only elastically compressed and consequently the majority of z-pins were not damaged.

In this regime, the difference in the absorbed energy between the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich materials is statistically significant (as indicated by the error bars which represent one standard deviation), albeit the difference being small. The sandwich composites experienced both face skin damage and core crushing, as shown for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1099636212443915">Figure 9</xref> for the impact energy of 40 J. The face skin was delaminated and, at the highest energies, completely ruptured. The amount of delamination damage to the z-pinned face skin was less due to the high interlaminar fracture toughness promoted by the pins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1099636212443915">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099636212443915">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099636212443915">25</xref>], however, the impact energy required to rupture the skin was about the same as the unpinned skin. Under high-energy impact loading, the face skin was indented into the underlying foam which caused core crushing. Microtomography revealed that all the z-pins immediately under the impact site were heavily crushed whereas many of the pins towards the edges of the impacted region where broken, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1099636212443915">Figure 10</xref>. The small increase in the absorbed energy of the z-pinned sandwich composite in the high-indentation regime was therefore attributed to the additional energy absorbed in breaking and crushing the pins, which did not occur in the low-indentation regime.

<p>The low-speed compression testing and acoustic emission monitoring revealed that the large increase to the energy absorption of the sandwich composite was due to crushing of the z-pins. Therefore, the small increase to the energy absorption of the z-pinned sandwich material under high-energy impact loading (above 25–30 J) was almost certainly due to the energy absorbed in pin crushing. However, the average percentage increase to the absorbed energy capacity under impact loading (between 5 and 10%) was much less than under low-speed compression loading (260%). This difference is attributed to the number and distribution of compression load applied on the z-pins. The low-speed compression test involved a distributed load applied over the entire surface area of the sandwich specimen; with about 500 pins resisting the applied force. The load was applied evenly between all the pins and therefore each pin reacted equally against compression. In contrast, the impact test involved point loading of the sandwich composite whereby fewer z-pins (typically under 50–100) were available to resist the indentation force. Importantly, the impact stress was non-uniformly distributed between the z-pins; being highest on the small number of pins in the centre of the impact site and the stress decreasing with distance away from the centre. The smaller number of z-pins acting against the applied force as well as the uneven load distribution between the pins in the sandwich composite under point impact loading may account for the lower percentage increase in the absorbed energy capacity compared to the quasi-static loading condition.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1099636212443915"><title>Impact damage size</title>
<p>The effect of increasing incident impact energy on the size (expressed both as area and length) of the impact-damaged region in the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich composites is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1099636212443915">Figure 11</xref>. The impact damage size was measured visually from cross-sections of impacted samples. Damage size was also measured for a few, selected impacted samples using microtomography, and the measured sizes were in close agreement with the visual measurements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1099636212443915">Figure 11</xref> shows that the size of the damaged region increased with the impact energy for both materials, which is expected. However, the size of damage sustained by the sandwich material for all energy levels (except the lowest of 10 J) was reduced by z-pinning, particularly at the transition energy level from low to high identation at 20–30 J. The increase to the damage resistance in the low-indentation regime (&lt;25 J) was attributed to interlaminar toughening of the face skin and interfacial strengthening of the skin-core interface. It is well known that z-pinning reduces the amount of impact damage to carbon fibre-epoxy (and other) laminate materials due to bridging traction loads formed by the pins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099636212443915">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099636212443915">27</xref>]. As mentioned, Casari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099636212443915">28</xref>] have shown that z-pinning also increases the fracture strength of the skin-core interface. For these reasons, it is believed that toughening of the face skin and skin-core interface by the z-pins resisted the growth of damage in the low-indentation regime. At the lowest energy (10 J), however, z-pins did not reduce the amount of damage, and this was attributed to the inability of z-pins to form bridging traction loads in either the skin or skin-core interface. Interlaminar fracture toughness and impact testing of composite laminates has proven that z-pins cannot promote toughening until the damage size is sufficiently large to create a bridging traction zone across the crack faces. Studies performed on carbon fibre-epoxy laminates containing the same volume content of z-pins (2%) as the sandwich composite reveal that the damage must be at least 10-mm long to promote significant interlaminar toughening by crack bridging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099636212443915">25</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1099636212443915">Figure 11</xref> shows that at the lowest impact energy (10 J), the damage length was less than 10 mm, and therefore the cracks in the impacted face skin and skin-core interface were too short for z-pins to provide toughening. It was only when the impact damage length was longer than ∼10 mm that the z-pins were effective at resisting damage growth in the low-indentation regime.

<p>The amount of damage sustained by the sandwich composite in the high-indentation energy regime (&gt;25 J) was reduced by z-pinning, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1099636212443915">Figure 11</xref>. The improved damage resistance was attributed to delamination toughening of the face skin, strengthening of the skin-core interface as well as by strengthening of the foam core by z-pins.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1099636212443915">Figure 12</xref> shows the effect of increasing incident impact energy on the in-plane compression stiffness and failure load of the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich composites. The in-plane compression stiffness and load of the sandwich composites were determined mainly by the properties of the laminate face skins, and not by the core material. The post-impact properties of the two sandwich materials were virtually the same over the entire impact range from low energies (which caused face skin cracking and skin-core debonding) to high energies (which caused skin rupture and severe core crushing). While the z-pins reduced the size of the impact damage region, this does not translate into an improvement to the post-impact properties.
<fig id="fig12-1099636212443915" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><p>Effect of increasing incident impact energy on the post-impact (a) compression stiffness and (b) compression failure load of the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich composites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636212443915-fig12.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The inability of z-pinning to increase the post-impact properties may be attributed to the modest reduction in the impact damage area due to the z-pins, which was insufficient to increase significantly the post-impact properties The difference in the impact damage area between the unpinned and z-pinned sandwich composites was relatively small except over the energy level range of 20–30 J when the indentation damage condition changed from face skin and skin-core interfacial damage (at below ∼25 J) to face skin and core damage (above ∼25 J). Over this narrow energy range of 20–30 J, it is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1099636212443915">Figure 11</xref> that the damage area was reduced significantly by z-pinning, and there was a corresponding increase in the post-impact strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1099636212443915">Figure 12</xref>(b)). At energies below 20 J and above 30 J, the difference in the amount of damage between the unpinned and z-pinned materials was sufficiently small to not improve the post-impact properties.</p>

<p>Through-thickness reinforcement of foam core sandwich composite material with orthogonal z-pins can improve slightly the impact damage properties. However, z-pins were only effective at low-impact energies when cracking within the impacted face skin or skin-core interface was sufficiently large for the z-pins to create a bridging traction zone and at high-impact energies when large-scale core crushing caused fracture of the pins. Low-speed flat-wise compression testing revealed that z-pin reinforcement was highly effective at increasing the through-thickness stiffness, strength and energy absorption of the core (between 260 and 300%). This improvement was achieved with a modest increase to the density of the sandwich material. In the material studied here, the z-pin content of 2% by volume increased the core density from 0.0735 and 0.1135 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (or an increase of 50%). While z-pinning greatly increased the flat-wise compression properties of the sandwich composite, such large increases were not achieved in the impact damage area, absorbed energy capacity or post-impact compression stiffness and strength properties.</p>
