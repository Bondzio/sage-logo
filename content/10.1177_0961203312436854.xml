<abstract>
<p><italic>Background:</italic> Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may require prolonged periods of corticosteroid therapy which lead to excessive weight gain and increased cardiovascular risk. <italic>Objective:</italic> To assess the utility of a low glycaemic index diet in patients with corticosteroid dependent SLE in achieving weight loss and improving glycaemic control. <italic>Design:</italic> A total of 23 women were enrolled in a 6 week study. All had mild, stable SLE, were receiving corticosteroids and had a body mass index &gt; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Subjects were randomly assigned to a low glycaemic index (Low GI) diet or a calorie restricted (Low Cal) diet. The primary end point was weight loss. Secondary end points included tolerability of diet, bio-markers of cardiovascular risk, disease activity, fatigue and sleep quality. <italic>Results:</italic> Weight loss in both treatment groups was significant (mean ± SD: Low GI diet 3.9 ± 0.9 kg; Low Cal diet 2.4 ± 2.2 kg, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 from baseline in each group). There were also significant improvements in waist and hip measurements. However, the difference in weight loss and waist and hip measurements between the two diet groups was not statistically significant. There was a statistically significant reduction in Fatigue Severity Scale in both diet groups, (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.03). Both Low GI and Low Cal diets were well tolerated, resulting in no serious adverse effects or increase in disease activity. <italic>Conclusion:</italic> Significant weight loss is achievable over 6 weeks in a diet-specific trial in subjects with stable SLE, who are on low dose prednisolone. Both diets were equally tolerable, and did not cause flares in disease activity. Our results suggest that dietary manipulation may significantly improve fatigue in subjects with SLE.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203312436854" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis and obesity is common among lupus patients especially in those taking long term corticosteroids. Urowitz and Gladman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312436854">1</xref></sup> found that SLE is associated with a five-fold increased risk of clinical coronary artery disease. Accelerated atheroma in SLE patients has profound clinical consequences and explains the bimodal pattern of deaths first described by Urowitz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312436854">2</xref></sup> with early deaths predominantly due to disease activity and late deaths due to cardiovascular disease. Our aim was to assess the role of dietary intervention in SLE as a way to reduce obesity and potentially favourably modify hyperlipidaemia and hyperglycaemia in patients on corticosteroids. We chose a low glycaemic index diet (GI) which to our knowledge has not been explored in SLE patients. The glycaemic index (GI) constitutes an empirical system for classifying carbohydrate-containing foods first proposed in 1981.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312436854">3</xref></sup> Dietary carbohydrates can be subdivided into low GI and high GI carbohydrates, which have different effects on postprandial glucose and insulin levels. Most varieties of bread, rice, breakfast cereal and potato have a high GI, whereas whole fruit, rice, non-starchy vegetables, legumes and nuts have a low GI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312436854">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shortly after a high GI meal blood glucose and insulin levels rise higher than after a low GI meal and glucagon secretion is inhibited. The resulting increased insulin:glucagon ratio promotes uptake of nutrients in the liver, muscle, and fat, and suppresses hepatic glucose release. The blood glucose level begins to fall within 60 minutes of a high GI diet, often to below fasting levels, and release of fatty acids from adipose tissue is suppressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312436854">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312436854">6</xref></sup> This rapid decline in blood glucose and inability to stimulate gluconeogenesis leads to hunger and overeating. The low GI diet aims to redress this early postprandial hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia and the late postprandial hypoglycaemia which increase the risk for obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A systematic review of low GI diets in obese subjects has shown them to be safe, tolerable and effective in numerous short term trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312436854">7</xref></sup> The quality of these clinical trials has however been limited by small numbers, a failure to show adherence to treatment and confounding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312436854">7</xref></sup> The adverse effects of corticosteroids include central abdominal weight gain, insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidaemia among others. Encouraged by the evidence of its benefits in non-lupus subjects we designed a study to assess the utility of a low GI diet in SLE patients on long term corticosteroid therapy. Fatigue and poor sleep quality are very prevalent among lupus patients and we also wished to assess any benefit of weight loss on these aspects of the disease.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203312436854" sec-type="materials"><title>Subjects and materials</title>
<p>A total of 23 women with SLE classified according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria were enrolled into a 6 week dietary study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312436854">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312436854">9</xref></sup> All subjects gave written informed consent and the St Thomas’ Hospital Local Research Ethics Committee approved the protocol.</p>
<p>Female patients attending the Louise Coote Lupus Unit, aged 18–65 years, with mild and stable disease, body mass index (BMI) &gt; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and stable prednisolone doses 5–20 mg/day were invited to participate. Exclusion criteria were active lupus with major organ dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled hypertension, significant renal impairment (serum creatinine ≥ 150 µmol/l) or hepatic impairment (elevated transaminases ≥ twice the upper normal limits), decompensated heart failure, taking lipid lowering drugs, breastfeeding or pregnancy, excessive alcohol intake (by self-report), or already following a weight reducing diet.</p>
<p>The subjects were randomly assigned, using a minimization protocol, to either a low glycaemic index (Low GI) diet or a calorie restricted (Low Cal) diet for 6 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312436854">10</xref></sup> The minimization criteria were age, ethnicity, BMI, smoking habits, menopausal state, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. This method of randomization reduces differences between groups, not only in subject numbers but also in subject characteristics.</p>
<p>All the following measurements were carried out by a clinician (RJD) at baseline and at 6 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using the validated British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) index, the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), the European Community Lupus Activity Measure (ECLAM) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) damage scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312436854">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312436854">12</xref></sup> Fatigue and sleep quality were assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312436854">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312436854">14</xref></sup> Fasting blood samples were taken to determine low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride level, serum lipoprotein A, homocysteine, fibrinogen, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and uric acid. An oral glucose tolerance test was also carried out at the same time points. Urine was dip-tested for ketones, blood and protein at baseline and on follow-up (Combur 7 Test, reflectance photometry with Urisys1100/UriluxS test strips).</p>
<sec id="sec3-0961203312436854"><title>Dietary intervention</title>
<p>All patients were advised on dietary treatment by the same dietician (KA). A total of 11 subjects were assigned to the Low GI diet whereby carbohydrate intake was limited to 45 g per day of low GI food, without restricting the consumption of fat and protein. There was no calorie restriction and the estimated composition of the diet was 10–15% of daily calories from carbohydrate, 25% from protein and 60% from both saturated and unsaturated fat. Twelve subjects were assigned to a conventional Low Cal diet with calorie restriction of 2000 kcal per day, approximately 50% of calories from carbohydrate, 15% from protein and 30% from fat.</p>
<p>Dietetic support (KA) was given in the form of a weekly telephone call to the subject, side effects were noted and any queries about the diet were answered. Dietary compliance was assessed by two methods. Firstly, subjects kept weekly food diaries which were checked by the dietician (KA) at their appointments and, secondly, subjects were questioned during their weekly telephone call with the dietician (KA) with regard to the type and amount of foods and drinks consumed at each meal and snack in relation to whether they were following the Low GI or the Low Cal diet.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203312436854"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The primary end point of this study was achievable weight loss. Secondary end points included tolerability of the diet, biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, disease activity, fatigue and sleep quality measurements on either diet. For comparison of continuous variables between the two groups, we calculated the change from baseline to 6 weeks in each group and compared the mean changes in the two diet groups using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Statistical significance was <italic>p &lt; </italic>0.05. An intention to treat analysis was used: all individuals enrolled in the study were included in the end analysis and baseline values were carried forward for any missing data and for those who withdrew from the study. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0.x computer software. A power calculation was not performed as this was a proof of concept study.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203312436854" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The 23 subjects were randomly assigned, with 11 subjects allocated to the Low GI diet and 12 subjects to the Low Cal diet groups. Subjects were matched according to the minimization criteria and baseline characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312436854">Table 1</xref>). Three subjects withdrew from the Low GI diet within week one: one subject returned home to the USA at short notice, the second subject was concerned about the possibility of side effects, and the third complained of unacceptable nausea. One subject withdrew from the Low Cal diet due to hospital admission for a cerebrovascular accident, unrelated to the diet. Dietary compliance from the food diaries was considered to be sufficient in subjects who completed the study. The attrition rate between the two groups, using Chi-squared, was not statistically significant. There were no significant differences between the characteristics of the subjects who completed the study with those who dropped out.

<p>Fatigue was reported by seven of the Low GI diet group compared with four in the Low Cal diet group and the FSS reduced from 4.9 ± 0.9 to 4.4 ± 1.2 in the Low GI diet group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.03) and from 4.7 ± 1.5 to 4.4 ± 1.7 in the Low Cal diet group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.03). Sleep disturbance was reported by four of the Low GI diet group and three of the Low Cal diet group. The PSQI recorded by subjects in both groups showed a trend towards improvement but this was not statistically significant. There were no significant changes within or between groups for the cardiovascular biomarkers: HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein A, homocysteine, fibrinogen, urate and high sensitivity CRP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203312436854">Table 3</xref>). At baseline, one subject in the Low Cal group had an impaired glucose tolerance test which normalized by week 6. At week 6, one subject in the Low GI group had an impaired glucose tolerance test. All other subjects had normal glucose tolerance tests and there were no significant changes in fasting glucose or insulin levels between or within groups during the study.

<p>Disease activity (SLEDAI, ECLAM) and SLICC/ACR damage index remained unchanged. The mean (±SD) SLEDAI score in Low GI diet group was 3.2 ± 5.1 at baseline and 2.8 ± 6.1 at 6 weeks. The mean (±SD) SLEDAI score in the Low Cal diet group was 1.0 ± 1.2 at baseline and 6 weeks. The mean (±SD) ECLAM score in the Low GI diet group was 1.7 ± 1.2 at baseline and 1.3 ± 1.4 at 6 weeks. The mean ECLAM score for the Low Cal diet group was 1.8 ± 1.2 at baseline and 2.2 ± 1.1 at 6 weeks.

<p>There were no serious adverse effects from either diet. Headaches were a prominent feature early on in both groups although they seemed to abate in the second week of the study. Five Low GI diet subjects complained of constipation whilst three Low Cal diet subjects experienced increased bowel frequency and bloating. None of the subjects on the Low GI diet were in ketosis by urinalysis and renal function was unchanged.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203312436854" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Obesity is common in patients with SLE. For example, a study from the LUMINA cohort found that 56% of 364 patients were overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 28% were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 2% were morbidly obese (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312436854">15</xref></sup> Elevated BMI was associated with older age, less social support, a higher degree of helplessness, depression, more abnormal illness-related behaviours, poorer self-reported HRQOL, fatigue, and fibromyalgia, but not with disease activity or damage accrual. In another study in SLE, obesity was associated with poorer functional capacity, impaired health related quality of life, higher levels of fatigue, and worse pain, and obese patients had higher levels of inflammation markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312436854">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>There has been a move to low-carbohydrate diets with several clinical trials in the past 10 years demonstrating that low-carbohydrate, high-fat, high-protein diets are at least as effective as calorie-restricted, high carbohydrate, low-fat diets for weight loss and improvement of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312436854">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312436854">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lupus patients need advice on weight loss strategies tailored to the use of corticosteroids – a major driver of weight gain and a contributor to increased cardiovascular risk. There are few controlled trials of dietary interventions in SLE patients. One small study by Shah et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312436854">18</xref></sup> studied 16 patients randomized to either a National Cholesterol Education Programme Step 2 diet (<italic>n</italic> = 8) or to no dietary advice (<italic>n</italic> = 8). There were only modest effects on serum lipids, lipoproteins, and body weight although the intervention diet was highly accepted and effective in changing the diet and quality of life. In the general population, a large scale randomized controlled trial of a low fat diet with increased intakes of vegetables, fruits, and grains did not significantly reduce the risk of CHD, stroke, or CVD in postmenopausal women and achieved only modest effects on CVD risk factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312436854">19</xref></sup> suggesting that simply reducing fat intake does not necessarily lead to improved cardiovascular outcomes.</p>
<p>We adopted a low carbohydrate diet designed to minimize the adverse effects of corticosteroids on glycaemic control. Our 6 week study demonstrated that a Low GI diet is comparable to the standard Low Cal diet, can achieve significant weight loss, and is safe and well tolerated by subjects with mild, stable SLE on long term low dose prednisolone. There were no disease flares on either diet. No changes were seen in serum markers of cardiovascular risk or glycaemic control in either group. This result is probably due to the small numbers enrolled and the short duration of the study.</p>
<p>There were no severe adverse effects or metabolic abnormalities on the Low GI diet. This may, in part, have been due to the fact that the carbohydrate restriction used in the diet was not severe enough to cause ketosis; indeed this was not the aim of the diet. None of the subjects on the Low GI diet developed deranged renal function (in particular hypokalaemia) and none had urinary ketones on urinalysis.</p>
<p>Fatigue affects up to 80% of individuals with SLE and is one of the commonest and most disabling symptom experienced by SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312436854">20</xref></sup> In the majority of patients, the cause of the fatigue in SLE is unknown and fatigue has been shown to be associated with diminished ability to function and physical deconditioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312436854">21</xref></sup> Patients with quiescent lupus continue to experience marked fatigue making it very difficult to treat, although graded aerobic exercise has been shown to improve fatigue in lupus patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203312436854">22</xref></sup> Fatigue in individuals without lupus is associated with a higher body mass index and waist circumference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203312436854">23</xref></sup> A large randomized controlled trial reported improvement in fatigue in obese subjects undergoing weight loss following either a low-carbohydrate diet or a low-fat diet: no diet was superior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203312436854">24</xref></sup> The significant improvement in fatigue assessed by the FSS seen in our subjects on both diets was of great interest as it suggests that dietary manipulation and associated weight loss may have an important role to play in the management of fatigue in patients with SLE. The change in the FSS fatigue score was small but significant. A similar magnitude of change was seen in a study by Tench et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203312436854">22</xref></sup> where the FSS dropped from 5.4 to 4.8 in the exercise group. Although this was not statistically significant, more of these patients felt much better or very much better than the control groups on a self-rated clinical global impression change score at 12 weeks suggesting that the change was clinically meaningful. However, the PSQI, which assesses sleep quality, did not improve.</p>
<p>Subjects on both diets lost significant amounts of weight over a short period of time. This result is relevant to clinical practice as it means that even patients with a chronic illness like SLE, who are obese and take regular doses of corticosteroids, can lose weight.</p>
<p>Dietary compliance in this study was measured with weekly food diaries. Throughout the study the dietician was felt to be of paramount importance in maintaining subjects’ adherence to and compliance with both diets and any future studies should include regular support from a dietician. The subjects were undoubtedly greatly helped by the constant support and advice from the dietician although this degree of input may be difficult to provide in normal clinical practice.</p>
<p>Other studies have shown significantly greater weight loss on a Low GI diet at 6 months when compared with a Low Cal diet; however this difference is lost at 1 year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203312436854">25</xref></sup> This is possibly due to difficulties with long term adherence to a Low GI diet and subjects in these studies often had minimal contact with dieticians.</p>
<p>Before advocating a low GI diet to manage obesity in SLE, especially when weight gain may be due to corticosteroid use, it is worth noting that qualitative differences in the dietary source of protein or carbohydrates may have a bearing on future risk of cardiovascular mortality. Fung et al. studied 85,168 women and 44,548 men without heart disease, cancer, or diabetes who were followed for at least 20 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203312436854">26</xref></sup> Low carbohydrate diets that were either animal based or vegetable based were assessed. The animal low-carbohydrate score was associated with higher cardiovascular mortality. In contrast, a higher vegetable low-carbohydrate score was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality. Interestingly, a small open study in patients with SLE by Thorner et al. suggested that reducing dietary polyunsaturated fats and enriching intake of saturated fats with no reduction in energy intake resulted in improvements in lupus disease activity by self-report and lower prednisolone requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203312436854">27</xref></sup> A further intriguing case report of a Japanese patient switching to a vegetarian diet with significant improvements in both serology and clinical disease activity including reduced proteinuria suggests that vegetable based diets warrant further study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203312436854">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>A major concern with all dietary studies is the failure to adhere to the diet long term no matter what diet is used to achieve initial weight loss. This is almost certainly due to psychological factors, the easy availability of food, and the increase in hunger and decrease in resting energy expenditure that often accompanies weight loss. A recent large study has demonstrated that obese subjects who achieve weight loss on a low calorie diet were more likely to complete the study and maintain weight loss if they were then randomized to a diet with a modest increase in protein content and a modest reduction in the glycaemic index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203312436854">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>No specific dietary recommendations exist for patients with SLE. A previous literature review of both animal and human studies suggested that patients with SLE may benefit from a balanced diet limited in calories and fat, especially saturated and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Increased intakes of fatty fish and supplements of fish oil and flaxseed may also be beneficial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961203312436854">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, our data support the need for further assessment of the role of dietary intervention in patients with SLE especially those on corticosteroid therapy with a view to minimizing cardiovascular risks and improving fatigue and quality of life. A limitation of our study is the small sample size. Our data supports the need for a larger randomized controlled trial with adequate power to test the superiority of a low GI diet over conventional weight loss measures.</p></sec>
