<abstract>
<p>Grounded in leader–member exchange, social exchange, political skill and influence theories, the present two-study investigation tests the model that leader political skill is related to both leader and follower effectiveness through leader–follower relationship quality. It is hypothesized that leader political skill is associated with leader effectiveness (Study 1) and follower effectiveness (Study 2) through relationship quality. The results support the hypotheses and were constructively replicated in Study 2, contributing to theory that leader political skill enhances relationship quality, which then ultimately affects leader and follower effectiveness relationships. Strengths, limitations, directions for future research, and implications for practice are discussed.</p>

<p>Trait views of leadership were proposed decades ago (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051812460099">Bass, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1548051812460099">Zaccaro, 2007</xref>), with early approaches focused on the main effects of leader characteristics (i.e., generally traits that individuals were either born with or not such as height, gender, etc.) on leadership effectiveness, with little consideration of the mechanisms that underlie such relationships. The renewed interest in trait-view research today has focused on multistage models that more precisely articulate the intermediate linkages between leader characteristics (e.g., individual differences) and leadership effectiveness, and have broadened their scope to include characteristics such as interpersonal attributes and task competencies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812460099">DeRue, Nahrgang, Wellman, &amp; Humphrey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1548051812460099">Van Iddekinge, Ferris, &amp; Hefner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1548051812460099">Zaccaro, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812460099">Ammeter, Douglas, Gardner, Hochwarter, and Ferris (2002)</xref> proposed a political theory of leadership in response to an appeal for such work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812460099">House and Aditya (1997)</xref>, which theoretically specified the leader characteristics or traits, behaviors, and contextual factors contributing to leadership effectiveness. A central leader individual difference variable proposed in this theory was political skill, which constitutes a synergistic set of social competencies argued to bring adaptability and situationally appropriate influence behavior to interactions with followers, inspiring trust and confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>). As such, leader political skill is regarded as one of the most important traits/characteristics of leaders that contribute to leadership effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812460099">DeRue et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been proposed that political skill should help both leaders and followers realize effectiveness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812460099">Ferris, Davidson, &amp; Perrewé, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051812460099">Ferris, Treadway, Brouer, &amp; Munyon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051812460099">Ferris, Treadway, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>), because political skill is a fundamentally interpersonal-behavior-oriented construct, and thus would be expected to demonstrate effects on more distal performance and effectiveness outcomes through effects on more proximal variables such as work relationships. Indeed, recent conceptualizations of leadership have supported such proximal and distal distinctions and positioned political skill-type traits/characteristics as influencing effectiveness outcome measures through particular types of leader behaviors and processes such as relationship building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812460099">DeRue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051812460099">Zaccaro, Kemp, &amp; Bader, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In a small number of studies, leader political skill has demonstrated main effect relationships with various operationalizations of leadership effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812460099">Ahearn, Ferris, Hochwarter, Douglas, &amp; Ammeter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812460099">Douglas &amp; Ammeter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812460099">Semadar, Robins, &amp; Ferris, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812460099">Treadway et al., 2004</xref>). Unfortunately, the intermediate linkages between, or mechanisms that underlie, the leader political skill–leadership effectiveness relationship have not been specified or empirically investigated to date, thus leaving theoretical gaps in our understanding of the leader political skill construct and how it works (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812460099">Ahearn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812460099">Ammeter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812460099">Treadway et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is to examine the impact of leader political skill on leadership effectiveness, but to do so by explicating the intermediate linkages through which leader political skill achieves effectiveness outcomes. More specifically, the present two-study investigation expands political skill theory by arguing that leader political skill operates to achieve desirable organizational outcomes through the relationships these leaders have with their followers. The precise focus of this investigation is to test the portions of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812460099">DeRue et al. (2011)</xref> model suggesting that work relationship quality mediates the leader political skill–leadership effectiveness relationships. As such, this investigation builds on recent work on trait views, relational approaches, and political perspectives on leadership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812460099">Ammeter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051812460099">Carmeli, Ben-Hador, Waldman, &amp; Rupp, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812460099">DeRue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812460099">Uhl-Bien, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Leadership effectiveness</italic> is a broad term that represents the various ways we can construe leadership outcomes to reflect increased performance and effectiveness of both leaders and followers. Two of the ways to construe or operationalize this broad effectiveness construct are leader performance and follower performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812460099">DeRue et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, we need to know much more about the antecedents of leader performance, as well as the leader determinants of follower performance. For example, given the importance of contextual performance in contributing to organizational effectiveness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812460099">Borman &amp; Motowidlo, 1993</xref>), research on situational factors (e.g., leader characteristics, organizational culture, etc.) that might encourage contextual performance is likely to be beneficial.</p>
<p>Specifically, for purposes of completeness in testing the proposed conceptualization that relationship quality between leaders and followers mediates the relationship between leader political skill and leadership effectiveness, both of these outcome manifestations of leadership effectiveness (i.e., leader effectiveness and follower effectiveness) are examined. Specifically, this investigation involves the development and testing of the hypothesized mediation model in Study 1 (i.e., using leader performance assessed from follower and superior perspectives as the criterion measure) and a subsequent test of the model in Study 2 (i.e., using follower contextual performance as the effectiveness measure) in an effort to provide constructive replication and theoretical extension evidence through this multistudy research package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812460099">Eden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812460099">Hochwarter, Ferris, &amp; Hanes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812460099">Lykken, 1968</xref>). The establishment of constructive replication in such research packages provides for greater confidence in the validity of the obtained results than single-study designs permit, which are always susceptible to questions of replicability of results.</p>

<title>Theoretical Foundations and Hypothesis Development</title>
<sec id="section2-1548051812460099">
<title>Theoretical Foundations</title>
<p>Social exchange theories are central to the study of work relationships, in general, and leader–member exchange (LMX), in particular (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812460099">Erdogan &amp; Liden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2009</xref>). The basic tenet of social exchange theory is that relationships form and endure between individuals because of the mutual obligations and interdependence that materialize between them (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812460099">Cropanzano &amp; Mitchell, 2005</xref>, for a review). Expectations of reciprocity typically develop between the participants in an exchange relationship over an extended and unspecified amount of time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812460099">Liden, Sparrowe, &amp; Wayne, 1997</xref>). The costs and benefits of such associations are the underpinnings of individual relational satisfaction within these relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812460099">Blau, 1964</xref>), and subsequent work has suggested that successful social exchanges foster trust and commitment in relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812460099">Cropanzano &amp; Mitchell, 2005</xref>), which then can foster more positive social exchanges over time.</p>
<p>Within organizations, leader–member relationships are at the core of an employee’s work experience. LMX theory specifies that leaders develop and maintain differing relationships with followers on the basis of social exchange theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812460099">Dansereau, Graen, &amp; Haga, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051812460099">Graen &amp; Cashman, 1975</xref>). Some leaders and followers develop higher quality relationships based the norms of mutual obligation and reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812460099">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997</xref>). These relationships go beyond the employment contract, with each party offering to do more than what is explicitly required by their job, and as a result tend to be more positive in nature. However, other leader–follower relationships consist of lower quality exchanges, with each party behaving merely in ways dictated by the employment contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812460099">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997</xref>), which would be more transactional in nature.</p>
<p>Most researchers have examined the outcomes of LMX but not the antecedents or predictors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051812460099">Dulebohn, Bommer, Liden, Brouer, &amp; Ferris, 2011</xref>), and few studies have examined the impact of leader characteristics (i.e., skills, personality, individual differences, etc.) on LMX (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051812460099">Dulebohn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812460099">Erdogan &amp; Liden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812460099">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997</xref>). In this regard, theory and research in political skill and influence provides a complement to social exchange frameworks by explicating the individual social motives, situationally adaptive behavior, influence dynamics, and perceptual lenses that affect social exchanges and work relationship quality, which then influence both leader and follower effectiveness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Leader Political Skill and the Effectiveness of Leaders and Followers</title>

<title>Nature of leader political skill</title>
<p>Political skill is best characterized as an individual difference variable that represents “a comprehensive pattern of social competencies, with cognitive, affective, and behavioral manifestations, which have both direct effects on outcomes, as well as moderating effects on predictor–outcome relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>, p. 291) and has been defined as “the ability to understand social interactions at work and to use this understanding to influence others to act in ways that enhance one’s personal or organizational goals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051812460099">Ferris, Treadway, et al., 2005</xref>, p. 127). Politically skilled individuals are socially astute, having an accurate perception of both their own and others behaviors as well as the social interaction in general, which allows them to be influential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812460099">Ferris, Davidson, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051812460099">Ferris, Treadway, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>). Those high in political skill also possess interpersonal influence, which is reflected in a certain style that allows them to easily influence others, providing the adaptability to change their behaviors as the situation demands in order to achieve desired goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812460099">Zaccaro (2002</xref>, p. 45) earlier suggested that “successful social influence by the leader requires the mastery of a range of skills and the ability to select and apply them to the appropriate situation,” and the political skill of leaders appears to function in this manner. Moreover, these individuals are characterized by networking ability and are able to forge friendships and build coalitions, strong beneficial alliances, and networks, thus vesting the politically skilled with a great deal of information and social support that they can share with followers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>). Last, politically skilled individuals are seen as possessing high degrees of integrity and authenticity, thus creating perceptions of as genuineness and sincerity in their interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812460099">Ferris, Davidson, et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1548051812460099">
<title>Leader political skill and leadership effectiveness</title>
<p>The accurate perception and reading of social relationships in organizations may well be what characterizes effective leadership. Political skill provides individuals with the ability to accurately read and understand social situations and themselves. These characteristics are central to arguments that leader political skill drives leadership outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812460099">Ammeter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812460099">Treadway, Adams, Ranft, &amp; Ferris, 2009</xref>). Although the empirical research on political skill in the leadership context is still relatively limited, some work has supported the positive influence of political skill on leadership effectiveness.</p>
<p>Among the earliest studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812460099">Ahearn et al. (2004)</xref> found that teams with leaders high in political skill performed better than teams with leaders lower in political skill. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812460099">Douglas and Ammeter (2004)</xref> found leader political skill to significantly predict leader effectiveness, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812460099">Semadar et al. (2006)</xref> reported leader political skill to significantly predict leader performance beyond other the other individual difference predictors of leadership self-efficacy, emotional intelligence, and self-monitoring. Although impressive, this collection of studies lacks a clear and precise explanation of the mediating factors through which leader political skill enhances leadership effectiveness, that is, an understanding of the “black box,” if you will.</p>

<sec id="section6-1548051812460099">
<title>Relationship Quality as Mediator of Leader Political Skill–Leadership Effectiveness Linkage</title>
<p>The present two-study investigation seeks to expand theory and research in this area by demonstrating that the work relationship quality formed between leaders and followers mediates the relationship between leader political skill and measures of leadership effectiveness. More specifically, we hypothesize that the relationships between leader political skill and leader effectiveness (i.e., operationalized as leader performance in Study 1) and follower effectiveness (i.e., operationalized as follower contextual performance in Study 2) are mediated by leader–follower relationship quality.</p>
<sec id="section7-1548051812460099">
<title>Leader political skill and relationship quality</title>
<p>Building and maintaining effective relationships at work is an important task that can serve as a source of increased effectiveness and competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812460099">Uhl-Bien, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051812460099">Uhl-Bien, Graen, &amp; Scandura, 2000</xref>). Because effective relationships are important to the success of leaders, and because high-quality work relationships provide positive outcomes for all involved (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051812460099">Dulebohn et al., 2011</xref>; Gerstner &amp; Day, 1987), it stands to reason that leaders should strive to develop and maintain high-quality relationships with their followers.</p>
<p>Using social exchange theory, the political skill of leaders should be associated with follower perceptions of higher relationship quality. Politically skilled leaders should be more aware that high-quality relationships are necessary in the workplace. Additionally, politically skilled leaders possess the ability to inspire trust; to use their understanding and adaptability to match their behaviors, rewards, and styles to each individual follower; and to use their vast network to access resources and share and invest such resources in follower relationship development. As such, social exchange process dynamics involving feelings of reciprocity between leaders and followers should operate in such work relationships. Therefore, leaders high in political skill should realize the critical need to develop and maintain effective relationships, which should direct such leaders to invest in high-quality work relationships, resulting in reciprocation behavior in leader-initiated goal accomplishment directions by followers, through which leader and follower effectiveness is realized.</p>
<p>Not only will politically skilled leaders be able to recognize the need for high-quality work relationships but also such leaders will reflect a deeper understanding of social exchange processes because they are attuned to their environments and followers. These leaders possess keen social astuteness that allows them to understand the motivations of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>). This allows politically skilled leaders to understand when followers reflect issues and needs that need to be attended to and addressed by leaders and precisely what is the best solution for that particular follower. Additionally, politically skilled leaders will engage in behaviors (e.g., provision of resources and support) that followers will wish to reciprocate.</p>
<p>Because political skill engenders a sense of calm and personal security to those who possess it, leader political skill positively affects the perceptions of followers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>). High-quality work relationships are built on an idea of mutual obligation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051812460099">Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051812460099">Scandura &amp; Pellegrini, 2008</xref>). Followers have to trust that when they go above and beyond their employment contract, their leaders will do so as well, therefore creating the feelings of reciprocity on which high-quality work relationships are built and maintained. In support of this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812460099">Treadway et al. (2004)</xref> found that politically skilled leaders were trusted more by followers, and followers felt they received more support, were more satisfied, and committed to those leaders.</p>
<p>Moreover, politically skilled leaders can sense and understand the motivations of others, and this understanding gives them the information needed about what exactly their followers need and value. For instance, the politically skilled leader will know whether a particular follower needs or wants verbal praise, more interaction, less interaction, more informational resources to do their job, and so forth. Thus, this understanding coupled with the ability of the politically skilled to adapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>) will allow leaders to tailor their behaviors, rewards, and feedback to each specific follower. When followers feel they are getting what they need and want from their leaders, this will increase feelings of reciprocity toward the leader, resulting in follower perceptions of higher quality relationships and goal-directed behaviors that can increase effectiveness.</p>
<p>Last, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051812460099">House (1996)</xref> argued that leaders who are central in their networks are able to acquire more resources for their unit. Furthermore, positioning, coalition building, networking, and social capital creation and leveraging (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812460099">Brass, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812460099">House, 1995</xref>), all of which political skill facilitates, allow leaders to maximize resources, which contribute to positive follower reactions and effectiveness behaviors common ways leaders can leverage such network connections on followers’ behalf, as well as through the increased reputational benefits these leaders acquire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812460099">Ammeter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051812460099">Hall, Blass, Ferris, &amp; Massengale, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>The present investigation argues that the establishment of high-quality work relationships with followers derived from politically skilled leaders will result in higher ratings of leader and follower effectiveness, because it is through such work relationships that leader and follower effectiveness is realized. This claim is supported by social exchange theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812460099">Blau, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812460099">Cropanzano &amp; Mitchell, 2005</xref>), and the norm of reciprocity, which suggests that when an individual perceives favorable treatment from another individual, the individual receiving the favorable treatment will feel an obligation to repay the provider for such treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051812460099">Gouldner, 1960</xref>) with behavior that favorably affects the provider in some ways. In fact, it is suggested that followers in high-quality work relationships work harder and exert more effort for the benefit of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812460099">Erdogan &amp; Liden, 2002</xref>), which can only lead to greater job, unit, and/or organizational effectiveness.</p>
<p>The benefits of leader–political-skill-driven work relationship quality extend beyond the employment contract, thus encouraging followers to do more than just what is required of them. Contextual performance is characterized as discretionary, individual behaviors that extend beyond the formal requirements of the job, helping to form the social context of all jobs, and thus promoting the effective functioning of jobs, work units, and organizations. Behaviors in this category include following rules and procedures, volunteering, helping and cooperating with others, exhibiting effort, and supporting work and organization goals and objectives, and have been designated by similar terms of contextual performance, citizenship performance, and organizational citizenship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812460099">Borman &amp; Motowidlo, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051812460099">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051812460099">Organ, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812460099">1988</xref>). One of the main ideas suggested about why individuals might choose to engage in contextual performance/OCBs involves the idea of reciprocity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812460099">Blau, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051812460099">Gouldner, 1960</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, individuals perform contextual performance because they are reciprocating what the organization (e.g., through the behaviors of leaders) has done for them. This would seem to indicate that more positive relationships with leaders will result in greater demonstration of contextual performance. In support of this, a recent meta-analysis found leader–follower relationship quality to be significantly and positively related to contextual performance-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812460099">Ilies, Nahrgang, &amp; Morgeson, 2007</xref>). In light of the foregoing analysis, we argue that the relationships between leader political skill and leader and follower effectiveness measures operate through the quality of the work relationships between leaders and followers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812460099">DeRue et al. (2011)</xref> argued that leadership traits and characteristics (i.e., they included leader political skill as one of these) should affect leadership behaviors and attributions and relational associations, which would then influence leadership effectiveness.</p>
<p>We follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812460099">DeRue et al.’s (2011)</xref> line of reasoning in suggesting that the political skill of leaders will encourage them to actively make connections with followers, invest resources in such followers, and encourage feelings of reciprocity exemplified by high-quality work relationships. In turn, these leaders and their followers realize greater effectiveness through the attitudinal and behavioral reciprocation followers provide in return for the leaders’ support and resource provision that occurs in high-quality work relationships. That is, the impact of leader political skill on leadership effectiveness will operate through the work relationship associations they form with followers, whereby leadership effectiveness (i.e., leader and follower) is realized.</p>

<title>Plan of the Research</title>
<p>The present research involves a two-study investigation designed to test the conceptualization indicating that leader political skill influences leader and follower effectiveness through leader–follower work relationship quality. Specifically, the mediation hypothesis is tested in Study 1, and then constructive replication and extension is sought in Study 2, testing a similar but slightly expanded model, which proposes that relationship quality mediates the relationship between leader political skill and follower effectiveness, operationalized as contextual performance.</p>
<p>Research findings are difficult to accept as truly scientific observations until they have been repeated and subject to further scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812460099">Popper, 1959</xref>). Constructive replications (i.e., with changes in subjects, measures, rating sources, and/or sampling procedures) are particularly influential in helping establish confidence in the validity of results that have been reported initially in single-study designs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812460099">Eden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812460099">Lykken, 1968</xref>). Thus, the convergent findings reported in these multistudy research packages not only increase confidence in the validity of the obtained results but also can make meaningful contributions to theory in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812460099">Hochwarter et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Study 1: Method</title>
<sec id="section11-1548051812460099">
<title>Procedure and Participants</title>
<p>Data for this study were collected in a school district in the Midwestern United States. Data for this study were collected from administrators, principals, program coordinators, and staff personnel within one school district in the Midwestern United States. A total of 275 surveys were distributed through interdepartmental mail to staff personnel who were asked for information on their unit leaders. The leaders were either principals or program coordinators, and they provided data reflecting their personal leadership style. The follower response rate was 42% (<italic>N</italic> = 105), mostly female (75%), and with a majority (66%) having at least a 4-year college degree.</p>
<p>Of the 25 leaders, 60% were male (i.e., 15), and all reported having at least a master’s degree. This resulted in 105 matched dyads. A separate survey was also distributed to the program directors and superintendents (administrators) who had reporting authority over the principals and program coordinators (leaders) whose staff personnel responded to the initial survey. Administrators (e.g., the leaders’ superintendents) were asked to evaluate leader effectiveness. Each leader had two to five subordinates and the administrators had one to three leaders as direct reports. Participation was voluntary for all surveys.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1548051812460099">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>All measures were described on 7-point Likert-type scales, with 1 = <italic>Strongly disagree</italic> and 7 = <italic>Strongly agree</italic> as anchors. The items in each scale were summed and then averaged to arrive at an overall value for the scale, with higher scores indicating higher levels of each variable.</p>
<sec id="section13-1548051812460099">
<title>Leader political skill</title>
<p>Leaders self-reported their political skill using the 18-item Political Skill Inventory (PSI) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051812460099">Ferris, Treadway, et al. (2005)</xref>. Examples of items include the following: “I know many important people and am well connected at work” and “I easily develop good rapport with most people.” As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812460099">Ferris et al. (2008)</xref>, the four dimensions were summed into a single higher-order factor, as has been shown to be empirically valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051812460099">Ferris, Treadway, et al., 2005</xref>). The coefficient alpha internal consistency reliability estimate for this scale is .96.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1548051812460099">
<title>Leader–follower relationship quality</title>
<p>The 7-item Leader–Member Exchange (LMX) scale, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051812460099">Scandura and Graen (1984)</xref>, was used to measure the quality of the relationship between leader and follower (i.e., from the follower’s perspective). Sample items are “My unit leader understands my problems and needs” and “I usually know where I stand with my unit leader.” The coefficient alpha reliability for this scale was .90.</p>
<p>We characterize political skill as an individual difference that will enhance the perceptions of LMX from the follower’s viewpoint. Thus, we do not see political skill as an average leader style that leads to the objective dyadic relationship between the leader and follower. Like many others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051812460099">Lewin, 1936</xref>), we argue that perceptions are the basis for individual actions in the workplace. Thus, rather than examining actual dyadic relationships between the leaders and their followers, we examine the followers’ perceptions of the quality of their relationships with their leaders. This is because we believe that follower behaviors will stem directly from their perceptions and not necessarily reality (and these perceptions may or may not be accurate).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1548051812460099">
<title>Leader effectiveness</title>
<p>Leader performance was used as the operationalization of leader effectiveness. Three items were used to measure leader performance, which focused on the leader’s effectiveness in representing the work unit to upper management, in meeting the job-related needs of work unit members, and in meeting the needs of the organization. Ratings on these items were taken from both followers and the leaders’ direct supervisors (i.e., the administrator), resulting in two outcome variables. The coefficient alpha reliability for the follower’s view was .86, and .92 for the administrator’s view of leader effectiveness.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section16-1548051812460099">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>Two methods of data analysis were used for this study. Because subordinates were nested within leaders, there may be concerns about leader effects, thus the pathway with the administrators’ view of leadership effectiveness was tested with hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). HLM is appropriate because it can account for the influence of leader factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812460099">Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, Congdon, &amp; Toit, 2004</xref>). For the model with follower ratings of effectiveness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812460099">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref> method of analyzing mediation using bootstrapping was used. This is appropriate because it allows a formal test of the indirect effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812460099">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, it uses resampling strategies (i.e., bootstrapping), which are not subject to the assumption of normality of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812460099">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812460099">Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002</xref>). A SPSS macro was used to complete the mediation analyses.</p>

As expected, these results reveal significant correlations between leader political skill, relationship quality, and leader effectiveness. Because followers each rated two variables in the model, we performed a Harmon one-factor test on leadership effectiveness and LMX. The one-factor solution did explain slightly more than half of the variance (60%). Therefore, this gives us some indication that common method bias may be an issue with the data.</p>

<p>A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was run to determine if these two variables were represented better as one variable or two. Two models were compared to each other: a one-factor model, χ<sup>2</sup>(35, <italic>N</italic> = 105) = 129.51, and a two-factor model, χ<sup>2</sup>(34, <italic>N</italic> = 105) = 80.30.

The chi-square difference test indicated that the models were significantly different from each other, and because the two-factor model has the lowest chi-square, it fits the data better than the one-factor model. Thus, the leadership effectiveness and LMX variables are best represented as separate variables.</p>

<title>Procedure and Participants</title>
<p>Dyadic data were collected from 12 organizations to ensure generalizability. All organizations were located in the United States and included industries such as medical, technology, and manufacturing. In most organizations surveyed, we were able to invite all employees to participate. In other organizations (especially larger ones), we were given an entire segment to survey. Surveys were mailed, emailed, or made available online, depending on the specific needs and requirements of the organizations (e.g., some organizations’ employees did not have regular access to computers). Leaders and followers were matched based on identification codes selected by the researchers. All participants were informed that their responses were confidential.</p>
<p>In all, 64 leaders and 474 followers were surveyed with 43 leader and 233 follower responses, resulting in 67% and 49% response rates, respectively. From the surveys received, there were 105 follower surveys and 37 leader surveys that could be matched, resulting in 105 dyads. The leaders held titles such as director, executive director, dentist, and manager. The leader respondents were 92% Caucasian, 2.7% African American, and 2.7% Asian, predominantly female (60%), averaged 51 years in age, and had 12.5 years in organizational tenure. The average number of subordinates they supervised was 24. The positions held by the subordinates included things such as administrative assistants, coordinators, nurses, dental assistants, and dental hygienists. The follower respondents were 81% Caucasian, 12.4% African American, 1.9%, Asian, and 3.8% Hispanic. The follower respondents were mostly female (81%), averaged 44 years in age, and 10 years in organizational tenure.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1548051812460099">Table 4</xref> provides descriptive statistics and intercorrelations of the variables in the study. As expected, leader political skill was significantly related to follower ratings of relationship quality (<italic>r</italic> = .27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and member ratings of relationship quality were significantly related to both follower ratings of contextual performance (<italic>r</italic> = .34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and leader ratings of contextual performance (<italic>r</italic> = .25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Interestingly, follower ratings of contextual performance were not significantly correlated with leader ratings of contextual performance (<italic>r</italic> = .07, <italic>ns</italic>). Additionally, because leaders and followers each rated two variables each in the model, we performed a Harmon one-factor test for each set of respondents. In each case, the one-factor solution did not explain the most variance (follower, 29%; leader, 39%). Therefore, this gives us some indication that common method bias may not be that strong of an issue in this data.</p>

<title>Hierarchical Linear Modeling Results</title>
<p>Because subordinates were nested within leaders, there may be concerns about leader effects; thus, HLM was employed. A null HLM equation (i.e., with no predictors) demonstrated that there was systematic between-leader variation in leader-rated contextual performance (χ<sup>2</sup> = 165.81, <italic>df</italic> = 36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). The ICC coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051812460099">Hofmann et al., 2000</xref>), calculated from the null model, indicated that 62% of the variance in leaders’ ratings of contextual performance reside between leaders, which indicates that the use of HLM is appropriate.</p>
<p>The HLM results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1548051812460099">Table 5</xref>. The hypotheses were tested using “means as outcomes” analyses in HLM (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812460099">Raudenbush et al., 2004</xref>). To test the proposed mediation of relationship quality in the leader political skill–leadership effectiveness relationships in HLM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812460099">Baron and Kenny’s (1986)</xref> approach was adopted. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1548051812460099">Table 6</xref>, Step 1 of Baron and Kenny’s procedure was supported, with leader political skill significantly predicting relationship quality (γ = .40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Next, in Step 2, leader-rated contextual performance was regressed on leader political skill and was found to be significant (γ = .28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Finally, in Step 3, leader-rated contextual performance was regressed on leader political skill and relationship quality. The impact of leader political skill dropped to nonsignificance (γ = .22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), thus providing support for mediation and the hypothesis.</p>

<title>Contributions to Theory and Research</title>
<p>The results of this two-study investigation indicate that leader political skill has a significant indirect effect on leader effectiveness through leader–follower work relationship quality, thus contributing significantly to theory in this area by helping explain how leader political skill operates to predict both measures of leadership effectiveness. Generally, this research responded to calls by leadership scholars for increased work on models that more precisely articulate the intermediate linkages between leader traits/characteristics and leadership effectiveness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812460099">DeRue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1548051812460099">Van Iddekinge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1548051812460099">Zaccaro, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051812460099">Zaccaro et al., 2004</xref>). More specifically, the present investigation addresses appeals by organizational scientists for empirical research to investigate the mediating conditions between leader political skill and both leader and follower effectiveness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812460099">DeRue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Although researchers have examined leader political skill in the past, most investigated its direct impact on follower attitudes or performance outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812460099">Ahearn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812460099">Treadway et al., 2004</xref>). The finding that leader political skill affects leader–follower work relationship quality, which ultimately affects leader and follower effectiveness, represents an important contribution to theory in the social exchange, LMX, and political skill areas, thus providing more specificity into how leader political skill operates to achieve positive performance outcomes. Furthermore, these results were constructively replicated and extended in a second study, which achieved comparable strength of results in terms of bootstrapping results and coefficients, and thus provide further confidence in the validity of the obtained results (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812460099">Eden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812460099">Hochwarter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812460099">Lykken, 1968</xref>).</p>
<p>These results are important because they help illuminate the “black box” with respect to leader political skill effects, suggesting that it partially operates through the relationships leaders develop with their followers, which then drive the effectiveness of both leaders and followers. Although several studies have examined the impact of leader political skill on leadership effectiveness, group effectiveness, and follower attitudes, there was little understanding of how political skill operates to achieve these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812460099">Ahearn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812460099">Douglas &amp; Ammeter, 2004</xref>). Because there was a significant indirect relationship, and evidence of partial mediation replicated using bootstrapping and HLM, some of the “how it operates” has been explained, thus contributing more empirical specification to theoretical arguments on political skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051812460099">Ferris, Treadway, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812460099">Treadway et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This research reinforces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051812460099">Carmeli et al.’s (2009)</xref> findings that leader relational behaviors affect performance through the cultivation of effective work connections and relationships. Also, the present results support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812460099">Uhl-Bien’s (2003)</xref> suggestion that leader relational skills affect dyadic work relationship quality. Furthermore, these findings expand the work relationships literature, generally, and the LMX literature, specifically. Finally, the results of this investigation shed light on potential work context (e.g., leader characteristics, etc.) effects on employee demonstration of contextual performance.</p>

<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>This research has a number of strengths and limitations that deserve mention, beginning with several methodological strengths that should be noted. First, the two studies together provide constructive replication, which contributes to greater confidence in the validity of the obtained findings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812460099">Eden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812460099">Hochwarter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812460099">Lykken, 1968</xref>). Second, rather than relying solely on self-report data, the research was conducted using matched dyadic data from followers and their leaders and followers and the leader’s administrator. Data from multiple viewpoints alleviates concerns of response bias. Third, between the two studies, we were able to capture two different aspects of leader effectiveness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812460099">DeRue et al. (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812460099">Yukl (2006)</xref> have suggested that when investigating leadership effectiveness, it is important to examine a variety of perspectives. We attempted to do this by examining multiple perspectives regarding some of the different variables (i.e., leaders, the leaders’ administrators, and followers).</p>
<p>To fully understand the results of this investigation, it is necessary to recognize some limitations. First, it needs to be recognized that the use of a newly developed subjective outcome measure (i.e., perceptions of leader performance) is not ideal and, therefore, represents a limitation of this research. Objective measures probably would provide more robust results. It is acknowledged in the research literature that those in higher quality work relationships with their leaders tend to be rated higher in performance regardless of their actual performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812460099">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997</xref>). Additionally, one of the measures of leadership effectiveness was collected from the same viewpoint as the LMX relationship. The CFA results indicated that they were best represented by two factors. Additionally, the results of the Harmon one-factor test indicated a modest amount of common method bias between the followers’ viewpoints of LMX and leadership effectiveness.</p>
<p>However, we did use multiple viewpoints of effectiveness as suggested by researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812460099">DeRue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812460099">Erdogan &amp; Liden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812460099">Yukl, 2006</xref>), and we found similar relationships across two studies and three different viewpoints of leadership effectiveness. This increases confidence that the results are not just artifactual of empirical confound or common method bias, because the other relationships were from different viewpoints and did not suffer from common method bias. Thus, we have three different relationships that confirm that the one relationship is not merely because of empirical artifacts. Additionally, finding support for our hypotheses with different studies (i.e., constructive replication) minimizes some of these concerns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812460099">Hochwarter et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sample sizes were relatively small. We were able to conduct the analyses on only 105 dyads for both studies. However, although this is a small sample size, it still has more than 15 cases per variable, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812460099">Stevens (1999)</xref>. Furthermore, our measures of relationship quality and follower view of leader effectiveness in Study 1, and relationship quality and follower-rated contextual performance in Study 2, were based on single-point-in-time-target (i.e., follower) reports. Although target reports provide multiple views of leader behavior, such views have the potential to be biased by recent events. If possible, future research should attempt to collect each measure at different points in time.</p>

<title>Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>These two studies examine the impact of leader political skill on work relationship quality and leadership effectiveness. Investigating the impact of follower political skill on the development and maintenance of high-quality leader–follower relationships is another promising area for future research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812460099">Dienesch and Liden (1986)</xref> argued that both leader and follower characteristics could affect relationship quality. These authors also maintained that followers’ uses of influencing behaviors could affect relationship development through their impact on leaders’ attributions about follower performance. It might be the case that followers’ political skill also would affect the development and maintenance of leader–follower relationships through its effect on follower influence behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051812460099">Brouer, Duke, Treadway, and Ferris (2009)</xref> investigated both follower political skill and LMX. However, rather than examining the impact of follower political skill on relationship development, these authors examined the moderating effect of political skill on the racial dissimilarity—LMX relationship.</p>
<p>Additionally, recent work has begun to explore the relationship development of the leader beyond that of dyadic exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051812460099">Carmeli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812460099">Uhl-Bien, 2006</xref>). It is argued that leaders can go beyond developing relationships just between themselves and followers, and they can be a key driver of relationship development among followers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051812460099">Carmeli et al., 2009</xref>). Because political skill enables individuals to build alliances, networks, and coalitions, it stands to reason that politically skilled leaders should be able to help their group members develop positive, strong relationships.</p>
<p>Thus, a logical extension would be to see if the leaders’ political skill goes beyond affecting just the dyadic relationship between the leader and follower. For instance, it may be that politically skilled leaders serve as role models for how to interact with others in the workplace because of their ability to set others at ease and easily influence them. Therefore, the entire work group might recognize these behaviors and try to model themselves after the leader. Thus, we might expect leader political skill to affect the quality of relationships formed among team members (i.e., referred to as “team-member exchange,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051812460099">Seers, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent research on the nature of dyadic work relationships has argued for a focus on the underlying dimensions of such relationships, such as trust, respect, time, distance, and affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, future research might seek to extend the present results to investigate which particular dimensions of work relationships between leaders and followers are driven by leader political skill. Because politically skilled leaders are believed to reflect a calm sense of self-confidence, which inspires trust and confidence, it might be hypothesized that the major factors contributing to high-quality work relationships with politically skilled leaders are the trust and confidence followers develop in them, as well as the support they feel the leader will provide them.</p>
<p>Such research could then expand on previous work reporting that leader political skill leads to follower perceived support from leader and trust in leader (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812460099">Treadway et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, Smith, Plowman, Duchon, and Quinn (2008) found that managers conveyed political skill through affability and a sense of humility, and through creating accountability and the development of trust, all of which are important qualities involved in effective work relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812460099">Ferris et al., 2009</xref>). This lends itself to another area of future research that stems directly from an interesting nonsignificant finding in our results. Specifically, our results indicated the administrator and follower ratings of leader effectiveness were unrelated (<italic>r</italic> = .16, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). It would be interesting to compare the politically skilled with the low politically skilled in this instance. It may be that politically skilled leaders would be more likely to be seen as uniformly effective by their followers and their leaders, whereas with those low in political skill, there may be disagreement between the two sets of evaluators.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>The results of this investigation indicate that leader political skill represents a particularly important set of social competencies for organizational leaders. Although political skill is thought to be partly dispositional, it is believed to reflect trainable competencies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812460099">Ferris, Davidson, et al., 2005</xref>), thus providing potential development opportunities on how to become more socially astute, use influence effectively, and how to build and manage networks. Therefore, organizations could use the PSI as a management selection tool, or in managerial training programs.</p>
<p>This article also confirmed that leader–follower quality is related to numerous positive outcomes, such as both leader and follower effectiveness (i.e., including follower contextual performance). High-quality relationships are effective and offer a host of positive outcomes for organizations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051812460099">Carmeli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812460099">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997</xref>). Therefore, it could be helpful for organizations to train leaders on how to develop and maintain such high-quality relationships with their followers. Much of this training can be integrated with the training in political skill. However, in addition to training leaders on how to be good listeners, organizations can train leaders to spend more time with their followers, discussing their needs and expectations for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051812460099">Graen, Liden, &amp; Hoel, 1982</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Leadership is vital for organizational success. This two-study investigation found that leaders high in political skill were able to develop high-quality relationships with their followers, which facilitated both leader and follower effectiveness. Therefore, this investigation highlights the critically important mediating role of leader–follower relationship quality in the linkages between leader political skill and leadership effectiveness measures. Hopefully, these results will stimulate further investigation into the roles of leader characteristics and the nature of relationship quality as they affect important work outcomes.</p>
