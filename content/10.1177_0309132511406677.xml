<p>It is a measure of how far apart the worlds of university and pre-university geography now are – at least here in Britain – that reviewing two books like these in a journal like <italic>Progress</italic> is fairly unusual. Graham Butt is based in Birmingham University’s School of Education, while David Lambert – Chief Executive of Britain’s Geographical Association (established by Halford Mackinder) – and John Morgan both work in London’s Institute of Education. All three are interested in the philosophy and practice of geographical education in schools. Why might their new books matter to university geographers, most of whom, like me, do not research (nor, if truth be told, know too much about) the kind of geography taught to children and teenagers? The answer is pretty obvious, especially in Britain where university geography remains a very popular choice for prospective undergraduates. Quite aside from the personal benefits young people accrue from experiencing a rich, challenging and stimulating geographical education, university geographers’ salaries are largely dependent on a continued stream of well-qualified applicants to their degree programmes. Moreover, some would argue that representatives of the university community should have a larger say in the sort of pre-university curricula being offered in public and private schools. In Britain, if not perhaps elsewhere, academic geographers no longer play the formative role they used to in the 14–16 and 16–18 geography courses taught across the country.</p>
<p>I keep mentioning Britain because both these books need to be understood in a very specific national context of educational policy and reform. The number of students electing to study geography beyond age 14 has tailed off in recent years, especially in England. At the same time, content-heavy and prescriptive geography syllabi are giving way to ones that are more teacher-led. Furthermore, the new coalition government’s planned reforms to primary and secondary education might bring geography back to the ‘high table’ of core subjects. In this context, as Butt argues, ‘“curriculum making” is best achieved when teachers and students have a clear conception of their subject, some agreed criteria for selecting content, and a shared understanding of what is to be achieved’ (p. 5). It is this sort of ‘clear conception’ that Lambert and Morgan aim to provide in their book. Theirs is a purposeful intervention in national discussions about the future of geography teaching in British schools. They argue that teachers should be given more freedom to make the curriculum, but that this freedom be based on a strong grasp of what resources the subject has to offer. For them, the subject ‘is not a list of contents to be covered, but a means of making sense of the world in a special way’ (p. 37). For them, that ‘special way’ is defined by the sort of ‘big concepts’ that most university geographers are familiar with – such as ‘scale’, ‘place’ and ‘space’. The heart of Lambert and Morgan’s book (Part 2) comprises a set of chapters devoted to showing teachers how these concepts can underpin a rich geography curriculum which is structured yet also open and flexible. In these chapters, the authors both cite and use research with which readers of this journal will be well familiar – work by Doreen Massey and Sally Marston, for instance.</p>
<p>The book is topped and tailed by two parts, both of which have important things to say. The first offers both a history and qualified critique of developments in school geography in Britain over the last 60 years. It dispenses programmatic advice on what it means to be a geography teacher today, and links teaching to a ‘capabilities theory’ of the individuals being educated. The final part contains a chapter on what difference the mass media makes to teaching, given that so many geographical topics and issues are communicated to students via the news, documentaries and so on. A short, reflective concluding chapter follows. Throughout, the prose is clear without being dry. The format, while text heavy, is attractive.</p>
<p>Inevitably, perhaps, <italic>Geography, Education and the Future </italic>lacks the cohesion of<italic> Teaching Geography 11–18. </italic>It represents the first fruits of the young Geography Education Research Collective, founded in 2007. In his scene-setting introductory chapter, Graham Butt lists three questions that contributors were asked to respond to: how can geography education prepare young people for the future, how should geography education change to reflect momentous real world changes afoot, and how can geography’s educational agenda be ‘sold’ to others who matter (like government education departments)? These questions are addressed in four parts and 12 chapters, with interleaving section introductions and section-end commentaries. The parts are entitled ‘Children, young people and geography’, ‘Place, space and change’, ‘Mediating forms of geographical knowledge’ and ‘Global ethics, environment and citizenship’, respectively. The whole is very much a pot pourri, and I must say that the commentaries were mostly ineffectual. Personally, the two chapters I found the most interesting were those by David Lambert – who expands on the capabilities approach to individuals flagged in his book with John Morgan – and Roger Frith – who makes the case for geography education in the context of the new sociology of education. Together, Lambert and Morgan reminded me of an unfortunate fact, which is that many university geographers educate students on the basis of a thin, non-existent and often implicit ‘philosophy’ of education. It also reminded that, while curriculum design <italic>should</italic> be contentious – involving important debates about content and delivery – it is often <italic>not</italic> contentious in university departments. Instead, the curriculum is, it seems, often made on the hoof in response to the exigencies of staff availability.</p>
<p>I cannot see many university geographers wanting to read these books, except for those based in departments of education or who actively research geographical learning. Then again, neither text is intended for use by the average academic geographer. This said, it is interesting to see how Lambert and Morgan use ‘our’ research in making their case for a concept-led high-school geography curriculum. Some university geographers would, I am sure, demur from Lambert and Morgan’s deliberately limited focus on ‘subject knowledge’ – what they metaphorically call the ‘grammar’ of geography. I am sure, too, that others would feel that too many chapters in <italic>Geography, Education and the Future</italic> define geography’s raison d’etre in terms of that final term, ‘the future’. At times, Butt’s edited book seems unwilling to acknowledge that geography is, in part, about understanding some of the ‘fundamentals’ that are relatively enduring in importance – such as the dynamics of climate and weather, or the processes that create glacial landscapes. It is important to focus on change, but I am not sure I want to put most of geography’s curriculum eggs in that particular basket. In the wrong hands, it can make geography appear as a rather trendy and hollow field lacking either a fundamental knowledge base or a distinctive perspective.</p>
<p>To summarize, these two books offer real insight into ways of thinking about the nature and value of school geography being promoted in Britain today. They leave me persuaded that some university geographers based outside departments of education should be taking greater interest in the sort of geography that young people experience prior to attending university. But they remind me too that what many educationalists take for granted many of us may be lacking: namely, a thought-through conception of the aims of (higher) education that we can relate to an equally considered understanding of our degree curricula. As undergraduate fees rise sharply from late 2012 in Britain, I suspect that departmental directors of BA and BSc degrees will be busy reviewing current provision. Student-consumers may become more demanding or exacting. That is no bad thing. However, it is important that departments have a robust conception of what they are trying to achieve in their teaching, one that they can defend (if need be) against outside parties who may advance an unduly narrow understanding of what a university geography degree is (good) for.</p>
