<abstract>
<p>In popular models of expertise and decision making in complex environments, such as the recognition-primed decision (RPD) model and take-the-first (TTF) heuristic, expert and skilled decision makers are described as generating few response options and typically choose the best option first. To explain these behaviors, proponents of TTF have suggested that a negative relationship exists between the number of options generated and decision quality. In the current article, we use a prediction and situational option generation paradigm to assess perceptual-cognitive skill in the complex domain of soccer to determine whether these claims explain how decision makers make predictions about others in the environment. In three experiments we provide evidence to show that superior prediction performance was supported by a situation model-type mechanism as proposed by long-term working memory (LTWM) theory rather than simpler heuristics, such as TTF or RPD. The similarity between LTWM mechanisms and relevant macrocognitive processes is discussed. The data have important implications for how future experts should be trained and, in particular, for developing skilled comprehension, apprehension, and prediction skill.</p>

<p>In traditional, normative decision-making paradigms, participants are often presented with a restricted but explicit set of options and are asked to evaluate them and then choose a single option. In the natural ecology, however, performers have to generate response options before a choice can be made about which course of action to pursue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein, 1993</xref>). In the context of chess, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1555343412461254">Simon and Chase (1973)</xref> argued that such decisions were made based on the ability to recognize patterns of pieces that, in turn, served as cues to retrieve appropriate moves. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein, Calderwood, and Clinton-Cirocco (1986)</xref> showed that experienced firefighters similarly reported generating decisions intuitively by retrieving options from their memory of related experiences. Further research is needed that better identifies the cognitive mechanisms that mediate how successful decision makers intuitively generate options in complex domains: (a) to provide a much-needed empirical basis for training decision making and improving performance and (b) to create training programs that effectively develop the type of cognitive mechanisms that support superior performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555343412461254">Ericsson &amp; Ward, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The option generation process has received limited attention in the context of making decisions about personal courses of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1555343412461254">Yates, 2001</xref>), and research examining option generation as an intuitive process in complex settings is sparse (for exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson &amp; Raab, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555343412461254">Raab &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>). Few researchers have examined this process in the context of predicting the possible courses of action to be taken by others in the environment rather than making decisions for oneself (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein &amp; Peio, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412461254">Ward, Suss, Eccles, Williams, &amp; Harris, 2011</xref>). In this article we use a simulated game-reading task in soccer to examine the option generation process when individuals are required to predict the outcome of a complex situation. Our goal is to identify the types of option generation mechanisms that support superior performance in this and similar complex domains such that these data could be used to inform the development of training.</p>

<title>Models of Intuitive Decision Making and Option Generation</title>
<p>Several theories have been proposed to explain how options are generated intuitively (either for oneself or for others)—each of which has different implications for training. For instance, the recognition-primed decision (RPD) model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein et al., 1986</xref>) suggests that as individuals become more experienced and expert within a domain, they store and have access to a large number of patterns in long-term memory and, as a result, are able to recognize familiar patterns in a particular situation. These patterns elicit from memory an associated response option to the situation. Subsequent response options are generated only when the initially generated option is subsequently deemed unsatisfactory. (Although RPD has alternative mechanisms for dealing with unfamiliar situations that go beyond the process of intuition, we do not consider them here.) Hence, the primary predictions of the theory are that (when meaningful options exist in the environment) experts generate better options first, options are generated serially, and little if any concurrent evaluation of options is performed. Although more than one option is often generated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson &amp; Raab, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein, Wolf, Militello, &amp; Zsambok, 1995</xref>), as individuals become more skilled, only one single option need be generated—the best—in an ideal world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1555343412461254">Yates, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The general tenets of the RPD model have been corroborated, primarily through postevent interviews (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412461254">Phillips, Klein, &amp; Sieck, 2004</xref>). Likewise, the specific claims with respect to option generation have been shown to hold in a controlled move selection and response option generation task in chess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein et al., 1995</xref>). High- and medium-skilled chess players considered acceptable moves first and generated only a relatively small number of the possible legal moves (i.e., 3–5). The skill groups did not significantly differ in their option-generation behavior and subjective performance ratings, implying that the mechanisms used likely did not differ between experts and novices.</p>
<p>Based on the fast-and-frugal notion that less is more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555343412461254">Gigerenzer &amp; Goldstein, 1996</xref>), a mechanistically different but complementary model to RPD—the take-the-first (TTF) heuristic—was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson and Raab (2003)</xref> to explain how successful decision makers generate options. The TTF heuristic suggests that experts capitalize on their extensive experience in relevant environments by acquiring learned associations between candidate options and the current situation, as well as between options themselves. Options are generated based on fast and frugal rules to determine how to search (e.g., identifying the entry point and how activation spreads), when to stop searching (e.g., when an option is sufficiently discriminating), and how to decide (e.g., select the option with the highest value) and based on associative memory networks—options that have been repeatedly used in previous situations are more strongly associated with the current situation.</p>
<p>Consistent with RPD, the TTF heuristic predicts that (when meaningful options exist in the environment) experts generate response options sequentially, few options are generated, and, rather than options being generated randomly, typically better options are generated first—because “the strength of the connections in the associative network will be stronger among better options” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson &amp; Raab, 2003</xref>, p. 220). In addition, TTF predicts that as experts generate more options, they risk making a poorer final decision (which may not necessarily be the first one generated; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson &amp; Raab, 2003</xref>). In other words, these authors predict a negative relationship between the number of options generated and the quality of final decision—since options generated earlier in the sequence are expected to be better, when participants stop generating options earlier they are forced to select from a smaller set of better options. Although this latter claim is not a part of RPD, importantly, it provides a potential mechanistic explanation for some specific characteristics of RPD: generation of the better/best option(s) first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein, 1993</xref>) and the observation that, theoretically, experts should strive toward generating only the best option (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1555343412461254">Yates, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>To test their model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson and Raab (2003)</xref> asked handball players to watch a series of 10-s video clips and to imagine they were the player with the ball. At the end of each clip, participants had to “to name as quickly as possible the first decision that intuitively came to mind” (p. 222; e.g., pass to player X, shoot at goal), then “name as many additional options they could conceive” (p. 222), and finally were “asked to decide which one[generated option] was the best for this specific situation” (p. 222). The successful decision makers generated few (i.e., <italic>M</italic> = 2.3) options, and as the number of options generated increased the likelihood of the best option being selected decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson &amp; Raab, 2003</xref>). These original hypotheses were extended to expert performance and supported by data in a subsequent study (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555343412461254">Raab &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The implications from both RPD and TTF are that training should be focused on the (a) perceptual learning of important situational patterns, (b) ability to recognize them when they are available in the environment, (c) ability to acquire strong associations with better, if not the best, response(s), and (d) ability to access the best response option immediately without the need for subsequent option generation or concurrent evaluation of options. For such training to be effective, researchers must first identify the structure of the patterns in complex environments that should be recognized for an associated response to be generated and implemented effectively. However, there has been only a limited focus on how situational events or options are recognized and/or generated, or on how these behaviors can be trained (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1555343412461254">Ward et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Extending Intuitive Models to Prediction and Situational Option Generation</title>
<p>Skilled performers not only have to make good decisions and pursue a course of action effectively, they often have to predict changes in the environment as well as the effects of their actions on the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1555343412461254">Poulton, 1957</xref>). Similar considerations apply to making decisions about an opponent’s actions in games, such as chess, and are supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555343412461254">de Groot’s (1965)</xref> classic research. De Groot showed that, as a means to select the next move for themselves, highly skilled chess players had to first generate the future moves of their opponent. Highly skilled chess players generated better moves, implying that they were able to predict better moves for their opponent in comparison to lesser skilled players. This finding has been corroborated consistently over the past 20 years in research examining the ability of skilled athletes to anticipate their opponent’s intentions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555343412461254">Abernethy, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555343412461254">Williams &amp; Ward, 2007</xref>). Based on de Groot’s research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein and Peio (1989)</xref> stated that an important aspect of skilled decision making lies in the ability to generate situational options by predicting which situational events or actions will, could, or should happen next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein &amp; Peio, 1989</xref>). Moreover, they asserted that the RPD model could accurately account for this predictive, situational component of the decision-making process.</p>
<p>To test this claim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein and Peio (1989)</xref> examined the ability of novice and proficient chess players to predict the moves made in a chess game played by experts. Participants were shown a specific chessboard configuration from the expert’s game, were asked to identify the plausible moves that the opposing player might make, and then were asked to highlight which one the expert actually made. Participants then saw the actual move made by the expert for that position and repeated their analysis for the 20 subsequent different chess positions. Based on the RPD model, proficient players were expected to make more accurate predictions and generate the correct alternative earlier in the sequence of produced options than novices.</p>
<p>On trials where there were at least two reasonable options from which experts could choose (<italic>n</italic> = 15; as rated by grandmasters), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein and Peio (1989)</xref> showed that proficient players predicted significantly the experts’ move more frequently (38%) than novices (23%). These data are consistent with the research that demonstrates that experts more accurately anticipate their opponent’s next move than novices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1555343412461254">Williams, Ward, Knowles, &amp; Smeeton, 2002</xref>). As predicted by the RPD model, G. A. Klein and Peio found two trends that did not reach statistical significance, namely, that proficient chess players generated fewer options per trial than novices (2.3 vs. 2.6) and when correctly predicting the experts’ move proficient players generated this option <italic>first</italic> 59.5% of the time and novices did so only 41.3% of the time.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412461254">Ward et al. (2011)</xref> tested these ideas in a more complex and dynamic domain by extracting option generation strategies from the verbal reports of law enforcement officers in a simulated task environment. Special weapons and tactics (SWAT) and rookie officers physically responded to video-based scenarios and had to make a decision about whether to respond with lethal force. Options generated during both the situational assessment (i.e., when identifying what their opponent might do next) and response (i.e., when in pursuit of a personal course of action) phases of decision making were extracted from the verbal reports and video data. The SWAT officers generated a relatively high number of critical situational options compared to rookie officers (9 vs. 5), which exceeded the noncritical options in number. In addition, the number of critical situational options generated was significantly and positively related to the number of good decisions made. As the number of critical situational options generated increased by one, participants were 1.77 times more likely to have made a correct response. Similar findings were observed during the response phase of decision making.</p>

<title>An Alternative Means to Support Option Generation: Long-Term Working Memory</title>
<p>Although data from research investigating RPD and TTF indicate that simpler heuristics can result in better decisions, data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412461254">Ward et al. (2011)</xref> indicate that the experts’ performance was supported by a comprehensive situational representation. In a range of domains, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555343412461254">Ericsson and Kintsch (1995)</xref> showed that expert performers generate dynamic memory representations that describe the semantic relations of the current situation. These situational representations are stored, integrated, and updated on the fly in long-term memory (LTM) and remain accessible during performance. They facilitate the encoding of predictive and other types of inferences about the situation by experts in a range of domains and support both apprehension and comprehension. Moreover, these representations permit future retrieval demands to be anticipated and allow performance to be effectively executed, monitored, controlled, and subsequently improved. The acquisition of such a representation was termed long-term working memory (LTWM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555343412461254">Ericsson &amp; Kintsch, 1995</xref>). One could describe an expert’s LTWM as a rich representation of the state of the world that encodes multiple options dynamically, often simultaneously, and permits immediate access to this already encoded and filtered range of possibilities for any given situational moment.</p>
<p>The notion of a superior knowledge representation or retrieval structure is not inconsistent with most theories of expertise, including RPD or TTF—more familiar patterns stored in memory and stronger associations between the situation and/or candidate options are core aspects of these specific models. Consistent with RPD and TTF, LTWM predicts that better task-relevant options would be more likely to be generated first—primarily because it would have more semantic relations encoded. However, contrary to TTF, LTWM theory predicts that when task-relevant options exist in the environment, a greater number of task-relevant options would be generated by experts than novices, and a positive relationship would exist between the number of task-relevant options generated and prediction/decision quality. Although TTF predicts that encoding these additional task-relevant options should reduce final prediction/decision quality, LTWM would assert that such encoding provides a means to attain cognitive flexibility. For instance, when an opponent does not take the predicted and/or best option (e.g., when the opponent makes a bad decision or a last-second change to his or her course of action), having immediate access to task-relevant alternatives should facilitate performance. This difference in relationship across the models discussed implies fundamentally different mechanisms for making accurate predictions and decisions: one based, primarily, on association, activation, and fast and frugal rules (TTF) and the other based on skilled indexing of all task-relevant options at encoding and situation model building on the fly (LTWM).</p>
<p>These mechanistic differences have implications for how performance may be improved and how future experts should be trained. Although the former might argue for a focus on adopting context-specific yet simple rules and developing the necessary associations between knowledge and situation, the latter would advocate for developing context-specific prediction, apprehension, and comprehension skills. To determine the kinds of skills that are necessary for successful decision making in complex domains and, therefore, the type of training required to develop these skills, a detailed examination of option generation behavior is needed, and some bounds on when different strategies might be useful need to be defined. This is the focus of our research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1555343412461254">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>In this article, we use a prediction and option generation paradigm to test the proposal that claims based on RPD can be extended to making predictions about situational events in a complex and dynamic task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein &amp; Peio, 1989</xref>). More specifically, we examine whether the specific claims of the TTF heuristic can be extended to this context—primarily to determine whether this heuristic can be viewed as one potential mechanism that could explain specific characteristics of RPD: generating fewer options and better ones first. Answers to these questions will provide a principled and empirical basis for developing the appropriate perceptual-cognitive mechanisms that are capable of supporting the development of expert performance in different dynamic contexts.</p>
<p>In three experiments, we examined differences in skilled and less-skilled soccer players’ ability to encode a dynamic pattern of soccer play under time constraint, anticipate the outcome accurately, and generate and prioritize task-relevant situational options. In line with the general literature on expert performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555343412461254">Ericsson &amp; Ward, 2007</xref>) and on perceptual-cognitive skill in sport (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555343412461254">Williams &amp; Ward, 2007</xref>), across all three experiments we expected skilled players to demonstrate better predictive ability than less-skilled players—as evidenced by superior anticipation of the outcome of each play. Since the chosen domain was dynamic and required encoding under time constraint, we expected that all participants would generate a small number of total options (e.g., 3). However, based on the LTWM claim that experts are superior at encoding and indexing more task-relevant information, we expected that experts would generate more task-relevant options (which were limited in number; i.e., 2–4 per trial) and fewer task-irrelevant options (which were limited only by the number of possible combinations of actions, teammates, movements, and space) than less-skilled players.</p>
<p>Consistent with RPD, TTF, and LTWM, we expected that skilled participants would generate higher quality options as their <italic>first</italic> option more frequently and correctly predict their opponent’s next move as their <italic>first</italic> option more often than less-skilled participants (Experiment 2 only). The predictions about the relationship between the number of (task-relevant) options and prediction quality were different depending on the theoretical perspective (Experiments 2 and 3). Based on LTWM theory, and on the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412461254">Ward et al. (2011)</xref>, we expected that the number of task-relevant options generated and the ability to prioritize those options would both be positively correlated with prediction accuracy, whereas the number of task-irrelevant options was expected to be negatively correlated with prediction accuracy. Collectively, these predictions are counter to TTF, which would predict a negative relationship between the <italic>total</italic> number of options and prediction quality.</p>

<sec id="section5-1555343412461254">
<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>The primary focus of this experiment was to demonstrate skill-based differences in the ability to anticipate the outcome of the situation (i.e., prediction quality) and in the ability to generate and prioritize situational options (see situational assessment section). (a) We expected that relatively few options would be generated given the time constrained nature of the task; (b) counter to TTF, we did not predict any differences in the total number of options generated; (c) but consistent with LTWM, we expected that skilled participants would generate more task-relevant and fewer task-irrelevant options than their less-skilled participants.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Skilled (<italic>n</italic> = 21) and less-skilled (<italic>n</italic> = 20) male soccer players were selected as participants. Skilled participants were recruited from a soccer academy run by a Premier League club in England and played at the highest national level for their age. Nine of these players had received a professional contract from their respective clubs. Less-skilled participants were amateur players recruited from local high schools. The mean age of the two groups was 16.32 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.32) and 16.34 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.07) years, respectively. All experiments were conducted in accordance with American Psychological Association ethical guidelines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1555343412461254">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were presented with video stimuli on a 2.7-m × 3.5-m projection screen, subtending a visual angle of 45° in the horizontal plane and 34° in the vertical plane. The stimuli consisted of video footage from live, 11-player versus 11-player professional and semiprofessional games filmed from a slightly elevated perspective above the goal. In each clip, the offensive pattern of play (i.e., the opposing team with the ball) progressed toward the participant. Similar stimuli filmed from the same perspective have been used in other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson &amp; Raab, 2003</xref>), and construct validity has been repeatedly demonstrated in paradigms similar to those used in this study (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555343412461254">Williams &amp; Ward, 2007</xref>). Using one of two paradigms, each trial ended unexpectedly after viewing for approximately 10 s.</p>
<sec id="section9-1555343412461254">
<title>Anticipation</title>
<p>The temporal-occlusion paradigm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555343412461254">Jones &amp; Miles, 1978</xref>) was used to assess anticipatory performance. Each video simulation was occluded (i.e., the video stimulus changed to a black screen) at one of three potential time points at the end of the simulation: 120 ms prior to an attacking player from the opposing team making contact with the ball with his or her passing foot (pre); at foot–ball contact (contact); or 120 ms after contact (post). Occlusion always occurred when the player with the ball was in the midst of making a pass. After 3 practice trials, 8 test trials were randomly presented in each condition, for a total of 24 unique trials. The participants’ task was to choose the end location of the pass from three different locations on the field. Participants responded during a 5-s intertrial interval using pen and paper.</p>

<title>Situation assessment</title>
<p>A situational option-generation and prioritization paradigm was used to assess the nature of information encoded while viewing each stimulus. Each video simulation ended just prior to an attacking player on the opposing team passing the ball to another player, taking a shot on goal, or retaining possession while running with the ball. Unlike the temporal occlusion paradigm, the last frame of action remained on screen as a still image for 20 s. This approach is consistent with past research on option generation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson &amp; Raab, 2003</xref>). The end point of each sequence was edited to minimize the availability of any postural cues from the player with the ball (e.g., frozen at least 120 ms prior to foot–ball contact).</p>
<p>The participants’ task was to report the options available to the opposing team that were potentially threatening to them (the participants) as defenders. Participants were instructed to generate all <italic>plausible</italic> options that the opposing player with the ball might take and that would warrant some consideration (by the participant), including but not limited to an immediate shot at goal, a pass to another opposing player in a good position to immediately receive the ball, a pass to an opposing player in a good position to coincide his or her movement with receipt of the ball in the surrounding open space, and retaining possession of the ball. Different combinations of these (e.g., opposing player actions, movements, and pitch locations) resulted in unique situational options generated by the participant (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1555343412461254">Ward &amp; Williams, 2003</xref>). Once participants had generated all plausible alternatives, they were asked to prioritize each of their highlighted options by ranking them in an order that reflected the greatest threat posed to their defense. Three practice and 18 test trials were presented.</p>
<p>A panel of three expert soccer coaches from an English Premier League club determined the task-relevant options (e.g., player action/movement and pitch-location combinations) and the criterion prioritization level of each option for every trial. All expert coaches derived their answers by repeatedly scrutinizing the information available to ensure their decisions were based on all of the available dynamic information. In addition, the expert coaches had the benefit of hindsight (i.e., used the unedited films to examine the consequences of the actions observed within the trial, such as the actual outcome of the play and the subsequent actions/movements of players and ball). Only those options where there was total agreement across coaches were included as task-relevant (i.e., good) options against which performance would be scored. There were 53 task-relevant options across all 18 trials.</p>

<title>Anticipation</title>
<p>The number of correctly anticipated outcomes was used as a measure of prediction accuracy. The maximum score in each condition was 8. ANOVA was used to analyze the data with skill (skilled, less skilled) as the between-participant factor and occlusion condition (pre, contact, post) the within-participant factor.</p>

<sec id="section13-1555343412461254">
<title>Situation assessment</title>
<p>We counted the number of task-relevant <italic>and</italic> task-irrelevant situational options generated. A weighted point system was devised to score the option prioritization data. Five points were awarded for correctly assigning the highest priority (i.e., rank 1) to the option prioritized by the expert coaches as posing the most threat, four points for assigning the second highest rank to the second most threatening option, and so on. When participants prioritized an option as being lower or higher than the criterion rank given by the expert coaches, the absolute difference between the participant and criterion ranks was deducted from the above number of points. The number points for each trial was divided by the maximum number of points available for that trial and expressed as a value from 0 to 1. The maximum number of points available for option prioritization across all test trials was 18.</p>
<p>ANOVAs were used to examine skill-based differences in option generation and prioritization, with skill as the between-participant factor. Type of information (task-relevant option, task-irrelevant option) was included as a within- participant factor in the analysis of number of options.

<title>Summary</title>
<p>There were three main findings. First, skilled participants were able to anticipate the outcome more accurately than less-skilled individuals when the video was unexpectedly occluded at a critical moment. There was also a trend toward skilled participants being able to anticipate based on less perceptual information (i.e., when the video was occluded earlier in the sequence). These data demonstrate that in this soccer-specific task, skilled players are capable of predicting situational events based on partial information. Although much research exists that indicates experts are capable of choosing effective courses of action based on incomplete environmental information, few researchers, beyond those in sport, have detailed this effect when predicting the actions of others (e.g., the opponent) in the environment (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein &amp; Peio, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, on average, all players generated just more than two total (i.e., task-relevant and -irrelevant) options per trial (<italic>M</italic> = 2.30, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.26). Although the actual number of total options generated is entirely consistent with RPD, TTF, and LTWM, the absence of a skill effect for option generation contradicts the explicit TTF claim, and the more general RPD claim, that skilled and more experienced participants would generate fewer options than less-skilled/experienced participants (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson &amp; Raab, 2003</xref>; G. A. Klein &amp; Peio, 2003). Moreover, observed differences in the number of task-relevant options generated per trial by the skilled players (<italic>M</italic> = 1.99, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.26) compared to their less-skilled counterparts (<italic>M</italic> = 1.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.20, <italic>d</italic> = 1.67), and similar effects in the opposite direction for the number of task-irrelevant options, are also inconsistent with the fast and frugal heuristic.</p>
<p>These data are more consistent with LTWM than TTF or RPD. However, a stronger test of the claims of TTF would be to examine the relationship between prediction quality and the number of options generated when participants engage in these behaviors simultaneously <italic>in the same paradigm</italic>. This was the focus of and motivation for the next experiment.</p>
<p>Note that in Experiment 1, as in previous research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson &amp; Raab, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555343412461254">Raab &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1555343412461254">Ward &amp; Williams, 2003</xref>), we assessed option generation behavior in a dynamic environment by providing cues that would be unavailable in the real world (e.g., a freeze frame of the last frame of action). In Experiment 2 we removed these unrealistic cues while participants generate their options, and in Experiment 3 we examined the effect of providing or removing such perceptual support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1555343412461254">
<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>There were several goals for this experiment. First, our goal was to replicate the results from Experiment 1 when both tests were integrated into a single paradigm. Despite the increased difficulty that would result from participants performing the combined tasks without perceptual support (i.e., without the last frame of action present), we still expected to find that skilled players would generate more task-relevant and less task-irrelevant options and would prioritize those options better than less-skilled players.</p>
<p>Second, we wanted to examine the order in which participants generated the best situational options and the moves actually taken by their opponent. Consistent with RPD, TTF, and LTWM, we expected that higher quality options and the actual option taken by their opponent would be generated first more frequently.</p>
<p>Third, given the different predictions between TTF and LTWM with respect to the relationship between prediction quality (i.e., anticipation) and (a) the number of situational options generated and (b) the ability to prioritize those options, one of our primary motivations was to explore this relationship further. Based on LTWM and the results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412461254">Ward et al. (2011)</xref>, we expected to find a positive relationship between prediction quality and both the number of task-relevant options generated and the ability to prioritize situational options. We also expected prediction quality to be negatively related to the number of task-irrelevant options generated. Moreover, we expected that the use of verbal reports would provide additional evidence of a more comprehensive situational representation of the type described by LTWM theory. The verbal report data were expected to reflect more complex processing of task-relevant information (such as monitoring, evaluation, prediction, and planning statements).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section22-1555343412461254">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Skilled (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and less-skilled (<italic>n</italic> = 8) adult male soccer players were selected as participants. Skilled participants played at a semiprofessional level and had attended an elite professional training academy. Three skilled participants had played at a professional level. The less-skilled participants were amateur club players with recreational experience only. The mean age of the two groups was 26.04 (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.02) and 28.67 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.22) years, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1555343412461254">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Both anticipation and situation assessment tasks from Experiment 1 were adapted and combined into a novel paradigm (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein &amp; Peio, 1989</xref>). The video stimuli used to assess situation assessment in Experiment 1 were used in this experiment, with one notable difference; at the end of each clip, the stimulus was occluded unexpectedly using a perceptual mask such that participants had to perform the tasks without any detailed perceptual information.</p>
<sec id="section24-1555343412461254">
<title>Combined anticipation and situation assessment task</title>
<p>Participants were presented with a line drawing of the pitch (27 × 40 cm) that replicated the final video frame, except that it was devoid of context, other than pitch markings, goal posts, and the ball position at the end of the trial. Participants were asked to mark on the line drawing the final position of any players they were attending to at the end of the video. They were informed that the total number of players recalled was unimportant. The goal was to identify the positions and movements of players implicated in the offensive pattern of play such that they could perform the subsequent tasks. Attacking and defending players were denoted using X and O, respectively, and the movements of players and the ball were denoted using directional arrows.</p>
<p>In the anticipation portion of the task, participants anticipated the <italic>action</italic> the player with the ball would perform immediately after the occlusion. Three alternatives were provided—pass the ball, shoot at the goal, or retain possession—since these were the only plausible alternatives immediately available. Chance performance for action was only 1 in 3. Participants were then asked to generate the <italic>direction</italic> of play (i.e., direction of run, shot, or pass). The direction-related responses were categorized into one of four alternatives: toward, to the left of, to the right of, or away from the actual recipient of the ball (e.g., directly behind the player with the ball). Chance performance was 1 in 4 for anticipation of direction. When participants anticipated the outcome to be a pass, they were asked to identify the pass recipient. Players could, in theory, have chosen a pass recipient from all 10 of their teammates, making chance performance for pass recipient alone 1 in 10. Chance level for correctly choosing the actual action <italic>and</italic> direction of play was 1 in 12, and for choosing the actual action, direction, <italic>and</italic> pass recipient, 1 in 120. Direction and pass recipient responses are presented as cumulative scores.</p>
<p>In the situation assessment portion of the task, participants completed the same option generation/prioritization paradigm as in Experiment 1. Participants were asked to perform the anticipation and situation assessment components concurrently and without emphasizing one part over the other—so that they would naturally organize their judgments about what actually would (anticipation), could (option generation), and should (option prioritization) happen next. Participants’ responses were coded by two different experimenters (interobserver agreement = 92.4%) and, where possible, verified by verbal report data and video recordings of responses. Three practice and 18 test trials/stimuli were presented.</p>
<p>After each trial was completed, the last video frame was shown to participants. For purposes of exploration, they were asked to “redo” the tasks with perceptual information present. The same metrics were recorded. However, because of the obvious order effect these data were not included in the primary analyses. Some additional analyses are presented. The study design for each trial (including completing tasks with perceptual cues) is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1555343412461254">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Think-aloud verbal reports</title>
<p>Prior to the start of the experiment participants were instructed on how to think aloud. The instructions were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412461254">Ericsson and Simon’s (1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555343412461254">1993</xref>, pp. 375–379) original instructions to include an extended set of domain-specific warm-up tasks. Participants were then asked to provide a concurrent verbal report while viewing each video sequence and performing the experimental tasks.</p>
<p>Verbal reports of the type described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412461254">Ericsson and Simon (1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555343412461254">1993</xref>) have been shown not to be reactive, except to slow down performance in time-constrained tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555343412461254">Fox, Ericsson, &amp; Best, 2011</xref>). Given that viewing an evolving pattern of soccer play in soccer is a time-constrained activity, we expected that concurrent verbalizations while viewing the dynamic stimuli would permit limited access to the participants’ actual on-line thoughts and would be restricted to monitoring statements only. Although the participants’ responses and verbalizations in this experiment were based solely on information represented under time constraints, the subsequent experimental tasks themselves were not time constrained. Therefore, there was no reason to expect that concurrent verbal reporting would significantly modify their thoughts.</p>
<p>Verbal reports were recorded using an external microphone and video recorder and then transcribed. An inductive task analysis was conducted to derive codes. Transcriptions were coded using a protocol analysis method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555343412461254">Ericsson &amp; Simon, 1993</xref>). Action-based codes included relations such as pass, shoot, retain, move, defend, attack, and possession, as well as element codes for identifying each player and locations on the pitch. Different combinations of these relations and elements (e.g., player, action, movement, and pitch-location combinations) resulted in unique options generated by the participant. An example of the final frame of action and the player and pitch coding is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1555343412461254">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Four different types of verbal statements were coded, namely, monitoring, prediction, deep planning, and evaluation. Monitoring referred to all statements representing the current state. Predictions included any statement that referred to immediate possible outcomes of the current situation. Deep-planning statements referred to searching possible alternatives beyond the immediately available options. Evaluations were statements that made some form of assessment or comparison, typically in the form of positive (e.g., win, best, better, good) or negative appraisal (e.g., bad, worse, won’t work) of a monitoring, prediction, or deep-planning statement. The data were encoded on two separate occasions by the primary experimenter, and a random sample was coded by a third party. The proportion of agreement between coders ranged from 87.0% to 95.5%.</p>

<sec id="section27-1555343412461254">
<title>Anticipation and situation assessment data</title>
<p>One point was awarded for each correctly anticipated action, direction of play, and pass recipient. The maximum score for anticipation of action only and the cumulative scores for anticipation of action + direction and anticipation of action + direction + pass recipient were 18, 36, and 54 points, respectively. Scores in the situation assessment tasks (i.e., option generation and prioritization) were calculated using the same procedures as in Experiment 1. We also recorded the order in which participants generated task-relevant options and actual next move taken by the opposing team (i.e., the option they were attempting to predict in the anticipation component of the task). These data are reported as the percentages of all the task-relevant options generated by each skill group.</p>
<p>ANOVA was used to analyze skill-based differences in each variable, with skill as the between-participants factor. Type of information (task relevant, task irrelevant) was included as a within-participant factor in the analysis of number of options. Effect size data (η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) are provided. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the anticipation and situation assessment variables. Each anticipation variable was used as an outcome variable in separate analyses. Skill was entered first as the sole predictor variable.

<title>Condition effects</title>
<p>To explore whether participants performed differently when given the opportunity to “redo” the tasks when the last frame of action was presented back to them, we conducted additional separate ANOVAs on all variables and included condition (noncued, cued) as a within-participant factor. The skill effect was significant for each of the anticipation, <italic>F</italic>(1, 14) = 7.03–15.00, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .33–.52, and situation assessment variables, <italic>F</italic>(1, 14) = 4.68–26.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .25–.65. Likewise, the Skill × Type of Information interaction for the analysis of number of options remained, <italic>F</italic>(1, 14) = 11.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .46. The condition effects were also significant for each anticipation, <italic>F</italic>(1, 14) = 14.71–43.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .51–.76, and situation assessment variable, <italic>F</italic>(1, 14) = 15.85–35.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .53–.72. All groups improved their performance when they were allowed to redo the task with the available perceptual cues. The Skill × Condition interactions were not significant (<italic>F</italic> &lt; 2). To eliminate the possibility of an order effect, these findings were further examined in Experiment 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section35-1555343412461254">
<title>Order of situational options generated</title>
<p>In the cued condition, 24% of the task-relevant options generated by the skilled participants were the highest quality options (i.e., the best move for their opponent) that were generated as their <italic>first</italic> situational option. The skilled participants generated the best option <italic>first</italic> more often than when they generated the second highest quality option as their <italic>first</italic> option (16%), or when they generated the highest quality option (10%) or the second highest quality option (13%) as their <italic>second</italic>. In contrast, 13% of task-relevant options generated by the less-skilled participants were the highest quality option generated as their <italic>first</italic> option and 12% were of the second highest quality option as their <italic>first.</italic> The less-skilled players generated the highest quality and the second highest quality options as their <italic>second</italic> options 7.5% and 5% of the time, respectively.</p>
<p>Although the highest quality option and actual next move taken by their opponent were not independent, skilled participants correctly predicted their opponent’s move as their <italic>first</italic> option slightly more often (19%) than did the less-skilled participants (16%). Both groups correctly predicted their opponent’s move as their <italic>second</italic> option about 11% of the time. Recall that percentages are expressed as a proportion of all options generated by a particular skill group. Since skilled players typically generated more task-relevant options and anticipated the outcome more accurately, the same percentage values equate to better performance by skilled players.</p>

<sec id="section36-1555343412461254">
<title>Relationship Between Prediction Accuracy and Option Generation/Prioritization</title>
<p>Anticipation of <italic>action</italic> only and the cumulative anticipation scores of <italic>action + direction</italic> and <italic>action + direction + pass recipient</italic> were used as the dependent variables. The situation assessment variables (i.e., number of task-relevant options, number of task-irrelevant options, and option prioritization score) accounted for an additional 45% (42% adjusted), 23% (14% adjusted), and 8% (1% adjusted) of the variance in anticipation accuracy, respectively, over and above the effect of skill. The regression data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1555343412461254">Table 3</xref>.</p>
<p>There were significant positive correlations between the number of task-relevant options and each of the anticipation variables. Similarly, the option prioritization scores were positively correlated with anticipation accuracy. In contrast, negative correlations were found between the number of task-irrelevant options and anticipation accuracy. The correlations data used to partition the variance are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1555343412461254">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>When the experimental tasks were performed with perceptual information removed (i.e., noncued), the results of Experiment 1 were replicated: Skilled players were more accurate than less-skilled players at anticipating their opponent’s actions. In addition, they were better at anticipating the subsequent result of that action. Per Experiment 1, the skilled players also generated more task-relevant and fewer task-irrelevant options compared to less-skilled participants and prioritized task-relevant options more appropriately. These data show that experts are still capable of making accurate predictions and situational assessments even when important retrieval cues in the form of the last frame of action are unavailable at the time of reporting.</p>
<p>In the context of the current line of inquiry, more important are the tests of the specific theoretical claims and the implications of the observed mechanisms for training. First, as per Experiment 1, and consistent with RPD, TTF, and LTWM, all players generated relatively few total options per trial (<italic>M</italic> = 2.02, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.43). However, as observed in Experiment 1, the absence of a skill effect in the analysis of the option generation data in the current experiment (and the generation of more task-relevant options by skilled players) provides further evidence that is inconsistent with the TTF claim that skilled players would generate fewer total options than less-skilled players.</p>
<p>Consistent with all three models, skilled players generated a higher percentage of best options as their first option than less-skilled players, and this percentage was greater than for any other combination of option quality and generation order (i.e., highest quality option generated <italic>second</italic>, second highest quality option generated <italic>first</italic>, second highest quality option generated <italic>second</italic>). As a means to evaluate the TTF heuristic as a potential mechanism for how the best options are generated first a greater proportion of the time, recall that we examined the relationship between numbers of options generated and prediction quality. Counter to the TTF claim of a negative relationship between the <italic>total</italic> number of options and decision quality, there was a positive relationship between the number of task-relevant options generated/option prioritization and the quality of the associated anticipatory decision. In contrast, only the number of task-irrelevant options was negatively correlated with prediction quality. Even when the effect of skill was statistically controlled, the same significant correlations were observed between the numbers of options generated and quality of the generated prediction.</p>
<p>These data are consistent with LTWM theory and suggest that, rather than using fast and frugal rules or recognition-based decisions, the skilled soccer players built and used, on the fly, a more comprehensive situation model-type mechanism to support their performance. The verbal report data provide additional evidence that performance was supported by the type of situational representation espoused by LTWM. Skilled participants made more higher-order verbalizations (i.e., more prediction and positive evaluation statements) and greater reference in those statements to a higher number of unique options.</p>
<p>Collectively, these data have implications for training in this specific domain and in domains where similar ecological structure can be identified (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412461254">Brunswik, 1957</xref>). Rather than basing training on fast and frugal rules, training should be geared toward the development of greater prediction, apprehension, and comprehension skills. Training that increases option awareness and encourages trainees to generate alternatives and/or consider plausible futures—developed by researchers most aligned with the RPD framework (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412461254">Cohen, Freeman, &amp; Thompson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412461254">G. L. Klein, Drury, &amp; Pfaff, 2011</xref>)—arguably has made the greatest progress in this regard. One of the beneficial consequences of these and related training programs may be to promote situation or mental model-building skills of the type advocated by LTWM (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1555343412461254">Ward et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555343412461254">Ward, Suss, &amp; Basevitch, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The additional exploratory analyses that included condition as a within-participant factor suggest that large skill effects, and the same relationships between option generation and prediction quality, occurred irrespective of condition. However, both groups improved their performance when moving to the cued condition. It seems likely that the presentation of retrieval cues helped both skilled and less-skilled players access stored information, but this may be a simple order effect where performance in the cued condition benefited from the information generated in response to the noncued condition. To distinguish these possibilities we designed another experiment where the conditions were systematically varied and presented in a randomized order.</p>

<sec id="section42-1555343412461254">
<title>Experiment 3</title>
<p>The primary purpose of this experiment was to further examine the improvement in performance reported in Experiment 2 when perceptual information was presented back to the participants. In this experiment, we conducted a modified within-participant version of Experiment 2, without eliciting any verbal reports. Participants responded to different trials presented with (i.e., cued) or without (i.e., noncued) perceptual cues but not both. We expected to be able to replicate the findings of Experiment 2, irrespective of whether trials were presented with or without perceptual cues.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section44-1555343412461254">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Skilled (<italic>n</italic> = 20) and less-skilled (<italic>n</italic> = 20) female soccer players were selected as participants. The skilled participants played Division 1 collegiate-level soccer in the United States. Of the skilled players, 11 played at the national level for their respective country and age group. The less-skilled participants had played soccer on a recreational basis only. The mean age of the two groups was 19.57 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.16) and 22.50 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.25), respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section45-1555343412461254">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The video stimuli and experimental tasks were the same as in Experiment 2. However, after viewing the dynamic action sequence and perceptual mask, participants responded to each of the 18 trials under only one condition (i.e., cued or noncued). To ensure that task difficulty was similar in each condition, all 18 trials were first ranked from most to least predictive of performance (based on the data in Experiment 2). Of the most 12 predictive trials, 6 were viewed in each condition. The number of options available on each trial in every group of 6 trials was comparable across conditions (<italic>M</italic> = 3).</p>
<p>The order of presentation of cued and noncued test trials was counterbalanced. Half of the participants responded to 6 of the 18 trials under cued conditions (e.g., A–F) and 6 of the remaining 12 (e.g., G–L) under noncued conditions. The other half responded to the same sets of trials under the alternate conditions (e.g., cued G–L, noncued A–F). The remaining 6 (least predictive) trials were presented as noncued trials and considered filler trials in both conditions (e.g., M–R). A random trial order was used such that participants could not predict whether they would respond to the next trial under cued or noncued conditions.</p>
<p>In both conditions, prior to completing the experimental task participants first marked the final position of players implicated in the attacking sequence of play directly on a line drawing of the pitch (as in Experiment 2). Then they completed the experimental tasks. Participants’ responses were coded by two different experimenters (interobserver agreement = 98.5%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section46-1555343412461254">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>The anticipation and situation assessment data were calculated as per Experiment 2. We used ANOVA to examine skill-based differences in each variable. Skill was the between-participants factor and condition (cued, noncued) the within-participants variable. In the analysis of number of options generated, the type of information (task-relevant options, task-irrelevant options) was included as a within-participants factor. Effect size data are provided.</p>
<p>As in Experiment 2, multiple linear regression analysis was used to predict anticipation performance. Skill was entered first, and then the combined scores for each of the situation assessment variables were entered at the next step. Pearson’s product–moment correlations were used to apportion the variance.</p>

<p>The correlation data indicate that there were significant, moderate to large, positive correlations between the anticipation variables and both the number of task-relevant options and option prioritization score. The negative correlations between the number of task-irrelevant options and the anticipation data were significant only when correlated with anticipation of action + direction + destination.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>When we accounted for the presentation order of condition (cf. Experiment 2), the main conclusions did not differ considerably from those presented in Experiment 2. A positive correlation was still observed between the quality of predictions and (a) the number of task-relevant options generated and (b) the ability to prioritize generated options. The anticipation scores did not differ as a function of condition, and although there were some minor differences in situation assessment scores in this experiment, the relationship between option generation and prediction quality remained constant. As in Experiments 1 and 2, although all participants generated relatively few options, the skilled players anticipated significantly more options than the less-skilled participants, generated more task-relevant options and fewer task-irrelevant options, and prioritized those options better. In sum, the conclusions in Experiment 2 were not affected by varying the availability of perceptual information cues at responding. This is an important finding since prior research has largely examined option generation by making perceptual cues available (even though they would not necessarily remain available in the natural ecology).</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, we examined whether the predictions of the RPD model and the TTF heuristic—originally proposed to describe making decisions about personal (or own-team) courses of action in complex environments—could be applied to making predictions about complex situational events, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein and Peio (1989)</xref>. Similar to LTWM theory, both RPD and TTF predict that few options will be generated and the best option will be generated first. However, contrary to LTWM theory, TTF predicts an inverse relationship between the number of options generated and the resulting decision/prediction quality. As a consequence, successful and expert decision makers should generate fewer options than less-skilled and novice participants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson &amp; Raab, 2003</xref>). The relationship proposed by TTF and its underlying fast-and-frugal mechanism provides a potential explanation for why experts generate the best or better options first (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein et al., 1986</xref>). Although few empirical tests of these claims have been made, support has been found when making decisions about personal courses of action (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson &amp; Raab, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555343412461254">Raab &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>) and predicting the course to be taken by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein &amp; Peio, 1989</xref>). However, contrary findings have been observed in the domain of law enforcement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412461254">Ward et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Partial support was found in the current set of experiments for the RPD model and TTF heuristic in the form of the generation of relatively few <italic>total</italic> options (i.e., 2–3) and better options being generated first. However, these predictions are not unique to these models (see LTWM), and the temporal constraints of the task could provider a simple explanation for the number of options generated—as the time available to encode the dynamic stimulus increases, the number of options that can feasibly be generated will decrease. From our perspective, the basis for generating better options first is more interesting. The current data suggest that the performance of participants in this study was mediated by a more complex representation than the fast-and-frugal mechanism proposed by TTF.</p>
<p>Rather than a negative relationship between anticipation accuracy and the <italic>total</italic> number of options generated (as predicted by TTF), we observed a positive relationship between anticipation accuracy and the number of <italic>task-relevant</italic> options generated/prioritized. At the same time, we observed a negative relationship between the number of task-<italic>irrelevant</italic> options and anticipation accuracy—more akin to the mechanisms of TTF. These data tentatively suggest that two component processes support the on-line development of an accurate situational representation from which high-quality predictions can be made: increased task-relevant encoding and task-irrelevant information reduction. In the context of the series of soccer studies presented in this article, we interpret the data to mean that the skilled players successfully anticipate their opponents’ intentions by dynamically encoding and integrating the evolving pattern of play on the fly, apprehending and representing each possible threat posed by the opposing team hierarchically, while excluding from their situational model the opposing players who did not pose a threat.</p>
<p>The verbal report data provide additional evidence that support the view that skilled performance was mediated by a dynamic situational representation of the type proposed by LTWM—skilled players engaged in more effective encoding of the available task-relevant alternatives by verbalizing more predictive inferences about task-relevant options (beyond the actual predicted outcome) and evaluating these options more effectively. Likewise, the ability to assess the situation and anticipate the outcome from memory without access to the perceptual information in the noncued conditions (i.e., Experiments 2 and 3) provides additional support that skilled individuals were able to build a situational representation of the dynamic pattern of soccer play that remained accessible after encoding. These data are most consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555343412461254">Ericsson and Kintsch’s (1995)</xref> LTWM theory and suggest that, with increases in skill, expert performers are capable of generating on the fly, situational representations that describe the semantic relations of the current situation that facilitate apprehension of the situation and, among other inferences, the ability to make accurate predictions about how the situation will unfold (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412461254">Kintsch, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>In a recent review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555343412461254">Suss and Ward (in press)</xref> argued that the type of situation model-building mechanism proposed by LTWM is quite similar to the macrocognitive notions of sizing up a situation and mentally projecting about its future state (albeit on the fly), and to the ideas of developing mental models or engaging in mental simulation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein et al., 2003</xref>). However, rather that adhering to views of mental models as static schemas and mental simulation as a means to “test” ideas about how to proceed (e.g., when the situation is unfamiliar or when generated options turn out to be unworkable), the dynamic situational mechanism proposed by LTWM provides a means to explain both the perception and action components of intuitive decision making in real time. In addition to permitting skilled comprehension and assessment of the current situation, this mechanism supports skilled apprehension—immediate access to meaningful situational patterns and immediate predictions about the future state of the current situation and how to respond.</p>
<p>In the natural ecology, the ability to use alternative heuristics as the context demands is likely to be highly beneficial to successful performance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555343412461254">Gigerenzer &amp; Todd, 1999</xref>). In the context of previous findings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412461254">Johnson &amp; Raab, 2003</xref>, vs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412461254">Ward et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein &amp; Peio, 1989</xref>, vs. the present study), rather than interpreting the current data as the only possible explanation for complex performance—which we are not proposing—this can be more readily explained by the skilled use of the most appropriate mechanism given the available context. The more appropriate question, then, might not be which mechanisms explain expert and superior performance but when (i.e., in which contexts and under which circumstances) each mechanism should be employed to achieve a successful outcome. More research is needed that adequately maps the ecology to indicate when each mechanism might be most effective.</p>
<p>One could argue that the use of the type of mechanisms proposed by RPD might be most applicable for performance in tough yet routine situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein, 1997</xref>). However, researchers agree that the ability to recognize situations as <italic>un</italic>familiar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555343412461254">Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009</xref>) and/or examine performance on low-frequency, nonroutine cases is likely to bring about a greater understanding of the cognitive mechanisms responsible for expert performance in many complex domains (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555343412461254">Ericsson, Whyte, &amp; Ward, 2007</xref>). Consequently, in addition to individual skill level, an appreciation of the environmental regularities of the situation in which individuals perform is likely to provide a more solid basis for determining the type of thinking and strategy to be adopted and the success of the performance that ensues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412461254">Brunswik, 1957</xref>).</p>
<p>There are some significant differences between the domain of soccer and other complex domains of expertise. On the surface, the criticality and life-threatening nature of the kinds of decisions made in contexts such as firefighting and the military stand in stark contrast to those made in highly competitive domains such as sports. However, other researchers have contended that many more meaningful similarities than differences exist between such domains, similarities that could be leveraged to further our understanding of the generalizability of human performance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555343412461254">Fiore, Hoffman, &amp; Salas, 2008</xref>). For instance, in two recent studies that examined the options generated by skilled and less-skilled law enforcement officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412461254">Ward et al., 2011</xref>) and nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1555343412461254">Ward, Torof, Whyte, Eccles, &amp; Harris, 2010</xref>), when making life-threatening decisions (e.g., shoot/no-shoot decisions; treating patients in physiologic decline) similar results were obtained to those in the present work with soccer players. Given that we have observed similar results in different types of domains, yet see different option generation strategies in different sports (i.e., volleyball vs. soccer), without further specification the differences between and within domains alone are unlikely to provide a strong basis for answering the question of when particular mechanisms are most appropriate. In our opinion, it is more likely that situational factors such as the ecological texture beyond cue validity alone (e.g., option validity, similarity, complexity, and difficulty) and other situational constraints such as stress and time pressure, and their interaction with skill level in terms of option utilization, are likely to provide more insight into the skilled use of context-appropriate heuristics and strategies.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that differences exist in how decisions are made in the field and in the laboratory, and that the representative methods used in this study may have affected the results. For instance, in the natural ecology, assessments, predictions, and decisions are often made in a fraction of a second—without sufficient time to verbally report on numerous options, even if other options were consciously accessible. Consequently, the number of options participants could feasibly verbalize (i.e., when 2 or more task-relevant options are available) is likely to be closer to 0 or 1 than the numbers hypothesized by each of the theoretical models discussed (e.g., 2–5). However, following Raab and colleagues and some of our own earlier research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555343412461254">Raab &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1555343412461254">Ward &amp; Williams, 2003</xref>), in the present study we asked participants to view dynamic stimuli—where encoding time was severely constrained by the situation—but then asked them to generate situational options and predict the outcome of a specific moment in time (i.e., postocclusion)—where the time available to generate options was extended (for a review of similar methods in human factors research, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555343412461254">Suss &amp; Ward, in press</xref>). As indicated in the method section, to avoid prolific option generation and undue deliberation, we attempted to restrict the generation of options to those “of concern” up until the point of occlusion rather than permit option generation ad infinitum. Relative to the total number of possible options available, the small number of options generated by all participants suggests that we were, at least modestly, successful in this regard.</p>
<p>Despite these differences, it is our belief that representative task methods used in this research provide one possible means to obtain a window into the expert’s mind’s eye to better understand the mechanisms that support skilled apprehension and comprehension in dynamic contexts. This research could be translated to the field using a variation of the paradigms used in this research and of existing technologies (e.g., field-based temporal occlusion via liquid crystal spectacles; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555343412461254">Starkes, Edwards, Dissanayake, &amp; Dunn, 1995</xref>). This would permit researchers to gain insight into the options that are consciously accessible to participants but, given the prohibitive time limitations of dynamic contexts, would otherwise be inaccessible at the moment of the decision (except, e.g., via retrospective interview methods). When we have examined prediction and decision making in a dynamic simulated environment—where the number of options generated during assessment/prediction and decision making were limited by the situational constraints rather than methodology, and the options generated were extracted from retrospective verbal reports of thinking—more rather than fewer options were generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412461254">Ward et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section55-1555343412461254">
<title>Implications for Training</title>
<p>This body of research has considerable implications for training perceptual-cognitive skills (i.e., situation assessment, perceptual anticipation, prediction, and decision making) in many domains. Previously, researchers have indicated that anticipation skill can be improved in the laboratory and in the field (i.e., by highlighting important perceptual cues and providing knowledge of their relationship to the outcome of a play; see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1555343412461254">Williams et al., 2002</xref>). It is our contention that a modified option-generation, prioritization and prediction paradigm could be used to enhance such training to increase trainees’ awareness of the structure of the ecology, the viability and quality of available options (where they exist), the ability to predict the outcome, and the appropriateness of different heuristics and of the situational factors that constrain each of these elements. We expect that the utility of this approach and the availability of any given option would be highly contingent on the specific complexities and nuances of each situation. Pursuing further research that identifies how context constrains strategy will provide a principled basis for accelerating the skill acquisition process.</p>
<p>Although differences exist across models in the nature of mechanisms that support performance, we expect that research that attempts to train these features of performance will be highly beneficial. Researchers who have exploited techniques that increase awareness and/or exploration of task-relevant options (e.g., option awareness training, crystal ball technique, decision skills training), for instance, by having participants engage in mental simulation as a means to assess the value of generated options (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412461254">G. A. Klein, 1997</xref>), have demonstrated the efficacy of these kinds of approaches for improving skilled performance across several domains (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412461254">Cohen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412461254">G. L. Klein et al., 2011</xref>). However, we would go one step further and suggest that when training also requires participants to anticipate the future state of the situation, more specific development would occur of the types of situational mechanisms that support performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1555343412461254">Ward et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555343412461254">Ward et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section56-1555343412461254">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>In sum, data collected across three experiments in soccer indicated that although all participants generated few options, on average skilled participants predicted more accurately the outcome of the situation and generated more task-relevant and fewer task-irrelevant options than did less-skilled participants. The observed positive relationship between the number/prioritization of task-relevant options generated and anticipation accuracy together with the verbal report data suggest that skilled prediction was more consistent with the use of an LTWM-based situational representation rather than of simpler heuristics, such as TTF or RPD.</p>
<p>The data have important implications for how future experts should be trained. To improve skilled prediction, apprehension, and performance, trainees should engage in training that increases awareness and exploration of relevant options and that allows them to assess the value of generated options, for instance, via mental simulation. Furthermore, when such training requires participants to predict the outcome of a broad range of challenging situations, we propose that more specific development would occur of the types of situational mechanisms that support performance. Future theories of expert skill need to be able to describe the range of mechanisms that account for superior prediction and decision making across a range of contexts. In addition, they need to be able to account for how these mechanisms are developed through training and practice. It is important that theories of expert skill should be able to predict <italic>when</italic> the use of the proposed mechanisms will result in superior performance such that training can be tailored appropriately.</p>
