<p>Henry Teune, a member of our Editorial Board, died on April 12, 2011, after battling cancer for a number of years. Teune was completing his 50th year in the Political Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania, where he distinguished himself by serving as chair and by holding other key positions in the department and the Graduate School. Teune was a past president of the International Studies Association (1981–1982) and was active in the International Political Science Association and the International Sociological Association. He will be missed by friends and colleagues in countries across the world.</p>
<p>Teune was a member of the Editorial Board of <italic>Comparative Political Studies</italic> since 1974. He published an article in the very first issue of <italic>CPS</italic> in April 1968, titled “Measurement in Comparative Research.” While Teune is widely known for his professional activities, and for his coauthorship (with Adam Przeworski) of The <italic>Logic of Comparative Social Inquiry</italic>, his continued presence and mentorship on behalf of <italic>CPS</italic> is less well-known. Over a period of many decades, he never (not once) failed to respond to a manuscript sent to him for a review. His evaluations were models of clarity and incisiveness. His commitment to the journal, and to the profession, was remarkable.</p>
<p>Few people know how profoundly Teune shaped the early development of <italic>Comparative Political Studies</italic>. Indeed, he was one of a number of scholars, along with Harry Eckstein and Gabriel Almond, who were regularly consulted by SAGE Publications even before the journal had a functioning Editorial Board. He helped to establish <italic>CPS</italic> as a leading publication in political science.</p>
<p>Teune will be missed by all of us involved in comparative and international politics. He will be especially missed by me, since he was my PhD advisor and mentor throughout my career.</p>
