<abstract>
<p>Mitigation measures, especially municipal energy infrastructure transformation, have been the focus of Sweden’s climate change responses. Recently, adaptation measures have grown in priority and planners are challenged to integrate mitigation and adaptation. In our study, we observe how synergies and conflicts in adaptation, mitigation, and other social and economic dimensions of spatial planning are grappled with in municipalities. We draw primarily from interviews with municipal planners and regional agencies as well as a review of policy documents. Our conclusion is that municipalities could be assisted in their climate change planning by stronger regional and national involvement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The processes in which a society’s responses to climate change occur require more study. Spatial planning, often at its most concrete at the local level, is tasked with finding responses to the challenge of climate change. Two approaches for doing so, <italic>mitigation</italic> and <italic>adaptation</italic>, are only partially understood. Having achieved some familiarity in tackling problems of mitigation, spatial planning is increasingly being mandated to consider adaptation issues as well. In recent academic literature, the issue of integrating adaptation and mitigation in planning by creating synergies rather than conflicts has also been considered.</p>
<p>While the terms mitigation and adaptation are useful in rallying political momentum and organizing the ensuing implementation of climate change policy, a preoccupation with either can lead to suboptimal results. Not only the focus on these approaches but also the very use of the terms themselves often have a strong framing and even limiting effect on the development of response processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739456X12463943">Tol 2005</xref>). At times, they create a separation in attitude and perspective so evident that it forms a dichotomy of approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12463943">Biesbroek, Swart, and Van der Knaap 2009</xref>). Indeed, in some cases, an emphasis on one leads to a conflict with the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739456X12463943">Hamin and Gurran 2009</xref>), while in other cases, both conflicts and synergies emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739456X12463943">Davoudi, Crawford, and Mehmood 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X12463943">Laukkonen et al. 2009</xref>). Working with an awareness of the potential for both conflicts and synergies between adaptation and mitigation can give rise to a focus that achieves an integration of the two approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12463943">Biesbroek, Swart, and Van der Knaap 2009</xref>). The purpose of this paper is to explore challenges that municipal administrations face when including climate change in their panoply of concerns, as well as to increase our knowledge of how these challenges can best be faced, so that concrete and strong responses are achieved. To do so, we draw upon the experience of municipal planners and representatives of regional agencies that we have interviewed, and which we have complemented through a review of policy documents.</p>
<p>While our key results do show that the integration of mitigation and adaptation is a challenge at the local level, as the two approaches may create conflict, there are also other more general, and even more important, issues. Those relate more generally to conflicts of interest between, on one hand, a focus on climate change response and, on the other, the imperatives of more short-term economic and social aspects of local spatial development. Those conditions are accentuated by the lack of regional and national assistance to the municipal level. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12463943">Biesbroek, Swart, and Van der Knaap (2009)</xref> discuss options that are more directly relevant to facing the more intricate challenge of integrating adaptation and mitigation approaches, we argue that they can also speak to the inclusion of climate change response more generally, when other dimensions of local spatial development—often short-term, economic, and social aspects—must also share priority on the municipal agenda, as our respondents indicated.</p>
<p>In the following section we present the central concepts regarding the integration of adaptation and mitigation in spatial planning and the main tools useful for analyzing it. We then describe the main parameters of the Swedish national context in which planners must situate themselves, find direction, and comply with political and governance processes. Shifting next to the local perspective, we discuss the efforts by municipal planners to develop appropriate responses to climate change. Finally, we reflect on observations regarding the difficulties posed by some of the more intensive response processes that planners find themselves engaged in. Attention is paid to the emergence of success factors that contribute to strong municipal adaptation and mitigation practices.</p>

<title>Integrating Adaptation and Mitigation in Spatial Planning</title>
<p>It is possible, arguably, to continue to work from perspectives that primarily focus on either adaptation or mitigation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0739456X12463943">1</xref></sup> but current research on climate change response processes shows that there is much to be gained by being aware of how the two approaches impinge on each other. The growing awareness that both mitigation and adaptation have to be considered in climate change response also calls for ways to deal with them without creating conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12463943">Biesbroek, Swart, and Van der Knaap 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739456X12463943">Tol (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739456X12463943">Swart and Raes (2007)</xref> explain, the choice of either focus, or their combination, is often related to the spatial and temporal scales concerned, while a number of other writers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739456X12463943">Wilson 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739456X12463943">Hamin and Gurran 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X12463943">Laukkonen et al. 2009</xref>) emphasize the importance of the level—of organization, of government and of governance—at which the response is being considered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739456X12463943">Howard (2009)</xref> states that as planning communities are moving their attention from mitigation to adaptation, it is fundamentally important that they also push harder than ever for changes in land use, transportation systems, energy systems, water systems, and built environment that have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As that move proceeds, the possibility of a relation between mitigation and adaptation itself demands careful consideration. As planners increasingly consider both mitigation and adaptation practices, it is crucial that their strategies avoid counteracting each other, and instead arrive at synergies.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12463943">Biesbroek, Swart, and Van der Knaap (2009)</xref> advance this line of thought by proposing the <italic>adaptation–mitigation dichotomy</italic>. The dichotomy is historically created, since mitigation and adaptation have been framed by scientists and policy makers as two different approaches. The adaptation–mitigation dichotomy consists of at least three factors; these are (1) differences in time, (2) spatial scale, and (3) the stakeholders. These three factors are structured around work done by others, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X12463943">Goklany (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739456X12463943">Klein et al. (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739456X12463943">Schipper (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739456X12463943">Schreurs and Tiberghien (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739456X12463943">Folke et al. (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739456X12463943">Swart and Raes (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739456X12463943">Swart, Robinson, and Cohen (2003)</xref>. The three factors, we argue below, are useful not only for gaining knowledge about, and analyzing the integration of, adaptation and mitigation but also for the inclusion of climate change response versus other, often short-term, dimensions that are also important for local spatial development.</p>
<p>The first factor, <italic>differences in time</italic>, relates to the notion that, in general, adaptive measures are short-term investments with short-term solutions to the impact of climate change, while mitigation strategies are short-term investments for long-term climate results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12463943">Biesbroek, Swart, and Van der Knaap 2009</xref>). This notion is seen in light of the argument by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X12463943">Goklany (2007)</xref>, among others, that this thinking is dualistic, and can thereby hinder further integration of adaptation and mitigation. While it is often the case that actions related to mitigation and adaptation have different time perspectives, focusing on dualistic thinking reduces the potential for innovation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0739456X12463943">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second factor is the <italic>spatial scale</italic>. The notion here is that adaptation measures are often local, while mitigation measures are predominantly global, in the sense that decisions, even at the local level, often derive from national and international policy agreements. In other words, the benefits of mitigation are global, but the costs often occur at the more local level. For adaptation, on the other hand, costs, as well as benefits, are local (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12463943">Biesbroek, Swart, and Van der Knaap 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739456X12463943">Klein et al. 2007</xref>). For mitigation activities to be considered successful, a specific locality is dependent on an outcome in all other localities globally. An adaptive measure, on the other hand, since it most likely has a direct impact at the local level, is not particularly dependent on the contributions of other localities in other countries. We must add a qualification, however, that climate change mitigation, in the long term, has the potential to reduce the need to adapt. In that sense, reduction in the local level’s need to adapt is dependent on the willingness that other localities (around the world) have to work with climate change mitigation.</p>
<p>The third factor is that of the <italic>stakeholders</italic> involved in adaptation and mitigation. When abrupt changes and threats such as those resulting from climate change occur, social networks tend to mobilize and demand involvement in policy making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12463943">Biesbroek, Swart, and Van der Knaap 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739456X12463943">Folke et al. 2005</xref>). As has been stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Due to the growing awareness of the cause and impacts of climate change, there is an increasing amount of public and private organisations that participate in the design and implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies, adding climate change as a new dimension for investment decisions. Although both mitigation and adaptation requires efforts of whole society, mitigative measures can take place varying from the individual to the international level, whilst adaptation is predominantly the responsibility of interest groups, local or regional governments. This requires a different type of approach to raise awareness of the urgency of the problem and inform about the possibilities to act [<italic>sic</italic>]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12463943">Biesbroek, Swart, and Van der Knaap 2009</xref>, 233)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What then, can spatial planning contribute? Planning, among its many tasks, coordinates local preferences, contexts, and stakeholder initiatives with sectoral policy objectives, from local to (inter)national levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12463943">Biesbroek, Swart, and Van der Knaap 2009</xref>). One should remember, however, that given the complexity, uncertainty, and scale of the climate change issue, planning might play an important role, but at the same time has little to offer in terms of pragmatic solutions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X12463943">Bulkeley (2006)</xref>, there are several areas in which planning can make a difference, such as housing, transport, flooding, and renewable energy. Local and regional bodies work with climate change response, but often still at a rhetorical level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X12463943">Bulkeley (2006)</xref> states that the planning profession needs to confront three challenging requirements. The first is that decision making needs to be oriented toward the long term, but implemented immediately. Second, new and more robust language that can advance climate change response to the top of the agenda needs to be created. Third, there needs to be a means to deal with a collective problem, but in specific places. Special attention is also required:
<disp-quote>
<p>At a time when scholars properly criticize planning’s fixation on mitigation to the near exclusion of adaptation, it is striking that planners, to a considerable extent, now seem to be trying to merely turn more attention to adaptation and proceeding as if tensions and complementarities between the two activities have little bearing on how to design effective strategies for either. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739456X12463943">Howard 2009</xref>, 21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739456X12463943">Howard (2009)</xref> contends that the accelerating pace of climate change emphasizes the need that planners have to couple adaptation and mitigation; there is, in other words, a need to operate “in the ‘sweet spot’ and avoid adaptation that undermines mitigation” (ibid., 25). An example of this is when, as an adaptive measure against heat waves, an air conditioning system is expanded and upgraded, but is then powered by conventional electricity from fossil fuels, which in turn contravenes mitigation efforts.</p>

<title>Challenges to Swedish Climate Change Response—Setting the Scene</title>
<p>The main responsibility for spatial planning in Sweden is borne by each of its 290 municipalities, through the production of their own Comprehensive and Detail Plans. In addition, some of the larger regions, for instance, those of Stockholm and Gothenburg, develop Regional Spatial Plans. Those latter plans, however, are not, legally binding upon any eventual municipal planning.</p>
<p>The regional level in Sweden is twofold. First, there are County Councils, which are elected by the citizens of a county. County Councils are responsible for health care and other regional public services, as well as an optional Regional Spatial Plan. Second, the regional level also consists of County Administrative Boards (CABs), which represent the national government at the regional level. These are only administrative units and not directly elected by citizens. CABs are responsible for implementing national programs at the regional level. Their main tools for influencing municipalities are through financial, and other, support and guidance. The CABs develop Regional Development Plans, often integrated with the Regional Spatial Plans, when those are forthcoming. Local plans are always handed over to the CABs for hearings. There are only a few issues in which CABs can stop municipal plans: intermunicipal interests, national interests, and environmental quality norms, risk, and security. At the national level, government offices are supported by sector agencies, such as the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning (Boverket) and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (Naturvårdsverket). These agencies often act through CABs.</p>
<p>In the Swedish system, it is at local and regional levels that an opportunity for integrating adaptation and mitigation and prioritizing climate change response is most obvious. But the way in which this occurs in interplay with other levels, for example, when local and regional climate change response must be aligned with national policies, is also of importance. The overarching context that planners at local and regional levels work in is created by the ever-fluctuating climate change response activities at the national level.</p>
<p>In general, each of the Nordic countries has incorporated the climate change challenge into its panoply of concerns. This is reflected in a variety of ways in their planning practices, from country to country. Sweden, the largest of the Nordics, experienced its first wave of climate change response with the shift to the implementation of Agenda 21, in 1996. That shift was followed, beginning in 1998, by two national government grant schemes, the Local Investment Program (LIP) and, a few years later, the Local Climate Investment Program (KLIMP). Both programs were designed to stimulate and support municipalities in their environmental work. The LIP was a broad environmental subsidy, while KLIMP had a more focused aim in climate change mitigation measures. A major emphasis was on developing comprehensive energy plans at the municipal level. This has involved wide-scale conversion to renewable energy, especially with regard to efficient district heating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739456X12463943">Fudge and Rowe 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739456X12463943">Feichtinger and Pregernig 2005</xref>). These emphases have in turn been influential in spatial planning processes in many localities. One of the most common outcomes is that many municipalities have found it convenient to rename their energy system conversion efforts as climate change measures, which has often also resulted in a subsequent lack of initiative in designing new climate change responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739456X12463943">Langlais et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739456X12463943">Langlais 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Both LIP and KLIMP played an important part in the implementation of mitigation-dominated climate change policies that Sweden focused on for approximately a decade, until 2006, when public and official awareness of climate change entered a new phase. Since then, there has been a marked increase in the awareness of the need for adaptation, not just with regard to energy-related questions but across most, if not all, sectors. The national government attempted to construct and consult a broad forum of interests through the formation of four major initiatives, which in turn provide the backdrop for Swedish climate change response planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739456X12463943">Sweden 2009a</xref>), including:</p>
<list id="list1-0739456X12463943" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>a Commission for Sustainable Development, made up of a broad consortium of leaders in academia, government, industry, nongovernmental organizations, and politics. Its mandate is to focus on climate change issues as a part of sustainable development, by promoting cross-sector collaboration, providing a basis for an international perspective, and taking into account ecological, social, and economic aspects of sustainable development;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a Scientific Council on Climate Issues, consisting of leading Swedish climate scientists and other academics, which delivered a report on the scientific basis for climate change issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739456X12463943">Scientific Council on Climate Issues 2007</xref>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a parliamentary Climate Committee, whose remit was to formulate climate policy recommendations for the short, medium, and long term; an action plan for meeting the 2020 emission goal; and action in international climate negotiations. It substantially based its work on the report of the Scientific Council on Climate Issues; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a Commission on Climate and Vulnerability, which was established specifically for undertaking an extensive and comprehensive national enquiry into the situation with regard to adaptation to climate change. Its final report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0739456X12463943">Sweden 2007</xref>) was a dramatic step in bringing the awareness of adaptation onto the public agenda, and is a major component underlying the government’s and the parliament’s work on a Climate Proposition.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>After an intricate process of consultation and cross-referencing among the four main bodies described above, as well as with several other more specifically focused enquiries, their collective work was synthesized into a major “Climate Proposition,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0739456X12463943">3</xref></sup> which was intended to provide a state-of-the-art basis for jurisdiction and policy on climate change in all areas and across all levels of the Swedish governance system.</p>
<p>The Climate Proposition in itself does not include any direct changes in the law, but highlights the need for further investigation and changes to specific laws, such as the Planning and Building Law. Furthermore, the Climate Proposition highlights both adaptation and mitigation, but does not explicitly relate to finding synergies and avoiding conflicts. With regard to mitigation, the Proposition stresses that CABs should take more responsibility for intermunicipal planning issues, and that changes in the Planning and Building Law are necessary to ensure that municipal spatial planning incorporates an active mitigation perspective. Regarding climate change adaptation, the Proposition stresses the need to make necessary changes in the Planning and Building Law, as well as the need to better coordinate adaptation measures at both the national and regional levels. It also stipulates that CABs should be central actors at the regional level.</p>
<p>As part of the work that was done in preparation for the Climate Proposition, in 2008, the Swedish government had given all CABs the task of coordinating climate change mitigation at the regional level. After the passing of the 2009 bill, CABs were directed to coordinate adaptation at the regional level. That coordination mainly relates to providing municipalities with guidelines and recommendations through existing and new networks in the regions. To facilitate that work, regional climate change adaptation strategies are being developed, as well as energy and climate strategies (mitigation). The integration of adaptation and mitigation are absent from the list of CAB responsibilities.</p>
<p>One of the agencies that had been tasked with producing a report for the original Climate Proposition was Boverket, the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning. Even though its report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X12463943">Boverket 2009</xref>) goes further than the more general indications in all later versions of the Climate Proposition, it still provides little, if any, practical guidance for municipal planners. The Boverket report is relevant because it remains the definitive statement by the national-level agency that has the broadest overview and the greatest interaction with municipal planners. The report contains interesting admonishments that provide clues to the problems involved when considering how adaptation and mitigation may eventually be handled. For instance, the necessity for new ways of collaboration and cooperation is presented as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Climate change clearly brings to the fore the need for increased national and regional responsibility for the planning system. The complex planning questions that are connected to climate change demand a clear division of responsibility between the national and regional, as well as the local, where the nation takes a greater role in the planning system. The questions involved can simply not be solved in a comprehensive way within the municipality itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0739456X12463943">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X12463943">Boverket 2009</xref>, 71; authors’ translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That statement is provocative because it contrasts with the present situation, in which final responsibility for planning decisions still rests with the municipality. There have been a number of situations in the past few years actualizing the need for the kind of change that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X12463943">Boverket (2009)</xref> calls for, and that many would consider radical. Municipalities have, in some cases, proceeded with decisions even when they knew that they were doing so in direct contradiction of a national guideline on climate change response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739456X12463943">Langlais 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As the national “tone-setter” for how planners should consider their roles in municipal planning, it is significant that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X12463943">Boverket (2009)</xref> repeatedly emphasizes that both adaptation and mitigation are important but at the same time limits itself in supplying the prescription that the two “must” be considered “hand-in-hand” (e.g., p. 8). It stops short of specifying <italic>integration</italic>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X12463943">Boverket (2009)</xref> raises the issue, among many that it finds relevant in the first Climate Proposition, of how the production of Detail and Comprehensive Plans that municipalities are responsible for can also affect the overall national climate change response. It cites how adaptation needs to be integrated into the elaboration of Detail Plans and that there needs to be appropriate coordination between the processes producing Detail Plans and Comprehensive Plans. While Detail Plans have the power to affect the use of land and water, through specification of the structure of social services, and to affect the way in which renewable energy is produced, Comprehensive Plans influence the placement of actual buildings and infrastructure. It is important to take into account the ensuing changes in transportation and energy use that will result from new developments. As a consequence of those considerations, the report in turn proposes, at least with regard to vulnerabilities and risks, that the law should be changed so that municipalities will have to respond to national authorities’ demands for the implementation of appropriate response measures. This can be enhanced by improving collaboration between municipalities, since the ability to coordinate the complexity of such decision making needs more inputs than any one municipality alone can sustain. An example of one of the two forms of such collaboration that it selects is the Climate Municipalities Network.</p>
<p>After two more years of intense debate, a new Planning and Building Law was passed on May 2, 2011. That law states that climate change should be considered in municipal planning, through both adaptation and mitigation measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0739456X12463943">Sweden 2010</xref>). This strengthens the mandate of municipalities when they desire to integrate climate change issues in their Detail and Comprehensive Plans, and also strengthens their stance in dealing with developers.</p>
<p>The above-described national processes provide the broad context and contours in which planners confronting the mandate and directive to work with climate change response must operate. Although a major shift in climate change awareness and policy has occurred, where both mitigation and adaptation are now approaching equal standing nationally, regionally, and locally, planners still must face the challenge of integrating mitigation and adaptation with little assistance from regional and national authorities. Their work is often conducted in remote locations, with little resources and unclear political mandates. Furthermore, we have not been able to find that Boverket has provided any further, substantial guidance on how municipalities are supposed to concretely integrate climate change with other, often more short-term, dimensions of spatial development, let alone mitigation and adaptation approaches in spatial planning.</p>

<title>Research Methods</title>
<p>The national-level context framing the jurisdictional conditions for municipal planning activities is the backdrop for our studies of the challenges that municipalities face in integrating climate change response with their normal spatial planning processes. The studies entailed a series of surveys, conducted in 2007, 2008, and 2009. This paper draws primarily from the third survey.</p>
<p>In 2007 and 2008, we performed telephone surveys of Sweden’s 290 municipalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739456X12463943">Langlais et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739456X12463943">Dymén, Langlais, and Andersson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739456X12463943">Dymén, Francke, and Langlais 2009</xref>). More than 2000 conversations were conducted and, by virtue of sheer persistence, the response rate was 100% in both years. Our primary interest was to develop an initial, impressionistic insight into the character and prevalence of climate change responses at the municipal level, across the entire country. These surveys showed that mitigation action still dominates in planning practice but that adaptation issues are slowly entering into the municipalities’ panoply of concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0739456X12463943">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>To assess whether or not the integration of climate change has become a challenge in Swedish municipalities’ spatial planning activities, we used the results from the 2007 and 2008 surveys as the basis for the performance of a third survey, in 2009, which is presented and analyzed in the coming sections.</p>
<p>The 2009 edition was a highly reduced survey, since we chose to focus only on the most active category of municipalities. One researcher contacted planners from the municipalities of Borlänge, Boxholm, Grästorp, Helsingborg, Jönköping, Kiruna, Kristianstad, Lerum, Lidköping, Lund, Mölndal, Nacka, Olofström, Stockholm, Säffle, Söderhamn, Uddevalla, Växjö, and Älvdalen (a total of nineteen municipalities). The following question was sent by e-mail to the officer responsible for spatial planning in each municipality (in the case of Nacka, the interview was carried out by telephone, and for Stockholm the interview was done by both e-mail and telephone):</p>
<list id="list2-0739456X12463943" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>What challenges, problems and obstacles do planners in your municipality meet when incorporating climate change response in spatial planning? (Please relate your answers to both adaptation and mitigation.)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The question is rather open and allows the actors themselves to identify and define the main challenges related to climate change. Answers were received from the following municipalities: Stockholm, Lund, Borlänge, Boxholm, Kiruna, Kristianstad, Nacka, Olofström, Söderhamn, Uddevalla, Växjö, and Jönköping (a total of twelve responses).</p>
<p>To complement the answers from these Swedish municipalities, the same researcher also e-mailed the research question to all CABs (twenty-one in total) in Sweden. Since they always have the opportunity to comment and react upon a municipal plan (Detail Plan as well as Comprehensive Plan) before it is approved by municipal councils, they usually have a good overview of the challenges that municipalities are facing. Responses were received from the following counties: Stockholm County, Dalarna County, Gotland County, Gävleborg County, Jönköping County, Kronoberg County, Skåne County, Västerbotten County, Västernorrland County, Örebro County, and Östergötland County (eleven in total). From all municipalities and CABs, except Stockholm and Nacka municipalities, one answer was received. However, the answers are based on efforts from several planners in the municipality, or at the CABs. The answer from Nacka municipality is only based on a telephone survey, and the answer from Stockholm municipality is based on a written e-mail reply and one telephone interview.</p>
<p>The analysis of the third survey is based on a qualitative meaning condensation method (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739456X12463943">Kvale and Brinkmann 2009</xref>). This implies that the researcher, who also did the data collection, interprets and sorts the material received from the respondents into different subject areas or topics. While analyzing the material, the researcher clusters the answers into a number of categories with different meanings. Each category is presented below under a separate heading. The categorization does not necessarily have a quantitative dimension, in the sense that only those categories that contain material addressed by several respondents are presented. Below, however, it is explicitly stated whether the meaning of a category is addressed by many of the respondents.</p>

<title>Planners on Stage: Municipal Challenges in Responding to Climate Change</title>
<sec id="section6-0739456X12463943">
<title>The Journey from Comprehensive to Detailed Level Is a Challenge</title>
<p>Five-out-of-twelve municipalities highlight the challenge of dealing with climate change issues at a detailed level. The municipal Comprehensive Plan does not have legal standing; it is therefore easier for decision makers to agree on than the Detail Plan, since the latter is legally binding for planned construction and development. Our interviews signal that the general challenge for planners and decision makers is not to map risks on the comprehensive level but rather to counteract the strong economic aspects on the detailed level. Politicians become more reluctant to make “unpleasant” decisions in the municipal council. One of our respondents argues that “when the Comprehensive Plan is developed, stakeholders and politicians usually agree. It is when action is to be realized that discussions occur. One example is the issue of district heating, and that it is too expensive.”</p>
<p>Another respondent highlights that “it is easy to describe intentions in a comprehensive plan, which only serves as guidance. However, it is much more difficult to take decisions at the detailed level. This is where real conflicts of interest occur. In the municipality of Uddevalla, for instance, one conflict of interest is, on the one hand, the need to increase the density of central parts of the city and, on the other, the challenges that this causes for the risk of flooding.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0739456X12463943">
<title>Conflicts of Interest</title>
<p>One of the most common challenges for municipalities is to find and balance desirable solutions, not only from a societal perspective but also for stakeholders, in light of different interests. Conflicts can arise not only between adaptation and mitigation policies but also between calls for climate change response and other social and economic dimensions of spatial development. Five of twelve municipalities specifically highlight different conflicts of interest. A few of the challenges reported by municipal planners are as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-0739456X12463943" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>conflict between urban densification and the handling of storm drainage;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>conflict between urban densification and proneness to drought;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>conflict between the political desire for an acceptance of urban sprawl and the resultant reluctance to satisfy the increase in the need for automobile use;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>that a municipal organization and its politicians can have incommensurable interests and goals, so that tension arises;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>conflict between planning and building for urban densification and the retention of certain urban environmental qualities adopted by the central government. There can be competition between municipalities when it comes to planning for urban density. In project competitions, a municipality that acts in a “climate-friendly” way can lose to a neighboring municipality that may not be as strict and consistent about the values intrinsic to the dense city concept;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>municipalities that act in a “climate-friendly” way, for instance, by promoting and encouraging denser urban development, may lose projects and inhabitants to neighboring municipalities that are not as strict regarding the development of a resource- and energy-efficient city;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>that the environmental quality norms (Miljökvalitetsnormer) cannot be exceeded. While following the norms is desirable, this can conflict with urban densification. As a result of global warming, the dense city has to find innovative strategies for handling unbearably warm urban environments and flood emergencies;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>that responding to climate change has to avoid conflict with the notion that all parts of a city should be dynamic and livable. How should less dense suburban areas be dealt with? Should they become denser, or should other attractive qualities be maintained?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If development occurs in so-called risk areas, areas that are, for instance, highly prone to flooding, who shall then pay for safety measures in, say, 20 to 50 years?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although the above issues were highlighted by the municipalities in the study, they have also been strongly emphasized by CABs (seven of eleven CABs reported conflicts of interest); the latter are familiar with the challenges that municipalities face. Local politicians, for instance, often want to offer attractive waterfront living conditions. This is a major challenge in relation to climate change adaptation. In general, municipalities have to make compromises, and it is not unusual that economic interests are valued higher than issues of sustainability. For planners that prepare Detail Plans, it can be a challenge to incorporate environmental and climate change aspects, since municipal decisions are often based on short-term economic interests. Also, private developers are not always interested in climate change considerations, since these do not, in the short term, generate profits. Municipalities also face several other conflicts of interest, according to the CABs. These are exemplified below:</p>
<list id="list4-0739456X12463943" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>urban densification generates less car use, but also results in smaller and fewer green areas, which is less desirable from a public health perspective;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the regional spatial plan for Stockholm states that densification should occur with reference to railway stations, which is both good, from an environmental perspective, since car use is reduced, and bad, since it reduces the diversity of housing options;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>often, a community’s political will is that all areas of the municipality should be inhabited. If followed, one consequence might be urban sprawl, creating difficulties for the creation of public utilities, such as district heating;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>an additional fundamental challenge is that politicians, planners, and scientists do not always agree on what a “climate-friendly city” looks like.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The last statement creates a suitable bridge to the next section, which describes the challenge of reconciling the question of what a “climate-friendly city” with low emissions of greenhouse gases should look like with the fact that the magnitude of climate change and its impacts for the locality are largely unknown. How much should a municipality adapt?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0739456X12463943">
<title>What Are the Effects of Climate Change?</title>
<p>An overarching challenge, especially related to emphasizing the priority of climate change adaptation over, for instance, economic development, is that there is a general insecurity as to how large the impacts of climate change will be, and how these effects will influence a locality (emphasized by four CABs and two municipalities). Examples relate to insecurity regarding sea-level rise and therefore insecurity in how to plan waterfront development.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one CAB raises the question of how those municipalities that attract large numbers of tourists during wintertime (this is the case for many municipalities in the mountainous areas of Sweden), often related to winter sports, should proceed with their planning. Incorporating a climate change dimension in planning is not only about dealing with conflicts of interest but also about managing uncertainty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0739456X12463943">
<title>The Municipalities Cannot Do It Alone</title>
<p>Even though municipalities in Sweden are responsible for climate change response in spatial planning, three municipalities raised the urgent need for cooperation across municipal boundaries and within regions. Examples of issues that need cooperation between municipalities are the establishment of external shopping centers as well as public transport. Even if the municipality has a strong climate change response agenda, it is dependent on other municipalities and on the region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0739456X12463943">6</xref></sup> It is, for instance, difficult for municipalities to influence the establishment of public transport in more peripheral areas, since “the demand” is smaller and the regional council is responsible for public transport. One respondent expressed that “even if the municipality manages to decrease car use, we cannot control whether trips by car increase on national roads that pass through the municipality.” National roads are, of course, the responsibility of the national government.</p>
<p>Furthermore, four of the CABs reported a need for clearer national guidelines and legislation. One central problem is that regulations and legislation are too weak, especially in relation to climate change mitigation. One CAB argued that “regulations regarding planning for public transport and urban development are too weak. If the central government can invest 20 Billion SEK in the development and construction of a remote railway, the Botniabana, then there should be stronger demands for locating urban development actually in areas where public transport is well developed.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0739456X12463943">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, one CAB and one municipality argued that national authorities are not always open to discussing the consequences of different guidelines, and it is also often the case that different national authorities have different perspectives that are not always commensurable. This might also be reflected in the fact that municipalities lack good and reliable data on different aspects of climate change, as well as good examples of how climate change can concretely be incorporated in planning practice (reported by three CABs and two municipalities).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0739456X12463943" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>From our survey of municipalities and CABs, a main conclusion is that municipalities are left to themselves to integrate climate change in planning practice when other often more short-term economic and social aspects gain force on the agenda. Municipalities also face challenges when not only mitigation but also adaptation has to be considered. An indication that adaptation is only slowly entering the array of municipalities’ concerns is that good examples, best practice, and data, such as maps showing flood-prone areas, are lacking.</p>
<p>The most striking observations from our interviews, regarding the integration of mitigation and adaptation, relate to the following concerns. Several planners (three CABs and three municipalities) raised the point that the dense city is ideal for mitigation, at the same time as other values may, as a result, be weakened. In two of their examples, they described how dense city structures make it more difficult to prepare for and handle emergencies related to climate change. For example, a small area with a high concentration of citizens creates difficulties in flooding situations.</p>
<p>It appears from research presented in this paper, and from previous research, that Swedish municipalities are still much preoccupied with mitigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739456X12463943">Langlais et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739456X12463943">Dymén, Langlais, and Andersson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739456X12463943">Dymén, Francke, and Langlais 2009</xref>) and that, in most cases, the outcomes related to the integration of adaptation and mitigation measures have not yet been realized. The challenges associated with that ambition and in reconciling it with the requirements of other social and economic dimensions of spatial development are highly visible.</p>
<sec id="section11-0739456X12463943">
<title>Reflections on the Adaptation–Mitigation Dichotomy</title>
<p>What emerged from our survey is intriguing. In the analysis, it became evident that many of the problems encountered by municipalities in responding to climate change can be related to the so-called adaptation–mitigation dichotomy. Even if the main challenges identified in our survey are not only related to the integration of mitigation and adaptation, the three factors as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12463943">Biesbroek, Swart, and Van der Knaap (2009)</xref> are relevant when considering the integration of climate change response and other social and economic dimensions of spatial development. Many municipal planners (reported by five municipalities and seven CABs) emphasize that in their everyday work they experience conflicts between different municipal interests. What is important to highlight is that our interpretation of the adaptation–mitigation dichotomy corresponds with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12463943">Biesbroek, Swart, and Van der Knaap’s (2009)</xref> understanding, namely, that focusing too much on the dichotomy reduces the possibilities for finding synergies in spatial planning practice. It is often the case that adaptation and mitigation efforts are not separated in dichotomies, but rather situated on a continuous scale, from the municipal level to national level, from short-term to long-term, and from local stakeholders to global stakeholders. For the sake of illustration, climate change adaptation related to flood control is not always only a municipal interest, since actions that deal with flooding might incorporate, for example, the water catchment area of an entire lake, which can overlap and require the involvement of several counties. In our research, however, we have found it useful to reflect on the adaptation–mitigation dichotomy as a tool for gaining knowledge about the challenges that planners face in integrating climate change response and other social and economic dimensions of spatial planning.</p>
<p>Regarding the first factor, <italic>differences in time</italic>, it is clear from our results that interests that are of more short-term character tend to take over. Short-term economic development is such an example. When considering the example of waterfront housing, we reach the conclusion that a short-term economic profit often gains sway over the risks related to sea-level rise, even though climate threats are not that far off in the future. A factor of success could be stronger involvement on the part of the regional and national levels. The national rules and regulations would need to be clearer, and regional and national levels could contribute to minimizing unsustainable competition between municipalities. As one of our respondents reported, a more climate-friendly municipality can lose businesses and citizens to a neighboring municipality that does not incorporate a sustainability approach. Furthermore, many of our municipal and regional respondents (as reported by six CABs and five municipalities) supported the claim that there is a need for stronger regional and national-level engagement, as well as more outcomes from the type of stakeholder activities that we ourselves are engaged in.</p>
<p>At a workshop that we held in June 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0739456X12463943">Tepecik Dis, Dymén, and Lange 2011</xref>), planning practitioners from every corner of the Nordic countries enthusiastically participated in identifying challenges and needs in municipal climate change response. Our preliminary observations from that seminar are that municipal planners are urging regional and national decision makers to take greater responsibility in coordinating climate change response. The workshop participants highlighted, moreover, that short-term political interests—the result of a situation where political responsibility lasts only until the next election—need to be challenged in order to sustain ongoing discussions within political bodies. This stems from the strong feeling that discussions of environmental issues should retain their vitality and not be hostage to short-term political mandates. A conclusion, then, is that if regional and national levels would assume more long-term responsibility in coordinating efforts at the local level, unsustainable competition between municipalities could be minimized.</p>
<p>Relating our results to other Swedish examples in which integration of climate change response and other dimensions of spatial development are crucial, the development of the Eco City Augustenborg housing area, in Malmö, is interesting. In that locality, spatial development has found synergies between climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as in other economic and social dimensions of spatial development. Eco City Augustenborg is one of Sweden’s largest urban sustainability projects. The housing company, MKB, began the construction of the area in 1948. The underpinning idea for the area, at that time, was that it should consist not only of apartments, but also schools, shops, employment opportunities, and community centers. In recent years, Augustenborg has been subject to major regeneration, including its branding as Eco City. The aspects that have been dealt with include, among others, local handling of storm water, green roofing, green outdoor environments with local employment opportunities, local waste recycling, a safer traffic environment, and electric tram service.</p>
<p>What makes Augustenborg especially interesting is that synergies between the more long-term goals of climate change response and the short-term goals of local economic development are being created. Many of the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as waste recycling, resource-saving, and transport solutions that emit less greenhouse gases, have also incorporated a short-term economic aspect, in the sense that employment opportunities have been created.</p>
<p>Regarding the second and third factors, those of <italic>involved stakeholders</italic> and the <italic>administrative level</italic>, our results indicate that one of the most difficult challenges in municipal spatial planning is to reach decisions at a detailed and concrete level. Our results reveal that issues related to climate change mitigation need the involvement of regional and national levels, since decisions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are not solely local. Even if decisions are taken at national and international levels, through policy agreements, the challenges for municipalities arise at the detailed local level, implying that regional and national levels also have to interact with that level. According to regional and national regulations, municipalities are not necessarily forced to compete against each other when approached by the private sector. The involvement of regional and national levels has the potential of coordinating municipal adaptation and mitigation efforts in a synergetic way. The new Planning and Building Law from 2011, as well as CABs’ task of coordinating regional climate change adaptation and mitigation, is an example of such attempts, and may contribute toward better climate change response on the municipal level. This is a necessary target for future research.</p>

<title>Reflections from a Perspective of a Local Spatial Planning</title>
<p>It would be interesting to know more about the processes leading to the final decisions and the resolution of conflicts of interest that occurred in the municipalities we have studied. What were the decisions based on, and how were the processes pursued? Is it possible to reach a decision that is scientifically sound, meaning that planners, through a rational planning approach, <italic>calculate</italic> the best solution to a problem (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739456X12463943">Strömgren 2007</xref>)? Or is it more sustainable for municipalities, and more desirable for stakeholders, to adopt an approach that is more <italic>communicative</italic>, where politicians, planners, and stakeholders communicate and reach consensus? What we can argue, though, is that those municipalities that we have studied do incorporate strong forces that counteract a <italic>libertarian</italic> planning approach (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739456X12463943">Strömgren 2007</xref>), where decisions are taken ad hoc, based on market mechanisms and where an overall development path for the municipality has not been stated, nor at all discussed. That those municipalities are strong, and concrete, in responding to climate change, indicates that there is long-term thinking, even though short-term economic profit has, or may have, a strong stake in the situation.</p>
<p>In another study, “Engendering Climate Change: The Swedish Experience of a Global Citizen’s Consultation,” we develop and discuss a planning approach that contributes to the discussion of how planners, in their quest for achieving decisions that are sustainable for society and desirable for stakeholders, can act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739456X12463943">Dymén, Langlais, and Cars 2010</xref>). Such an approach acknowledges that the more rational approach, where sustainable solutions can be <italic>calculated</italic>, is needed. Notwithstanding that, there is still the need for a complementary, communicative, and participatory approach, where <italic>softer</italic> aspects are considered, that reflects society as being affected and formed by gender, social and economic factors, ethnicity, and so on.</p>
<p>Our intention for future research is to better understand how municipalities that are in the forefront of climate change response deal with the conflicting interests that we have identified in their spatial planning processes. In our interaction with municipalities in Sweden and elsewhere in Europe during the past six years, we have minted the use of the term <italic>adaptigation</italic> and found it to be helpful in our work. Its use signals to planners and decision makers that a different perspective is being discussed, a perspective that is not simply <italic>more of the same</italic>. It indicates and reminds that synergies are to be found in the integration of adaptation and mitigation responses. The interesting aspect in using the term <italic>adaptigation</italic> is its potential to indicate new understandings of how to respond to climate change. Such understandings emerge when the effort to think about adaptation and mitigation in an integrative manner is actually made. On completion of the study presented in this paper, we have concluded that such a term should be complemented by other terms that signal interaction between climate change response and other social and economic dimensions of spatial development. We believe we have worked in the spirit of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X12463943">Bulkeley (2006)</xref>, who originally flagged for the need to adopt new and more robust language.</p>
<p>As a concluding reflection, it is obvious in the Swedish case that municipalities are urging for the development of stronger and longer-term regional and national responsibility for dealing with conflicts of interest. This strengthens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X12463943">Bulkeley’s (2006)</xref> statement that decision making must become more long-term oriented and that the means of resolving local conflicts have to be developed. We find that stronger engagement by regional and national levels can contribute to the advancement of solutions for these issues. These results are supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X12463943">Boverket (2009)</xref>, a Swedish national agency, which specifically calls for a similar approach. Seen through the eyes of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12463943">Biesbroek, Swart, and Van der Knaap’s (2009)</xref> adaptation–mitigation dichotomy, it is obvious that municipalities cannot by themselves coordinate complex levels of interaction between stakeholders, administration, and time constraints. That municipalities in Sweden have the overall responsibility for spatial planning only accentuates their need for increased resources and support.</p>

<p>Adaptation is defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as “adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.” Mitigation is defined as “an anthropogenic intervention to reduce the anthropogenic forcing of the climate system; it includes strategies to reduce greenhouse gas sources and emissions and enhancing greenhouse gas sinks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739456X12463943">Klein et al. 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>What emerged as one of the most interesting impressions from the 2008 survey was that energy and emission issues, after years of obsession with mitigation, still remained highest on the agenda. When municipalities were asked to describe the character of their climate change response, only 13 of 290 municipalities responded that climate change adaptation is on their agenda. Although when asked directly about whether they foresaw any threat from climate change, the issues of flooding, heavy rains, tourism, and agriculture were often mentioned (in 173 out of 290 municipalities), and several municipalities mentioned that measures were undertaken to map threats posed by climate change, or that measures to adapt to climate change would be undertaken in the near future (in 102 of the municipalities). Compared to climate change mitigation, which had already emerged in the 1990s, adaptation issues, at the time of the 2008 survey, had just started to emerge as one of the municipalities’ concerns.</p>
<p>Moreover, what became obvious from those surveys was that one of the municipalities’ keys for success regarding mitigation was access to such economic incentives as KLIMP and LIP. In each case, the municipality’s choices managed to achieve greater acceptance among politicians. Competition for state subventions has preferred the more robust municipalities, with their well-developed capacity for developing successful proposals. Smaller municipalities consider themselves as underprivileged. 2008 was the last year for applying for KLIMP.</p>
