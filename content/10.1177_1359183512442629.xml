<abstract>
<p>Museums are sites where people encounter material objects. This article examines object and subject entanglements that take place at a university museum in northern Norway, and illustrates how objects shift identities as they interact with subjects and how subjects are also affected by the encounter. A relational materialities perspective, which demonstrates how object identity is related to the subject it engages with, allows multiple versions of objects to appear. Working as a certified expert in the university museum, the author aims to address the quandary over future museum collection policies. She argues that collection policies are not only about what to select but also who makes the selection decisions, and the perspectives associated with such choices. If museum collections are based on expert relationships to objects, the quality of the expert needs further investigation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 1905, the anthropologist Franz Boas left his job in the American Museum of Natural History after a disagreement with the museum president over the anthropological exhibits. Boas wanted to depart from the knowledge paradigm of the day that cultures evolved from primitive to more complex forms of life. He attempted, through putting objects on display, to demonstrate instead that each culture had its internal logic. The museum president, Morris K Jesup, was not pleased with the display. The two men disputed treating human cultures as part of the new anthropology or as part of the older natural history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359183512442629">Conn, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Boas–Jesup dispute sets the theme of this article: that museum collections represent expert relationships to things and, more theoretically speaking, experts and things as relational materialities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359183512442629">Damsholt and Gert Simonsen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359183512442629">Law, 1999</xref>). Boas and Jesup engaged with the same collection of objects, but saw different things. They differed in many respects: position, training and experience, amongst other things. These differences are of importance for how they perceived and reacted to the objects; their professional and positional differences influenced the narratives that the objects were allowed to present. Seen from a relational material point of view, another dimension can be explored. The objects engaged the men in different ways and suggested distinct and different stories. Thus, they or rather the entanglements between object and person opened up different versions of the ‘real’.</p>
<p>A hundred years later, the relationships between objects and experts are still key issues for museums; their storerooms are filled to the brim, but the objects’ roles in pedagogy and display have changed. Consequently, the collection of objects, once so essential to the object-based learning and epistemologies of knowledge production in museums, has declined significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359183512442629">Knell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359183512442629">Macdonald, 2006</xref>) and objects are utilized less and less in displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359183512442629">Conn, 2009</xref>). There are both epistemological and pragmatic reasons for this trend. On the pragmatic side, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359183512442629">Fyfe (2006)</xref>, one can point to the fact that, today, households dispose of more things in a week than most previous generations consumed in their lifetime. The overwhelming choice of objects makes it a genuine challenge for museums to decide what to add to their collections. To this representational issue, which is not just pragmatic, more epistemological aspects must be added. The trust in object-based learning has diminished and the educational role of objects is questioned. Complicating the issue even more, there is a political dimension to representation and heritage. Worldwide, museums possess large ethnographic collections over which there are ownership disputes both regarding property rights to objects as well as to the stories they may tell.</p>
<p>However, collecting is deemed essential to museum practices. The International Council of Museums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359183512442629">ICOM, 2007</xref>) declares in its statutes that museums are institutions that acquire and exhibit the heritage of humanity and its environment. Regarding the subject of acquisition, two white papers in Norway offer advice. One stresses the need for knowledge-based collection policies that are continuously evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359183512442629">St. meld. nr. 49, 2008–2009</xref>). The other, addressing university museums in particular, stresses the need for an increased consciousness of the histories that collecting practices reflect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359183512442629">St. meld. nr. 15, 2007–2008</xref>). These political reports are not easily transformed into practical museum work as they provide no guidance for practical engagement with objects. However, taking these reports at face value, I think both ‘knowledge-based policies’ and ‘increased consciousness’ can be achieved through seeing experts, things and collection policies as relational materialities. As I will show, this perspective allows for an increased understanding of what objects are and do in museums as well as for dealing with the consequences of such knowledge – providing more reflection on who should be responsible for museum objects.</p>
<p>In exploring object and expert relationships, I will look at specific examples at a university museum in northern Norway. Tromsø Museum was established in 1872 and became a university museum in 1976. Having worked as Associate Professor at the museum since 2004, with responsibility for collections and exhibitions in the Department of Cultural Sciences, I will pick three particular cases for discussion of expert relationships: (i) a group of planes (woodworking tools) that mainly entered the collection in the 1960s; (ii) some special curtains from the 1990s; and (iii) how the cod, a fish of prime importance to Norway, was exhibited in the early 2000s. I will analyse the significance of object–expert entanglements to the constitution of object identities and the experts involved. My main aim is to explore how a relational materiality perspective allows for multiple object versions to be seen, or rather seen as acting in society, and vice versa: how multiple versions of object are linked to multiple human identities. These perspectives do not make it easier to decide upon collection policies, but they aid in building a greater consciousness concerning the practices that such policies entail. I will end my analysis by commenting on how the quandary over future museum collection policies is not only about what to select, but is as much a question of who should be selecting and what perspectives are involved.</p>

<title>Relational materialities and ontological politics</title>
<p>The concept of ‘relational materiality’ originates in the literature on the sociology of science, where entities are seen as effects or outcomes of work performed in networks made up of human and non-human elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359183512442629">Callon, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359183512442629">Latour, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359183512442629">Law, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359183512442629">Law and Hassard, 1999</xref>). Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359183512442629">Law (1999</xref>: 3) introduced the notion of ‘relational materialities’ to focus on how entities and realities take form and acquire attributes as a result of relations with other entities. These classical actor–network–theory perspectives are not commonly applied to museum studies, but when they are they can form the basis of interesting museological studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359183512442629">Mordhorst (2009)</xref>, for instance, follows descriptions of museum objects over centuries and shows how objects are embedded in current practices, gaining identities from their multiple relationships. Changes in object descriptions stem from many small adjustments in practices vis-à-vis objects, rather than new paradigmatic shifts in scientific perspectives.</p>
<p>All the objects in Mordhorst’s study have provoked some entanglements with experts, whose lack of precise definitions, both synchronously and over time, is significant. Over the years, there have been many conflicts over what museums should collect and display, conflicts that include some disputes over the essence of objects. The Boas–Jesup argument has been mentioned; another much discussed case is the Enola Gay exhibition at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359183512442629">Conn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359183512442629">Crane, 2006</xref>). The exhibition never developed as the initiators anticipated because the parties involved could never agree on its main theme: honouring technological progress that ended a bloody conflict and saved millions of American lives; initiating the Cold War and atomic age of fear; or the destruction of innocent Japanese lives. These conflicts over which pasts should be mediated are important. Heritage production is politics, and museum experts are aware of this fact. Many have been wounded in ‘culture wars’ that started appearing in the middle of the last century. Anthropologists had followed in the footsteps of Boas and developed their discipline into a cultural anthropology focusing less on material objects and more on the immaterial aspects of culture. As they mediated their knowledge, the people who were the ‘objects’ of their study began to talk back and the resulting culture wars were conflicts over how to re-present culture and who had the right to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359183512442629">Dubin, 2006</xref>). With the constructivist focus in social science towards the end of the century, concerns were also raised over how language and interpretation by experts with varying political perspectives informed what was real (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359183512442629">Lidchi, 1997</xref>). Museum scholars followed suit with studies of how museums reflected politics through their collecting and display activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359183512442629">Macdonald, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359183512442629">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359183512442629">Macdonald and Fyfe, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>There is less awareness of ontological politics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359183512442629">Mol (1999)</xref> combines the term ‘ontology’ with that of ‘politics’ to suggest that the conditions of the real, the conditions of possibility that we live with, are not a given. According to Mol, ‘reality does not precede the mundane practices in which we interact with it, but is rather shaped within these practices’ (p. 77). She uses the word ‘politics’ to stress the active mode of the process of shaping. Different versions of an object may be enacted, and some realities may be strengthened while others are weakened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359183512442629">Law, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359183512442629">Mol and Law, 2002</xref>). What is important here is the subtlety of such politics. It is a type of knowledge politics performed by subjects in direct material engagement with things, but without clear political intent. The politics is situated in practices, procedures, and rules of engagement between entities. Furthermore, it is a politics that affects both objects and subjects. They are mutually constituted in the engagements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512442629">Barad (2007)</xref> prefers to speak of ‘intra-actions’ as opposed to interactions in order to stress this point of mutual constitution. The primary ontological unit is the phenomenon, she says, the property of the phenomenon being that of inseparability of object and measuring agencies.</p>
<p>Ontological politics is a problematic term. Ontology refers to the essence of things, but when combined with politics it begins to question essence. It reaches even deeper and questions the very foundation of museum collections – authenticity. It is important to talk of the subtle politics of making essence, primarily because the idea of essentialities still informs situations where real political choices are made. A common aspect of disputes over displays are disagreements over what <italic>is</italic> real instead of how the real is made and, as would be possible with a clearer understanding of ontological politics, <italic>should</italic> or could be made. By raising these questions, however, I do not mean to say that there is no such thing as essence. Rather, I want to argue that it is blurred by an insufficient understanding of its conditions. Even authenticity, that highly cherished property of museum objects, is a relational quality. It is often one or more experts’ relations to objects that define authenticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359183512442629">Knell, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Engaging with planes</title>
<p>Planes are wonderful tools: they can shape a rough piece of wood into a beautifully ornamented moulding; they enable boat builders to create the necessary curves of their non-linear projects; and they can create plain smooth surfaces. The cultural history collection of the museum includes nearly 6000 items, of which 146 are planes, reflecting an impressive range of woodworking tasks. When discussed in my department, however, the planes are often treated in a humorous manner. The talk is often followed by, if not laughter, at least a smile. They are obviously more than tools for shaping wood. To my colleagues, they matter in more respects. They are complex, composite objects that invite multiple performances from the subjects they meet. How can we understand this?</p>
<p>When the planes were collected they were not laughed at. Although established in 1872, the museum had no cultural history section until the 1930s, and it was over 30 years before the section obtained professional staff. The collection policy in the recently established department of the 1960s was aimed at representing the ‘northern way of life’, and the planes were collected during this period. They were cultural examples of how northern ancestors built their tools, and they held stories of their use. In the collections at the university museum they have many companions, other objects from the same culture and time. These include fishing gear, echo sounders and knives, but also ‘softer’ fishing equipment such as socks and woollen mittens. These items represent the northerners’ ‘fisher–farmer’ ancestors. The public narrative of the northern predecessors is that they lived a life where men went sea fishing, providing the household with an income while women performed household tasks on land, raising children and taking care of livestock. Men and women had separate tasks during the winter as fishers and farmers, respectively. In summer, they both became farmers. The collections contain, first and foremost, objects that people used in their everyday practices in order to make ends meet.</p>
<p>That we know this story so well is not primarily because of the museum objects. The fisher–farmer was also studied in academic texts of the time. A well-known source in Norway is Ottar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359183512442629">Brox’s (1966)</xref> writings on how northern practices were treated by the political authorities and bureaucratic administration, both situated in the south. Brox wrote of political and administrative neglect and misunderstanding of the customs and daily life of the north. He is often said to have given back a sense of meaning to the people of the north. They were not backward, they were rational beings carrying out the most practical activities of the moment, making a living out of fishing using small-scale technology. Brox explained that this was the most economically viable option. As fish were abundant in close proximity to people’s homes, there was no incentive, let alone sense, in exchanging this way of life for a career on board a trawler – which was what the planning authorities encouraged as desirable development. They stated that the north could never develop its full potential if it did not industrialize, switching to trawler fishing to supply a growing frozen fish industry.</p>
<p>Ottar Brox’s work had an impact on the identity of the north and provoked academic debate. There were supporters who continued his work, describing the logic of northern cultural practices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359183512442629">Hersoug et al., 1993</xref>). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, he was criticized by feminist academics. These scholars asserted that the focus on women’s work had been neglected to some degree in the historiography of this period and they attempted to correct this by producing texts on women’s work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359183512442629">Gerrard (1983)</xref>, for instance, emphasized the extensive work of women by writing of their many household responsibilities, including their essential roles in relation to men’s fishing activities. She labelled women the ‘ground crew’ in the fisheries, as they provided men with a substantial amount of the material requirements for fishing. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359183512442629">Larsen (1980)</xref> maintained that, as women were farming all year round whereas men only farmed in the summer, the term ‘fisher–farmer’ was misplaced, placing too much emphasis on the men’s work, while discrediting the women’s. She suggested the Norwegian concept of <italic>omsorgsbonden</italic>, which describes these aspects of the cultural pasts. The concept does not translate well into English, but ‘caring farmer’ comes close. By introducing the concept of care, Larsen intended to bring the roles of women more to the front.</p>
<p>Those who laugh at woodworking planes are aware of these former debates over their history. I should add here that Ottar Brox did not provide northerners with a fisher–farmer ancestry merely through his texts but also through objects. Brox worked at the museum for a few years in the 1960s and during this time materialized this perspective through the collection of tools and fishing gear used by fisher–farmers. And he did collect quite a few planes. There are many ‘male’ items, but the planes have a principal role, as there are so many of them, accounting for 146 objects in a collection of nearly 6000 items, and they are symbolic representatives of a history of the northern ancestors’ work. The women’s milking stools, for example, were never collected with the same intensity. When department staff moved the planes to new locations, before they had become the laughing stock of the collection, their strong presence in the collection became even more visible and some staff raised the question – do we really need all these planes? Would just a few be sufficient? However, the debate led to no positive action and the planes continued to hold their unambiguous legitimacy in the collection. But now they have gained additional attributes – they are a source of amusement just for their continuing presence in the museum collection.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359183512442629">Otto’s (2009)</xref> reading, I would suggest that this amusement contests the ways in which the planes work to describe cultural pasts. As memory is materially distributed, the creation of a new society can be hindered by the existence of an uncomfortable cultural heritage; it must be dealt with. Otto pinpoints three strategies for doing this: (i) there can be conflicts over what material memories to hold on to; (ii) there can be thoughtful repositioning so that material memories work therapeutically; and (iii) material objects can be used to ridicule the past. Discussing the latter strategy, Otto refers to Grutas Park in Lithuania where people can engage with material objects of the past in new ways; for instance, the monuments of former communist heroes have been taken off their pedestals and placed on the ground. People can now reach up to shake Lenin’s raised hand and a park restaurant serves ‘communist soup’. As Otto points out, this can be seen as a bizarre mix of Gulag and Disneyland, its founder Viliumas Malinauskas having been been criticized for ‘Disneyfying’ the serious history of the communist past. But as Otto contends, this invitation to materially engage with the past is welcomed by visitors, and the bodily actions of irony and ridicule are tools that remove the impediments that the serious communist past may put in the way of developing the future.</p>
<p>Finding amusement in woodworking planes can be regarded in the same way. Following Otto, we need to deal with problematic aspects of the past in order to build a better future. Ridicule and laughter are powerful tools for dealing with this unease, they are bodily responses. Inspired also by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359183512442629">Farquhar (2002)</xref>, who stresses that the body has a language and history and is responsive to specific built environments, engagement with the planes can be seen as two materialities ‘intra-acting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512442629">Barad, 2007</xref>) where the material and the social are entangled in ways that produce embarrassment and laughter as the human response. Laughing at the planes revokes their ability to tell stories of the forefathers who used them.</p>
<p>Planes are examples of relational materialities. They engage with subjects and become different phenomena in their various entanglements. To Brox, they were material representations of a fisher–farmer culture. They enact the same culture today, but their representational role provokes more reactions than were envisaged at the time of their collection. They now have multiple qualities and are engaging subjects in many ways. They matter. They allow for a multiplicity of subject identities to arise in relationships with them and are not mute objects that passively accept the description an expert might apply to them. When viewing the planes, individuals with knowledge in other fields may bestow other identities on them. Object and expert thus interact with each other.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359183512442629">Collins and Evans (2002)</xref>, we can sort the various subject–object relations between persons and planes along dimensions of expertise and experience. Collins and Evans discuss a normative theory of expertise, one that allows for widening the basis for technical decision-making beyond the core of scientific experts and at the same time proposes a solution to the problem of extension – that is, how far such wider participation should extend. They present a model that balances the input from both specialist and lay expertise, arguing that not all expert knowledge is relevant in decision-making, nor is all lay knowledge. They differentiate between certified and non-certified types of expertise, the latter also including lay expertise. Both are relevant, but what matters are real contributions to the issue at hand. The authors distinguish between scientists as a general group and scientists who work directly on the issue in question. They also make distinctions between members of the public, favouring those with experience-based contributions as more suitable for being part of the core group of people that make decisions.</p>
<p>Applying these concepts of expertise to the ‘plane entanglements’ discussed so far, we can think of all employees at the department with responsibilities for object collections as certified experts. They may be connoisseurs in particular fields, material or disciplinary, but they do have responsibilities for cultural heritage collections. Thus they are all certified experts. As such, they act according to museum procedures, museum rules of engagement with objects that inscribe them in a specific way. Concerning woodworking planes, they are enrolled as representatives of tools used by northerners.</p>
<p>My point now is not to deny them this identity. Entangled with certified experts, they are also representatives but, in fact, they are more than this. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359183512442629">Knell (2007</xref>: 12) maintains that museums’ practices of structurally organizing objects in hierarchies are necessary in order for ‘museums to act rationally in collecting, managing and exhibiting the world’. While this may be true, the point I want to make is that these rational acts are more than collecting, managing and exhibiting a world that lends itself to easy description. The rational acts are performing a version of the world. Describing the past through objects from a male fisher–farmer culture is also a performance of a particular world. It is a particular way of materializing culture and it is this that some experts in the department oppose. They are experts in that they have academic training and work at a department with responsibilities vis-à-vis cultural heritage. When coming into contact with the woodworking planes, however, they are assigned roles as non-certified experts, as their expertise concerning planes has no procedural way of entering the museum catalogue. Their enactments, meant to create a different past (one where women’s work mattered more, or where planes are questioned as cultural heritage for other reasons), must employ other means, including the ridiculing of present symbols of representation. The tools or ‘inscription devices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359183512442629">Latour and Woolgar, 1979</xref>) that the two expert groups have available are different. The certified experts have catalogues and registration procedures, which allow for only a few plane functions. The experts label the planes in order to identify what particular curve they can assist in making, and they are classified by material and size. The experts also have other means by which they treat objects as museum things. When handling the objects, white gloves are worn which, when seen as an enactment of essence, is a symbolic and powerful way of stating both the authenticity and value of real museum objects. It is an altogether different type of attitude than that shown by laughing museum staff. The entanglements between planes and experts reveal interesting performances of subject and object identities.</p>

<title>Entangling with curtains</title>
<p>In a remote island community of northern Norway, there is a collection of objects belonging to Tromsø University Museum. Visiting the collection in 1999, the current certified expert made inquiries into the fate of the objects held in an empty house on the island, abandoned since 1964, when the elderly man who lived there had died. He had lived alone since his wife had been moved to a nursing home six years earlier. The expert was interested in the textiles in the house, and his wish was granted. Among pillows, down quilts, carpets, shoes and much more, were the curtains. They had hung in a window of the house, a window that was found to be broken in 1999. This, said the expert, was probably the reason why the curtains were damaged as they had been exposed to the wind and weather for many years.</p>
<p>On arrival at the museum, the textiles were registered but not fully enrolled into the collections as they were not assigned museum accession numbers. They were repacked and stored, awaiting future action. Ten years later they were unpacked, at which point the museum was involved in recording the collections by photographing and transferring information about all objects to digital media. In this re-engagement with the curtains, the fact that they were torn became an issue. They were not a masterpiece of curtain-making and, as they were torn, there was the question of whether they should be thrown away. It is very rare for museum curators to discard museum objects but this was an option at this stage as the curtains had not been properly catalogued.</p>
<p>The fate of the curtains was discussed by two people with different expert statuses and responsibilities regarding the collection, one of whom was myself. I had certified expert status and my colleague was (and still is) a conservator who is very knowledgeable about the collections. Employed by the museum since 1990, he also had a wealth of experience of handling such items. Deciding the fate of the curtains, I leaned towards discarding them but my colleague was opposed to this solution and won his case. The curtains received their museum number and are now placed on museum shelf L-1-3, catalogued as museum item N-5829. The rationale for keeping them was that they still served an important role as a museum object. Despite being torn, one could still examine them for technical details. They were of a specific style, size and material, and could therefore reveal valuable information about curtain-making and curtain use in the past. Here is a key point: curtain ontology is defined in expert terms – discussed and defined. This rationale, however, is only one of many possible enactments of curtains. The upcoming digital presentation of the curtains will display them before a wider audience. In the following paragraphs, I will hypothesize situations where the dispute over whether they are trash may be evoked in various ways during the curtains’ life at the museum. I will show how various subjects relate to the curtains, and suggest subject and object identities that may arise in the ‘intra-actions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512442629">Barad 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512442629">Barad (2007)</xref>, who defines the property of the primary ontological unit, the phenomenon, as that of inseparability between object and measuring agencies, I will call this intra-action between object (curtain) and measuring agencies (certified museum experts) phenomenon number one. Working with the curtains in this way categorizes them as representatives of some clearly defined qualities that count as cultural heritage. They would be curtains of a household of 1964, fabric: cotton, size: 90 cm by 64 cm, colour: white.</p>
<p>There is, however, a phenomenon number two: the curtains do not conform to their new role and cannot be viewed merely in the context of technical details. They will engage with the audience they encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359183512442629">Dudley, 2010</xref>) and, as they are torn, there are several optional interpretations. Without knowing that it was the wind that had damaged them, the way is clear for them to be seen in many different lights. As curtains are the responsibility of women, our first thoughts could go to the woman in the household. The fabrics tell of her affluence and, considering their style, they tell of her taste. Now, if she was using torn curtains in her window, we could easily think she had neither money nor taste. What were simply torn curtains at the time the museum acquired them become something else. They change into curtains hanging in a poor woman’s window.</p>
<p>The envisaged intra-activity between curtain and woman here would have further repercussions for our own identities. If we were strangers to the culture, we might pity the poor people in the fishing village. If we were natives, we could be happy that things have changed and we are far richer now. We could also distance ourselves from the poverty, excluding this woman from our past by seeing her as someone else’s grandmother, not our own.</p>
<p>The curtains could also represent a third phenomenon. They could just be regarded as rags. We could think that there had been a different set of curtains hanging in the window, and the woman had saved these curtains as rags to use for weaving. Maybe the museum experts were wrong to label them as curtains – they were former curtains, now rags. This would be a quite different story, appreciating the woman’s household management and her knowledge of how to recycle resources. We would be pleased to identify with women with these qualities in the past. She could very well be my grandmother.</p>
<p>Thus, the curtains can represent many different phenomena, enacted in various relations to people of different expertise. As with the woodworking planes, there is a museum version that counts as more real than others, as it is this version that is labelled in the museum catalogue. Understanding object and measuring agencies as constituting ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512442629">Barad, 2007</xref>), we can say that the act of insisting on the museum rationale as true essence is an ontopolitical decision, where the certified expert is given sole authority. The curtain ontologies enacted by the non-certified expertise, my imagined audience, is ignored. One of the ranges of curtain hypotheses is silenced. And for every muted curtain hypothesis, there is an entangled human counterpart that is also silenced. One could argue that they all come to life in actual engagements and that the curtains therefore work well as museum objects, engaging a variety of emotions and experiences for the audience. The problem, however, is the lack of consciousness over the processes by which museum objects work, especially as the relational material approach teaches us how they are put to work in ontopolitical processes. The suggested curtains all impact on the visitors: there are curious people with research interests in curtain techniques; there are people who are proud of their ancestors and the work they performed; there are people feeling pity or shame for their own or others’ pasts. The visitors are affected when they move away from the curtains; they are touched in various ways as they have met with various curtains. The intra-actions that take place influence the subjects as well as the objects they have engaged with in museum processes.</p>

<title>Enacting cod</title>
<p>That objects are defined in engagements with subjects also holds true for nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1359183512442629">Szerszynski et al., 2003</xref>). This is the theme of a recently produced exhibition at Tromsø University Museum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359183512442629">Maurstad, 2010</xref>). The exhibition presented different perceptions of cod, the differences being indicated in visual design as well as textually. Both design and text aimed to resonate with and appeal to visitors’ own knowledge and identity, in humorous ways. The opening section was framed by a close-up view of the face of a giant cod staring at the audience, the text explaining cod as enacted in various practices:
<disp-quote>
<p>Cod has various societal missions. Dependent on perspective, we enact it as domesticated, as an environmental symbol, as a staple of society and much more. Laws and institutions define and determine perceptions of cod. As time goes by, the perceptions become naturalized and are impediments to other ways of seeing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This text was illustrated with visual images of various societal versions of cod. One is the cultural cod, framed in an archetypical Norwegian icon of culture, that of <italic>rosemaling</italic>, or decorative painting. An excerpt explains Norwegian culture further – how hospitality and silk scarves are iconic images of the identity of the northerners. They know how to lead the good life, and fishermen buying silk scarves for their women when the fishing is plentiful is said to be a northern way of life. The westerners act differently: when they earn good money from fish, it is invested in industries such as furniture factories.</p>
<p>Setting the scene for an exploration of differing perceptions of cod in Norway and for the different relationships between cod and humans, the exhibition refers to other aspects of cod perhaps less known to the public but still relevant and recognizable. The environmental nature of cod, for instance, is presented alongside text from the Norwegian website of the World Wildlife Fund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1359183512442629">WWF, 2010</xref>). Here cod is described as the most beloved fish in Norway. The statement is further qualified by saying that it has an attractive white belly and a beautiful pattern on its back. This is a new version of cod and I doubt that fishermen have ever described it as such before. I do not deny that they have a love for fish but, even if they think cod does have an attractive white belly, they would not express their opinion for fear of ridicule. But the WWF has this opinion, and it can be seen as essential to the relationship between the WWF and cod that the fish has these features. Cod is given these attractive qualities because environmentalists think animals are attractive, and to be an environmentalist and keep on working to save cod, the fish must continue to be presented that way. As the beauty of cod has not been mentioned previously, it is time to begin to explore this quality. This will recruit more environmentalists to speak up for cod.</p>
<p>There is one type of cod, however, that seems to be the most popular – the giant cod. This type of cod seems to make people proud and happy, as shown in a large panel at the exhibition displaying pictures of people holding up giant cod. The immediate message is obvious: people like to catch big fish. Chefs, amateur and professional fishermen alike, they are all smiling and holding up a big fish. The subtext therefore is that ‘super cod makes people super happy.’ The roles being enacted here are comparable to those that the environmentalists are engaged in. Humans take their identity from catching, holding and associating with a particular type of fish; in these engagements, they categorize not just the fish, but also themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512442629">Miller, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359183512442629">2007</xref>). Cod–human activities, then, compare to the entanglements with other objects such as curtains and woodworking planes. There are many object versions as well as expert versions involved in these engagements. Unlike the planes and curtains case studies, however, in the case of the cod exhibition it was the certified museum experts’ clear intention to talk of plurality. The focus was to show that multiple enactments of cod exist and co-exist. Where certified experts narrowed the ontologies of woodworking planes and curtains to a singular essence in the earlier examples, the situation here was inverted. And this work took time. The certified experts had to make a considerable effort to hold their position and focus, this time advocating ontology in the plural: ontologies. Three expert discussions can shed further light on this.</p>
<p>Some experts were concerned whether the museum was the right place to tell the story of cultural enactments of cod. It was a complex story; it was argued that perhaps it was better to explore it in a text or a book. Furthermore, it was suggested that, as a three-dimensional site, the museum presupposes objects, and there are few, if any, objects that could materialize this perspective. This is supported by the museum collection itself. As stated, the collection is rich in objects from a fisher–farmer culture. Displaying some fishing gear from the past might appear as a minor act indulging this view. The certified experts resisted this temptation, however. It was argued that using objects from the collection would detract from the message of the exhibition. The objects in the collection tell one particular story, that of the cultural cod, i.e. what cod means to culture. Material arrangements such as fishing gear or woollen mittens for warming the fishermen’s fingers would support a story of how cod is important in culture. While this is relevant, this story would compete with the perspective of the exhibition that seeks to highlight the ‘production of nature’, probably also becoming the main focus. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359183512442629">Macdonald (2002)</xref> shows, museum visitors often have predefined expectations that may block curators’ attempts to expand on new versions of a phenomenon. In order to keep the focus on how cod is enacted in various cultural forms, the items in the museum collection had to be ignored. In addition, the certified expert group took additional action by including more experts with the same perspectives in order to strengthen the exhibition by visualizing how important practices in culture are to nature.</p>
<p>The other expert discussion took place in the proofreading phase. Realities are also enacted in words, and texts are important authorizers of reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359183512442629">Callon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359183512442629">Law, 2004</xref>). The texts were thoroughly edited to assist the visual images of enactments. The proofreaders, however, commented on the awkwardness of some of the text. One concern was the previously mentioned introductory passage on how we assign many roles for the cod, where the passage ends with the statement: ‘Laws and institutions define and determine perceptions of cod. As time goes by, the perceptions become naturalized and are impediments to other ways of seeing.’ For the sake of simplicity and pedagogies, the proofreaders suggested changing this by eliminating the sentence on laws and institutions to say only: ‘As time goes by, we get used to our own image of the cod, and forget other ways of seeing it.’ The two statements present different realities. The first refers to the process of defining cod as a work process. Definitions are made, laws and institutions are made, and these protect and give the definitions further existence. The suggested change would only reveal a naturalized cod, concealing and making invisible all the societal and cultural work that accompanies the production-of-nature perspective. In this case, too, the certified experts won the argument, and the proofreaders’ comments were ignored.</p>
<p>The third expert discussion was more a process of discovery and took place after the exhibition had opened. Left to the workings of the market, the multiple readings of cod slipped out of the hands of the certified experts in the original project team. In the hands of different experts – for example, the marketing people and curators of other museums acquiring the exhibition – despite the stated intent to show cod as enacted in culture, the feedback from curators and visitors shows that the exhibition is often read as dealing with cod-in-nature. This is not surprising since the natural perspective is so dominant, as plainly illustrated by a visitor who, after being guided through the exhibition, stated: ‘I did read before I got here that it was about cod in culture; still I thought it was about biology. Now I see.’ People’s expectations as to what the museum holds can provide real challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359183512442629">Macdonald, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Summing up, the cod exhibition is a good example of more aspects of museum ontological politics. The certified experts in the cod project team exerted a particular power in order to overcome the resistance of other experts – experts certified in areas other than making an exhibition on cod plurality. Disturbing ideas and objects were excluded and only allies were enrolled; that is, experts dedicated to the knowledge perspectives of talking about object multiplicity, cod ontologies.</p>

<sec id="section6-1359183512442629">
<title>Relational materialities and collection policies</title>
<p>Things in nature and culture – cod, curtains and planes – come in different versions depending on the work they engage and are engaged in. Objects shift ontology as they move back and forth between human subjects, affecting human identities as well. There are relational and dialectical relationships between humans and objects, with material effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512442629">Miller, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359183512442629">2007</xref>). Most of us smile at giant cod, some of us smile at planes. Objects are relational materialities that matter. Performative perspectives on museum objects allow for a deeper focus than earlier constructivist perspectives on how poetics and language construct objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359183512442629">Lidchi, 1997</xref>), or interpretative perspectives on how materials are stable – it is interpretations that vary with social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512442629">Komissar, 2002</xref>). In these studies, there are often conscious actors at work. They have intentions that, if constructed differently, would change the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359183512442629">Demeritt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359183512442629">Hacking, 1999</xref>). The politics of performing thing identities is far subtler. The essence of things is located in practices, procedures, rules of engagement, and use of technologies, and it cannot always be accounted for as performed with intent, nor can effects be accounted for in advance.</p>
<p>My point is not that it is wrong – either professionally or morally – to perform ontological politics. On the contrary: I meant to show that it is intrinsic to our practices in the world. I meant to increase our awareness of its wide application in museum practices. Greater awareness can address and deal with these politics. We can make choices with regard to planes, curtains and cod, conscious choices where the knowledge dimension becomes explicit. What are we portraying and mediating by collecting and exhibiting specific objects? What knowledge are we conveying, what are we neglecting and for what reasons? These are key questions that museum experts already deal with. It is my contention that there are mind-opening answers to these questions if we start seeing museum objects as relational materialities where engagement and practice matter.</p>
<p>Aiming to promote knowledge-based collection policies (the political guideline for Norwegian museums), it follows from a relational material approach that there is both the question of participating parties and, as actions and relations are so important, the question of what these parties do. Discussing this at length would go beyond the scope of this article, but I will stress some matters of importance for further explorations in the field. The first is that defining items as cultural heritage is ontopolitical and knowledge-based work and it is work that should be analysed in more detail by knowledge-scientists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359183512442629">Collins and Evans (2002</xref>: 240) underline that sociologists of knowledge should claim their place as experts in the field of knowledge and ‘develop a knowledge science’ using knowledge and expertise as analysts’ categories. Their quest is to develop a normative theory of expertise allowing for prescriptive statements about the role of expertise in the public sphere. I have used their model to shed light on museum expert work with cultural heritage. As museum experts, we must distance ourselves from the idea that there are things out there of a certain age and meaning that give them immediate access to museum collections. Likewise, it is not sufficient to think that there are things out there that by themselves are representative authentic ‘spokesthings’ of a certain culture. Discussing the intricacies of museums’ relations to materiality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359183512442629">Knell (2007</xref>: 26) trusts the connoisseur: ‘It is expertise – with all the risks of bias – which breathes life into the corpse-like object, by shaping the labels in drawers, exhibits and heads.’ I would think that a relational material approach adds a warning here. The connoisseur is just one type of expert, and we must begin to see the performative elements of connoisseurship.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359183512442629">Collins and Evans (2002)</xref> advise forums dealing with knowledge science to define core groups of experts and people with relevant experience. These will have real contributions to make. A forum for deciding on collection policies could be built around the same model. Relevant experience could be evaluated according to the task at hand. Those with carpentry skills have different contributions to make than those skilled in knitting or sewing. A perspective on experience would help to realize the well-meant intentions behind the buzzwords ‘integrating the public’. Concerning expertise, museums have experimented with silencing curators, allowing the audience to experience objects on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359183512442629">Hein, 2006</xref>), or having the audience define what objects constitute community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359183512442629">Crooke, 2006</xref>). Such experimentation is vital for understanding more about how to perform pasts, but I do think curators need voices – in fact, I think they need several voices. I have shown how experts act out different versions of objects. As things, planes are very different from cod but they share the same fate when they come into contact with museum experts. They become subject to discourses over identity and function. Putting these discourses to work, analysing the situation to aid the decisions on outcomes, is knowledge-science work. A collection policy forum needs knowledge-scientists, and I believe they should even be in charge. I also think they need their role as certified experts, i.e. as people with a real say.</p>
<p>So far, I have talked of certified experts as those who have been concerned with narrowly defined object essences or ontologies. My claim here, that certified experts should be in charge, presupposes that their work changes towards seeing object multiplicities and performative aspects of object–subject entanglements. There are also other kinds of relevant experts. There are museologists, antiques experts and culture scientists, to mention just a few. We must also add, learning from the examples I have presented, that there are experts who are not certified to enact objects, but do so nevertheless. The academics who make fun of planes also need to be heard in future collection policy forums although I am not arguing for a poll on such matters. Learning from the cod exhibition experience, it was necessary and vital to listen to opposing voices, not just in the interests of democracy but in order to perform better in the knowledge-science nature of this project. It was to oppose the traditional view that cod is pure nature – a view so deeply entrenched in our consciousness, not to mention practices – that the cultural enactment of cod in various settings was emphasized in order to gain wider ground.</p>
<p>How to compose forums for collection policies and practices is a question that needs to be addressed in detail. First, it must be sufficiently understood by the parties involved: the different experts at the museum, but also the visitors. Museum staff have a special obligation to start addressing the issue, and I suggest experimenting with diverse voices in forums in order to appreciate how vital performances are to object identities and cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Ontopolitical decisions take place in most entanglements between objects and subjects; this makes it important that collection policy forums work to understand and reveal how museum relationships with objects are performative, and to develop a better understanding of the distinction between knowledge-based and politically based decisions. Subject–object interactions are real. Applying an ontopolitical perspective to objects such as woodworking planes, curtains and cod, I have shown that entities are often multiple and that different versions can be enacted. Applying an ontopolitical perspective to the question of how to exhibit the Enola Gay, there is the question of whether an expert panel, laying out the multiple versions of the Enola Gay, could have presented a new basis for an exhibition. The Enola Gay is a multiple phenomenon. Depending on whom it engages with, it can be seen as both causing Japanese suffering and saving American lives. Picking a version is a political choice with consequences, even ontological ones. The knowledge-scientist’s work is to point out that there are ontopolitical choices and to aid in understanding what materialities and persons the museum will enact if they pursue one version at the expense of others. Accepting a performative perspective of nature and culture means there can be no resting place. While we wait for proper collection policies and procedures to develop, we are still performing. Museums continue to affect society by the way they display their objects, provide knowledge about them and present their past.</p>
