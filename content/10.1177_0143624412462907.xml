<abstract>
<p>Buildings contribute to a large fraction of energy usage worldwide. In the United States alone, buildings consume about 40% of total energy expenditure, including 71% of electricity and 54% of natural gas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624412462907">1</xref></sup> The Army alone spends more than US $1 billion for building-related energy expenses. The 2005 Energy Policy Act<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624412462907">2</xref></sup> requires that Federal facilities be built to achieve at least a 30% energy savings over the 2004 International Energy Code or ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004, as appropriate, and that energy efficient designs must be life-cycle cost effective. According to the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA 2007),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143624412462907">3</xref></sup> new buildings and buildings undergoing major renovations shall be designed to reduce consumption of energy generated off-site or on-site using fossil fuels, as compared with such energy consumption by a similar building in fiscal year 2003 (FY03) as measured by Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) or Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) data from the Energy Information Agency, by 55% in 2010, 80% by 2020, and 100% by 2030. Current US research efforts focus on renewable energy sources and single-building energy efficiency, and pay little attention to integration and minimization of energy use in building communities, i.e. Army installations and university campuses. There is no over arching ‘power delivery/energy storage/demand’ architecture and methodology to accomplish this.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Practical applications:</italic></bold> This article describes the Net Zero fossil fuel-based energy optimization process and illustrates it with an example based on the results of study conducted for a cluster of buildings at Fort Irwin, CA. Application of the energy optimization process to new construction and major retrofit project shows17 20 that use of high performance building envelope (improved insulation and air tightness), advanced lighting strategies, and efficient HVAC systems results in significant energy savings (site and source) in Army buildings in all climates. When buildings built or retrofitted with a high performance building envelope, using advanced lighting systems and highly efficient ‘low exergy’ HVAC systems, reach a theoretical energy use minimum, the largest percentage of the remaining energy use in the building will be related to its ‘mission’: lighting, plug loads, and domestic hot water usage. Additional savings may be achieved with measures related to improved efficiency of power generation supplied to the building (co- and tri-generation) and use of energy supplied from renewable energy sources. The integrated energy solution recommended here demonstrates that vastly improved energy efficiency and GHG reduction are feasible in the context of a normal scale development using proven approaches from the USA and elsewhere. Moreover, the optimization process can be applied to new construction and major renovation of buildings and building clusters projects developed for low energy communities.</p>

<p>Army installations are essentially small campuses, comprised of clusters of buildings. Energy efficiency requires serious tracking of all waste energy flows, their use, and their storage within the ‘installation boundaries,’ with consideration of realistic thermodynamic constraints for all rejected energy (e.g. recovery and reuse of heat in cogeneration processes). The implementation of improved standards and increased energy efficiency in individual buildings can help those buildings become more energy-efficient, but it is difficult to achieve net zero energy (NZE) goals by improving individual buildings in isolation. NZE cannot be met with efficiency increases alone; there must be efficiency gains on the conversion, supply, and distribution side as well. Achieving NZE cost effectively will be possible if an optimum mix of demand reduction, energy distribution, energy supply, and renewable sources are put in place at a community (installation) or building cluster scale.</p>
<p>The knowledge base needed to build, renovate, and maintain Army installations with the highest levels of energy efficiency do not penetrate far enough into the market. Many technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143624412462907">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143624412462907">5</xref></sup> are available to improve building energy efficiency related to the building envelope, ventilation, advanced ‘low exergy’ heating and cooling systems, central energy plants with co- and tri-generation, hybrid, and high efficient lighting systems designs and technologies, integrated solar thermal and electrical systems, etc. Economies of scale can make many technologies more efficient – in technical and economic terms – when used in large rather than small or individual building systems. Employing these technologies will enable optimized systems to reduce primary (both demand and supply) energy consumption to the best available standards, and at lower costs.</p>
<p>Community energy planning and central system’s optimization does not require new tools. In the past, central energy system designers used hydraulic and thermal optimization tools to design the components of the energy supply system for a combined heating and power plant using an ‘optimization strategy,’ which can be used for both heating and cooling systems. Although this approach is rarely used by community energy planners, it is an important feature necessary in community-wide energy planning to integrate supply and demand to achieve an optimized solution. The objective in applying the principles of such a holistic approach to community energy is to provide such necessary methods and instruments to master planners, decision makers, and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Thermal energy systems consist of three major elements: energy generation, energy distribution, and energy demand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143624412462907">Figure 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-0143624412462907" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Energy supply chain from primary energy to its use inside a building</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0143624412462907-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The goal is to find the optimum for the entire energy system, where each element requires consideration and to calculate the amount of energy delivered, in various forms, by the energy systems. The challenges of the model are to assess the system’s energy needs in terms of heating, cooling, and power generation; and then to estimate how those needs can be met by the various energy systems that are selected. The model is devoted to calculating the system’s load and energy use and to evaluate how they can be optimally met.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0143624412462907"><title>Building level optimization</title>
<p>The Army’s present and future building stock consists of a variety of building types. Energy requirements in some types (i.e. barracks, office buildings, child development centers, maintenance facilities, and hangars) are dominated by climate control (heating, cooling, and humidity), with smaller effects from plug-in loads. Other buildings (e.g. command and control facilities, hospitals, training facilities with simulators, dining facilities, laboratories, etc.) have high energy loads dominated by internal processes and/or high ventilation requirements.</p>
<p>Most of these facilities have similar, well-understood energy use reduction methods (e.g. building envelope improvement, better lighting systems designs and technologies, etc.). In buildings with high internal loads, energy use can be reduced only by altering the way specific processes use energy efficient appliances and significant waste streams;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624412462907">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624412462907">6</xref></sup> currently, this is rarely addressed.</p>
<p>Energy demand determines the amount of energy that the distribution and supply generation side must provide. Models such as EnergyPlus, ESPr, TRNSYS, or other accurate hourly energy analysis programs can simulate and optimize building level energy use. Evaluation of a community or a cluster of buildings will reveal opportunities for energy savings and challenges for analysis and optimization. Addressing buildings as a cluster does not require a deep evaluation of each building, but it does require that individual analyses be applied to the building cluster, and that consideration be given to the possibility of integrated supply services.</p>
<p>The building optimization process starts with: (a) identifying typical buildings and energy systems on Army installations and existing energy wastes and inefficiencies related to these buildings and systems;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143624412462907">5</xref></sup> (b) developing load profiles for typical base-case buildings; and (c) analyzing suites of technologies for an ultra-low energy installation to include waste recovery and energy conservation (ultra-low energy), and energy generation and storage technologies that could be applied to buildings and the energy systems that support those buildings to minimize traditional electrical and fossil energy use.</p>
<p>There is a debate over whether to conserve energy first or just generate energy with renewable alternatives. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143624412462907">Figure 2</xref> shows several theoretical paths that a designer or master energy planner can choose and the process for each individual building and building cluster optimization. Point 1 represents the base case building, which is either an existing building, or a new building that must be built to local code requirements with a given total annual cost, which is the annual mortgage or financed first cost plus the annual energy operating costs. If renewables are added at this point, the total annual cost of the NZE building will be as shown in Point 8, using a constant cost for a unit of photovoltaic (PV) system ($/m<sup>2</sup> of a PV panels or $/kWh electricity produced). Point 8 has the largest annual cost, created by adding expensive renewable technologies without reducing buildings demands first.
<fig id="fig2-0143624412462907" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Building fossil fuel reduction optimization process</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0143624412462907-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Another alternative from Point 1 is to add energy efficiency technologies at the building level, which will require investing in these technologies (additional first cost); eventually, you reach Point 2 with the lowest total annual cost. Typically you would not add renewables at Point 2 since adding many conventional energy efficiency technologies at this point may be more cost effective than adding renewable generation. When Point 3 is reached, you have achieved the same total annual cost as your existing building or base case building built to code (Point1), but the building at Point 3 is now much more energy efficient and often much more comfortable. As one continues to add energy efficiency improvements, the building will eventually reach Point 4, where adding more energy efficiency measures will either result in diminishing returns, or where they will cost more than adding renewable generation.</p>
<p>For an individual building analysis, this building at Point 4 would be ‘Net Zero Ready.’ For different types of buildings and climate locations, fossil fuel-based energy reduction will vary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143624412462907">7</xref></sup> In buildings with low internal energy loads, reduction of fossil fuel can be significant (50–75%), but in buildings with high internal loads, reductions of only 20–30% may be achieved. This is true even for buildings built or retrofitted to ‘passive house’ requirements, and that use advanced ‘low exergy’ systems to satisfy remaining heating and cooling needs. The remaining energy requirements will be dominated by electrical power needs for lighting, appliances, and internal processes and by domestic hot water needs, e.g. for showers. Adding renewables from Point 4 will result in the total annual cost shown by Point 7. The process from Point 4 to 7 is approximately at the same slope, or cost, as the process from Point 1 to 8, but it is shown to be more cost effective to purchase less expensive renewable energy technology for a building with reduced energy demands.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the building characterized by Point 4 can be connected to co-generation plant serving either this individual building or cluster of buildings. This will require a smaller investment compared to the cost of decentralized boilers and chillers for single buildings, and the cost of larger renewable generation equipment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143624412462907">8</xref></sup> but will result in a significant fossil fuel reduction due to use of waste heat accompanying electricity generation. This heat can be used either to satisfy heating, cooling, and domestic hot water needs of the building cluster, or be exported to another building cluster. The use of co-generation for individual buildings and building clusters affects the optimal location of Point 4 for each individual building. When the subject of interest is a single building, the waste heat produced by co-generation process can be only used for heating, cooling, and domestic hot water needs. The amount of waste heat generated will determine the optimal level of the building insulation and its loads. Typically, the level of insulation used in new construction and retrofit project results in small heating and cooling loads and the waste heat from co-generation process will compete with the heat that can be generated using solar thermal systems. When the boundaries of the analysis go beyond a single building, the waste heat can be used for the building clusters under consideration, and the decision on the level of building insulation must be made based on a mix of buildings (new and old) and on other potential uses of waste heat.</p>
<p>Connecting to a combined heat and power (CHP) plant, fossil fuel usage by the building cluster (Point 5) can be further reduced by another 20–25%. When a CHP uses biomass or biogas as a fuel, the connected building(s) become ‘Net Zero’ fossil fuel. Typically, at Point 5, buildings do not require additional thermal energy from renewable energy source, but may require additional electrical power. After Point 5, adding solar- or wind-generated electrical power becomes a cost-effective supply option. At this point, by definition, the building cluster is ‘Net Zero Ready.’ Path 1–2–3–4–5–6 is the lowest cost path for building improvement leading toward net-zero fossil fuel-based energy strategy.</p>
<p>When this process has been completed for each building, the results from all of the individual buildings are integrated and summed into annual load duration curves. The load duration curve shows the cumulative duration for different loads in the system over a full year. These curves are derived from hourly load data to show all possible variations to the system and are generated from the hourly building energy simulation program. Due to the diversity of energy use in buildings comprising the cluster (community), the peak of the resulting load curve is much smaller than the sum of peaks of individual buildings so that the needed generation and back-up capacity is much smaller.</p>

<p>Significant energy use reduction by buildings can be achieved by minimizing the impact of the external environment on the building heating and/or cooling loads. While the current advanced buildings practice in the USA is based on the ASHRAE Standards 90.1 (2010) and 189.1 (2010), the most rigorous standard for building energy efficiency resulting in ultra-low energy buildings are the German Passive House (Passivhaus) standard. ERDC–CERL researchers in collaboration with Georg Zielke, Architekturburo Zielke Passivhauser and Dr Berthold Kauffman, Passivhaus Institute, Germany, have developed the interpretation of Passive House characteristics of the building envelope for application to US construction in all 16 DOE climate zones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143624412462907">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143624412462907">Table 1</xref>), which contain the following representative cities:

<sec id="sec6-0143624412462907"><title>Windows</title>
<p>Windows play an important role in energy efficient buildings: they can reduce heat loss and light the space with sunlight. High efficiency windows with heat-conserving glazing can achieve low <italic>U</italic>-values. The amount of total solar gain with triple glazed windows can be as high as 60%, depending on glazing and gas-filling. This requires the window frame to incorporate insulation and triple glazing, and ideally, to eliminate thermal bridging. The US Army also has a security requirement for blast resistant windows (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143624412462907">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>According to the USACE ECB 29 2009, the air leakage rate of the building envelope shall not exceed 1.27 L/(s* m<sup>2</sup>) at a pressure differential of 75 Pa for new and renovation construction projects. In 2010, more than 250 US Army buildings were constructed and renovated to meet or exceed this requirement at no or minimum additional cost. Achieving air tightness of 0.51 L/(s* m<sup>2</sup>) or better was not uncommon. Based on this experience and on industry consensus, it was proposed to lower the new level for air tightness to 0.76 L/(s* m<sup>2</sup>) at a differential pressure of 75 Pa.</p>

<p>Lighting design strategies and energy efficient technologies adapted in this study are a part of a comprehensive ‘Lighting Design Guide’ developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Lighting strategies resulting in significant energy savings are: appropriate illuminance levels without over-lighting; use of efficient lamps, ballasts, and luminaires; and reduction of electric lighting usage with controls.</p>

The study considered the following types of HVAC technologies: dedicated outside air system (DOAS) for ventilation, humidity control, and building pressure management; separate ventilation systems for living areas and laundry facilities in barracks; VAV system with reheat and outdoor economizer for administrative buildings; ceiling-mounted radiant heating and cooling systems for barracks and administrative facilities; free cooling air-cooled chiller for DOAS system; transpired solar collectors for ventilation air preheat for climate zones 2 A–8 A; demand-based make-up ventilation systems for dining facilities and repair bays in maintenance facilities; hydronic, in-floor radiant heating systems for maintenance bays and vehicle corridors; high efficiency vehicle exhaust capture systems; improved kitchen hood designs and control strategies for dining facilities; and ground-coupled heat pumps for different types of facilities.</p>

<p>Energy models that optimize distribution of energy from central generation/production to the energy usage by the buildings and systems can be used to develop the community energy concept. The building simulation gives results for demand curves for domestic hot water consumption, electricity consumption, heating, and cooling for those buildings at existing climatic conditions; these are passed to the next step.</p>
<p>These models will minimize energy waste and losses and optimize first and operating costs (first cost + operating cost = total cost). Based on this concept, a Master Planning process can be developed that will provide an orderly approach to changing the typical Army installation to an ultra low energy consuming community.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0143624412462907"><title>Distribution and supply optimization</title>
<p>An energy system optimization model like POLIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143624412462907">10</xref></sup> can simulate supply systems. Between energy generation and energy demand points (at each building level), a distribution system transports the energy via hot or chilled water system. These systems can be simulated using a hydraulic flow model. While ‘energy balancing’ means just calculating the correct energy flows (and perhaps also carbon emissions) in a system, to estimate energy costs and to benchmark with other similar systems, simulation and optimization is necessary for system planning. A simpler simulation approach is preferable to generally compare available alternatives, to model a whole-system energy balance and compare the effects of different demand or supply side measures in terms of energy efficiency, capital and energy costs, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the simulated demand curves from the building simulation optimization step.</p>
<p>POLIS models an energy system as a closed system that includes the entire chain from demand, through the distribution system, to the supply systems. All elements (e.g. buildings, boilers, generators, grids, etc.) are described as ‘knots’ of energy and cost related parameters linked together in an interconnected system in which different usages are interlinked. Power supply, heating, and air-conditioning are modeled in a common system. This offers the opportunity to compare efficient technologies such as co-generation (power + heat) and tri-generation (power + heat + cooling). The model requires at least an hourly time resolution. The results of such a modeling offer the best suited solution to reduce the energy usage of a building cluster and lead the way to least-cost, net-zero installations. Furthermore, the approach of optimizing building clusters will offer new and/or additional options to cost efficiently reduce the fossil energy footprint of community systems. The results can be directly applied to detailed design planning to implement the solution found in the model.</p>
<p>POLIS can model an energy system using prototype generation equipment, distribution systems, and load profiles. Cost, emissions, and technical parameters are used to describe existing or future elements of the system. Simulation is performed using hourly load profiles for thermal and electrical energy demand throughout a year (8760 h) generated from the summation of the building cluster energy simulations. POLIS allows calculation of the best suited combination of paths to meet the load, with the objective to minimize total system costs, or to minimize total GHG-emissions. Since distribution systems play a significant role in an overall thermal energy system, a hydraulic flow model should be used to analyze critical capacities and flows in the system. Through an iterative process, these two models will determine whether an optimization of the energy system (POLIS results) will lead to a feasible optimized supply and generation system.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0143624412462907"><title>Building upgrade improvements for typical renovation projects</title>
<p>Barracks buildings in the Army inventory typically get a major renovation at ∼25 years of service under the building upgrade program (BUP). This study attempts to reduce the building’s energy use to the energy usage level of a newly constructed building, e.g. by adding insulation; installing tight fitting, well insulated doors, and by replacing windows. The lighting, HVAC, and domestic water energy systems need to use high efficient equipment and effective controls. Appliances and equipment should be energy star rated.</p>
<p>Our analysis for cost effectiveness of achieving NZE use of the building cluster assumes that the major building upgrade has been accomplished under the BUP. The subject barracks buildings in this cluster would, therefore, already have had a major improvement in their efficiency of energy use and a significant investment would have been made in the buildings. The recommendations in this report would build on these improvements to achieve buildings that would be ready to apply renewable energy systems for the achievement of NZE use. To minimize the cost of these additional improvements, it is expected that they would be accomplished during the BUP building upgrade.</p>

<sec id="sec15-0143624412462907"><title>Energy savings estimates</title>
<p>The estimated energy use of the five barracks and dining facility as operating during the site visit was 3.1 million kWh/year and 9193 million Btu of LPG gas. The data generated by computer analysis indicate that a typical upgrade of a barracks building only saves 8% of the electricity use compared to the barracks ‘as we found them’ and 7% of the heating energy.</p>
<p>The results of further analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143624412462907">Table 3</xref>) show that upgrades to NZE ready buildings allow to reduce the energy consumed to heat, cool, and ventilate the cluster facilities by 44–49% of electrical use and 30–59% of heating use with paybacks of 2–10 years depending on the alternative chosen. Since the proposed energy efficiency work includes the implementation of DOAS and high efficiency dehumidification systems, that would dramatically reduce the potential for biological growth; in climates where mold is an issue, the avoided costs of mold mitigation can decrease the payback to 1.2 years.

<p>In Option 2, the coverage of the DHW demand with the solar thermal system using evacuated tube collectors is approximately 90%. In the summer period, the solar thermal system is designed to cover 100% of the DHW demand.</p>
<p>In Option 3, the DHW and SPH demand of the barracks and the dining facility could be met with a biomass system using wood waste as the fuel source. The LPG boilers would be reduced to peak load boilers and for redundancy in case of maintenance of the biomass system. No solar thermal systems would be installed.</p>

<p>The barracks have a significant amount of roof space at a 30° tilt where PV panels could be installed to feed into the grid; 242 m<sup>2</sup> of roof area left after installation of solar thermal system will provide enough room for 125 PV panels flush to the roof. This yields a total capacity of 21.9 kW<sub>DC</sub>. The dining facility roof has approximately 122 m<sup>2</sup> of flat available roof area with a 20° tilt. Considering 2.25 m of spacing between each row of panels, 18 PV panels can be installed on roof to yield a total capacity of 3.2 kW<sub>DC</sub>.</p>
<p>Installing solar thermal, biomass (wood chip), and PV electrical generation systems can save 4832 million Btu/year and generate 41,630 KWh/year. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0143624412462907">Table 4</xref>). Renewable thermal energy generation is cost effective and has a payback period below 10 years. Using PV panels to generate renewable electrical energy is not cost effective solution since it has a significant payback period of 47 years.</p>

<p>Application of the energy optimization process described in this article to new construction and major retrofit project shows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143624412462907">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143624412462907"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143624412462907"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143624412462907">20</xref></sup> that use of high performance building envelope (improved insulation and air tightness), advanced lighting strategies, and efficient HVAC systems results in significant energy savings (site and source) in Army buildings in all climates. For example, barracks site energy can be reduced by 50–70% (depending on climate) compared to the EPACT 2005 baseline; maintenance facilities by 77–85%, brigade headquarters by 32–82%, etc. However, source energy use reduction goals of EISA 2007 (starting 2015) cannot be achieved by any type of building except for maintenance facilities in some climate zones.</p>
<p>Well insulated and air tight building envelope significantly reduces heating and cooling loads on the HVAC systems, and minimizes the impact of different system types selected. For example, the HVAC system type can be selected using multiple criteria (e.g. greater energy efficiency, ease of operation and maintenance, and ease of installation). Some heating and cooling technologies that can reduce building site energy use will result in increased use of source fuel. For example, while the use of ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs) may appear to be an attractive choice to reduce building site energy consumption, calculations made back to the source fuels negate many of the gains related to the use of GSHPs, and in some locations, show that GSHPs use more source fuel than alternative technologies.</p>
<p>When buildings built or retrofitted with a high performance building envelope, using advanced lighting systems and highly efficient ‘low exergy’ HVAC systems, reach a theoretical energy use minimum, the largest percentage of the remaining energy use in the building will be related to its ‘mission’: lighting, plug loads, and domestic hot water usage. It is important to understand these loads, to improve their efficiency, and to reduce their use. Additional savings may be achieved with measures related to improved efficiency of power generation supplied to the building (co- and tri-generation) and use of energy supplied from renewable energy sources. Connecting a building to a CHP plant, can further reduce the building’s fossil fuel usage by 15–25% depending on the thermal-to-electric load ratio.</p>
<p>The analysis applied to the existing building cluster that will be undergoing major retrofit shows that it is possible, with only a slight additional cost, to fund energy saving projects that will reduce the energy consumed to heat, cool, and ventilate facilities by 44–49% of electrical use and 30–59% of heating use. Using the incremental cost of these projects over the retrofit costs, the additional savings will provide a payback of less than 10 years. Also, it is possible to achieve net zero fossil fuel energy used for heating and cooling using solar thermal and biomass based generation technologies. Standalone solar PV power generation is not a cost-effective technology, but when used in combination with other demand-based and thermal generation technologies, may result in a cost effective NZE solution.</p>
<p>Under a future US climate regulatory regime, the credits associated with GHG emissions may have significant value and should be included in the financial evaluation of all projects. The costs of natural gas, alternative energy technology, alternative fuels and the impact of GHG regulation are significant uncertainties in the future. For this reason, implementing construction and retrofit projects by connecting buildings to centralized systems is an approach that minimizes the potential future risks. The integrated energy solution recommended here demonstrates that vastly improved energy efficiency and GHG reduction are feasible in the context of a normal scale development using proven approaches from the USA and elsewhere.</p>
<p>A ‘business as usual’ approach employs individual boilers and chillers for each building, and normally results in a significant overcapacity and over time excessive energy use by this equipment. Alternatively, district heating and cooling systems link buildings in common networks that eliminate inefficient over-capacity of boilers and chillers and allow the integrated system to meet the integrated peak loads instead of the sum of individual peak loads. This way, efficient machines can be added now so that, in the future, new technologies may more easily added at one common location instead of in each individual building.</p>
