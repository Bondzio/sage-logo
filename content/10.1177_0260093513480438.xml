<p>This issue of <italic>The Bible Translator</italic> marks a new phase in the history of the journal. It began publication as a single series in 1950 with Eugene Nida as founding editor. Volume 23 in 1972 saw the emergence of the two series, <italic>Technical Papers</italic> (January and July) and <italic>Practical Papers</italic> (April and October). With volume 64, 2013, the United Bible Societies enters a partnership with SAGE Publishing, a leading academic publishing house which handles many reputable journals. This partnership will broaden the readership and enhance the profile of <italic>The Bible Translator.</italic> SAGE’s role in the partnership is to publish, distribute, and market the journal. Editorial control and policy and appointments to the Editorial Board remain the responsibility of the United Bible Societies. The aim of the journal remains unchanged—to provide a forum for the discussion of matters relating to the theory and practice of Bible translation for everyone involved in the task, both translators and scholars, set within the wider world of linguistics, biblical studies, and translation studies.</p>
<p>The most obvious changes include the following:
<list id="list1-0260093513480438" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>The Bible Translator</italic> will appear in three larger issues per year—in April, August, and December.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Each ordinary issue will have two sections, containing technical and practical papers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A single Editorial Board will combine the resources of the two existing boards to provide rigorous peer review of submissions for publication in the whole range of specialist areas involved.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Many subscribers will have access via SAGE to full searchable electronic copy of the journal.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Subscriptions to the journal, outside the Bible Societies fellowship, will be handled directly by SAGE.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>This first issue under the new publishing arrangement, however, is no ordinary issue. It is a Festschrift containing papers offered in honour of recently retired editor, Dr. Roger Omanson. In fact, the response to the call for papers has been so great that the Festschrift will be spread over two issues of the journal.</p>
<p>We welcome, as Guest Editors of this Festschrift, Dr. Philip Towner and Dr. Philip Stine. Phil Stine, formerly Translation Services Coordinator and then Director for Publishing, Marketing, and Translation for the United Bible Societies, helped induct Roger into the role of UBS Translation Consultant. Phil Towner is Executive Director and Dean of the Nida Institute for Biblical Scholarship at the American Bible Society, was also formerly UBS Translation Services Coordinator, and preceded Roger as Editor of <italic>The Bible Translator—Technical Papers.</italic></p>
<p>UBS would like to acknowledge the assistance of Dr. David Trobisch and Dr. Dirk Jongkind as well as the entire Editorial Board in the preparation of this special issue.</p>
<p>The full list of colleagues and friends who have contributed to this Festschrift is as follows: Robert Bascom, Roger Bullard, David Clark, Simon Crisp, Edgar Ebojo, Paul Ellingworth (another former editor of <italic>Technical Papers</italic>), Sarah Lind, Stanley Porter, Adrian Schenker, Seppo Sipilä, Daud Soesilo, Marlon Winedt, and Lynell Zogbo. Papers not included in this issue will appear in volume 64 no. 2, August 2013.</p>
<p>The Editorial Staff and Board join these colleagues in honouring Roger as a scholar, colleague, and friend, whose contribution to Bible translation and this journal is immense, and in wishing him a long and happy retirement.</p>
