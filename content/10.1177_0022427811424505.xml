This article is the first to examine the costs of a life course of crime in the United Kingdom. Method: This study uses longitudinal data from 411 South London males from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD) to derive costs-of-crime estimates from childhood to middle adulthood (ages 10 to 50). Additional features include a calculation of cost estimates across distinct offending trajectories and centering on costs per offender. Results: Offending over the life course imposes a considerable amount of economic and social costs and these costs are differentially distributed across offending trajectories. The cost of high-rate chronic offending is nearly two and a half to ten times greater than the cost of high adolescence peaked offending, very low-rate chronic offending, and low adolescence peaked offending, respectively. It is estimated that a male high-rate chronic offender on average would impose an annual cost of £18 ($29) per U.K. citizen or a lifetime cost of £742 ($1,185) per U.K. citizen. Conclusions: As the average and total costs of crime were significantly different across offending trajectories, with high-rate chronics imposing the most financial burden, adopting prevention and intervention strategies aimed at reducing the number of high-rate chronics and/or speeding up their eventual desistance will offer many savings to the public and perhaps turn those negative costs into positive contributions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>costs of crime</kwd><kwd>offending</kwd><kwd>trajectories</kwd><kwd>longitudinal</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>When the public is asked about their perception of crime, they often tend to espouse some very hard-line views of why offenders commit crime and how the criminal justice system should respond with various punishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811424505">Cullen, Fisher, and Applegate 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427811424505">Roberts and Stalans 1997</xref>).

These studies led to additional research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427811424505">Anderson (1999)</xref> and others, who also summarized the total costs of crime to include those costs outside the criminal justice system (e.g., victim losses, crime prevention strategies, opportunity costs of victims', criminals', and prisoners' time, the fear of being victimized, and the costs of deterrence). In Anderson’s study of data mainly from 1997, he estimated crime costs to exceed $1 trillion annually for the entire United States. If one were to take the U.S. population from 1997, we would arrive at a crime cost of $3,731.97 per U.S. citizen regardless of age.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022427811424505">1</xref></sup></p><p>Other research on cost estimates expanded these early studies by examining different crime types and expanding the various inputs into the cost estimates to include expenses such as direct and indirect, tangible and intangible costs, such as medical care, mental health treatment, and counseling, property loss, employment loss, overall quality of life, emotional distress, pain and suffering, and also the public’s willingness-to-pay costs (which include public concern about crime and willingness to assist in crime prevention) in order to capture the victim-specific and societal toll that is imposed by crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427811424505">Cohen et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811424505">2004</xref>).

One early attempt was completed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427811424505">Cohen (1998)</xref>, who calculated the various costs that a young career criminal would likely inflict over their criminal career. Including the annual victim and criminal justice-related costs per index crime, he found that the total external costs of a life of crime ranged from approximately $1.5 to $1.8 million. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427811424505">DeLisi and Gatling (2003)</xref> replicated Cohen’s study among a sample of 500 midwestern adult criminals with at least 30 career arrests and found that the average cost imposed per offender was more than $1.14 million. In a third study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022427811424505">Welsh et al. (2008)</xref> used data from the Pittsburgh Youth Study and found that the 10 percent most serious and chronic delinquent inner-city boys imposed about $800,000 to $900,000 in victim costs during adolescence.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811424505">Cohen and Piquero (2009</xref>) used data from the 1958 Philadelphia Birth Cohort Study to examine the costs of crime through the mid-20s. These authors presented the value of saving a high-risk youth (i.e., the preventive value indicating how much money and victimization would be saved if the offending career was forestalled) to be between $2.6 and $5.3 million at age 18. A key feature of their work was the use of public willingness-to-pay estimates that include public concern about crime (i.e., collateral costs that include crime prevention expenditures, avoidant behaviors, insurance costs, government welfare programs) and increases the costs associated with career offenders. These modifications served to produce higher cost estimates than those obtained in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811424505">Cohen and Piquero 2009</xref>:38).</p><p>In a follow-up study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427811424505">Cohen, Piquero, and Jennings (2010a)</xref> estimated the costs of crime for offending trajectories in the same data and found that a group of chronic offenders who commit crimes frequently when young and who turned to more serious crimes as adults imposed far greater costs than low-frequency chronic offenders and a group of offenders whose offending peaked during adolescence. Several findings are noteworthy. First, the mean costs per offender in the high-rate group were over $1 million. Second, the costs of offending for the high-rate group were higher in early adulthood (age 18 to 26) than during adolescence (age 8 to 17). Third, the most frequent (high-rate chronic) offender (53 crimes) imposed a cost of $1,696,000 by the mid-20s. Finally, their findings indicated that preventing individuals from becoming high-rate chronic offenders would yield significant cost savings of upward of $200 million by the mid-20s. Subsequent analyses by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811424505">Cohen, Piquero, and Jennings (2010b)</xref> exploring race/sex differences in trajectory cost estimates indicated that (1) <italic>male</italic> high-rate chronic offenders imposed costs of over half a billion dollars; (2) the average costs per one high-rate chronic male offender was greater than $1.5 million; (3) high-rate chronic African American offenders, who represented 2.7 percent of the sample imposed 36.3 percent of the total costs—more than $1.6 million per offender; and (4) high-rate chronic Hispanic offenders had a cost of over $200,000 per offender.</p><p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811424505">DeLisi et al. (2010)</xref> reported on the costs imposed among 654 convicted homicide offenders from eight U.S. states, finding that the average murderer imposed costs of about $24 million, while the most severe offender imposed a total cost of over $160 million. This cost is much higher than the average cost of a criminal career or high-risk delinquent youth ($1 to $5 million) previously reported—likely due to the use of a sample of convicted murderers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022427811424505">2</xref></sup></p><sec id="section1-0022427811424505"><title>Current Study</title><p>This study extends prior work in several ways. First, we use longitudinal offending data for males in the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD), including previously identified offending trajectories (through age 40) as well as offending data obtained from an additional record search that offers an additional 10 years of data to age 50. Second, most cost-of-crime studies have been limited to the United States, and to the best of our knowledge there exists no cost-of-crime research employing criminal career/life course data at the individual-level outside the United States. As such our analysis is the first to examine the costs of a life course of crime in the United Kingdom, a country that has experienced significant crime and criminal justice system issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811424505">Farrington and Jolliffe 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427811424505">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811424505">2005b</xref>). Finally, in order to examine whether distinct groups of offenders impose varying degrees of financial harm, we examine how the economic and social costs of crime are distributed across offender trajectory groups. Our data following a cohort of individuals into middle adulthood permit one of the most comprehensive investigations that examine the costs of crime across distinct offending trajectories and centering on costs per offender.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0022427811424505"><title>Data</title><p>The CSDD is a prospective longitudinal survey of the development of antisocial behavior in 411 South London males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427811424505">Farrington, Coid, and West 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427811424505">Farrington et al. 2006</xref>).

Convictions were counted for offenses committed up to the end of 1993. Between ages 10 and 16 inclusive (the years of juvenile delinquency in England at that time), 85 males were convicted. Up to age 40, 164 males were convicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811424505">Farrington, Barnes, and Lambert 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811424505">Farrington, Lambert, and West 1998</xref>).

Not surprisingly, the nonoffenders and the low-rate adolescence peak offenders were still inactive in their 40s, but the high-rate adolescence peak group became active again in their 40s after nearly a decade of inactivity. It is also worth noting that in general, about 40 percent of the sample had accumulated at least one conviction by age 50 and 13.2 percent of the sample had a violent conviction (assault, robbery, sex offense), of which most were for assault. Not only did the high-rate chronics offend the most frequently (21.13 mean convictions; <italic>F</italic> = 590.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) but they also had a greater prevalence (87.5 percent; <italic>F</italic> = 42.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and frequency (3.63 mean convictions; <italic>F</italic> = 84.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) of <italic>violent</italic> convictions compared to all other offender groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022427811424505">10</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig1-0022427811424505" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>CSDD offending trajectories from age 10 to 40 with additional follow-up to age 50.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022427811424505-fig1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="section10-0022427811424505"><title>Costs of CSDD Trajectories from Age 10 to 50</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022427811424505">Figure 2</xref> presents the mean costs of offending in £ from ages 10 to 50 by age and by group as well as the monetary cost estimates converted to $. A comprehensive monetary cost estimate was attached to each individual’s specific crime(s) that they committed from early adolescence into middle adulthood.

Another important finding lies in the comparison of the frequency of offending and the costs of offending between the two high-rate groups during mid-to-late adolescence. Specifically, although the high adolescence peak offenders offend more <italic>frequently</italic> on average than the high-rate chronics, the high-rate chronics <italic>cost</italic> more due to their greater involvement in serious (and person-oriented) offenses.</p><fig id="fig2-0022427811424505" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>CSDD cost trajectories from age 10 to 50 by trajectory membership in U.K. pounds (£) and U.S. dollars ($).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022427811424505-fig2.tif"/></fig><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022427811424505">Figure 3</xref> provides further illustration of the group-based trends in the monetary costs of crime where the age by year cost estimates were smoothed by creating 5-year averages for the costs of crime from ages 10 to 50 (with the exception that the final average cost, age 45 to 50, was based on a 6-year average). The solid black line represents the mean costs of offending for the sample from ages 10 to 50 in the aggregate and emphasizes the importance of disaggregating the costs across groups as the large amount of variability in the costs of crime are minimized and masked in the mere aggregate costs. As shown, there is a strong age/cost pattern that resembles the classic age/crime curve and peaks in adolescence. This suggests that the answer to whether the average cost of crime follows the aggregate age/crime curve depends on unpacking the trajectories and which group is being focused on. For most offender groups, the age/cost pattern tends to strongly peak in late adolescence, but for the high-rate chronics the costs appear to be high well into early adulthood and into middle adulthood.</p><fig id="fig3-0022427811424505" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Five-year smoothed CSDD cost trajectories from age 10 to 50 by trajectory membership in U.K. pounds (£) and U.S. dollars ($).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022427811424505-fig3.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="section11-0022427811424505"><title>Mean and Total Cost Comparisons of CSDD Trajectories from Age 10 to 50</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811424505">Table 1</xref> provides the mean cost of offending in each of the groups in U.K. £ and U.S. $ as well as the total costs of each trajectory.

This study used longitudinal data from the CSDD in order to produce cost-of-crime estimates to age 50. A focus on the costs of crime in the United Kingdom is of interest not only because of the lack of replication outside the United States but also because these data represent the most comprehensive monetary costs-of-crime individual-level analysis in the literature and because the costs of crime in the aggregate in England and Wales has been estimated to be around £60 billion (almost $100 billion) at 1999 prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427811424505">Brand and Price 2000</xref>). Several findings are highlighted.</p><p>First, when we investigated the average costs of offending by age and trajectory, we found that (1) the most costly stage of the life course is mid-to-late adolescence, where offense frequency also tends to peak; (2) during adolescence, high adolescence peak and high-rate chronic offender trajectories had similar offending frequencies, but the high-rate chronic group costs more because they also had more serious person-oriented offenses in their crime mix; and (3) total costs of crime were significantly different across offending trajectories, with high-rate chronic offenders costing the most (average high-rate chronic offender costs £59,760 or $95,241). Second, persons in the high-rate chronic group average 21 convictions to age 50 and the most costly offender in this group was convicted of 17 offenses (6 of which were serious person-oriented) and imposed a cost of £96,000 ($153,000). In short, the total aggregate monetary costs of offending among the offenders amounted to £2,042,297 ($3,254,935). Third, under the assumption that the prevalence of the male high-rate chronic group was representative of the prevalence of male high-rate chronic offenders in the United Kingdom specifically, then a male high-rate chronic offender on average would impose an annual cost of £18 ($29) per U.K. citizen or a lifetime cost of £742 ($1,185) per U.K. citizen (based on 2011 population estimates and regardless of age; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811424505">Central Intelligence Agency 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022427811424505">12</xref></sup></p><p>As noted, only officially recorded crimes were included and thus the cost estimates are underestimated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427811424505">Farrington et al. (2006</xref>; table 4.7) reported that the ratio of official convictions to self-reported offending over the life course for this sample was 1 to 38.7. If this ratio was applied to the male high-rate chronic group, then a male high-rate chronic offender’s “true” criminal career, on average, would impose a lifetime crime cost of £28,715 (£742 × 38.7; $45,865) per U.K. citizen or an annual crime cost of £700 ($1,118) per U.K. citizen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022427811424505">13</xref></sup> This scaling-up estimate suggests that our conviction-based estimates are a low bound estimate of the true costs of crime and that the real cost is likely to approximate the scaled-up version.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022427811424505">14</xref></sup></p><p>Several limitations need to be considered. For example, the conviction data did not include costly white-collar/corporate crimes. White-collar/corporate occupations, uncommon in this sample, are not observed among the high-rate chronic offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427811424505">Piquero, Piquero, and Farrington 2010</xref>). Also implicit in our estimates are the assumptions underlying the inputs into the cost figures across the respective crimes. One of these deals with accounting for the public’s willingness to pay for crime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022427811424505">15</xref></sup> Specifically, the cost estimates used in this study, which were derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427811424505">Brand and Price (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811424505">Dubourg and Hamed (2005)</xref>, are more similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427811424505">Cohen (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811424505">Miller et al. (1996)</xref> that account for victim (intangible) losses but not society’s willingness to pay. Once again, therefore our cost estimates are conservative. Such limitations and cautions should be kept in mind when interpreting such figures. Other costs not previously considered (psychological costs to the victim, police protection costs to the criminal justice system, and costs borne by households and communities that seek to minimize the risk of victimization) might partially explain the differences that are observed across cost-of-crime studies. Given that high-rate chronics tend also to impose costs on society because of their lack of education and employment and adverse health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811424505">Piquero, Farrington, et al. 2010</xref>), the costs of their offending also entail costs that are independent of victim and criminal justice costs. These offenders, while small in number, likely contribute even more of a financial burden than previous and current estimates suggest. Adopting prevention and intervention strategies aimed at reducing the number of high-rate chronics and/or speeding up their eventual desistance will offer many savings to the public and perhaps turn those negative costs into positive contributions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn16-0022427811424505"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn17-0022427811424505"><label>Funding</label><p>The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><fn-group><title>Notes</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0022427811424505"><label>1.</label><p>Estimated in July 1997 at 267,954,764 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact97/country-frame.html">http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact97/country-frame.html</ext-link>, accessed December 20, 2010).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0022427811424505"><label>2.</label><p>As an anonymous reviewer observed, overall cost estimates (and savings) need to be considered within a context, that is, a $200 million savings in the United States is very different from a $200 million savings in a specific city.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0022427811424505"><label>3.</label><p>Since (at least until the 1970s) conviction in London was very likely after arrest, the requirement of conviction in London does not represent a major distinction from the arrest data which is the more commonly available official record data in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811424505">Blumstein, Farrington, and Moitra 1985</xref>:194).

Thus, applying the same cost per crime regardless of whether the crime was prosecuted leads to a cost of crime which is biased upward. Another point of caution deals with the sample. To the extent that the CSDD is focused on children with socioeconomic conditions correlated with offending, then the rate of chronic offenders in the sample would be much larger than in the U.K. population as a whole, thus biasing the estimate upward.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn15-0022427811424505"><label>15.</label><p>Caution should be exercised when interpreting the degree to which the public’s willingness to pay for crime has been incorporated into the monetary estimates reported here.
