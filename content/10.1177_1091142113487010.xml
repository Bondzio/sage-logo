<p>We dedicate this special issue of <italic>Public Finance Review</italic> to the memory of our colleague and friend Michael Pickhardt. Michael passed away on October 2, 2012, after suffering from a serious illness for a longer time. With Michael, we lost a skilled, active, and respected researcher. More importantly, we lost a good, personal friend. We miss him dearly.</p>
<p>This special issue represents papers on the cutting edge of research on the shadow economy, tax evasion, and money laundering.</p>
<p>Getting individuals and firms to pay their legally due tax liabilities has been an enduring problem for government, one that has attracted increasing attention from scholars in recent years. Even so, there is much that we still do not fully understand. The existence of “tax evasion” is related to (if not the same as) the presence of the so-called “shadow economy”, also known as the underground economy, the informal sector, the black economy, the unofffical economy, and other similar names. The links between tax evasion and the shadow economy have often been recognized and examined in research. Both phenomena are also related to “money laundering.” These links are much less frequently considered, but all money earned in some way or other in the unofficial economy without paying taxes—so-called “black cash” or “illicit money”—must eventually be brought back into the official economy for buying goods and services. As a result, there is a strong connection between the shadow economy, tax evasion, and money laundering. The articles in this special issue of <italic>Public Finance Review</italic> aim at understanding the particular topics for their own sake as well as at uncovering the interrelations between the topics. They represent the latest research in these areas.</p>
<p>Earlier versions of most of these articles were presented at the conference “The Shadow Economy, Tax Evasion, and Money Laundering,” held at the Münster School of Business Administration and Economics, University of Münster, Germany, July 28–30, 2011. The articles were submitted to <italic>Public Finance Review</italic> (without any guarantee of publication), went through the regular reviewing process, and were revised in response to comments by the anonymous, external reviewers.</p>
<p>A first group of articles attempts to quantify the extent of the shadow economy. A second group uses theoretical methods to analyze some aspects of tax evasion and the underground economy with respect to fiscal policy and collusion among firms. A third group of articles is concerned with tax evasion, money laundering, and the respective flows of illicit money.</p>
<p>The first group consists of three articles. James Alm and Abel Embaye present an innovative method (i.e., dynamic panel data estimation) to assess empirically the size and development of the shadow economies of 111 countries over the period 1984–2006. Their estimates show a large variety of sizes of the shadow economy as well as their trends over time. Brugt Kazemier, Arjan Bruil, Annemieke van de Steeg, and Marieke Rensman develop novel approaches to measure the national income share of the many types of illegal economic activity in the Netherlands. Their estimates show that illicit drug manufacturing and trade is the most important of these illegal activities. Adriana AnaMaria Davidescu and Ion Dobre estimate the size of the Romanian shadow economy between 2000 and 2010, employing a currency demand approach and emphasizing the impact of unemployment. They find that the unemployment rate plays a crucial role in determining the size of the underground economy.</p>
<p>In the second group are two articles that analyze theoretically various aspects of tax evasion and the shadow economy. Francesco Busato and Bruno Chiarini study the relation between fiscal policy, tax evasion, and the underground economy in a dynamic general equilibrium model, and their analysis provides (among other things) a strong basis for the existence of a certain parameterized Laffer curve. Florian Baumann and Tim Friehe analyze the possible effects of tax evasion on the sustainability of cartels. They show that tax evasion may enhance or reduce collusion, depending on the effect of tax evasion on a firm’s profit under different circumstances.</p>
<p>The third group of articles is concerned particularly with money laundering and the flow of illicit money. Brigitte Unger provides a comprehensive review of research on money laundering, with respect to its definition, measurement, and methods to fight it; of much interest, she points to the many linkages between the shadow economy, tax evasion, and money laundering. Friedrich Schneider demonstrates the state of knowledge concerning international sources of illicit economic profits from crimes and their implications for the economy, especially the connection with the financing of terrorism. Like Unger, he relates profits of illicit activities to money laundering.</p>
<p>We would like to thank all the people who made the 2011 conference possible and contributed to its success. The revised versions of the papers presented in this issue gained not only from the review process of the journal but also from discussions at the sessions in Münster. We thank all session participants, commentators, and chairpersons for their efforts. Their support is gratefully acknowledged.</p>
<p>Again, we dedicate this special issue of <italic>Public Finance Review</italic> to the memory of Michael Pickhardt. Michael was the central person of the 2009 and 2011 conferences on the shadow economy, and he was engaged in preparing the upcoming 2013 conference. We have lost much with his passing, and we will always miss him.</p>
