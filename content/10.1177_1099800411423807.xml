<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Pregnancy-induced bone loss may be further exacerbated by activity restriction (AR). The authors compared the bone status of AR hospitalized (≥7 days) pregnant women in the third trimester to ambulatory (AM) women at the same gestational age, using a prospective cross-sectional design.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Method:</title>
<p>AR was quantified in AR women by daily step counts using a pedometer for 7 consecutive days. Bone status was evaluated in the left and right calcaneus bones of both AR (<italic>n</italic> = 13) and AM (<italic>n</italic> = 20) women using quantitative ultrasound (QUS).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>AR women took an average of 1,504 ± 1,377 steps/day. Speed of sound scores (1,543.05 ± 41.97 m/s vs. 1,569.60 ± 46.12 m/s) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) scores (107.93 ± 9.59 dB/MHz vs. 114.69 ± 17.06 dB/MHz) were not different between the AR and AM groups, respectively (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). However, bone stiffness index (SI) scores (84.0 ± 16.2 vs. 95.8 ± 22.1, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) were different between groups, indicating a greater relative risk of future fracture in the AR women.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Increased fracture risk appears to be a negative side effect incurred through an average of 16 days of hospitalized AR in late pregnancy. Further investigations using a larger sample size are necessary to evaluate the effect of antepartum AR on bone status in the postpartum period to determine if bone status is further attenuated by breastfeeding or if recovery occurs with resumption of ambulation and return of menses and to assess future risk in these women as they age. Prenatal care providers should be made aware of these risks.</p>

<p>Pregnancy induces complex adaptations in maternal bone metabolism. Combining the results from bone turnover markers, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and quantitative ultrasound (QUS) studies, evidence reveals that maternal bone metabolism undergoes the greatest adjustment in the third trimester when the maternal–fetal calcium transfer peaks, indicating that the maternal skeleton contributes to mineralization of the fetal skeleton late in pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099800411423807">Black, Topping, Durham, Farquharson, &amp; Fraser, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099800411423807">Hellmeyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099800411423807">More, Bettembuk, Bhattoa, &amp; Balogh, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1099800411423807">Paparella et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1099800411423807">Ritchie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1099800411423807">Ulrich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1099800411423807">Yamaga, Taga, Minaguchi, &amp; Sato, 1996</xref>). The demand on maternal calcium sources thus intensifies during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, as a direct result of mineralization of the fetal skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099800411423807">Kovacs, 2005</xref>). To fulfill the increased calcium requirement, there is an associated augmentation in intestinal calcium absorption; however, this maternal adaptation may not fully meet the demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1099800411423807">Ward, Adams, &amp; Mughal, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Antenatal activity restriction (AR), employed as the main treatment modality for high-risk obstetric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411423807">Maloni, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1099800411423807">Sciscione, 2010</xref>), may exacerbate pregnancy-induced bone resorption and compromise maternal bone status. Bed rest studies conducted on healthy male volunteers simulating space flight with mechanical unloading show that musculoskeletal adaptations, including rapid bone resorption, occur in response to AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411423807">Giangregorio &amp; Blimkie, 2002</xref>) within 1–2 days of the start of bed rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099800411423807">Baecker et al., 2003</xref>). In healthy men, it took at least 180 days of reambulation for the measured losses in bone mass after 56 days of bed rest to be reversed, with further work recommended to determine when the recovery process is actually complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099800411423807">Armbrecht et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While the goal of antenatal AR is a positive outcome for the developing fetus/fetuses, research indicating the lack of effectiveness in prevention of complications and demonstrating multiple negative side effects for mother and infant has challenged the continuation of its widespread use during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411423807">Maloni, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099800411423807">Maloni, Alexander, Schluchter, Shah, &amp; Park, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411423807">Maloni &amp; Schneider, 2002</xref>). A recent study of Canadian prenatal care providers suggests that, although care providers are discouraged from recommending bed rest for women at risk of preterm birth, many are still recommending this therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1099800411423807">Sprague, O’Brien, Newburn-Cook, Heaman, &amp; Nimrod, 2008</xref>). To date, only two studies have examined the combined effects of both pregnancy and AR on maternal bone health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1099800411423807">Kaji et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1099800411423807">Promislow, Hertz-Picciotto, Schramm, Watt-Morse, &amp; Anderson, 2004</xref>). Preliminary results suggest that AR may intensify bone resorption experienced late in pregnancy. The exacerbated bone loss induced by AR may increase the risk of osteoporotic fracture in this population. Furthermore, few studies have quantified AR, and no study to date has assessed the effect of antenatal AR on maternal calcaneal bone status. The purpose of this preliminary study was to compare the bone status of AR hospitalized pregnant women in the third trimester to the bone status of ambulatory (AM) pregnant women at the same gestational age using QUS. We hypothesized that bone status measures would be lower in AR high-risk hospitalized pregnant women during the third trimester compared to AM women at the same gestational age.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>We obtained ethics approval for the involvement of human subjects through the Research Ethics Board of the University of Western Ontario, and all participating women gave informed consent.</p>
<sec id="section4-1099800411423807">
<title>AR hospitalized pregnant women</title>
<p>Pregnant women in the AR group (<italic>n</italic> = 14) were in the third trimester (≥28 weeks' gestation) and were hospitalized for at least 7 days in the antenatal ward of a hospital in London, Canada. We included women with singleton, twins, or triplets and those who were experiencing placenta previa, shortened/open cervix, premature rupture of membranes, preterm labor, and other conditions that required bed rest for longer than 7 days. We excluded women who had severe preeclampsia (risk of immediate delivery), metabolic bone disease, hyper- or hypothyroidism, Cushing’s disease, or anemia or who took medication known to interfere with bone metabolism, were hospitalized for a condition known to cause a short hospital stay (such as infections), or had been extremely physically active prior to bed rest. We defined AR as hospitalized bed rest with bathroom privileges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1099800411423807">
<title>AM pregnant control women</title>
<p>We approached AM pregnant women (<italic>n</italic> = 20) in the third trimester (≥28 weeks' gestation) in the waiting room of the Women’s Health Clinic at the same hospital in London, Canada. We collected data once, while women were waiting for their obstetric appointments.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-1099800411423807">
<title>Questionnaires</title>
<p>We used a health and activity history questionnaire to collect general prepregnancy information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099800411423807">Campbell &amp; Mottola, 2001</xref>), including previous medical conditions or diseases, history of bone fractures, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and activity habits prior to pregnancy. We defined being active as performing a minimum of 30 min of moderate-intensity activity (perspiration and breathing rate above normal) at least 3 times per week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411423807">Artal &amp; O’Toole, 2003</xref>). We also obtained information regarding the gestational age at time of AR/hospitalization, reason for AR/hospitalization, and current medications.</p>
<p>Women in both groups completed the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099800411423807">Chasan-Taber et al., 2004</xref>) to quantify activity during pregnancy prior to the AR group being hospitalized. The questionnaire asks women to estimate the time spent participating in 32 activities in the categories of household/caregiving (13 activities), occupational (5 activities), sports/exercise (8 activities), transportation (3 activities), and inactivity (3 activities). For each activity, participants select the category that best approximates the amount of time spent participating per day or per week during their current trimester of pregnancy. The amount of time is multiplied by the respective metabolic equivalent (MET) intensity to calculate the average weekly energy expenditure (MET·hr/week) attributable to each activity. The value for each of the 32 activities is summed to derive average MET hr per week for total activity.</p>
<p>In addition, women completed the Bone Loading History Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411423807">Dolan, Williams, Ainsworth, &amp; Shaw, 2006</xref>), which details the history of weight-bearing exercise since age 18 in order to calculate a score of recent hip and spine bone loading units. Participants report the number of years of participation, the season of participation (spring, summer, fall, and winter), and the frequency of participation (1–3 times a month, 1–2 times a week, 3–5 times a week, and &gt;5 times a week) for each type of exercise or physical activity recorded. A list of activities is provided with the questionnaire to assist with recall. Spine and hip bone loading units are averaged to generate a bone loading unit for each activity and then summed across activities to give the total bone loading exposure over the reference period. This value is then adjusted for age of participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411423807">Dolan et al., 2006</xref>). Questionnaire scores had a significant correlation with femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) and good test–retest reliability (spine <italic>r</italic> = .89 and hip <italic>r</italic> = .92) in premenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411423807">Dolan et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1099800411423807">
<title>Pedometer and Pedometer Log</title>
<p>Hospitalized women wore a pedometer (Accusplit, Eagle™ 120 Activity Pedometer) secured to a waistband for 7 consecutive days to define the current restriction of bed rest. We have used pedometer assessment previously and have found step counts to be a reliable measure of physical activity in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1099800411423807">Tomkins, Mottola, &amp; Giroux, 2007</xref>). Participants reset the pedometer to 0 upon awaking in the morning and recorded total daily steps at the end of each day. Participants also noted the number of times they were out of bed in the pedometer log, along with a brief description of the ensuing activity (e.g., bathroom). We did not obtain step counts for the AM group in the present study. However, we previously analyzed step counts in AM pregnant women in the third trimester and reported an average of 6,495 ± 2,282 steps/day (<italic>N</italic> = 19; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1099800411423807">Tomkins et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1099800411423807">
<title>Three-Day Dietary Intake Record</title>
<p>During the same 7 consecutive days in which they wore the pedometer, we asked the AR women to collect hospital menus and record all items consumed following each meal for 3 consecutive days (2 days during the week and 1 day on the weekend) to determine factors that influence bone status (total energy, calcium, and vitamin D intake). AR women recorded the food item description (from hospital or elsewhere), method of preparation, and time and place eaten and estimated the amount consumed with reference to household measures. Dietary intake included all food and liquid consumption. We analyzed the 3-day dietary intake records using the Food Processor<sup>®</sup> structured query language (SQL) version 9.8.1 (ESHA Research 2006, Professional Nutrition Analysis Software). We have previously used this methodology in AR women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1099800411423807">Tomkins et al., 2007</xref>), and 3-day dietary intake records have been shown to accurately represent the usual intake for each subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1099800411423807">Kolar et al., 2005</xref>). We did not conduct 3-day dietary intake analyses in the AM group because we met participants in this group only once.</p>

<sec id="section10-1099800411423807">
<title>QUS</title>
<p>A trained technician took all bone status measurements at both the left and the right calcaneus bones using an ultrasonometer (Achilles InSight, GE Lunar Corp, Madison, WI). The QUS sends high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) through the bone tissue and generates a series of measurements reflecting the physical properties of the bone. It does not use ionizing radiation and is safe to use on pregnant women. Speed of sound (SOS) measures the velocity of the sound wave traveling through bone in meters per second (m/s) and is influenced by the elasticity (deformation/reformation) and density of bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411423807">Malavolta, Mule, &amp; Frigato, 2004</xref>). Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) measures the energy loss of the sound wave passing through bone in decibels per megahertz (dB/MHz) and is influenced by diffraction (bending of the sound wave), scattering (dispersion of the sound wave), and absorption (retention of the sound wave) in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411423807">Malavolta et al., 2004</xref>). SOS and BUA can be combined to form a clinical measure called the stiffness index (SI), which is an estimate of fracture risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1099800411423807">Lewiecki, Richmond, &amp; Miller, 2006</xref>). All QUS measurements took place during the months of May and June. In the AR group, we took these measurements sometime during the 7-day period in which women were wearing pedometers. In the AM group, we took these measurements at the time they filled out the questionnaires.</p>
<p>The technician performed quality assurance checks prior to patient scanning by completing a test scan using a manufacturer-provided phantom cylinder. Data were immediately analyzed by the Achilles InSight software program to generate a series of measurements reflecting the physical properties of the patient’s bone including SOS scores, BUA, and SI. The precision errors were 4 m/s and 2 dB/MHz for the SOS and BUA measurements, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411423807">GE Medical Systems Lunar Corporation, 2001</xref>). The SI was constructed by normalizing the SOS and BUA through subtraction of the lowest observable values (1,380 m/s and 50 dB/MHz, respectively) from each observed value and then adding the resultant normalized SOS and BUA values. The formula is SI = (0.67 · BUA + 0.28 · SOS) – 420 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411423807">GE Medical Systems Lunar Corporation, 2001</xref>). Typical values for SOS, BUA, and SI in trabecular bone of a healthy young adult female aged 20–35 are 1,560 m/s, 125 dB/MHz, and 100, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411423807">GE Medical Systems Lunar Corporation, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1099800411423807">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>We used statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 16.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) to perform statistical analyses. We compared participant characteristics and scores on the Bone Loading History Questionnaire and Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire between the AR group and the AM group using a Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> nonparametric test. We used the same test to evaluate QUS measures (SI, SOS, BUA, and the associated <italic>Z</italic> score, and <italic>T-</italic>score) for differences between the left and right calcaneus bones and found no significant differences. We therefore combined left and right calcaneus bone measures for each parameter (SI, SOS, BUA, <italic>Z</italic> score, and <italic>T-</italic>score) and reassessed between the AR group and the AM group using a Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> nonparametric test. Statistical significance was accepted as <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Values are presented as mean ±<italic>SD</italic>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 14 AR hospitalized pregnant women in the third trimester completed the QUS component of the study. However, one had extreme activity levels prior to AR, and we did not include her data in the analyses. Of the 13 remaining women, 11 were Caucasian, 1 was African American, and 1 was of Aboriginal descent. The high-risk conditions necessitating AR included placenta previa (<italic>n</italic> = 3 singleton), shortened/open cervix (<italic>n</italic> = 4:2 singleton, 1 twin, and 1 triplet), premature ruptured membranes (<italic>n</italic> = 3 singleton), threat of preterm labor (<italic>n</italic> = 2:1 singleton, 1 twin), and fetal superventricular tachycardia (<italic>n</italic> = 1 singleton). In the AM group, 20 women in the third trimester completed the QUS component of the study (19 were Caucasian and 1 was Lebanese), and all had uncomplicated singleton pregnancies.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1099800411423807">Table 1</xref> shows baseline characteristics for the participants.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study is the first to employ calcaneal QUS to examine the effect of AR during the third trimester on bone status in high-risk hospitalized pregnant women. The SI and its associated <italic>Z</italic> score and <italic>T-</italic>score measures of bone status were significantly lower in the high-risk pregnant women following an average of 16 days of AR compared to AM women of the same gestational age. SI estimates the risk of osteoporotic fracture, with no absolute demarcation for increased risk of fracture at a given SI. Rather a continuous gradient of risk is associated with the SI values generated by QUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411423807">GE Medical Systems Lunar Corporation, 2001</xref>). The <italic>Z</italic> score and <italic>T-</italic>score represent the relationship of the SI score to an age-matched population mean and a reference young population mean, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1099800411423807">Siris et al., 2004</xref>). The results of the current study suggest that there is a greater relative risk of fracture among the AR women as well as increased risk of susceptibility to falls and resultant morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099800411423807">Brahm, Mallmin, Michaelsson, Strom, &amp; Ljunghall, 1998</xref>). In addition, the fact that the SI of the AR group fell below the age-matched and young population means may be of clinical significance because prepregnancy and pregnancy activity patterns and adult weight-bearing bone loading stimulus, all of which may influence bone status, were not significantly different between the groups prior to hospitalization in the AR women. Thus, it appears that AR altered bone status during pregnancy. This finding warrants further longitudinal assessment as these women age. Because recovery from bone loss during the postpartum period may be further attenuated by breastfeeding, it is also important to determine if bone loss recovers with resuming postpartum ambulation and return of menses, which is currently unknown for women in this life stage.</p>
<p>The SI measurements of the AM group in the present study (<italic>M</italic> = 95.8 ± 22.1) compare favorably to those researchers reported in a recent pilot study exploring the SI measures of the left and right calcaneus bones of pregnant tennis players and control pregnant women at 33–36 weeks' gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099800411423807">Dimov, Khoury, &amp; Tsang, 2010</xref>). The mean SI value when both groups of left and right calcaneus bones were pooled together (<italic>N</italic> = 34) was 90.4, although the tennis players consistently scored higher than control women. Further investigation is required, as weight-bearing exercise may have a protective effect on the bone losses usually found in late pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1099800411423807">Paparella et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>About one third of women in each group engaged in a minimum of 30 min of moderate intensity activity at least 3 times per week before pregnancy. Although we did not assess bone status prior to conception in the current study, it can be reasonably assumed from the similar prepregancy physical activity levels and bone-loading stimulus results that the AR and AM groups had comparable bone statuses at the onset of pregnancy. During pregnancy (before hospitalization in the AR women), both groups reported a similar physical activity pattern in MET·hr/week. However, during hospitalization and AR, the mean daily total step count was only 1,503.5 ± 1,377.4 steps/day, similar to the mean step count reported in our previous study for 16 AR pregnant women in the third trimester (1,579 ± 936 steps/day; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1099800411423807">Tomkins et al., 2007</xref>) and significantly less than the step count reported for 19 AM women of the same gestational age (6,495 ± 2,282 steps/day). After reviewing the evidence related to public health issues, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1099800411423807">Tudor-Locke and Bassett (2004)</xref> proposed classifications for pedometer-determined physical activity in healthy adults, suggesting &lt;5,000 steps/day as an index for a sedentary lifestyle. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1099800411423807">Welk et al. (2000)</xref> suggested taking 10,000 steps/day for increased health benefits in the general population. Individuals with disabilities and chronic diseases walk 3,500–5,500 steps/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1099800411423807">Tudor-Locke &amp; Myers, 2001</xref>), which is substantially higher than the amount of steps our group of AR women walked during hospitalization. Thus, the reduced number of daily steps taken by AR hospitalized pregnant women may potentially place them at risk of chronic health problems, such as a decrease in BMD. Lower maternal activity resulting from deconditioning and hospitalization, without treatment or rehabilitation, may result in bone loss, muscle atrophy, and cardiovascular risks that are not likely to return to previous capacity. However, these women may also have the greatest potential to benefit from some type of physical activity intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099800411423807">Dimov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1099800411423807">Tudor-Locke &amp; Bassett, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results are consistent with those of other studies that measured bone turnover. While we investigated maternal calcaneal bone status using QUS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1099800411423807">Promislow et al. (2004)</xref> measured trabecular bone loss during pregnancy bed rest using DXA at the radius and ulna. AR pregnant women had a 4.6% mean reduction in ultradistal BMD from the second to the third trimester, compared with a 1.5% mean loss in AM pregnant women at the same site. Although the authors measured nonweight-bearing bones, they suggested that AR women may have lost even more bone in weight-bearing regions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1099800411423807">Kaji et al. (2007)</xref> examined the effect of bed rest during pregnancy on bone resorption markers. Urinary concentrations of both N-telopeptide (NTx) and C-telopeptide (CTx), breakdown products of Type I collagen, were significantly higher at 30 and 34 weeks' gestation in AR pregnant women than in a control group of AM late pregnant women. The authors did not quantify AR, nor did they investigate dietary intake. In addition, all women in their study were hospitalized for risk of preterm birth. In spite of the limitations, taken together, these studies suggest that BMD of trabecular bone decreases to a greater extent, and bone resorption increases to a higher degree, as a result of AR during the third trimester of pregnancy. The current study results supplement the existing literature by suggesting that risk of bone fracture is also heightened subsequent to AR during this period.</p>
<p>SOS and BUA measures of bone status were not significantly different between the AR and the AM groups in the present study. Both SOS and BUA reflect structural properties of bone including its elasticity, density, and the amount of diffraction, scattering, and absorption in the bone tissue. While these factors are important determinants of bone strength, individually they do not provide as much information as the SI, which is a function of SOS and BUA combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099800411423807">Guglielmi, Adams, &amp; Link, 2009</xref>). In support of this statement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099800411423807">Hadji et al. (1999)</xref> showed that the SI was significantly better in identifying women with osteoporotic fractures than SOS or BUA alone and encourage the use of SI as a diagnostic measure. Furthermore, fracture risk as measured by QUS at the calcaneus shows a significant association between heel QUS and fracture prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099800411423807">Guglielmi et al., 2009</xref>). The present study also adds to the growing body of evidence pointing to QUS as an inexpensive, portable, user-friendly, radiation-free alternative to DXA scans for predicting fracture risk but not for diagnosing osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099800411423807">Hans &amp; Krieg, 2008</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that QUS provides additional information on fracture risk beyond that produced by a BMD scan due to the fact that changes in ultrasound passing through bone are qualitatively different than those occurring when ionizing radiation interacts with bone. BMD depends on the chemical composition of the tissue, whereas fracture risk depends not only on the bone density but also on the structure of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411423807">Fuerst, Gluer, &amp; Genant, 1995</xref>). QUS provides measurements reflecting physical properties of bone that can give supplementary information for the assessment of bone quality and strength that DXA analysis, alone, cannot provide.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Among the women in the present study, three in the AR group and one in the AM group had gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). While GDM has traditionally been labeled as an exclusion criterion in bone density research, findings of a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1099800411423807">To and Wong (2008</xref>) evaluating whether or not the presence of GDM impacts BMD suggest that may not be warranted. Following linear regression analysis, the effect of GDM status on BMD alterations was negligible, while high prepregnancy BMD, high early pregnancy BMI, and greater fat accumulation during pregnancy had the most influence on BMD loss. The authors concluded that the diabetic state should be rejected as a significant factor influencing BMD. Although we did not assess prepregnancy bone status in the present study, prepregnancy BMI and body mass gain were comparable between the groups. In addition to GDM, two of the women in the AR group had Type 1 diabetes. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1099800411423807">Strotmeyer, Cauley, Orchard, Steenkiste, and Dorman (2006)</xref>, premenopausal women with Type 1 diabetes had 3–8% lower BMD and 15% lower calcaneal BUA compared with control women. Despite there being no significant differences in bone status parameters between AR women with or without Type 1 diabetes in the present study, we note the inclusion of these two women as a limitation.</p>
<p>We also note the following additional limitations. Since we saw the AM women in the present study only once, we did not ask them to complete a 3-day dietary intake record. Because all women in the AM group had the same obstetricians and, presumably, the same access to prenatal care, we assumed that they were receiving the same advice on healthy eating. Also, body mass at the time of QUS assessment was the same between the AM and AR groups. In addition, we did not assess caffeine intake in either group. However, a recent review suggested that the negative effect of consuming caffeine-containing beverages on BMD and fracture risk may be partly explained by an inverse relationship between the consumption of milk and the consumption of caffeine-containing beverages and that high caffeine intake is often a marker of low calcium intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1099800411423807">Heaney, 2002</xref>). Although previous oral birth control intake, parity, and number of women who breastfed did not differ between groups, the spacing between pregnancies, a variable we did not explore, may be an important factor for BMD. It may be, however, that the lack of significant difference in the ages of the groups indicates that the spacing of pregnancies were similar between them. One last potential limitation is the seasonality of the study. We took the QUS measurements in May and June. If we had performed these measurements in another season, it is possible that they would reflect seasonal differences relating to vitamin D resorption and bone status.</p>
<p>One more issue warrants caution in interpreting our study findings. Pregnant women carrying multiple fetuses are commonly prescribed antenatal AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099800411423807">Crowther, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411423807">Maloni, 2010</xref>). Of the women in the AR group, three had multiples, two twin, and one triplet. Research is limited surrounding the impact of multiple gestations on maternal bone metabolism, with one recent study suggesting that bone metabolism changes in women carrying twins are different from those in women with a singleton pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1099800411423807">Nakayama et al., 2011</xref>). The three women carrying multiples in the current study did not show significantly lower bone status measures compared to the other AR women in the group; however, the influence of multiple gestations must be taken into account when interpreting the results of the current study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Not only do women experience bone loss late in uncomplicated pregnancies, but postpartum women who breastfeed experience compounded bone resorption, as lactation heightens calcium demand even further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099800411423807">Kovacs, 2005</xref>). Yet, research on bone metabolism changes throughout both pregancy and lactation has shown that bone status is able to recover to baseline levels following the resumption of menses, such that even pregnancy and lactation combined confer no long-term detrimental effects on maternal bone health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099800411423807">Kovacs, 2005</xref>). No studies, however, have followed bone health throughout high-risk AR pregnancy and subsequent lactation to determine whether or not bone status is able to recover from the augmented bone loss observed in this population postweaning. If bone status is, in fact, unable to recover, AR women may have increased susceptibility to osteoporotic fracture and the resulting consequences for long-term morbidity and mortality. Studies evaluating bone rebound following lactation subsequent to an AR pregnancy are, therefore, critical, as studies in men have indicated that even after 180 days of reambulation from 56 days of bed rest, bone status may not be entirely reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099800411423807">Armbrecht et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings in the present study showed that an average of 16 days of AR during the third trimester was sufficient to induce a significant increase in the risk of fracture in high-risk hospitalized women compared to AM women of the same gestational age. Late pregnancy and mechanical unloading may have accelerated bone resorption in the AR group. The study also adds to a growing body of work showing that calcaneal QUS is a feasible technique to use during pregnancy, does not induce risk to the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099800411423807">Martina et al., 2010</xref>), and provides additional measures of bone quality, structure, and fracture risk. Future study and longitudinal follow-up are necessary to evaluate the future risk factors for AR women in the postpartum period and as they age. Prenatal care providers should be aware of these risks.</p>
