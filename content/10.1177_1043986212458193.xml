<abstract>
<p>Gangs remain a problem across the country. American Indian communities started to see increased gang activity in the 1990s. Despite this, there is little information on American Indian gangs in the literature. This article provides an overview of the characteristics of American Indian gang members and gangs from a Western American Indian reservation community. Utilizing survey responses from 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th graders, the authors explore the characteristics of American Indian gangs, the members who belong to these groups, and the risk factors that differentiate those individuals who become involved in gangs in tribal communities from youth who do not. This study contributes to the overall understanding of gangs and provides additional knowledge regarding American Indian gangs to help target law enforcement, prevention, and intervention services.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Racial and ethnic minority status has long been linked with gang membership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043986212458193">Chin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043986212458193">Hagedorn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043986212458193">Moore, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986212458193">Vigil, 1988</xref>). However, in the wake of considerable gang problems in urban areas, especially in African American and Hispanic communities, research and media accounts have focused on these populations to the virtual exclusion of other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986212458193">Decker &amp; Van Winkle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043986212458193">Fleisher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043986212458193">Hagedorn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043986212458193">Moore, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986212458193">Vigil, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986212458193">2002</xref>). Consequently, gang membership among American Indian populations is often overlooked, with fewer studies examining Native gangs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986212458193">Armstrong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986212458193">Bell &amp; Lim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986212458193">Donnermeyer, Edwards, Chavez, &amp; Beauvais, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986212458193">Hailer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458193">Henderson, Kunitz, &amp; Levy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major, Egley, Howell, Mendenhall, &amp; Armstrong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043986212458193">McNulty &amp; Bellair, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986212458193">Mendenhall &amp; Armstrong, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986212458193">Theriot &amp; Parker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986212458193">Whitbeck, Hoyt, Chen, &amp; Stubben, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043986212458193">Wyrick, 2000</xref>). These studies demonstrate that American Indian communities are not immune to problems associated with gang activity, such as tagging, increased levels of violence, and the use of firearms.</p>
<p>Law enforcement statistics suggest that gangs began to be problematic in American Indian communities in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major et al., 2004</xref>). By 2000, 23% of law enforcement agencies serving tribal communities reported having active youth gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major et al., 2004</xref>). It has been estimated “that there are over 4,500 gang members in about 375 gangs” on or near tribal lands, with larger communities reporting more gangs and gang members than smaller communities (Goldblatt, 1998, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986212458193">Pridemore, 2004</xref>, p. 52).</p>
<p>Although gangs are seemingly problematic for tribal communities, a paucity of data exists regarding American Indian gangs and gang members. Furthermore, the existing data on American Indian gang membership rely primarily on interviews with community members or stakeholders and law enforcement data, not on information directly from youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458193">Henderson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, much of this research is based on data from Navajo gangs, ignoring possible intertribal differences. Thus, our knowledge regarding Native gangs remains limited, calling into question our ability to develop effective policies to address gangs in American Indian communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458193">Henderson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986212458193">Mendenhall &amp; Armstrong, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986212458193">Nielson, Zion, &amp; Hailer, 1998</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1043986212458193">
<title>American Indian Gangs and Gang Members</title>
<p>The available research indicates that Native gangs are similar in many ways to African American and Latino urban gangs around which the contemporary gang literature is organized. American Indian gang members are primarily between the age group of 12 and 24 years, with most aged below 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458193">Grant &amp; Feimer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major et al., 2004</xref>). Law enforcement data suggest that American Indian gangs differ from more traditional urban gangs along gender lines: Approximately 20% of American Indian gang members are female as opposed to more traditional law enforcement estimates of about 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043986212458193">Egley, Howell, &amp; Major, 2006</xref>). However, this finding comports with self-report data that indicate a higher level of female involvement (i.e., 20%-50%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986212458193">Esbensen, Deschenes, &amp; Winfree, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458193">Esbensen &amp; Huizinga, 1993</xref>). As is the case regarding the gang composition of youth gangs in general, American Indian gangs tend to be mixed gender groups (82%) and are racially and ethnically mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with general gang research, American Indian gangs and gang members engage in a variety of delinquent activities. The crimes of choice among most American Indian gang members are theft, graffiti, vandalism, burglary, drug sales, and aggravated assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986212458193">Hailer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043986212458193">Major &amp; Egley, 2002</xref>). This involvement suggests a lack of specialization and instead reflects what Klein refers to as “cafeteria style” delinquency. In addition, American Indian gangs also spend a considerable amount of time partying and hanging out, mirroring the dominant activities of non-Native gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458193">Henderson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458193">Klein, 1995</xref>). Finally, American Indian gangs tend to be rather unstructured with a lack of cohesion and formal leadership, similar to most other youth gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986212458193">Decker, Bynum, &amp; Weisel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043986212458193">Fleisher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458193">Grant &amp; Feimer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458193">Klein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986212458193">Theriot &amp; Parker, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>American Indian gangs also possess a number of unique characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986212458193">Theriot &amp; Parker, 2007</xref>). They tend to participate in less violence than other traditional gangs. Gang-related homicides are rare among American Indian gangs, and firearms are seldom used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major et al., 2004</xref>), yet there is some indication that some gun use among American Indian gang youth contributes to violence in these communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458193">Joseph &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>American Indian gangs closer to urban areas tend to have higher rates of violence and delinquency than more rural gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043986212458193">Robbins &amp; Alexander, 1985</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986212458193">Hailer, 2008</xref>). This urban proximity has also been linked to the actual development of gangs in American Indian communities, representing a similar, yet unique, process from other mainstream gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986212458193">Whitbeck et al., 2002</xref>). In many Native communities, a constant stream of individuals moving back and forth between the reservation and urban areas is linked to gang development, as “gang migration” results from families relocating from one community to another and bringing the gang subculture with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986212458193">Armstrong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986212458193">Donnermeyer et al,. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986212458193">Maxson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986212458193">Mendenhall &amp; Armstrong, n.d</xref>.). This process of gang diffusion is similar to gang migration reported by Maxson and replicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043986212458193">Egley and Ritz (2006)</xref> using data from the National Youth Gang Survey. Many law enforcement and members of American Indian communities feel that American Indian youth gangs are influenced in this way by urban street gangs or by gangs outside of their immediate environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986212458193">Hailer &amp; Hart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458193">Henderson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986212458193">Mendenhall &amp; Armstrong, n.d</xref>.). While there is some evidence that American Indian youth are influenced by urban street gangs such as the Crips, Bloods, Latin Kings, and Banditos, most American Indian gangs are homegrown, created by individuals in their immediate environment, and reflected in characteristics related to their heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458193">Grant &amp; Feimer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986212458193">Hailer &amp; Hart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986212458193">Maxson, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Factors Influencing Gang Membership Among American Indian Youth</title>
<p>Most gang development among American Indians has been tied to the social and economic conditions of reservation communities, which are not that dissimilar from inner cities or the barrios where other gangs have developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986212458193">Hailer &amp; Hart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458193">Joseph &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986212458193">Mendenhall &amp; Armstrong, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986212458193">Theriot &amp; Parker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986212458193">Whitbeck et al., 2002</xref>). Factors such as difficult economic conditions and poverty, discrimination, exclusion from mainstream society, marginalization, hopelessness, negative social influences, and disorganized communities marked by multiple social problems contribute to what Vigil refers to as “multiple marginality.” This marginalization from dominant society occurs on a number of different levels, resulting in the street socialization of youth in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986212458193">Vigil, 1988</xref>). Tribal communities are located in some of the poorest areas of the country; American Indian unemployment rates are 4 to 5 times higher than mainstream society, contributing to economic strain in many of these communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458193">Grant &amp; Feimer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458193">Joseph &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>American Indian communities also have a unique history in the United States, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986212458193">Vigil (1988)</xref> argues should be considered when examining the motivating factors for youth joining gangs. American Indians are a historically oppressed population, having endured forced migration, assimilation, and continuing racism. The lasting effects of this history are feelings of social isolation, exclusion, and frustration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986212458193">Theriot &amp; Parker, 2007</xref>). As a result, American Indian youth often experience cultural conflict. Some researchers have suggested that these youths develop an “identity crisis” that pulls them between “mainstream” and Native culture; one adaptation to this identity crisis is becoming involved in gang life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986212458193">Hailer &amp; Hart, 1999</xref>). Other research indicates that for some Native youth, gangs grew out of drinking groups that developed in response to culture change and the difficulty of transitioning to adulthood, while for others there was an identification with “gangsta” culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986212458193">Armstrong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458193">Henderson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986212458193">Mendenhall &amp; Armstrong, n.d</xref>.). Although certain tribes have maintained ceremonies marking the transition from childhood to adulthood for females, ceremonies for males have largely disappeared, creating a void filled by gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458193">Henderson et al., 1999</xref>). The lack of connection with traditional culture, similar to Vigil’s views on Hispanic gang formation, remains a dominant theme for gang involvement among Native groups.</p>
<p>In addition to links to economics and culture, the available research finds gang membership among American Indian youth associated with a number of common risk factors for gang involvement, including those in the family, school, and peer domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986212458193">Esbensen, Peterson, Taylor, &amp; Freng, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986212458193">Hailer &amp; Hart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458193">Joseph &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986212458193">Theriot &amp; Parker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043986212458193">Thornberry, Krohn, Lizotte, Smith, &amp; Tobin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986212458193">Whitbeck et al., 2002</xref>). Family risk factors include female-headed households, maternal antisocial behavior, poor attachment, family dysfunction, and families that move on and off the reservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458193">Joseph &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986212458193">Theriot &amp; Parker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986212458193">Whitbeck et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, American Indian youth are particularly likely to join gangs through connection from family members, especially their cousins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986212458193">Hailer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986212458193">Mendenhall &amp; Armstrong, n.d</xref>.).</p>
<p>Poor school performance and school adjustment issues are also closely tied with gang membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458193">Joseph &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986212458193">Whitbeck et al., 2002</xref>). Delinquency, drug use and sales, violence, and negative peer influences are also primary factors associated with gang involvement among American Indian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986212458193">Donnermeyer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458193">Joseph &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986212458193">Whitbeck et al., 2002</xref>). Other variables related to gang membership among American Indians include age, number of life transitions or negative life events in the past year (such as the number of moves in a year, changes in schools, or the death of a close relative), cluster housing rather than traditional housing, and perceived discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986212458193">Henderson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458193">Joseph &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986212458193">Mendenhall &amp; Armstrong, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986212458193">Whitbeck et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, the growing body of literature describing characteristics of American Indian gang members and risk factors for joining paints a picture not too dissimilar from the general gang literature. The current research aims to expand the literature by further exploring the characteristics of American Indian gangs and the individuals who join, as well as the factors that influence gang involvement in a previously unstudied Native nation. Specifically, we provide a descriptive account of the characteristics of American Indian gangs and gang members, including their activities, gang size and organizational structure, as well as the reasons given for joining.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To examine the prevalence and factors associated with American Indian gangs and gang membership, anonymous surveys were administered to 6th-, 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students attending school in a non-Navajo Western American Indian reservation community during the spring of 2007. To assess youths’ involvement in and exposure to gangs in their communities, the questionnaire included items measuring demographics, attitudes, involvement in prosocial and delinquent activities, as well as violence and gangs. We used a passive parental consent procedure approved by the school district. Consent forms were sent to the parents of students in these grades with the school newsletter; no parents refused their child’s participation. Prior to survey administration, students also signed an assent form acknowledging that they understood the survey process and that their responses were voluntary and anonymous. Once these forms were collected, questionnaires were distributed. The researcher read the questions aloud to the students. Upon completion, students were given a small reward for participating.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1043986212458193">
<title>Gang Membership</title>
<p>We rely on research verifying simple self-nomination as a robust measure of gang involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986212458193">Esbensen, Winfree, He, &amp; Taylor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043986212458193">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we simply asked individuals to identify whether they had ever been a gang member.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1043986212458193">
<title>Demographic</title>
<p>We included a number of demographic variables in the analysis based on previous research, including age, gender, and family structure. Respondents were asked to indicate who lived with them on a regular basis. Since single-parent families often serve as a risk factor and connections with extended family have been tied to gang membership among American Indians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986212458193">Hailer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986212458193">Mendenhall &amp; Armstrong, n.d</xref>.), we separated this variable into four separate categories: (a) two-parent families, (b) single-parent families regardless of whether extended family was present, (c) step-parent families, and (d) exclusively extended family structures, which included families led by grandparents or aunts and/or uncles, among others. We measured school achievement by asking students what their grades were like last year. Finally, respondents also indicated whether any family members, including siblings, parents, or cousins, were gang members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1043986212458193">
<title>Gang Member Characteristics</title>
<p>One focus of this research involves examining the characteristics of gang members and the gangs to which they belong. To assess individual gang members’ characteristics, respondents were asked their age when they joined the gang, their crime victimization, as well as their individual involvement in delinquency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1043986212458193">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1043986212458193">
<title>Reasons for Joining the Gang</title>
<p>Participants were also asked to indicate the reasons they joined the gang, such as for fun, respect, protection, money, because a family member was in the gang, or whether they were forced to join. Respondents were permitted to indicate multiple reasons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1043986212458193">
<title>Gang Characteristics</title>
<p>Gang characteristics included questions regarding the number of members in the gang, the gender composition of the gang, and the involvement of individuals’ gangs in delinquency. To assess the organization of their gang, participants were asked a number of questions related to whether their gang had symbols or colors, established leaders, specific rules or codes, initiation rites, specific roles, and/or regular meetings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1043986212458193">
<title>Factors Associated With Gang Membership</title>
<p>A second focus of this research was to investigate those factors related to gang membership among American Indian youth. For this analysis, a number of scales were created to measure risk factors previously identified as related to American Indian gang membership. Individual-level mean substitution was utilized for those individuals who had minimal missing data (only one missing data point), and those with significant missing data were coded as missing. Unless otherwise noted, the individual items consisted of a 5-point scale with responses ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section12-1043986212458193">
<title>Individual factors</title>
<p>Individual factors included measures of cultural identity, social isolation, and guilt. Cultural identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986212458193">Taylor, Casten, Flickinger, Robers, &amp; Fulmore, 1994</xref>) examined how participants felt about their ethnic group and included questions, such as “I feel a strong attachment toward my own ethnic group” and “I feel good about my cultural or ethnic background.” Social isolation was gauged by assessing how lonely the individual felt in a variety of circumstances such as with friends, family, and at school. The guilt scale determined how guilty or badly the respondent would feel for participating in a variety of activities ranging from skipping school without an excuse to taking a handgun to school. Responses were based on a 3-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>not very guilty/bad</italic> to 3 = <italic>very guilty/bad</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1043986212458193">
<title>Family factors</title>
<p>Family factors included parental monitoring and parental attitudes toward deviance. Parental monitoring was measured with questions like, “My parents/guardians know where I am when I am not at home or school” and “My parents/guardians know who I am with if I am not at home.” Questions assessing parental attitudes toward deviance asked how wrong their parents/guardians would regard their participation in a number of activities ranging from skipping school to belonging to a gang. This scale consisted of responses ranging from 1 = <italic>very wrong</italic> to 4 = <italic>not wrong at all</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1043986212458193">
<title>School factor</title>
<p>School commitment represents a documented risk factor for joining gangs. This measure consisted of seven questions such as “I like school” and “Grades are very important to me.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1043986212458193">
<title>Peer factors</title>
<p>The peer factors included measures of both pro-social and delinquent friends. Respondents were asked how many of their friends were involved in a variety of activities, including “getting along well with teachers and adults at school,” “almost always obeyed school rules,” to “dropped out of school,” and “hit someone with the idea of hurting them.” Responses ranged from 1 = <italic>none of them</italic> to 4 = <italic>all of them</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1043986212458193">
<title>Community factors</title>
<p>Community factors included a measure of neighborhood stability assessed by questions such as “I like my neighborhood” and “Most of the residents in my neighborhood have lived there for more than three years” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043986212458193">Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention [OJJDP], 2002</xref>). Neighborhood environment investigated the presence of characteristics such as rundown buildings, violence, and gangs in the neighborhood to which participants indicated whether these issues <italic>were not a problem</italic> (1), <italic>somewhat of a problem</italic> (2), or <italic>a big problem</italic> (3).</p>

<title>Results</title>

<title>Sample Characteristics</title>
<p>A total of 106 students were surveyed across the 4 grades, and 96 (91%) reported being Native American/American Indian. Three additional cases were excluded due to inconsistent data on the various gang variables, resulting in a final sample of 93 individuals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043986212458193">Table 1</xref>). The sample included more males (53%) than females (47%). Most individuals indicated that they lived in either intact (32%) or single-parent households (36%), with an additional 12% living in stepparent households and 21% living exclusively with extended family members. Adult employment and parental highest education were included as proxies for economic status but proved not to be extremely useful due to missing data and lack of variability. When asked whether at least one adult in the house was employed, students overwhelmingly (96%) reported “yes.” About a fourth of the individuals did not know the educational level of their parents, and of those that did, the majority (71%) stated that at least one parent completed some education beyond high school. An additional 19% reported that their parent had completed high school. Students also indicated active involvement in school, with 77% reporting that they receive mostly Bs and Cs as grades and 11% achieving mostly As.</p>

<title>American Indian Gang Member Characteristics</title>
<p>More than one fourth (27%) of the sample reported that they either currently or had been a gang member at some point; henceforth, we refer to these individuals as “gang members.” The majority of gang members identified themselves as male (60%), with females representing 40% of gang members (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043986212458193">Table 1</xref>). Most respondents (79%) joined the gang before the age of 13, most commonly at age 10 (42%). Significant differences do appear between gang and nongang members when examining family structure. Nongang members reported mainly coming from intact (37%) or single-parent families (39%). On the other hand, only (16%) of gang members came from intact parent families, but 40% came from exclusively extended family structures. Two thirds (67%) of gang members also reported that a family member belonged to a gang, representing a significant difference from nongang members. However, nongang members also have a considerable tie to gang membership through family, with 35% indicating gang members in their family.</p>
<p>Gang and nongang members alike were involved in a variety of delinquent activities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043986212458193">Table 2</xref>). Gang members were significantly more involved in delinquency than nongang members. Specifically, gang members (48%) were more likely to be arrested and more involved in burglary (28%) than nongang members. About one third (32%) of gang members reported committing assault compared to only 11% of nongang members. Approximately half (48%) of gang members carried a hidden weapon for protection. Notably, this activity, reported by 17% of nongang members, represented the third most frequent delinquent act by nongang members. Involvement of nongang members in traditional gang activities was also seen with gang fights. As expected, a majority of gang members (72%) reported involvement in gang fights, but interestingly, so did 6% of nongang members.</p>

<p>Drug use represented the activity most involved in by both gang and nongang members. Marijuana or illegal drugs had been used by almost all gang members (96%) and more than one third (35%) of nongang members. On the other hand, use of inhalants (36%), selling illegal drugs (36%), and graffiti (68%) were primarily gang member activities, with less than 10% of nongang members participating in these behaviors. Other than illegal drug use, shoplifting represented the activity most likely to be reported by nongang members (24%) and a high percentage of gang members as well (72%).</p>
<p>Other than being hit, gang members (72%) and nongang members (43%) did not indicate significantly different levels of victimization. Sixty percent of gang members and 54% of nongang members had something stolen; 16% of gang members were victims of robbery compared to 5% of nongang members; and 20% of gang members were assaulted with a weapon compared to 9% of nongang members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1043986212458193">
<title>Reasons for Involvement in American Indian Gangs</title>
<p>Respondents were asked why they joined the gang. The primary reasons they gave were “respect” (36%) and “for fun” (36%). Having a family member in the gang (32%) also represented a common reason for joining. Protection and having a friend in the gang were reported as reasons for joining by about one fourth (24%) of gang members. Only 16% joined for money and only one person reported joining their gang due to force.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1043986212458193">
<title>American Indian Gang Characteristics</title>
<p>American Indian gangs, according to the participants, are fairly large. Most respondents (44%) reported their gangs had 30 or more members, and another 40% belonged to gangs that had between 11 and 30 members. Consistent with the fact that females represented 40% of gang members, 87% stated that their gang included female members, with only 13% indicating no female involvement. Respondents indicated fairly high levels of gang organization. Most members claimed that their gang had symbols or colors (92%) and established leaders (88%). A majority of gang members reported that their gang had specific rules or codes (64%) and specific roles for members (60%). About half of members (52%) indicated their gangs participated in initiation rites and 36% stated that their gang held regular meetings.</p>
<p>Not only did gang members vary in their individual delinquency participation, but they also revealed differing levels of delinquency committed by the gang as a whole. To measure this, respondents were asked to indicate the different types of delinquency committed by their gangs. Gangs were mostly involved in fights (88%) and selling marijuana (79%). Property offenses such as stealing things (74%) and damaging/destroying property (71%) also represented common activities. Fewer participants indicated their gangs were involved in robbing people (41%), selling illegal drugs (38%), and stealing cars (29%).</p>

Nongang members, on the other hand, reported higher levels of guilt than gang members. Both family factors, parental monitoring and parental deviance, were significantly different between gang and nongang members. Gang members reported significantly less parental monitoring and higher levels of perceived parental deviance than did nongang members.</p>
<p>Gang members described significantly lower levels of school commitment than nongang members. Both peer factors also indicated significant differences between gang and nongang members. Nongang members reported more prosocial peers, and gang members had more delinquent peers. Finally, no significant differences existed between gang and nongang members for either of the community factors, neighborhood environment and stability.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>Existing evidence indicates that American Indian communities are not immune from gang problems. This study, while consisting of a small sample of American Indian individuals in one location, provides a contemporary examination of American Indian gangs and enhances our knowledge not only of the characteristics of American Indian gangs and gang members, but also the factors related to gang involvement among this particular group. Although this study extends the literature regarding American Indian gangs, a number of limitations exist. The nature of cross-sectional data limits our ability of establishing the temporal ordering of the factors related to gang membership and gang joining. As a result, we are restricted to discussing correlates rather than actual risk factors for gang membership. This issue, as well as the fact that previous research indicates that once gang members leave the gang, their attitudes and behaviors become more prosocial, is further complicated by the utilization of the “ever gang member” definition since this could also include ex-gang members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043986212458193">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>). We considered that the inclusion of individuals reporting “ever” gang involvement in gangs could influence the relationships examined; however, the “ever” definition versus the “current” gang member definition did not impact the results and thus was utilized to increase statistical power since the overall number of gang members was relatively small. Despite these limitations, this study points to some unique findings as well as those that are consistent with the gang literature as a whole.</p>
<p>American Indian gangs contain a considerable membership, often exceeding 30 individuals. This reflects the general trend of gang development in rural areas where gangs typically consist of 50 or fewer members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986212458193">Egley, 2005</xref>). A majority of individuals reported joining before age 13, most around age 10. Since the average age of most youth gang members is typically between 13 and 16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986212458193">Armstrong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986212458193">Howell, 2012</xref>), early intervention and prevention seems important. Furthermore, as most recent evidence indicates, female involvement in gangs can no longer be overlooked. Consistent with other self-report studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986212458193">Esbensen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986212458193">Esbensen &amp; Huizinga, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043986212458193">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>), in this sample, females represented 40% of gang members and 87% of respondents indicated female members in their gangs. Finally, gang organization seems quite high, with close to 90% reporting symbols/colors and established leaders and more than 50% of individuals reporting that their gangs had initiation rites, established rules, and defined social roles. This contrasts with other research indicating fairly low levels of gang organization among youth gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043986212458193">Decker et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043986212458193">Fleisher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458193">Grant &amp; Feimer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458193">Klein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986212458193">Theriot &amp; Parker, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings regarding both individual and gang delinquency and victimization also shed some light on how American Indian gangs compare to gangs in general. Most of the respondents reported “cafeteria-style delinquency,” especially involvement in property and drug-related offenses, reflecting trends similar to the larger gang literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986212458193">Armstrong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458193">Klein, 1995</xref>). We also found that gun-related activity is relatively rare, consistent with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major et al., 2004</xref>). Of note, however, was the involvement of nongang members in carrying a hidden weapon for protection as well as their involvement in gang fights. These results might signify a unique position of nongang members in these communities. Although they are not involved in gangs, it might be difficult to ignore or avoid gang activity around them. This might correspond to situations described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043986212458193">Anderson (1999)</xref> in inner-city environments in which “decent” individuals are required to abide by the “code of the street,” which includes showing nerve and standing up for oneself. Carrying a hidden weapon and being involved in gang fights might represent various ways of maintaining respect in these communities. Although gang membership is usually found to be correlated with higher crime victimization rates, gang members in our study report fairly low levels of overall victimization. However, gang members were more likely than nongang members to be hit.</p>
<p>The reasons that individuals gave for joining the gang also provide some insight into gang membership among American Indians. The majority of respondents did not actually claim a reason for joining their gang, making it difficult to understand why American Indian youth participate in gangs. For those who did respond, items such as “respect” and “fun” denoted the common reasons for joining. American Indian youth, mirroring other findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986212458193">Freng &amp; Winfree, 2004</xref>), do indicate that coercion is not a precipitating factor in joining the gang. On the other hand, protection and money, common reasons given for joining gangs, seem inadequate to explain gang joining for this group. For example, although 100% of gang members in our sample report that the gang provides protection, only 24% actually joined for this reason. Given the economic situations that often face American Indian individuals, it seems curious that only 16% join for monetary gain. Perhaps illegitimate opportunities are as rare as legitimate opportunities in these communities. Thus, the American Indian population sampled here seems to defy the traditional set of explanations deployed to account for why youth join gangs in a number of ways.</p>
<p>Promoting a better understanding of traditional values has often been identified as one way to assist in decreasing gang activity among American Indian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986212458193">Grant &amp; Feimer, 2007</xref>). Individuals more connected to their traditions and culture should have less desire and need to join a gang. The findings of this study do not support this contention. Levels of cultural identity did not differ between nongang and gang members. Indeed, gang names such as “Native Mob” and “Nomads” seem to emphasize rather than ignore native culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043986212458193">Eckholm, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986212458193">Hailer &amp; Hart, 1999</xref>). Thus, these groups may actually represent an extension of native culture, rather than a repudiation thereof. This finding represents an important consideration in terms of prevention and intervention programming as many proposals to address gang membership among American Indians include elements of culture and promote increasing ties to traditional culture, which may not produce the desired effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986212458193">Theriot &amp; Parker, 2007</xref>). Moreover, this finding poses a theoretical challenge to perspectives that see native gangs as wholesale cultural imports. These groups may instead be a unique expression of ethnic solidarity with other disadvantaged groups, while remaining rooted in native cultural tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986212458193">Armstrong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986212458193">Mendenhall &amp; Armstrong, n.d</xref>.). Without fully understanding this unique relationship, however, increasing the connection to culture through programming may be ineffective and should be examined more extensively.</p>
<p>Social isolation is often linked to gang membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043986212458193">Esbensen, Huizinga, &amp; Weiher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986212458193">Vigil, 1988</xref>). However, in this study, social isolation did not contribute to gang involvement. It is possible that social isolation remains rampant among American Indians as a whole and thus does not serve as an important factor in gang participation. On the other hand, consistent with the gang literature in general (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986212458193">Esbensen et al., 2010</xref>), American Indian gang members possessed less guilt than their nongang counterparts.</p>
<p>It is difficult to ignore the influence of the family on gang involvement. Gang research has shown that gang members are more likely to live in single-parent or extended families (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043986212458193">Bowker &amp; Klein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986212458193">Esbensen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986212458193">Esbensen &amp; Winfree, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986212458193">Hill, Howell, Hawkins, &amp; Battin-Pearson, 1999</xref>). However, it seems that family structure has little impact on gang membership for certain groups, specifically African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043986212458193">Maxson, Whitlock, &amp; Klein, 1998</xref>). In this sample, family structure remains significant, suggesting that individuals coming from an exclusively extended family are more likely to be involved in a gang. This reflects other findings that American Indian gang members often come from nonintact families and that extended family, especially cousins, might influence gang joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986212458193">Armstrong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043986212458193">Hailer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986212458193">Mendenhall &amp; Armstrong, n.d</xref>.). Having a gang member in the family characterizes a primary reason for joining the gang. For example, 67% of gang members reported that they have a family member with gang involvement. However, only 32% reported this was the reason for joining the gang. In addition, nongang members also have a considerable tie to gang membership through their families. Thus, it is not clear whether this influences gang joining behavior or represents an entrée into the same gang as the gang member relative.</p>
<p>The results regarding school commitment and peer influences supported traditional findings. Gang members often possess less school commitment than nongang members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043986212458193">Bjerregaard &amp; Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986212458193">Esbensen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986212458193">Hill et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458193">Klein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043986212458193">Maxson et al., 1998</xref>) and similar relationships were found in this study. On the other hand, although lower school achievement is often tied to gang membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986212458193">Hill et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043986212458193">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>), this was not the case in this study. However, it is important to keep in mind that this was a school-based sample, so it might not reflect those for whom low school achievement may have resulted in dropping out. In terms of peer relationships, nongang members had more prosocial relationships, whereas gang members possessed more delinquent peers reflecting one of the most supported findings in the gang literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043986212458193">Bjerregaard &amp; Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043986212458193">Hawkins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986212458193">Hill et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986212458193">Klein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043986212458193">Thornberry et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Community factors, such as the neighborhood environment and neighborhood stability, have often been linked to increased levels of gang membership. Traditionally, stable neighborhoods characterized by strong social institutions and high levels of social control often reflect areas with decreased gang involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043986212458193">Bowker &amp; Klein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043986212458193">Moore, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986212458193">Vigil, 1998</xref>). In this research, neither community variables, neighborhood environment, nor stability differed significantly between nongang and gang members. Further research examining the specific mechanisms by which neighborhoods contribute to gang membership in tribal communities is needed to either better understand this finding or show it to be anomalous.</p>
<p>These findings point to a number of aspects to consider when addressing gangs in tribal communities. The geographic, political, and social differences between tribal communities and other disadvantaged communities are significant and are reflected in the policies and practices utilized to address gang problems. Tribal leaders can change quickly, resulting in issues with consistency of prevention programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986212458193">Hailer &amp; Hart, 1999</xref>). In addition, reservations are policed by federal, state, and tribal law enforcement, making it very difficult to find consistent solutions on how to deal with youth gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458193">Joseph &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>). These jurisdictional issues, coupled with limited overall law enforcement resources, create opportunities for gang development and gang activities. Due to the lack of resources, tribal communities often lack basic programs to prevent gang membership, putting a strain on law enforcement and affecting their ability to control the growth of American Indian youth gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986212458193">Joseph &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>). In response to this situation, tribal leaders have so far pursued less aggressive preventative methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major et al., 2004</xref>). The balance of evidence suggests gang membership among American Indian gang members could be addressed in the same way that gang membership is handled in other populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986212458193">Major et al., 2004</xref>). However, these results also suggest that family- and peer-based preventative methods could be important in intervention strategies and focusing on cultural elements may not have the impact previously thought. Furthermore, since some of the most successful programs for other emerging youth gang populations have not been tested with American Indians, further investigation regarding the mechanisms by which American Indian youth become involved in youth gangs and how they differ from the traditional research is needed and may be able to help these tribal communities to develop effective prevention and intervention strategies.</p>
