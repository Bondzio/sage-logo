<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study is to examine how learning emerges in terms of structure and function to transform from an individual to a collective (team) phenomenon. Drawing on learning theory and multilevel thinking, the authors developed and validated measures for the basic team learning processes (i.e., intuition, interpretation, integration, and codification) in three independent field studies of innovation project teams and employed multilevel structural equation modeling to test relationships across the individual and team levels of analysis. Their results confirm the hypothesis that team learning originates in individual intuitions, is amplified through interpretation and integration, and manifests itself at the team level via the codification of collective cognition and action. Across the three studies, team learning was found to significantly affect team performance. The authors’ approach contributes to a conceptualization and measurement of team learning as a multilevel phenomenon.</p>

<body>
<p>The ever-increasing use of team-based structures in modern organizations has resulted in substantial scholarly work on processes that are hypothesized to influence team performance (for a recent review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311419366">Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, &amp; Gilson, 2008</xref>). Within this body of research, team learning has been proposed as a critical process and has received a considerable amount of empirical examination in real group settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311419366">Wong, 2004</xref>). The conceptualization and measurement of team learning, however, presents some unique challenges. Because team members work in an interdependent and interactive environment, it is necessary to consider the dynamic interplay between individual members’ knowledge and skills and the team’s collective learning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311419366">DeShon, Kozlowski, Schmidt, Milner, &amp; Weichmann, 2004</xref>), or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">Morgeson and Hofmann (1999)</xref> described as the <italic>emergence</italic> form of a collective construct arising from complex individual interactions. Yet research on team learning lacks <italic>multilevel</italic> examinations of how learning emerges from the cognitions and interactions of individuals to become a group property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311419366">Bell &amp; Kozlowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206311419366">Ellis et al., 2003</xref>). As Wilson and her colleagues note, “Treatments of group learning confuse levels of analysis by not distinguishing individual learning in the context of groups from group-level learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311419366">Wilson, Goodman, &amp; Cronin, 2007</xref>: 1042).</p>
<p>To date, research has tended to focus on team learning more like a single-level construct by aggregating individual perceptions to create a group mean score. As a result, it fails to recognize team learning emergence and provide explanations of “how disparate individual learning and action emerge as a collective phenomenon” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311419366">Kozlowski &amp; Ilgen, 2006</xref>: 87). This serious gap in the extant research brings up questions such as, Is it reasonable to refer to teams as if they have learning properties that are inherently human? Are teams able to learn independently of the learning of individual members? By simply aggregating individual contributions, are we committing fallacies of the wrong level and personification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206311419366">Rousseau, 1985</xref>), and hence, are we developing learning constructs that have doubtful scientific validity? Addressing questions such as these becomes increasingly important because of the current proliferation of studies examining learning in work teams and, more importantly, because understanding how learning occurs within socially complex team settings is a critical condition for predicting not only team but also organizational performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of the present study is therefore to address the above-mentioned gaps by means of multilevel research in an attempt to clarify the <italic>structure</italic> (i.e., how collective phenomena take shape) and <italic>function</italic> (i.e., causal effects) of team learning emergence. Structure and function represent the two fundamental dimensions that should be thoroughly examined before any higher level construct can be considered scientifically valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311419366">Li &amp; Cropanzano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">Morgeson &amp; Hofmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206311419366">Ployhart, Weekley, &amp; Baughman, 2006</xref>). In this manner, the work at hand makes a number of contributions to the extant literature.</p>
<p>First, using the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan, Lane, and White (1999)</xref> as our starting point, we propose and validate a model of team learning as an <italic>emergent</italic> phenomenon, where different sociocognitive processes (i.e., intuition, interpretation, integration, and codification) are modeled at different levels, linking the individual with the team. Essentially, in this study we attempt to show how individuals’ cognitions and interactions take shape and emerge as a collective learning phenomenon. For our purposes, the model of Crossan and her colleagues is particularly appropriate, as it is an inherently multilevel conceptualization of how learning unfolds; it draws attention on the importance of intragroup individual interactions and delineates inter alia the fundamental processes determining the nature of learning emergence. Accordingly, the present study offers an explicitly multilevel definition of team learning and empirically examines important, yet untested, propositions about learning emergence in the context of teams, contrary to existing research that does not directly investigate how individual knowledge and learning develop into the team level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311419366">Kozlowski &amp; Ilgen, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, this study incorporates—both conceptually and empirically—the inherent dependence of individual members <italic>nested</italic> within teams. This constitutes a significant addition to the learning and teamwork literature, which have largely developed “imprecise frameworks” because of a lack of attention to the nonindependent nature of real group settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311419366">Mathieu &amp; Chen, 2011</xref>). The explicit recognition of this dependence allows us to align the level of theory with the level of measurement (i.e., the unit from which original data are collected) and the level of statistical analysis of the team learning construct, hence avoiding “fallacies of the wrong level” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206311419366">Hitt, Beamish, Jackson, &amp; Mathieu, 2007</xref>). For this purpose, we employ multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) to develop measures of team learning processes that capture their multilevel, emergent nature and to test for a functional relationship between team learning and team performance in three different samples of innovation project teams. In so doing, we further provide evidence of discriminant, criterion-related, and incremental validity by comparing our measures with related—but theoretically distinct—constructs and with existing measures or alternative operationalizations of team learning.</p>
<p>Using MSEM, therefore, the present study addresses recent calls regarding the need for a multilevel approach to understanding learning in teams in a way that directly accounts for their nonindependent nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311419366">Chen, Kirkman, Kanfer, Allen, &amp; Rosen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206311419366">Kozlowski, Chao, &amp; Jensen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311419366">Kozlowski &amp; Ilgen, 2006</xref>) and provides researchers with a set of valid and reliable measures to better theorize and empirically examine the antecedents and consequences of team learning across levels of analysis.</p>

<title>Theoretical Background and Hypotheses</title>

<title>Team Learning Research</title>
<p>Since the influential work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206311419366">Senge (1990)</xref>, who argued that teams comprise the fundamental learning unit in an organization, an increasing amount of research has been carried out to examine learning in teams (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206311419366">Argote, Gruenfeld, &amp; Naquin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206311419366">Bresman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206311419366">Ellis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311419366">Gibson &amp; Vermeulen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206311419366">Kostopoulos &amp; Bozionelos, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206311419366">Van der Vegt &amp; Bunderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311419366">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311419366">Wong, 2004</xref>). A team-level approach represents a middle ground for synthesizing individual- with organizational-level learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 2002</xref>), thus offering the potential for a full account of the social milieu within which individual cognition and action—that is, the basic elements of organizational learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311419366">Fiol &amp; Lyles, 1985</xref>)—are shaped and translated into collective (team) properties.</p>
<p>Team learning is commonly conceptualized as an ongoing process of action and reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 2002</xref>) through which teams acquire, combine, and apply knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206311419366">Argote et al., 2001</xref>). This process is closely related to such activities as asking questions, seeking feedback, improvising, discussing errors, challenging underlying assumptions, and reflecting on specific results or unexpected outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311419366">Wong (2004)</xref> distinguished between learning activities that occur from interactions <italic>within</italic> the team, which she referred to as local learning, and activities directed <italic>outside</italic> the team (i.e., distal learning) and found them to contribute to efficiency and innovativeness, respectively. Team learning, however, also refers to knowledge being encoded and embedded within the team. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311419366">Gibson and Vermeulen (2003)</xref>, for instance, underlined the importance of documenting and reflecting on what has been learned through a process of knowledge codification. Codification entails recording teamwork procedures and, thus, converting tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge so that workable outcomes can be developed. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311419366">Wilson and her colleagues (2007)</xref> argued that the processes of storing and retrieving knowledge are central dimensions of team learning. Storage and retrieval enable learning to persist over time by retaining knowledge and learned artifacts in memory repositories and by facilitating team members to find and access them for future use.</p>
<p>Although this research is very important, still it seems to provide a rather incoherent account of what constitutes team learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311419366">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>). A perhaps more serious problem is that existing conceptualizations do little to explicate how learning emerges from individual members to become a collective property of the team. This raises critical theoretical and empirical questions about the appropriate level of analysis and the processes utilized in current frameworks to clarify how learning attains meaning and structure at the team level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206311419366">Kozlowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311419366">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As a starting point, it is clear that team learning cannot exist without the cognitions and actions of individual members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311419366">Argyris &amp; Schön, 1978</xref>). It is also true, however, that a collection of individual learners will neither necessarily nor automatically lead to a team in which learning occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311419366">Fiol &amp; Lyles, 1985</xref>). What we can safely suggest is that those team members’ unique ideas, insights, and behaviors constitute the foundation from which learning emerges as a team-level phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311419366">DeShon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311419366">Kozlowski &amp; Ilgen, 2006</xref>). Hence, a central theme to address is how team learning emerges out of individual learning. How do individuals interact and influence each other to develop collective learning perceptions? What are the sociocognitive processes that underlie these interactions? How does learning become a team property that transcends individual members? As yet, extant research lacks adequate explanations to these questions; the use of multilevel thinking can be an effective means to move forward.</p>

<title>Team Learning as a Multilevel, Emergent Phenomenon</title>
<p>Given the aforementioned limitations in the literature, we build on multilevel theory to conceptualize team learning as an emergent phenomenon that traverses individual and group levels to rise as a collective property of the team. A construct is emergent “when it originates in the cognition, affect, behaviors, or other characteristics of individuals, is amplified by their interactions, and manifests as a higher-level, collective phenomenon” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311419366">Kozlowski &amp; Klein, 2000</xref>: 55). Therefore, to conceptualize team learning as an emergent phenomenon, we need to carefully investigate individual contributions (e.g., cognition, insights, ideas) as well as the system of cross-member interactions (e.g., knowledge sharing, collective sense making, influences on each others’ actions and behaviors) that enable learning to arise as a team property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311419366">DeShon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">Morgeson &amp; Hofmann, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Individual cognition and actions have long been recognized as the elemental content of organizational learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311419366">Fiol &amp; Lyles, 1985</xref>). Individuals within organizations, however, do not think and act in a (social) vacuum. Their cognition and behaviors are affected and bounded by the surrounding context within which they operate (e.g., project teams, departments, business units), and thus, the acceptable range of their actions is shaped by a variety of situational or contextual factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">Morgeson and Hofmann (1999</xref>: 251), following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311419366">Allport’s (1967)</xref> view on collective behavior, describe this intersection of individual action in its context as the “ongoings of the individual system.” Individual ongoings inevitably encounter one another, leading to a system of interpersonal events where individuals stimulate each other’s actions and reactions. Team members, for example, share information and resources, communicate moods and feelings, engage in sense making, and perform activities that exert influences and generate successive responses by others. As this interaction unfolds in a circular and recurrent pattern, a structure of collective action emerges, which transcends individuals and forms the basis for the development of team learning as a higher level construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">Morgeson &amp; Hofmann, 1999</xref>). Therefore, team learning emerges from the ground up, with individual members’ interactions being the building blocks of the emerging collective structure.</p>
<p>This ground-up approach to team learning creates the need for an underlying theoretical framework that clarifies the structure of its emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311419366">Kozlowski &amp; Klein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311419366">Mathieu &amp; Chen, 2011</xref>). We adopt as our theoretical <italic>starting point</italic> the learning model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan and her colleagues (1999)</xref>. Their work offers a compelling conceptual basis that specifies the sociocognitive processes through which learning unfolds. Four characteristics of Crossan et al.’s model are particularly important to conceptualizing learning as a collective phenomenon: (1) It is a multilevel model by its very construction, linking the individual through the team to the organization level of analysis; (2) it identifies the mechanisms and interaction dynamics that bridge the levels through four processes—intuition, interpretation, integration, and institutionalization; (3) it emphasizes the emergent and contingent nature of these processes, with learning being conditional on the individuals involved and the group context within which these processes take place; and (4) it captures the ongoing interplay between cognition and action, which, as previously noted, constitutes a fundamental characteristic of any learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311419366">Fiol &amp; Lyles, 1985</xref>). For our purposes, we utilize the first three of these processes (i.e., intuition, interpretation, and integration) as originally theorized and reconceptualize the fourth (i.e., institutionalization) as learning being codified and embedded into the team level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311419366">Gibson &amp; Vermeulen, 2003</xref>), not the organizational level, of analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0149206311419366">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Crossan et al. define <italic>intuition</italic> as “the preconscious recognition of the pattern and/or possibilities inherent in a personal stream of experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">1999</xref>: 525). Intuition is, of course, situated within the individual. Individuals explore, improvise, and develop novel solutions or recognize opportunities based on previous experience and their ability to identify underlying or potential patterns in that experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206311419366">Dane &amp; Pratt, 2007</xref>). These intuitive insights and ideas may act as “mental moderators” to individuals’ learning tendencies and preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311419366">Bargh &amp; Chartrand, 1999</xref>) and are typically generated in a tacit or preverbal form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311419366">Hogarth, 2001</xref>). Hence, they have to be converted and articulated in terms of metaphors, which may be the only possible means of communicating individual insights with other team members.</p>
<p>While intuition focuses on the subconscious development of individual insights, interpretation acts as a “feed-forward” mechanism that links the individual and team levels through conversation and dialogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>Interpretation</italic> is defined as “the explaining, through words and/or actions, of an insight or idea to one’s self and to others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan et al., 1999</xref>: 525). With a predominantly social character, interpretation involves dialectical interactions within a group context, through which individual members share and refine their intuitions, negotiate meaning, and build a common language. In this way, members develop their cognitive maps and begin to name and explicate previously unstructured ideas, half-thoughts, or feelings. The process of interpretation, therefore, facilitates the development of shared understanding among team members, thus enabling members’ cognitive schemas to converge regarding critical domains of their task environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206311419366">Weick &amp; Roberts, 1993</xref>). For Crossan and her colleagues, interpretation “bridges” the individual with the collective (i.e., the team) in which it (the individual) is embedded.</p>
<p><italic>Integration</italic>, in turn, is a process that takes place at the team level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206311419366">Bontis, Crossan, &amp; Hulland, 2002</xref>). Once intuitive insights have been translated into a convergent, shared interpretation, they have the potential to be integrated into the activities of the team. Crossan et al. refer to integration as “the process of developing shared understanding among individuals and of taking coordinated action through mutual adjustment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">1999</xref>: 525). The process of integration has an explicit orientation toward the accomplishment of coherent, collective action. Through continuing communication and shared practice, members’ distributed activities tend to converge, generating actions upon which all team members agree and participate.</p>
<p>Finally, the collective action and the ensuing knowledge created in the course of interactions among members need to be <italic>codified</italic> and embedded into the team (e.g., stored in written documents or in electronic databases and reporting systems) so that learning can persist and produce workable outcomes. As Gibson and Vermeulen note, codification “enables a team to put knowledge and ideas into practice and reflect and build on what has been learned” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311419366">2003</xref>: 206). In the absence of codification, a team may fail to learn and thus may be unable to contribute new explicit knowledge in memory repositories or produce new ways of working that could help its members and the broader organization to perform effectively in a future situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, the sociocognitive processes of intuition, interpretation, integration, and codification delineate the emergent character of learning in team settings. Team learning originates in individual intuitions that involve previous experiences and creative insights on a common task. These largely amorphous cognitive elements of individual members are filtered and shaped by the social process of interpretation; personal insights are blended with those of other individuals in the group through a system of dialectical interactions. Team members work together, communicate and share knowledge, transform their intuitive perspectives into explicit concepts, and influence each other toward a uniform interpretation of their team task. Potential variations in individual perceptions tend to dissipate, as only those interpretations that are accepted by all members will converge to a shared team understanding. As this shared understanding is repeatedly enacted, team members choose the type of actions that the team should perform through the process of integration. Through integration, cognitive elements (i.e., common interpretation and shared understanding) are translated into mutual action (i.e., coordinated behaviors and team activities). It is in this sense that cognition–action interrelationships emerge as collective team learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">Morgeson &amp; Hofmann, 1999</xref>). Finally, collective cognition and action have to be converted into explicit outcomes through codification. Documenting and codifying what has been learned ensures that learning has actually taken place and will endure as an emergent property of the team, “exerting influence beyond the individual members involved in the original learning process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311419366">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>: 1043).</p>
<p>Based on the discussion above, we argue that intuition, interpretation, integration, and codification are different sociocognitive processes that affect and complement each other and, jointly, compose team learning. Hence, <italic>team learning is more than the simple sum of these four processes</italic>. Rather, it is reflected in the pattern of interrelations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311419366">Venkatraman, 1989</xref>) among these processes, seen as constitutive dimensions of a higher (second-) order, emergent phenomenon, which originates in individual intuitions, is amplified through interpretation and integration, and materializes at the team level via the codification of collective cognition and action. Properly testing learning emergence in our context requires the specification of a two-level model where the different processes identified above are located at the level prescribed by theory, team learning is represented as a second-order factor, and the model fit the data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a thorough examination of the discriminant validity of our multilevel, higher order factor structure of team learning necessitates comparisons with related, but theoretically distinct, group constructs, such as coordination and communication. Team coordination, referring to the process of synchronizing team members’ activities with respect to their sequence and timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206311419366">Marks, Mathieu, &amp; Zaccaro, 2001</xref>), and team communication, referring to the exchange of information among team members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206311419366">Pinto &amp; Pinto, 1990</xref>), are considered as fundamental group processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311419366">Mathieu et al., 2008</xref>). We expect these constructs to be related to, but distinct from, team learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311419366">Wong, 2004</xref>). Hence, we hypothesize:</p>

<title>Team Learning and Its Functional Relationship to Performance</title>
<p>Multilevel theory further asserts that to fully understand a higher level construct, one should also examine its function, that is, the effects or outputs it generates within an organizational system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">Morgeson &amp; Hofmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206311419366">Ployhart et al., 2006</xref>). In recent years, scholars have begun to study the function of team learning by exploring its effects on team efficiency and effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311419366">Wong, 2004</xref>), on quality of intrateam relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206311419366">Zellmer-Bruhn &amp; Gibson, 2006</xref>), or on the implementation of new practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206311419366">Tucker, Nembhard, &amp; Edmondson, 2007</xref>). As noted above, however, we argue that this work still lacks conceptual and measurement rigor, as it fails to examine team learning as a collective, emergent phenomenon.</p>
<p>The most obvious function of team learning is its capacity to affect team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311419366">Mathieu et al., 2008</xref>). Team performance can be generally defined as the extent to which a team is able to meet its output goals (e.g., quality, functionality, and reliability of outputs), the expectations of its members, or its cost and time objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311419366">Ancona &amp; Caldwell, 1992</xref>). Using performance as the dependent variable in a functional analysis illustrates the critical role of learning in a collective team environment and allows us to better evaluate the construct validity of our team learning construct by unraveling the very processes through which learning emerges as a collective phenomenon from its performance outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">Morgeson &amp; Hofmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311419366">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In most studies, team learning has been shown to enhance efficiency-based facets of team performance (e.g., adherence to budget and time schedules). The basic line of reasoning for these positive effects is that learning facilitates a team to adapt to changing circumstances, to continually refine procedures and practices, and to implement new and better ways of achieving its objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311419366">Edmondson &amp; Membhard, 2009</xref>). It has also been suggested, however, that learning may not invariably lead to higher team effectiveness and may even be dysfunctional under certain circumstances. Teams that overemphasize learning could suffer the costs of experimentation without (necessarily) gaining concrete performance benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311419366">Levinthal &amp; March, 1993</xref>), may consume time without assurance of results, or may produce more variation than can be effectively assimilated and integrated into group operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206311419366">Bunderson &amp; Sutcliffe, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, for teams working on nonroutine tasks (e.g., innovation development teams), learning may be argued to represent a sine qua non condition for generating novelty and for producing innovation under market and technological uncertainties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311419366">Edmondson &amp; Membhard, 2009</xref>). Hence, in such challenging and demanding circumstances the benefits of learning are expected to outweigh the potential risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311419366">Choo, Linderman, &amp; Schroeder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206311419366">Kostopoulos &amp; Bozionelos, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>By engaging in the sociocognitive learning processes identified above, teams are able to adapt to or even take advantage of shifting task requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206311419366">Bontis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311419366">Gibson &amp; Vermeulen, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206311419366">Hoopes and Postrel’s (1999)</xref> study of new product development teams demonstrated that teams with greater common task knowledge were able to perform better, as shared knowledge outweighed possible glitches or coordination errors arising from misunderstandings. In a similar vein, other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206311419366">Dougherty, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206311419366">Marks, Sabella, Burke, &amp; Zaccaro, 2002</xref>) have shown that learning improves team performance by facilitating information sharing and the harmonization of activities among members carrying out innovative tasks. Effective learning will therefore permit a more accurate understanding of the tasks at hand, as well as of the broader environment within which the team operates; will foster creative actions; and will ultimately enable the team to accomplish its goals successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311419366">Wong, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, we expect that our multilevel, higher order factor structure of team learning would better predict performance than existing measures of team learning, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311419366">Edmondson’s (1999)</xref> seven-item scale or an alternative operationalization (i.e., average scores) of our team learning items. This is because our proposed factor structure allows for a better alignment between the level of theory with the level of measurement and the level of statistical analysis of the team learning construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311419366">Chan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206311419366">Klein, Conn, Smith, &amp; Sorra, 2001</xref>), thus offering an unbiased estimation of model parameters and measurement error across levels of analysis. Hence, we hypothesize:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2a</italic>: Team learning will be positively related to team performance.</p></list-item>

<title>Samples, Analyses, and Measurement Procedures</title>
<p>Data were collected in three different studies, which were designed to (a) develop scales to measure team learning processes (i.e., intuition, interpretation, integration, codification), based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan et al. (1999)</xref> and related work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311419366">Gibson &amp; Vermeulen, 2003</xref>), and (b) examine the structure and function of team learning emergence. For these purposes, we followed standard and multilevel scale development procedures and analytic techniques described in the relevant literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206311419366">Ashill &amp; Jobber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311419366">Chen, Mathieu, &amp; Bliese, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311419366">Dyer, Hanges, &amp; Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311419366">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>). In particular, Study 1 focused on generating a set of items that fully represented the four sociocognitive processes of team learning and on assessing their content validity, dimensionality, and reliability. Study 2 was an attempt to examine the emergent nature of team learning by confirming the factor structure (i.e., different factors at different levels) and constructs’ dimensionality and to provide evidence of convergent, discriminant, criterion-related, and incremental validity, using MSEM. Finally, Study 3 aimed at replicating the factor structure and demonstrating construct validity for the team learning scale (again employing MSEM) in a different multicountry data set. In all three studies, we surveyed teams that had completed innovative assignments (i.e., development of a new product or service, technology, or introduction and adoption of a new process or management system) up to three months before data collection. These teams were time limited and were composed of managerial staff, engineers, and scientists.</p>
<p>The principal analytic technique employed was MSEM. MSEM is a relatively new field of methodological research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206311419366">Bauer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206311419366">Cheung &amp; Au, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206311419366">Croon &amp; van Veldhoven, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206311419366">Liang &amp; Bentler, 2004</xref>) that explicitly addresses the nonindependent nature of hierarchically nested data often encountered by management scholars (in our context, multiple respondents rating various features of the same team). In simple terms, MSEM consists of a concurrent analysis of both the within-group (i.e., individual-level) and between-group (i.e., team-level) covariance matrices. Therefore, MSEM, unlike its single-level counterpart or other more traditional approaches (e.g., aggregation), simultaneously considers the effects of intragroup dependency and between-groups differences, thus allowing an unbiased estimation of model parameters and measurement error at both the individual and team levels of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206311419366">Croon &amp; van Veldhoven, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311419366">Dyer et al., 2005</xref>). More importantly, by employing MSEM, researchers are able to demonstrate an appropriate (based on their theories) factor structure that may differ across levels, thus testing for emergence (i.e., Hypothesis 1a), and examine functional relationships at the desired level of analysis (in our case, learning effects on team performance—i.e., Hypothesis 2a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206311419366">Hanges &amp; Dickson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Team learning processes and team performance were measured with Likert-type items (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) using direct consensus and referent-shift compositional formats. Consistent with our conceptualization of team learning as a collective property emerging bottom-up, our measures attempted to gauge learning processes as individual perceptions with respect to intuition and as <italic>shared</italic> perceptions of team members with respect to interpretation, integration, and codification. It needs to be emphasized that whenever lower level (e.g., individual) data are collected to measure and make inferences about higher level (e.g., team) phenomena, researchers usually adopt (implicitly or explicitly) a composition model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311419366">Chan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206311419366">Klein et al., 2001</xref>). Direct consensus and referent-shift measures employed in the context of compositional models, based on assumptions of isomorphism, describe constructs that maintain the same meaning across levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311419366">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311419366">Kozlowski &amp; Klein, 2000</xref>). Had we theorized team learning as a <italic>combination</italic> of <italic>diverse</italic> individual-level contributions, we would have employed a compilation model of measurement (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206311419366">Kozlowski, Gully, Nason, &amp; Smith, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, in keeping with our basic premise that team learning is an emergent phenomenon transcending from the individual to the collective, we employed a direct consensus format to measure intuition (i.e., utilizing “I” referenced items; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311419366">Chen et al., 2004</xref>) and a referent-shift format to measure interpretation, integration, codification, and team performance (i.e., utilizing “we” referenced items). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan et al. (1999)</xref>, the learning process of intuition is situated within the individual, not the team; thus individual (“I”) referents should be an appropriate measurement approach. An example item used for rating intuition was (for details, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206311419366">Table 1</xref>): “<italic>I</italic> could effectively improvise in this team.” Conversely, the processes of interpretation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0149206311419366">2</xref></sup> integration, and codification are considered to take full shape at the level of the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan et al., 1999</xref>). Hence, for these learning processes we used items that shifted the referent from the individual member (“I”) to the <italic>team as a whole</italic> (“we”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311419366">Chan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311419366">Chen et al., 2004</xref>). An example item used for measuring integration was (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206311419366">Table 1</xref>): “In <italic>our</italic> team, <italic>we</italic> managed to agree upon the actions and activities that <italic>we</italic> should perform.” As Morgeson and Hofmann note, “Inferences at the collective [team] level will be facilitated by focusing on collective phenomena, framing questions in collective terms, treating individuals as informants about collective processes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">1999</xref>: 261).</p>

<title>Item generation and content validity</title>
<p>Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan et al.’s (1999)</xref> conceptual model and on other existing measures of team learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311419366">Gibson &amp; Vermeulen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311419366">Wong, 2004</xref>), we followed established scale development procedures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311419366">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>) to first generate a pool of 24 items that fully represented the four team learning processes. The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206311419366">Bontis et al. (2002)</xref> was also reviewed, as it is, to our knowledge, the only study that attempted to operationalize Crossan et al.’s framework. Nevertheless, Bontis et al. focused on measuring stocks and flows of organizational learning rather than specific processes that could explicate the emergence of learning as a team-level phenomenon.</p>
<p>Eight independent reviewers from industry and academia, experienced in team operations and related research, examined the initial pool of 24 items to verify content validity and to identify ambiguous wording and redundant items. Based on their comments, we excluded 2 items from further analysis and rephrased 4, reducing the pool to 22 items (5 for intuition, 7 for interpretation, 6 for integration, and 4 for codification).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0149206311419366">
<title>Dimensionality and reliability</title>
<p>To further purify the measures and assess dimensionality, we subsequently tested items in two stages. In the first, 12 in-depth interviews with senior executives were carried out by the first author to examine the clarity and practical relevance of the measures. Each interview lasted approximately one hour and, based on interviewees’ judgments, 15 out of the 22 items were retained (3 for intuition, 5 for interpretation, 4 for integration, and 3 for codification).</p>
<p>In the second stage, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on a sample of 271 executives attending graduate courses at a large European business school who had recently participated in project teams. All participants completed anonymous surveys in English during class time (participants were proficient in the English language). The average age of the participants in this sample was 34.2 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.5), 65% were male, and the average organizational tenure was 4.8 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.8). EFA was performed using principal component analysis with oblique rotation and eigenvalues greater than 1 as the criterion for factor extraction. Oblique rotation was selected because it has been shown to be more effective, compared to orthogonal rotation, at the early stages of scale development due to the fewer constraints it imposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206311419366">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, oblique rotation was most appropriate, as team learning processes are expected to correlate with one another.</p>
<p>After removing 3 items that either did not load significantly on any factor or loaded highly (above .40) on more than one factor, a four-factor solution was obtained with 12 items loading as expected and well above the conservative cutoff level of .5 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206311419366">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206311419366">Hair et al., 2006</xref>). The percentage variance explained for each of the four factors was as follows: intuition 14.8% (eigenvalue: 1.8), interpretation 35.3% (eigenvalue: 4.2), integration 12.5% (eigenvalue: 1.5), and codification 20.7% (eigenvalue: 2.5). The cumulative variance explained for all four factors was 83.3%. The reliability of those factors was also quite satisfactory. Cronbach’s alphas for the four learning processes were .81, .94, .91, and .89, respectively. Moreover, the existence of moderate-to-high intercorrelations among the factors (ranging from .12 to .57) confirmed the (implicit) assumption that the four processes represent dimensions of a higher order team learning factor. Overall, these results provide a reasonable degree of confidence on the dimensionality and reliability of the scales.</p>

<title>Study 2: Multilevel Construct Validation: Emergence and Functional Effects</title>
<sec id="section11-0149206311419366">
<title>Sample and procedures</title>
<p>Data from innovation project teams operated within the information and communication technology (ICT) and the pharmaceutical sectors in Greece were used to confirm the construct validity of the scales, as purified in Study 1, and to examine the structure and function of team learning as a second-order, emergent phenomenon. Two separate questionnaires in English were administered to team members and team supervisors, assuring anonymity and confidentiality (all participants were proficient in English). Team supervisors were managers formally assigned to monitor and evaluate team performance. Team members’ questionnaires contained measures of team learning processes, whereas supervisors’ questionnaires measured team performance. This procedure mitigated the possibility of common method bias, as different informants were utilized to assess the intragroup variables (i.e., learning processes) and team performance. Team performance was measured with five Likert-type items adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311419366">Ancona and Caldwell (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206311419366">Oh, Chung, and Labianca (2004)</xref>, which captured both the efficiency and effectiveness facets of performance.</p>
<p>We initially contacted by phone 85 firms in the ICT industry and 58 firms in the pharmaceutical industry. Fifty ICT and 35 pharmaceutical firms agreed to participate, for an overall response rate of 59%. From these firms, we managed to initially recruit 153 project teams (93 and 60 teams from ICT and pharmaceutical companies, respectively). Next, the first author conducted personal interviews with members and supervisors of those teams. To ensure that there were enough respondents to accurately reflect their teams, we followed the widely used response criterion of three or more completed questionnaires from team members and a completed questionnaire from the supervisor (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311419366">Hinds &amp; Mortensen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206311419366">Van der Vegt &amp; Bunderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206311419366">Van der Vegt &amp; Janssen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311419366">Zhang, Hempel, Han, &amp; Tjosvold, 2007</xref>). This led us to omit 14 teams from further analyses. Hence, the final sample for Study 2 consisted of 139 project teams from 85 ICT and 54 pharmaceutical companies, corresponding to a 90.8% team-level response rate, with 661 team members (the mean percentage of members surveyed from each team was 64%) and 139 supervisors. These response rates were deemed comparable with those achieved in similar studies on project teams (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311419366">Choo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206311419366">Haas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206311419366">Tucker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311419366">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Team size ranged from 4 to 15 members (<italic>M</italic> = 7.4, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.9), and mean project duration was 12.2 months (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.9). The average age of participants in this sample was 33.4 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.7), and 74.5% were male.</p>

<title>Multilevel analyses and results</title>
<p>As previously mentioned, given the inherently multilevel nature of our conceptual model, we employed MSEM as our primary analytic technique in this and the subsequent study (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206311419366">Bentler &amp; Liang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311419366">Muthén, 1994</xref>). In particular, we used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311419366">Muthén’s (1994)</xref> five-step procedure to assess the multilevel structure of data and examine the emergence of learning at the team level (for recent applications of Muthén’s procedure, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206311419366">Cheung &amp; Au, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311419366">Dyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206311419366">Hirst, Van Knippenberg, &amp; Zhou, 2009</xref>). The first step involves a conventional structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis on the sample total covariance matrix (i.e., ignoring the multilevel nested data structure) that provides a rough (and most likely biased) estimate of fit of the proposed model. The second step pertains to an estimation of between-group variation—through computing the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), 1 – ICC(1)—that demonstrates whether multilevel analysis is appropriate for the data at hand. The third and fourth steps involve a SEM analysis on the sample pooled within-group (i.e., individual level) and between-group (i.e., team level) covariance matrix, respectively. The pooled within-group covariance matrix is corrected for between-group differences by subtracting relevant group means from individual scores, while the between-group covariance matrix is the covariance matrix of observed group means corrected for the grand mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311419366">Dyer et al., 2005</xref>). The fifth and final step entails the actual multilevel analysis that provides an unbiased estimation of both the within- and between-groups factor structure.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206311419366">Figure 1</xref> presents a graphical representation of our model. Recall that we hypothesize (Hypothesis 1a) team learning to be a second-order, emergent phenomenon in that different processes are modeled at different levels of analysis. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan et al. (1999)</xref>, we expect that intuition is an individual-level process; interpretation links the individual with the team level, acting as a bridging mechanism, while integration and codification are realized at the team level of analysis. These four processes define the structure of the sociocognitive processes by which team learning emerges as a collective, second-order phenomenon. Even though rooted in the cognitions and insights of individuals, team learning has a conceptual, as well as a pragmatic, meaning only at the higher (team) level of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311419366">Kozlowski &amp; Klein, 2000</xref>). Hence, our statistical representation of learning emergence treats team learning as a second-order latent factor at the team level of analysis, composed of the first-order latent factors of interpretation (modeled at both the individual and team levels), integration and codification (both modeled at the team level), and intuition (modeled at the individual level). Finally, as per Hypothesis 2a, team learning (as a second-order factor) is expected to affect team performance positively.</p>

</fig>
<p>All analyses were performed using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimates in the EQS 6.1 structural equations program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311419366">Bentler, 2004</xref>) that has features specifically accommodating multilevel analysis. FIML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206311419366">Bentler &amp; Liang, 2003</xref>), unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311419366">Muthén’s (1994)</xref> maximum likelihood estimator, offers a more robust estimation of standard errors and is likely more appropriate in situations of unbalanced data (i.e., where group sizes are different), such as those encountered in the current study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206311419366">Bauer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206311419366">Cheung &amp; Au, 2005</xref>). Various indices were utilized to determine multilevel model fit. Specifically, model fit was first assessed with the Bentler-Liang likelihood ratio statistic, which is the multilevel equivalent of the chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206311419366">Bentler &amp; Liang, 2003</xref>). In addition, we also used comparative fit index (CFI), normed and incremental fit indices (NFI and IFI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). Due to lack of standard cutoff levels for these fit indices in multilevel analysis, we followed conventional SEM recommendations (e.g., values of CFI above 0.95 and values of RMSEA below 0.08; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206311419366">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>), recognizing, however, that further research is needed to confirm these benchmarks in the context of MSEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311419366">Mathieu &amp; Chen, 2011</xref>). Regarding sample size, multilevel researchers propose that the number of higher level clusters (i.e., number of teams), rather than the total number of participants (i.e., individual team members), should be used as a comparable number to regular SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311419366">Mehta &amp; Neale, 2005</xref>). A team-level sample size should be at least 100 in order to reach reliable conclusions using MSEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206311419366">Cheung &amp; Au, 2005</xref>). Our sample of 139 project teams clearly exceeded this size benchmark.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311419366">Muthén’s (1994)</xref> five-step procedure, we first performed a confirmatory factor analysis at the individual level (i.e., <italic>N</italic> = 661) on the four team learning processes and on team performance. The primary purpose of this analysis was to verify the factor structure identified using EFA in Study 1 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206311419366">Table 1</xref>) and to provide evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. Therefore, we constructed a model with five factors (i.e., intuition, interpretation, integration, codification, and team performance) loading separately; for the five-factor model, Satorra-Bentler scaled χ<sup>2</sup>(109) = 223, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = .98, NFI = .97, IFI = .98, RMSEA = .04. All factor loadings were high (ranged from .68 to .96) and significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>We also tested whether more parsimonious four- (combining interpretation and integration), three- (combining interpretation, integration, and codification), and two-factor (all learning indicators loaded on one factor) models provided better fit to the data; for the four-factor model, Satorra-Bentler scaled χ<sup>2</sup>(113) = 1,032.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = .88, NFI = .87, IFI = .87, RMSEA = .11; for the three-factor model, Satorra-Bentler scaled χ<sup>2</sup>(116) = 1,976.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = .76, NFI = .75, IFI = .76, RMSEA = .16; for the two-factor model, Satorra-Bentler scaled χ<sup>2</sup>(118) = 3,377.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = .59, NFI = .58, IFI = .59, RMSEA = .21. The proposed five-factor model at the individual-level data performed better than all alternative models, thus providing evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for the constructs studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311419366">Bagozzi, Yi, &amp; Phillips, 1991</xref>). Moreover, the existence of moderate-to-high covariances (ranging from .18 to .50) among the four factors representing team learning processes confirmed the assumption that these are all dimensions of a higher order team learning factor.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we computed in EQS 6.1 the ICC(1) for each factor item in order to determine the level of between-group variance. The ICC(1) values for all items ranged from .29 to .42, demonstrating sufficient between-group variation to statistically warrant the use of multilevel analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311419366">Dyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206311419366">James, 1982</xref>). Therefore, we then conducted the final-step MSEM<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0149206311419366">3</xref></sup> on the sample pooled within-group and between-group covariance matrices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206311419366">Table 2</xref>). Specifically, our model tests simultaneously whether (a) team learning is a second-order latent factor at the team level composed of first-order latent factors represented at both levels (Hypothesis 1a) and (b) team learning affects team performance (Hypothesis 2a).</p>

<p>To further examine the appropriateness of our hypothesized structure of team learning emergence (i.e., a second-order construct composed of <italic>different</italic> factors at <italic>different</italic> levels), we tested an alternative MSEM model. This model imposed a direct-competing form of emergence by specifying the same factor structure at both levels (i.e., all learning processes were modeled as latent factors at <italic>both</italic> the individual and team levels of analysis). This alternative model showed poor fit to the data, Bentler-Liang likelihood ratio statistic (165) = 465.7, CFI = .87, RMSEA = .10.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to demonstrate the superiority of using referent-shift measures for interpretation, integration, and codification, we tested two additional multilevel models including self (“I”) referents for these three learning processes (one model had only “I” referents for all learning processes, while the other incorporated both “I” and “we” referents for all learning processes).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0149206311419366">4</xref></sup> Both models showed significantly worse fit than our proposed multilevel model; very low (and in some cases nonsignificant) team-level factor loadings for the self-referenced items of integration and codification (as compared to their “we” counterparts) and a problematic (first- and second-order) factor structure at the team level of analysis (i.e., in both models, a team-level factor structure for self-, or “I,” referents was identified only for interpretation). These results provided strong evidence in support of our proposed compositional approach (i.e., referent-shift) toward operationalizing integration and codification. Conversely, findings were rather unclear regarding the process of interpretation. In particular, the results of the second model (i.e., including self and team referents for all processes) indicated that our “I”- and “we”-referenced versions of interpretation had similar measurement qualities (i.e., magnitude and significance of factor loadings) at both levels, while they also demonstrated large intercorrelations (above .65). Furthermore, self- and team-referenced interpretation items presented similar levels of within- and between-groups variance (ICC) as well as similar within-group agreement (interrater agreement index). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206311419366">van Mierlo, Vermunt, and Rutte (2009)</xref>, these results could suggest that “I”- and “we”-referenced interpretation items essentially measure the same thing, and thus it would make little difference, statistically, which composition model is used concerning interpretation.</p>
<p>To further investigate this, we specified another direct alternative model, which was the same as our proposed model, except for interpretation, which this time was measured <italic>only</italic> with self-referenced items (recall that in our original model interpretation was measured with referent-shift items). This model showed satisfactory fit to the data, Bentler-Liang likelihood ratio statistic (123) = 235.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = .95, RMSEA = .06, and the first- and second-order factor loadings for interpretation were high (first-order loadings ranged from .63 to .82; second-order factor loading was .52) and significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) at both the within (individual) and between (team) levels. Although these results were clearly inferior to those of our original multilevel model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206311419366">Table 3</xref>), they may still imply that interpretation can be measured with either self or referent-shift items. However, given the aforementioned theoretical focus of interpretation on the team level of analysis, we recommend that it should be better operationalized with referent-shift items (e.g., “we” or “in our team”; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206311419366">Klein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">Morgeson &amp; Hofmann, 1999</xref>), as operationalized in our original model. To summarize, our proposed multilevel model performed better than all alternative models.</p>

<title>Discriminant validity</title>
<p>Although the results of the exploratory and the multilevel analyses supported the dimensionality of the a priori (first- and second-order) factor structure of team learning, a thorough assessment of discriminant validity requires comparison with related—but theoretically distinct—constructs. Hypothesis 1a predicted that team learning would be related to, but distinct from, team coordination and communication. To test this, we performed another multilevel analysis including team learning (as a second-order latent factor as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206311419366">Figure 1</xref>) and two additional constructs at the team level: a three-item measure of team coordination (α = .92) and a five-item measure of team communication (α = .91), adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206311419366">Hoegl, Weinkauf, and Gemuenden (2004)</xref>.</p>
<p>The multilevel model fitted the data well, Bentler-Liang likelihood ratio statistic (133) = 289.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = .97, RMSEA = .04, while all items loaded as expected on their corresponding factors, with high (range .36 to .96) and significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) values. Moreover, constraining the correlation between team learning and each of the two additional constructs (i.e., coordination and communication) at the value of 1 resulted in statistically inferior models (i.e., the chi-square difference tests between the unconstrained and the constrained models were significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Overall, the results of the multilevel analysis and additional tests provided strong evidence for the discriminant validity of our team learning measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206311419366">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>), as per Hypothesis 1b.</p>

<sec id="section14-0149206311419366">
<title>Criterion-related and incremental validity</title>
<p>Hypothesis 2a predicted that team learning will be positively related to team performance. The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206311419366">Table 3</xref> show that team learning (as a second-order factor) has a positive and significant effect on performance at the team level of analysis (β = .34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), thus providing evidence of criterion-related validity. This lends strong support to Hypothesis 2a.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2b stated that our second-order factor structure will exhibit <italic>incremental</italic> validity against existing measures and alternative operationalizations of team learning. For this purpose, we performed a multilevel analysis including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311419366">Edmondson’s (1999)</xref> seven-item measure of team learning (α = .87) and a more traditional operationalization (i.e., average scores) of our team learning items. Results indicated that our second-order latent factor of team learning added significant explanatory value in the prediction of team performance over and above alternative measures (standardized paths were .29 for the latent factor, .06 for Edmondson’s scale, and .20 for the averaged measure), hence demonstrating the incremental validity of our modeling approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206311419366">Hammer, Kossek, Yragui, Bodner, &amp; Hanson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311419366">Li &amp; Cropanzano, 2009</xref>).

<title>Study 3: Confirmation of the Multilevel Factor Structure</title>
<sec id="section16-0149206311419366">
<title>Sample and procedures</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to confirm and further examine the generalizability of the multilevel factor structure and construct validity of the team learning scale in a different empirical context. To this end, we used data collected as part of a large research project, which sought to identify factors affecting the performance of collaborative research and development (R &amp; D) projects that were financed under the EU 5th and 6th Framework Programmes (FP5 and FP6). A representative random sample of 54,492 project participants was drawn from a population of 121,661. Information on these participants (i.e., titles and abstracts of the projects in which they had been involved, postal addresses, and e-mails) was retrieved from the CORDIS (Community Research &amp; Development Information Service) database, which is the official information service that provides up-to-date information related to EU activities and initiatives in the fields of R &amp; D and innovation. Questionnaires in English measuring team learning processes and team performance, among many other variables pertaining to project management and performance, were administered electronically after an invitation letter was sent by surface mail, explaining the purpose of the survey and assuring anonymity. Due to space limitations and to lower each respondent’s load (since we utilized the same informants for all variables), team performance in this study was measured with three Likert-type items adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311419366">Ancona and Caldwell (1992)</xref>. The scale captured both the efficiency and effectiveness dimensions of team performance.</p>
<p>To enhance the survey response rate, a call center was contracted to call potential respondents for a period of six weeks. The call center was stuffed with 10 calling agents who had full English language skills in addition to mother tongues in French, Italian, German, and Spanish. The agents were extensively trained on the subject matter and the purpose of the exercise. In total, 15,500 calls were registered, and 2,650 follow up e-mails were sent with the details of the survey. Those respondents who had left their respective organizations since project completion, whose address and/or e-mails were unknown, or who expressed no interest in participating in the survey were removed from the database. The entire data collection exercise lasted 10 weeks. Of the 54,492 team members who received the invitation to participate in the survey, 7,098 completed the electronic questionnaire, for an overall response rate of 13.03%. Extensive descriptive analyses established that the data collected were representative of the population from which they were drawn.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0149206311419366">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The data used here represent that fraction of the original sample that provided <italic>complete</italic> information on all the key variables of interest for this study (i.e., learning processes and project performance). Specifically, the sample used in Study 3 contains data on 995 collaborative R &amp; D projects provided by 3,593 team members (on average, 3.6 responses per project) from 258 enterprises and 325 research organizations (i.e., universities and research institutes) from across the European Union’s 27 member states (EU-27). The mean project duration was 36.6 months (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.6).</p>
<p>Unlike Study 2, in this study the learning process of intuition was measured with referent-shift (“we”) instead of self- (“I”) referents. This is clearly inconsistent with the definition of intuition as an individual-level process, and hence the results pertaining to intuition should be interpreted with caution. We believe, however, that Study 3 is still very useful in that it confirms (as will be shown below) our basic hypothesis of team learning as a second-order, emergent phenomenon, where different learning processes operate at different levels of analysis. An additional problem in Study 3 is that the same informants provided data on both the learning scale and team performance; we had therefore to empirically assess the possibility of common method bias.</p>
<p>First, following the procedures recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311419366">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003)</xref>, we tested two SEM models: one with all the study’s constructs (i.e., team learning processes and team performance) and another one including also one unmeasured common method variance (CMV) factor, which was linked to the indicators of all constructs. These analyses showed that none of the CMV factor loadings was significant and that the structural path from team learning to team performance remained positive and significant.</p>
<p>Second, we tested another structural model by randomly selecting approximately half of the sampled team members as sources for team learning and the remaining as sources for team performance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0149206311419366">6</xref></sup> The results of this model in terms of overall fit were similar to the results of our full-sample model, while the structural path from team learning to team performance did not change much in terms of magnitude and significance (β = .54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, compared with β = .60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, in the full model; see below). Taken together, these findings indicated that common method bias did not significantly affect the results of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311419366">Podsakoff et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0149206311419366">
<title>Multilevel analyses and results</title>
<p>Similarly to Study 2, we followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311419366">Muthén’s (1994)</xref> five-step procedure to assess the multilevel structure of data and examine the emergence of learning at the team level of analysis. Therefore, we first performed a confirmatory factor analysis at the individual level (i.e., <italic>N</italic> = 3,593) on the four team learning processes and on team performance. We constructed a model with five factors (i.e., intuition, interpretation, integration, codification, and team performance) loading separately, Satorra-Bentler scaled χ<sup>&amp;#50;</sup>(78) = 511.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = .95, NFI = .94, IFI = .95, RMSEA = .06. All factor loadings were satisfactory (ranging from .50 to .88) and significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Further, the proposed five-factor model performed better than plausible alternative models (e.g., a four-factor model combining interpretation and integration or a three-factor model combining interpretation, integration, and codification), thus providing evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for the constructs studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311419366">Bagozzi et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we computed the ICC(1) for each factor indicator in order to determine the level of between-group variance. The ICC(1) values for all the items ranged from .10 to .22, demonstrating sufficient between-group variation to statistically warrant the use of multilevel analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311419366">Dyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206311419366">James, 1982</xref>). We then conducted the MSEM analysis on the sample pooled within-group and between-group covariance matrices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0149206311419366">Table 4</xref>). As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206311419366">Figure 1</xref>, MSEM modeled our individual- and team-level constructs simultaneously at both levels (i.e., team learning was modeled as a second-order latent factor at the team level composed of first-order latent factors represented at both levels, influencing team performance).</p>

<title>Discriminant validity</title>
<p>Similar to Study 2, we empirically assessed the distinctiveness of our measure of team learning by performing another multilevel analysis including two additional group processes: a three-item measure of team coordination (α = .87) and a five-item measure of team communication (α = .83), adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206311419366">Hoegl et al. (2004)</xref>. The three-factor multilevel model (i.e., team learning, team coordination, and team communication) fitted the data sufficiently well, Bentler-Liang likelihood ratio statistic (109) = 537.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = .96, NFI = .95, IFI = .96, RMSEA = .05, with all item loadings being high (range .58 to .96) and significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Additional evidence for discriminant validity was provided by the fact that in each pairwise test the chi-square difference between the unconstrained and the constrained model (fixing the correlation between any two factors at the value of 1) was significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206311419366">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>).

<sec id="section19-0149206311419366">
<title>Criterion-related and incremental validity</title>
<p>Consistent with Study 2, team learning (as a second-order factor) was found to relate positively and significantly with performance at the team level of analysis (β = .60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0149206311419366">Table 5</xref>), thus providing evidence of criterion-related validity.

<p>In addition, to assess the <italic>incremental</italic> validity of our scale we performed a multilevel analysis including a more traditional operationalization (i.e., average scores) of our team learning items.

<title>Measurement equivalence</title>
<p>Because we collected data from different countries (EU-27 member states), we further tested the assumption that our scales measured equivalent constructs across settings (i.e., measurement equivalence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206311419366">Mullen, 1995</xref>). Given the very large number of countries in the sample (i.e., from all 27 member states) and the highly unbalanced number of observations from each country, it would be impractical to conduct tests of measurement equivalence across all possible country pairs. We therefore first classified countries into four groups (i.e., leaders, followers, moderate innovators, and catching-up)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0149206311419366">7</xref></sup> based on their innovation performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206311419366">European Commission, 2010</xref>; recall that the data set for Study 3 was part of a wider research project examining the performance of R &amp; D and innovation projects across the European Union).</p>
<p>ANOVA <italic>F</italic> statistics on our learning and team performance measures showed no statistical differences (<italic>p</italic> values ranged from .42 to .94) between the four groups of countries, hence providing evidence of metric equivalence. In addition, we performed simple confirmatory factor analyses across all possible pairs of the four groups of countries, using a five-factor measurement model (i.e., intuition, interpretation, integration, codification, and team performance), to determine whether the assumption of metric equivalence was justified. In these analyses, we constrained the factor loadings to be equal across each pair of country groups and left error variances free to be estimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206311419366">Vandenberg &amp; Lance, 2000</xref>). In all cases, the five-factor model showed good fit to the data (CFI ranged from .94 to .97; RMSEA ranged from .04 to .07), and factor loadings were similar across each pair of country groups (ranging from .49 to .91; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Further, a nonsignificant change in chi-square between the constrained and unconstrained models in all confirmatory factor analyses (Δχ<sup>2</sup> ranged from 28.27 to 41.48; <italic>p</italic> values ranged from .27 to .49) provided additional evidence of metric equivalence for our measures.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>The field of team learning has over the years accumulated important scholarly work, which, however, has paid only limited attention to some key conceptual and methodological issues that pertain to its character as a collective phenomenon. In this study, we attempted to portray learning in teams in all its subtlety and complexity as a phenomenon that transcends individual contributions to materialize at the team level. To this end, we integrated learning theory with multilevel thinking to better explain the structure and function of the team learning construct. Specifically, building on the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan et al. (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">Morgeson and Hofmann (1999)</xref>, we examined (1) how learning occurs and emerges from individual members to become an enduring team property and (2) how team learning functions to produce specific performance outcomes. In so doing, we empirically examined a set of untested propositions regarding learning in teams and validated the measurement of team learning using advanced multilevel methods. Such an approach addresses several recent calls for building ties between individual and team levels of analysis in learning and teamwork research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206311419366">Humphrey, Morgeson, &amp; Mannor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311419366">Kozlowski &amp; Ilgen, 2006</xref>) and makes an important contribution by clarifying the definition and demonstrating what is important to conceptualize and examine (i.e., structure and function) when studying a significant collective phenomenon such as team learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311419366">Corley &amp; Gioia, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In keeping with the basic principles of multilevel theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">Morgeson &amp; Hofmann, 1999</xref>), our first goal was to clarify and measure the <italic>processes</italic> through which learning unfolds as a group-level construct, that is, the structure of its emergence. Unlike much of the existing conceptualizations (and measurements) of team learning, we drew from the well-known model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan et al. (1999)</xref> to argue that learning originates from individual members and takes shape at the team level through the four sociocognitive processes of intuition, interpretation, integration, and codification. We found strong empirical evidence indicating that these four processes should be modeled at the individual and group levels of analysis, as respectively theorized, and jointly defined learning as an emergent property of the team. To our knowledge, the results reported here provide the first empirical test of propositions derived from Crossan et al.’s framework as they pertain to team learning. Specifically, we demonstrated that individual members’ intuitive cognitions and dialectical interactions through the processes of interpretation and integration, together with knowledge codification, determine the structure of team learning emergence at the team level of analysis. As explained above, intuition is a distinctively individual phenomenon and interpretation “carries” individual contributions onto the team level, thus bridging the gap between the two, whereas integration and codification are manifested at the collective level. It is precisely in these terms that learning in teams is a second-order, emergent collective property and not just the simple aggregation of individual experiences.</p>
<p>As noted above, to our knowledge, these cross-level relationships have never been empirically modeled and verified. Our results are therefore important for a number of reasons. First, and foremost, they portray team learning as what it really is: an emergent, collective property that builds on, but cannot be reduced to, individual contributions. In so doing, we clarify the internal dynamics by which learning unfolds. Specifically, our results point to individual cognition and action as the elemental content of team learning, thereby verifying one of the fundamental premises of organizational learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311419366">Fiol &amp; Lyles, 1985</xref>). Next, they corroborate the hitherto untested notion that team learning unfolds hierarchically (i.e., from the individual to the team level), thus suggesting that team learning should be conceptualized and measured as a two-level, rather than a single-level, phenomenon. To date, research has failed to recognize explicitly the inherently multilevel nature of team learning, offering incomplete explanations of how learning—a distinctively individual capacity—transforms into a collective property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311419366">Kozlowski &amp; Ilgen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311419366">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>). Further, in adopting such a multilevel perspective, our analysis delineates the basic cognitive processes through which learning is realized. In this way, we are able to offer a fairly complete account of the activities that team members individually and the group as a whole engage in to process knowledge so as to adapt and improve, consistent with the key propositions of organizational learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311419366">Argyris &amp; Schön, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 2002</xref>). Finally, our study elucidates the structure of team learning emergence in a way that attempts to align the level of theory with the level of measurement and the level of statistical analysis of the team learning construct. A failure to do so can generate imprecision and lead to controversial or erroneous conclusions, often described as “fallacies of the wrong level” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206311419366">Rousseau, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to explicating issues of structure, that is, issues connected to how team learning emerges as a collective phenomenon, our findings shed light on the performance <italic>outcomes</italic> that team learning generates. This relates to the question of function of an emerging (collective) structure. According to multilevel theorists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311419366">Li &amp; Cropanzano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206311419366">Ployhart et al., 2006</xref>), the combined investigation of structure and function is essential for developing concrete and meaningful multilevel constructs, such as team learning. As Morgeson and Hofmann note, “A functional analysis provides the scholar with a language and useful heuristic for theory development” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">1999</xref>: 259).</p>
<p>Seen in this light, a functional analysis of team learning is useful because it reminds us that the processes of team learning and its performance implications are two distinct, albeit closely related, concepts. In some cases, existing research has equated learning occurrence with changes in performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311419366">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>). A team, however, may carry out certain learning activities without realizing any concrete performance benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311419366">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>) or even experiencing unproductive results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206311419366">Bunderson &amp; Sutcliffe, 2003</xref>). In this study, we explicitly distinguish <italic>learning as an outcome</italic>, seen here as the process of codification, from the performance impact of that learning. Our findings, similar to those of other scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311419366">Choo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 1999</xref>), indicate a positive functional relationship between team learning and team performance.</p>
<p>From a methodological standpoint, the present work offers a fresh empirical contribution by utilizing <italic>multilevel construct validation</italic> procedures for team learning. Although an increasing body of research employs multilevel analytic techniques in the context of teams (e.g., hierarchical linear modeling; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311419366">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206311419366">Humphrey et al., 2009</xref>), there has been no attempt to verify the factor structure of team learning simultaneously at the individual and team levels of analysis. To this end, we used MSEM to provide a more robust test of the construct validity of team learning, accounting for the inherent dependence of individual members nested within teams. MSEM adds methodological rigor by testing a complex theoretical construct that transcends multiple levels of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206311419366">Bliese, Chan, &amp; Ployhart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206311419366">Croon &amp; van Veldhoven, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The pool of items we have developed and the dimensionality of the construct were validated in the first study. Studies 2 and 3 served to establish and further enhance the generalizability of the multilevel factor structure and provided evidence of convergent, discriminant, criterion-related, and incremental validity in two additional, independent samples. In all studies, we obtained very satisfactory factor loadings and fit indices. Taken together, the validated scales of the four constructs offer, we hope, a theoretically rich and methodologically sound basis for further research on team learning as an emergent phenomenon with related antecedents and outcomes that span levels of analysis.</p>
<p>Our findings may also have <italic>implications for practice</italic>. The fundamental processes of intuition, interpretation, integration, and codification, as conceptualized in this work, along with their corresponding measures, could serve as validated diagnostic tools for improving team design and adaptability. Following such diagnostics, teams could be designed and structured in such ways as to enhance intermember communication and collective action in accordance with the basic dimensions of learning processes outlined here. The scales developed here offer firms an easily administered and valid instrument for assessing team learning. Practitioners, therefore, may now have at their disposal an instrument, specifically developed and validated at the group level of analysis, to use during team-building and development activities, learning orientation surveys, and selection of new team members.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research Directions</title>
<p>As with all empirical work, ours is not without limitations that future research could seek to address. First, interested scholars could validate the scales developed here and replicate our findings in different empirical contexts. In all three studies, we investigated innovative project teams operating in technology- and knowledge-intensive environments. Such teams perform highly complex tasks that demand finely tuned learning activities, aiming to produce new knowledge that is critical to their success. Although our data sets consisted of teams from different national and industrial contexts, there is considerable merit in research confirming the present findings in teams that perform tasks of routine nature or that operate within less knowledge-intensive environments; this will undoubtedly add to the generalizability of our scales.</p>
<p>Future research could also provide a thorough examination of the nomological network surrounding team learning across the individual and team levels of analysis. Previous work has shown that factors such as individual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206311419366">Reagans, Argote, &amp; Brooks, 2005</xref>), team psychological safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311419366">Edmondson, 1999</xref>), and group cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311419366">Wong, 2004</xref>) are significantly related to a team’s learning behavior. Those factors can affect the system of interactions among group members, which, in turn, may have an important role in determining the emergence of learning as a collective phenomenon. Our work clearly falls short of examining these effects. Additional analyses in this direction will be particularly useful for the validation of our findings.</p>
<p>Another limitation pertains to the nature of our data, which were cross-sectional and did not cover the longitudinal pattern of team learning emergence. Our cross-sectional multilevel models examined how learning emerges hierarchically, from the level of the individual to that of the team. Clearly, our treatment of learning emergence is static: It involves the simultaneous examination of different sociocognitive processes at different levels of analysis. Although this hierarchical approach has evolved as the primary means of explicating multilevel phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311419366">Mathieu &amp; Chen, 2011</xref>), it clearly fails to provide an account of how learning unfolds over time. A longitudinal design would thus be a very promising line of research; it could offer important explanations on how, for instance, different learning processes develop at different rates and influence each other over time (i.e., what Crossan and her colleagues call “feed-forward” and “feedback” learning flows). To illustrate, intuition as a lower (individual-) level process may develop more quickly and affect interpretation when a team is at the forming stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311419366">Kozlowski &amp; Klein, 2000</xref>), whereas codification may feed back and affect individual intuitions when the team task is near completion. A longitudinal design would therefore allow us to better articulate the dynamic nature of learning in teams, emerging episodically within different stages of a team’s life cycle in response to shifting task conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206311419366">Marks et al., 2001</xref>). Future research utilizing new methodologies such as latent growth modeling can thus integrate hierarchical and longitudinal multilevel approaches to extend our pattern of results and further advance the learning literature.</p>
<p>Furthermore, like much of the existing work in this area (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311419366">Gibson &amp; Vermeulen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206311419366">Van der Vegt &amp; Bunderson, 2005</xref>), most of our data were self-reported measures. Although there is evidence that people generally perceive their social environments accurately and provide correct performance evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206311419366">Alper, Tjosvold, &amp; Law, 2000</xref>), utilizing “objective” indexes could offer a more robust test of the functional relationship between team learning and team performance. Further, in Study 3 the learning process of intuition was measured with referent-shift items, which contradicts its individual-level definition. Although these concerns are somewhat mitigated by the fact that intuition was included in the empirical models only at the individual level (as in Study 2), its measurement properties should be interpreted with caution. Our preferred measurement of intuition is that of Study 2 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206311419366">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, in Study 3 the team learning and team performance measures were collected from the same respondents (i.e., team members) and, thus, may have been affected by common source bias. Even though the results of various additional analyses and tests provided evidence against the presence of common source bias, we cannot rule out its potential effect. Nonetheless, we note that all our data were collected from multiple respondents for each team studied, while in Study 2 different sources were employed for measuring team learning processes (i.e., team members) and team performance (i.e., team supervisors); these increase our confidence in the validity of our results.</p>
<p>Finally, we consider it important to emphasize that even though we utilize key aspects of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan et al.’s (1999)</xref> learning framework, our focus in this study is learning in teams, not organizations. Our focus on team learning extends the theoretical argumentation of Crossan and her colleagues by introducing an intermediary step to their model. Recall that Crossan et al. proceed from integration at the team level to organization-wide institutionalization of what has been learned. Our model suggests an intervening step in the transition from the team to the organization, that of knowledge codification occurring at the team level of analysis.</p>
<p>Crossan et al. note that “Institutionalized [i.e., organizational] learning cannot capture all the ongoing learning at the individual and group levels” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">1999</xref>: 530). Our model and findings imply that institutionalized learning will likely capture only learning that teams are able to codify. If this conjecture is valid, it opens up promising possibilities for future research on why organizational learning and renewal are so difficult to achieve. Teams do not always codify what they have learned; even if they do so, there always remains some important tacit element in the knowledge gained that is not amenable to codification. What underlies a team’s propensity to codify (parts of) the knowledge gained from its operations? Under what conditions can the team do so effectively? These and similar questions can perhaps provide significant insights on the question of organizational renewal along the path Crossan et al. developed in their seminal article.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the work at hand demonstrates the value of multilevel theory and related analytic methods for understanding the emergence of learning in teams. We have put forth considerable effort not to commit fallacies of the wrong level through aligning the level of theory with the level of statistical analysis and the level of measurement. Understanding how learning emerges through intuition, interpretation, integration, and codification is likely to be an important means of improving not only team but also organizational performance.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan, Lane, and White’s (1999)</xref> ultimate goal is to examine how organizations (not teams) learn. They therefore conceptualize institutionalization at the organizational level, referring to it as a process “of embedding learning that has occurred by individuals and groups into the organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">Crossan et al., 1999</xref>: 525). However, the key idea in the conceptualization of this process can be transferred and applied to the study of learning at the team level in that it represents the direct, codified outcomes of learning that have resulted in the course of interactions among members within the team; it is in this way that team learning persists over time, independent of individual contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311419366">Gibson &amp; Vermeulen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311419366">Wilson, Goodman, &amp; Cronin, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>The learning process of interpretation has a primarily social (collective) character. It initiates at the conscious elements of individual members, but it is constructed and fully realized as a shared, team-level property via a series of cross-member interactions. As Crossan et al. argue, “Interpreting is a social activity that creates and refines common language, clarifies images, and creates shared meaning and understanding. Equivocality [i.e., diversity of individual understandings] is reduced through interpreting. . . . Groups will have an interpretive capacity related to the makeup of the group and to the group dynamics. As the interpretive process moves beyond the individual and becomes embedded within the workgroup, it becomes integrative. Individual interpretive processes come together around a shared understanding of what is possible, and individuals interact and attempt to enact that possibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311419366">1999</xref>: 528). This means that interpretation is shaped as a group process reflecting a socially constructed reality and thus should be better measured with referent-shift (e.g., “we” or “in our team”) items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206311419366">Klein, Conn, Smith, &amp; Sorra, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311419366">Morgeson &amp; Hofmann, 1999</xref>).</p>

<p>For example, the distribution of the received questionnaires is 70.2% for EU 5th Framework Programmes (FP5) and 29.8% for EU 6th Framework Programmes (FP6) projects, which is almost identical to the distribution in the original sample. Similarly, a detailed breakdown of survey responses per program (FP5 and FP6) for the different thematic areas, funding “instruments,” and types of participating organizations showed that the data are representative of the aggregate numbers in the sample.
