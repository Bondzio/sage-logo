<p>“Let’s do it again,” shout the children as they complete an activity in music class. A casual observer would be aware that the children are fully engaged but may not be sure of the lesson focus. Is it to help children learn a new orchestra piece? To teach about the beat? To teach form? To teach rhythm? To teach children to read a music score? To teach them how to manage themselves in space? To help children practice thinking and problem solving? This article explores the power of movement to teach multiple music concepts, problem solving, and social skills simultaneously and effectively.</p>

<title>Moving Music</title>
<p>Sitting on the floor, the children imitated the teacher, who tapped the beat on her lap, as the recorded orchestra music played. After the first phrase, the teacher responded to the next phrase by tapping the long and short sounds of the melody on her shoulders as the children imitated. A leap of both hands into the air was the response to an accented orchestral sound at the cadence. As the music repeated, the actions repeated. Other actions included tip-toeing fingers on the floor to staccato sounds and rapidly rolling arms around each other in the B section of the music. “Let’s do it again,” the children exclaimed as the music ended.</p>
<p>The teacher suggested that the second time through they listen to the music but move only when they heard the strong accent, leaping their hands into the air. They could also twirl their arms when they heard the fast sounds in the B section. She challenged them to freeze during all other parts of the music. The children’s attention and excitement increased as they waited for the accented sound and the “twirling” section.</p>
<p>On the third listening, the children were invited to stand and “leap” their bodies on the accented sound and twirl their bodies instead of arms to the B section. They were allowed to practice leaping and twirling and freezing before the music was played. The children stood frozen in space until the appropriate music cues and seemed to delight not only with the movements, but also with the music they heard while not moving. Other repetitions included moving to only the “marching” phrase or only the long-short-long-short skipping pattern phrase or only the “tip-toeing” section while freezing during other parts. Finally, the children moved to the whole composition, listening to the music to guide their movements. Such marching, skipping, tip-toeing, leaping, and twirling you never did see as the children moved in response to the music, through space and around each other, immersed in the music.</p>
<p>As a last challenge, the teacher organized the children into four groups—marching, skipping, leaping, and tip-toeing. Each group was to move only during their part of the music. All four groups twirled during the B section. Let’s do it again,” exclaimed the children.</p>
<p>Movement is a major way young children experience life. Frank R. Wilson, medical doctor and musician, explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>When the body is not moving, the brain is not growing. The mind does not come into being or grow without bodily movement. Everything that we experience in life depends on the transformation of brain activity into muscular activity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371312474463">Wilson, 1985</xref>, p. 41)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The great educator and musician Émile Jaque-Dalcroze, who restructured his university theory classes to focus on movement, reminded us,
<disp-quote>
<p>The greater the variety of movements taught the young child by his mother, the better equipped will he be for taking full advantage of the lessons both of school and of life itself. And when this truth has become more widely known and practiced, there will come about a considerable amelioration in the human race, and the many problems of education will be more e<italic>asy</italic> [italics added] to solve. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048371312474463">Jaques-Dalcroze, 1931</xref> p. 101.)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at what the children were learning through movement as we think about how “easy” it was to teach and engage them.</p>
<sec id="section2-1048371312474463">
<title>Music Ideas</title>
<p>Through movement, children were experiencing a variety of music ideas, including beat, rhythm, phrasing, changing motives, articulation, dynamics, and energy. If Wilson is correct, then the brain was growing at an immense rate as children analyzed what they heard in relation to what they felt in movement.</p>

<sec id="section3-1048371312474463">
<title>Memory and Value</title>
<p>Four brain-compatible facts about learning music <italic>by ear</italic> are evident in the process described above.</p>
<list id="list1-1048371312474463" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Music is learned by hearing it. (Not talking about it)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Repetition in the hearing is essential. (Many repetitions needed for mastery)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Repetition must be meaningful to the learner. (If not meaningful to the learners, they become bored)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The most efficient, brain-compatible learning takes place by immersion in the whole while focusing on parts within that whole.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Because the children heard the music many times and were guided by different activities to help them stay engaged, the orchestral piece has become a part of the children’s lifetime music repertoire. Because the repetitions were challenging to the children, they loved the experience, including the music. The teacher let the music do the teaching and did not need to talk, making it easy for her to teach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1048371312474463">
<title>Focus</title>
<p>Imitation is the way young children learn. They are master observers and imitators. The teacher’s actions provided a developmentally-appropriate model for the children to imitate and at the same time to feel. The feeling of the movement coordinating with the sounds helped the children focus on the particular music elements. Focus was intensified as the children waited to move to certain parts while listening without moving to other parts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1048371312474463">
<title>Delayed Gratification</title>
<p>Waiting for certain parts of the music before moving provided challenge for the children. They love to move and want to move, but they disciplined themselves to wait, delaying the gratification of moving. According to research, the ability to delay gratification is the single most important indicator of success as children grow up (Goldman, 1985). Music activities such as this one give children opportunities to practice delayed gratification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1048371312474463">
<title>Child Development</title>
<p>As children participated in this music event, they practiced self-control (stopping and starting in appropriate places), self in space (freely moving in space with others without colliding), large and small motor coordination (marching, skipping, tip-toeing, twirling, leaping, with arms and then with their entire bodies), directionality (deciding whether to move forward, backward, sideways, around without losing control), and creativity (deciding how to twirl and do other movements, deciding where to go in the room, how to use space and work around other children).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-1048371312474463">
<title>Mapping Music</title>
<p>In an effort to experiment with a visual representation of the orchestral music selection, the teacher invited the children to “read” a music map as they listened to the music. Music maps are carefully designed by the teacher to represent certain elements in the music and to encourage children to see as well as move to the phrases, motives, sections, beats, rhythms, articulation, and so on in the music (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1048371312474463">Figure 1</xref>). The children were excited by the challenge of making the lines match the music. When they got lost, they would listen to the music and then find their place. They wanted to do it again and again in order to master the reading. That the experience was valued is evident by the desire of the children to listen repeatedly. Reports from parents that children wanted to listen to the music at home also indicated that the children had come to value the music. The drawing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1048371312474463">Figure 2</xref> is a copy of a map a four-year-old child made while listening to the music at home.</p>

<p>Jaques-Dalcroze describes music learning as multisensory, including “the ear that hears, the body that feels and senses, and the brain that imagines, judges and corrects” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371312474463">Abramson, 1986</xref>, p. 32). He believed that the teaching process should be a constant spiral beginning with hearing leading to moving, moving leading to sensing, sensing leading to analyzing, and analyzing leading to reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371312474463">Abramson, 1986</xref>, p. 36).</p>
<p>As the children participated in the series of lessons described here, they were engaged in a process that coordinates the eyes that see, the ears that hear, the body that feels and senses, and the brain that imagines, judges, and corrects. Their experiences began with hearing, which guided the moving, leading to sensing then analyzing (with the body). It was an easy step to “reading” the map. As the children gain in years and experience, the same journey could take them to reading traditional notation. While these young children cannot yet articulate what they “know,” they have heard (ears), felt (body), sensed (body and soul), and seen (eyes) the following information about music and themselves:</p>
<list id="list2-1048371312474463" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Music has a steady beat.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Music may be organized into sections that repeat or contrast.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sounds may be long or short creating rhythm patterns.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sounds may be staccato or legato.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Phrases may end with a cadence.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sounds may be loud or soft to express.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I value orchestral music from long ago.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I can follow symbols for sound (I can “read”).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I am a successful musician.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The children in this class were all 4 years old, and the music was the “March” from <italic>The Nutcracker Suite</italic>. But this process works with children of all ages, and it can be explored with many different music selections. In this age of continual focus on assessment and test scores, movement might be a great alternative to pencil–paper tests for evaluating children’s knowledge. And what greater criteria of a job well done than a voice from the children saying, “Let’s do it again!”</p>
