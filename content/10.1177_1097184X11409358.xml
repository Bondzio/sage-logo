<p>Michael Chabon’s newest nonfiction work, <italic>Manhood for Amateurs</italic>, offers another example of the breadth of the author’s range, this time drawing on his own life for material. And while the text can be accused of straying into self-indulgent territory, overall I found that in this work, Chabon makes an effort to offset this with an injection of self-deprecation. In his fiction and nonfiction writing, Chabon has written about, among other things, the world of writing, aging professors, adolescents, detectives, rogues of the Caucasus Mountains and now, the complexities of navigating the male adult life. The title suggests that this is one area in which Chabon is decidedly not an expert. As such, the essays are neither preachy nor self-indulgent, but rather the refreshing confessions of an overgrown boy whose writing talents suggest that he is anything but immature.</p>
<p>This book comes at the ideal time for examining the grown male—in Chabon’s case, the role of a father and partner. Books and articles exploring the tension between mothers and fathers working in and outside the home, the role of parents and their relationships with their children, and criticism and celebration of individuals of all genders who eschew the nuclear model have moved from the scholarly world to the mainstream in recent years. Terms such as the “mommy wars” posit a binary between different kinds of mothers, and suggest that, rather than an organic and lifelong flexibility of choices, parents opt for one path only and for that they are both condemned and heralded. Similarly, the increasing visibility of an “active” father, in some corners, has been scrutinized for motives and abilities. “Basement boys,” the man–child, caricatures of overgrown boys who cannot commit to the adult life have become standard fare for any discussion of the adult male. This is a period for both continued flexibility of gender roles and a challenge to the moulds that bind individuals to existing models. Chabon’s book arrives and asks the question, “but what if I haven’t figured it out yet?”</p>
<p>Chabon explores how his life experience is shaped by his manhood: he addresses, for example, the free pass that he receives from women when seen in public caring for his children alone. He observes the double standard that sets impossible standards for mothers, but congratulates fathers for merely keeping their children alive, all the while somehow convincing us that he <italic>is</italic> a good dad. He does so with honesty, humor, and personal anecdotes that capture the reader’s attention and empathy from the very start, and gives credence to both individual and shared struggles of adulthood.</p>
<p>Chabon moves from the past, using his parents as historical models of parenthood and partnership, to his contemporary challenges with navigating the maze of responsible and successful adult life of friendship, partnership, and parenthood. He convinces the reader in the end that there is no such thing as a model man—but this, he suggests, is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is Chabon’s discussion of how his own boyhood experience shaped both his development as an adult and his experience as a parent. Chabon includes within his essays his love of comics, a medium he has explored in his Pulitzer Prize-winning <italic>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</italic> (2000), and one that has become acceptable nostalgia for those for whom boyish things are considered impediments to development. Chabon describes his feminine ideal in terms of the formidable Big Barda of comic yore (“A Woman of Valor”), establishing comic hero knowledge as a touchstone through which he became the man he is and later, by which he can connect with his sons, but, he admits, not his daughters. Chabon discovers, notably, in “Surefire Lines” that the ease with which his boyhood allows him to relate to his sons—in this case, in drawing comic heroes—does not extend easily to his daughters. Chabon acknowledges this honestly, confessing that the bond of boyhood can sometimes create more easily forged father–son relationships. He lets himself off a little easily on the daughter front, however, skirting the issue of this discrepancy between his relationships with his children of different genders. Here lies a missed opportunity to contribute to the discussion of parent–child models, something that Chabon suggests he might engage with, but merely touches upon.</p>
<p>In <italic>Manhood</italic>, Chabon is grappling with challenging issues of gender and parenthood, of self-development and maturity. The gift of this book to this ongoing dialogue, however, is the accessibility of the writing of an admittedly flawed, and changing, man.</p>
