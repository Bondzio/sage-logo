<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sexual contact between men remains the predominant means of HIV transmission in men, whether in Western Europe, North America, or Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812465032">1</xref>]. Recent European data show a 19% increase in HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men (MSM) between 2004 and 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812465032">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812465032">3</xref>]. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are also on the rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812465032">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812465032"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812465032">6</xref>]. In Norway, a country with a relatively low HIV rate (5.8 per 100,000) and where the present study draws its sample, trends are similar. From 2010 to 2011, new HIV diagnoses among MSM increased by over 14%, representing the highest number of HIV diagnoses in this group any year and a tripling of the number of cases relative to only a decade ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812465032">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Consistent with these increases in HIV and STI diagnoses are profound changes in safer sex practices among MSM. In a variety of European populations of gay, bisexual, and other MSM, self-reported unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) presently range from 53% to 71% of those sampled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812465032">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812465032"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812465032">10</xref>]. Among HIV-negative MSM, any incidence of UAI between non-primary partners is traditionally regarded as an HIV transmission risk and there is international concern over the increasing rates of UAI in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812465032">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812465032"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812465032">13</xref>]. Following these trends regarding unprotected sex are sexual behaviours among MSM aimed at reducing the risk of HIV transmission, such as serosorting, which involves choosing sexual partners thought to have a similar HIV infection status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812465032">14</xref>]. There are some indications that a rise in STI transmission without a concomitant rise in HIV transmission might be explained by partner selection by HIV serostatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812465032">15</xref>]. Yet, as an HIV prevention strategy, it is a highly uncertain measure as it requires accurate knowledge of HIV serostatus for both partners and thorough disclosure. Although it also fails to prevent acquisition of other STIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812465032">15</xref>], recent studies have documented its increasingly widespread adoption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812465032">16</xref>]. Studies in France and Switzerland found that 22% and 38% of the MSM respondents, respectively, engaged in serosorting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812465032">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812465032">17</xref>]. There are no data on serosorting among MSM in Norway. In fact, to date, there seems to exist only one large-scale study on Norwegian MSM, with data collected in 2007 that identified correlates of STIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812465032">18</xref>].</p>
<p>The evolving context of new HIV infections among MSM in northern Europe and Norway in particular makes pertinent an updated understanding of the predictive dimensions of the sexual risk behaviours of MSM, particularly those who practice UAI with non-primary partners. The current study offers a contribution in this direction as up-to-date knowledge of factors associated with high-risk sexual behaviour is a prerequisite for evidence-based strategies toward reducing the incidence of HIV in MSM. Identification of predictors of UAI with non-primary partners and the sociosexual profile of MSM who engage in such higher-risk sexual behaviour is necessary to strengthen prevention and contribute to behavioural surveillance among the population MSM.</p>

<sec id="section2-1403494812465032" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The data described here were collected as part of the European MSM Internet Survey (EMIS), which was a collaborative cross-sectional study taking place during the summer 2010 in 38 countries across Europe. Full details regarding the methodology for EMIS are available elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812465032">19</xref>]. The current research is based on the dataset of respondents who stated that they lived in Norway.</p>
<sec id="section3-1403494812465032">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The participant recruitment and data collection were done through the Internet during 12 weeks in June through August 2010. In addition to the dating sites Gaydar, Qruiser, and Gay Romeo, the Norway-based websites Gaysir.no and Helseutvalget.no (Gay and Lesbian Health Norway) were used to recruit participants who lived in Norway. Men who visited the above websites were presented with banner and pop-up advertisements inviting them to participate in the study. By clicking on the advertisement (or typing the study URL), men were linked to a landing page where they selected a language (25 languages available) before they were routed to the study website, which detailed the research. Participants were next routed to the survey question if they declared they had read and understood the aim of the study and were legally of age to have consensual sex with men in their country of residence. The survey was completely anonymous (no cookies or other trace files installed or IP-addresses saved) and offered no recompense.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494812465032">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The survey consisted of about 280 questions. However, because it was tailored using intra-survey filters that depended on the respondent’s answer to previous questions, time to completion was only about 20 minutes. The survey variables examined in the present research covered six main dimensions. The first was a general description of respondents (education, age, etc.). For the multivariate analyses, education was dichotomised as low (International Standardised Classification of Educational Degrees (ISCED) 1–4) and high (ISCED 5–6). HIV serostatus at the time of the survey was self-reported by the respondents in response to the question ‘Have you ever received an HIV test result?’ to which the respondents could answer ‘No, I have never received an HIV test result/Yes, I’ve tested positive (I have HIV infection)/Yes, my last test was negative (I did not have HIV infection at the time of the test.’ Cognitive variables were loneliness, ease of saying no to sex that is not wanted, internalised homonegativity, and HIV knowledge. For the purposes of the analyses, data on some variables were dichotomised: ease of saying no to sex that is not wanted and loneliness had a five-point answer category (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither/not sure, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree). A conservative approach with answer options 1–3 were coded 1 and answer options 4–5 were coded 2. Internalised homonegativity was measured with the cross- culturally validated ‘Reactions to homosexuality’ scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812465032">20</xref>]. The score range was 0–6 and a higher score represented greater homonegative internalisation. HIV knowledge was computed from 16 statements about HIV transmission, testing, and treatment. The scale was computed such that a higher score indicated higher knowledge (range 0–16).</p>
<p>Two environmental variables were included in the current analysis: exposure to homonegative violence (a higher score indicated being exposed to greater levels of homonegative violence) and whether condoms had been available when the respondents had wanted one. In the area of sexual behaviours, three variables were incorporated: number of non-steady anal intercourse partners, whether the respondents had engaged in sex abroad with a non-primary partner, and whether they had visited a sex-related venue (backroom, sex club, sex party, gay sauna, porn cinema, cruising location where men meet for sex). Various additional sexual behaviours were assessed for a description of the respondents’ sociosexual profile, as were diagnoses of STIs. Respondents were asked about condom use when they had anal intercourse with casual partners during the past 12 months, and when condoms were not always used, the HIV serostatus of the sexual partner was investigated using the three following questions: ‘Have you had unprotected anal intercourse with a non-steady partner who you knew at the time was HIV positive/HIV negative/whose HIV status you did not know or think about at the time’ (yes/no)? Adopting the approach used by Velter and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812465032">17</xref>] and Parsons and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812465032">21</xref>], the answers to the latter question and to the self-reported HIV-test result question were then combined in order to ascertain whether the respondents practiced serosorting with casual partners, as the term ‘serosorting’ itself was not used in the survey. Thus, participants were considered to have serosorted with casual partners when they stated they knew their own HIV serostatus and that they in the past 12 months had UAI with a non-steady partner of the same HIV serostatus as themselves (similar to Velter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812465032">17</xref>] and Parsons et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812465032">21</xref>], UAI with men of a different or unknown HIV serostatus was considered not to practice serosorting).</p>
<p>Finally, the sixth domain of interest encompassed use of various drugs traditionally associated with unprotected sex among MSM (party drugs [ecstacy, amphetamines, crystal methamphetamine, GHB, ketamine], cannabis or LSD, benzodiazepines, poppers, Viagra, alcohol).</p>

<sec id="section5-1403494812465032">
<title>Objective</title>
<p>This analysis aimed to ascertain predictors of UAI with non-primary partners and to characterise the sociosexual profile of MSM who engage in such higher-risk sexual behaviour.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494812465032">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Statistical analyses (with SPSS 18.0) followed the main study objective, to identify predictors of UAI with non-primary partners in the past 12 months, therefore, multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted. To assess the proposed model in predicting UAI with non-primary partners, the dichotomised sexual risk behaviour, the enter method with confidence interval of 95% was used. For this analysis, the sample was restricted to respondents reporting anal intercourse with one or more non-primary partners in the previous 12 months. Eighteen predictor variables were considered to capture each of the survey’s major foci and attempt to examine multiple domains of potential predictors amenable to direct prevention initiatives. The pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> explained variance coefficient, along with the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit Chi<sup>2</sup> statistic are reported. Lastly, having identified the main predictors of UAI with non-primary partners, the sociosexual profile of MSM who engaged in UAI with casual partners was examined.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>At the end of study recruitment, 2164 respondents who lived in Norway had submitted answers, but 68 (3.1%) ineligible respondents were removed by the research team, leaving an analytic sample of 2096 MSM. The great majority were recruited from the general interest website Gaysir (81.5%) and from Gay Romeo (11.6%).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812465032">Table I</xref> presents the study participants’ general characteristics. Their average age was 32.88 (SD 11.83). While each of the 19 administrative regions (counties) of Norway was represented, 43.7% of the respondents lived in the county of Oslo. This is reflected in size of place of residence, which shows that 40.5% lived in a city with at least 500,000 inhabitants, although 12.9% lived in a city of less than 10,000 people. The majority of the respondents were well educated, worked full- or part-time, and 82.0% self-labelled as homosexual or gay. Most of the MSM who completed the survey (62.3%) were single and 62.1% stated their last HIV test was negative, but 33.9% did not know their HIV status (they had never received an HIV test result).</p>

<p>Two environmental predictors were included, one of which remained significant in the regression model. The likelihood of engaging in UAI with non-primary partners was higher for men who reported that condoms had not been available when they had wanted one in the last 12 months, compared with men who did not report this situation (OR = 1.58, CI = 1.01–2.48). Of the three sexual behaviour predictors, one remained significant in the multivariate regression model. Men who reported a higher number of non-primary anal intercourse partners in the past 12 months were also more likely than those with fewer partners to engage in UAI with non-primary partners in the same time period (OR = 1.20, CI = 1.12–1.28). There were six alcohol and other drugs predictors included in the model. Participants who reported use of party drugs in the past 12 months were more likely to engage in UAI with non-primary partners (OR = 2.34, CI = 1.09–5.00). Finally, use of Viagra in the last four weeks approached significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05) signalling that men who reported Viagra use were more likely to engage in UAI with non-primary partners (OR = 2.28, CI = 1.00–5.23).</p>

<p>First, the HIV and STI testing behaviour of the respondents was examined. Chi<sup>2</sup> analyses showed that among MSM who reported anal intercourse with non-primary partners in the past 12 months there was no significant difference between men who engaged in UAI with non-primary partners and men who engaged in protected anal sex with respect to testing for HIV (<italic>p</italic> = 0.232) and testing for STIs (<italic>p</italic> = 0.168) in the last 12 months (not tabled). However, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494812465032">Table III</xref>, men who in the last 12 months had engaged in UAI with non-primary partners were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with gonorrhea (<italic>p</italic> = 0.047) and Chlamydia (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in the same time period, and syphilis (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the second Norwegian survey among MSM to recruit a large and diversified sample, and the first to identify the predictive dimensions of unsafe sexual risk behaviours of MSM. It also appears to be one of the few studies having taken place in a Nordic country to examine the sociosexual profile of MSM who engage in UAI with non-primary partners. Relative to the previous MSM study among Norwegian MSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812465032">18</xref>], and in line with developments observed in other European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812465032">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812465032">12</xref>], the occurrence of UAI with non-primary partners appears higher in this sample, with 53.4% reporting UAI with non-primary partners. These men were not more likely to test for HIV or STIs. The prevalence ratio for HIV infection among MSM in this 2010 sample (3.4%) was slightly higher than that reported in the previous study from Norway (1.7%), which may reflect the recent increase in new HIV diagnoses among MSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812465032">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812465032">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Overall, men who were younger than 30 years old, had low education, reported lower HIV knowledge and not having a condom available when they wanted one, were significantly more likely to report UAI with non-primary partners. Such HIV risk behaviour also correlated positively with the number of non-steady anal intercourse partners, use of party drugs, and Viagra.</p>
<p>The finding that young MSM may be at elevated risk for contracting HIV by virtue of their sexual risk behaviour with non-primary partners complements the previous nationwide survey among MSM in Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812465032">18</xref>]. Taken together, there is some evidence that prevention efforts should target younger MSM. This is in concert with the findings that unprotected sexual behaviours were more likely to be reported by men with lower education, which was a main finding also among MSM in Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812465032">22</xref>], and those with lower HIV knowledge. It is possible that these results may be explained by the fact that younger MSM may have had fewer chances to obtain HIV prevention information through traditional education and community information resources or through contact with health staff. Given the distribution of free condoms through bars and various organisations, such as Gay and Lesbian Health Norway, throughout the country, it was unexpected that not having a condom available when one was needed emerged as an independent predictor of UAI with non-primary partners. It indicates that there may be preventive value in scaling-up condom distribution through traditional venues as well as introducing condom distribution, for example machines, in alternative settings, such as schools, public and private sector businesses, and commercial outlets. A recent meta-analysis of international-based structural-level condom distribution interventions concluded that this type of distribution intervention is efficacious for HIV risk behaviours and STIs. The authors recommended making condoms more universally available, accessible, and acceptable in locations reaching high-risk individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812465032">23</xref>].</p>
<p>The findings showed that UAI with non-primary partners correlated positively with the number of non-steady anal intercourse partners and use of party drugs. This pattern of result is similar to the previous study in Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812465032">18</xref>], Scandinavian data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812465032">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812465032">22</xref>], and other northern European studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812465032">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812465032">25</xref>]. A recent cohort study in the Netherlands documented that HIV seroconversion was associated with receptive UAI with non-primary partners and having more than five sexual partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812465032">12</xref>]. As we enter the fourth decade of the HIV epidemic, the results also for Norwegian MSM underscore the continued need for messages and behavioural strategies that encourage a decrease in the number of sex partners. It also seems that addressing the use of party drugs and Viagra should be part of public health and outreach strategies given their role in the context of HIV risk behaviour among men in this sample. However, further research is necessary.</p>
<p>As seroconversion among MSM typically results from high and frequent sexual risk taking, one study interest was identifying among men reporting non-primary partners those men engaging in UAI and another their sociosexual profile. The profile of men engaging in UAI with non-primary partners drawn by these analyses is one that is generally more conducive to STI and HIV transmissions relative to men who reported protected anal sex with non-primary partners. In fact, in the univariate analyses, men engaging in UAI with non-primary partners were more likely to have been diagnosed with various STIs.</p>
<p>The prevalence of STIs within a population may reveal important shifts in sexual practices. A study from San Francisco, which identified a rise in STI transmissions without a concomitant increase in HIV seroconversion among MSM, explained that increased HIV serosorting seemed to offset further expansion of HIV incidence in the city [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812465032">15</xref>]. With regard to Norwegian MSM, the present data suggest that many may be attempting to keep themselves HIV infection safe by engaging in HIV serosorting. The main concern with replacing condom use with this strategy is that it depends on accurate health information and disclosure. But studies that have collected a blood sample and self-reported HIV status indicate high numbers of cases where men wrongly assume they are HIV negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812465032">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812465032">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812465032">27</xref>]. Moreover, reflecting on their last sexual encounter, the majority of men engaging in UAI with non-primary partners reported they neither said anything about their own HIV status nor had any thoughts about the partner’s HIV status. While serosorting in theory can reduce the likelihood of seroconversion – a recent meta-analysis showed that it has efficacy as an HIV prevention strategy when compared with no strategy at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812465032">28</xref>] – it appears to offer limited protection to HIV-negative MSM. Given the less-than-optimal testing behaviour and sexual communication in the current sample, serosorting between non-steady sex partners may confer considerable HIV-transmission risk. Nonetheless, this sample of MSM seems to have absorbed harm reduction information and modified their sexual repertoire with it by serosorting; therefore, they may value opportunities for continued learning about also related harm-reduction strategies like seropositioning. HIV promoters and prevention professionals keen to see more explicit discussions of ways to reduce HIV risk in addition to the use of condoms might connect with the sexual choices of men such as those in this study by disseminating scientific knowledge such as this one, through for example the gay press, gay interest organisations, or HIV/AIDS service organisations.</p>
<p>The sociosexual profile of men engaging in UAI with non-primary partners shows that larger proportions of higher-risk men engaged in sexual behaviours across multiple dimensions, including rimming, fisting, and sex with women (that is more likely to be unprotected). These diverse sexual behaviours, along with some of the UAI predictors, raise the possibility of a sexual subculture where pleasure gains primacy over concern about risk. It may be a relatively small but sexually diverse core group of higher-risk MSM who is implicated in the upsurge of infections in Norway. Whether this is the case or not, the findings speak to the need to raise awareness within MSM populations and particularly higher-risk sexual networks about the necessity for regular and frequent testing as well as honest communication with sexual partners. Although the Norwegian Government offers free HIV antibody testing to MSM and a wide array of prevention services in most areas, especially Oslo county where many of the MSM in this study lived, a bolstering of programs and services seems indicated. The issue of testing as prevention has gained added currency recently with new evidence that HIV-positive individuals on successful antiretroviral treatment are much less likely to infect others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812465032">29</xref>].</p>
<p>This research comes with several limitations. First, the cross-sectional nature of the data prevents causal inferences from being drawn regarding the antecedents of high-risk sexual behaviours and the self-reported behaviours are susceptible to recall inaccuracy. Second, the results must be viewed in light of the sample having been recruited through gay websites, which may involve a skew towards respondents being more urban, younger, single, and have higher education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494812465032">30</xref>]. The size of this sample would seem to provide some assurance of quality, but it is not clear to what degree the findings can be generalised. Future studies on MSM in Norway involving longitudinal prospective cohorts of MSM would be helpful in furthering our understanding of the drivers and contexts of MSM sexual risk behaviours.</p>
<p>Certainly, additional research is warranted, but this anonymous Internet survey fills a gap in the knowledge of the predictive dimensions of sexual risk behaviours of Norwegian MSM and the sociosexual profile of MSM who engage in UAI with non-primary partners. It demonstrates that continuous investments in HIV prevention activities, including education, condom distribution, and testing are needed.</p>
