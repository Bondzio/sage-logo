<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> Within schizophrenia, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is highly prevalent and decreases life expectancy by more than 25 years. Our previous work suggests atypical antipsychotics (AAP) may diminish the cardioprotective benefits of omega 3 (n-3) fatty acids. N-3 metabolism is partially controlled by the fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) gene and the rs174583 T allele may be more cardioprotective. This pilot project examined the relationship between the rs174583 variants and lipids levels (Total Cholesterol (TC), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), and Cholesterol/High Density Lipoprotein ratio (TC/HDL)) in schizophrenia subjects receiving antipsychotic treatment. We hypothesized the FADS2 TT genotype would be associated with decreased cardiometabolic markers in these patients. <bold>Methods:</bold> Schizophrenia subjects receiving antipsychotic treatment &gt; 6 months were included in this cross-sectional analysis and screened for metabolic syndrome criteria and usual dietary intake. Genotyping for the FADS2 rs174583 (C/T) variant was done with pyrosequencing. Subjects were grouped into FADS2 C allele carriers and TT genotype. <bold>Results:</bold> This cohort included 143 subjects with a mean age ( ± s.d.) of 46.11 ( ± 11.30), 62% were Caucasian, 63% were male, and 72% were receiving AAP treatment. Overall, 46% met metabolic syndrome criteria and 57% were smokers. There were no differences in age, gender, race, AAP exposure, smoking status, statin use, and metabolic syndrome based on the FADS2 genotype. Those with the TT genotype had significantly lower levels of total cholesterol (p = 0.04) and LDL (p = 0.01). These relationships persisted after controlling for subject n-3 dietary intake using a regression analysis for the LDL (p = 0.03), TC (p = 0.03), and TC/HDL ratio (p = 0.03). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The FADS2 rs174583 TT genotype may confer cardioprotective benefits to schizophrenia subjects after controlling for n-3 dietary intake. It is unknown if additional n-3 supplementation may be necessary for rs174583 C allele carriers. This data may help to determine pharmacogenetic mechanisms for differential susceptibility of CVD within this population as FADS2 variants may predict patients at low-risk for antipsychotic induced metabolic complications related to lipid metabolism.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder may be twice that of the general population and treatment with atypical antipsychotics increases the risk of MS. Literature suggests patients with schizophrenia are less likely to receive management of concomitant medical conditions. The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with mental illness are less likely to receive interventions for uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors. <bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective cohort study. Medical records were utilized to identify patients with MS and schizophrenia or bipolar disorder during 2008. This study used a control group without mental illness for comparison. Baseline characteristics, abnormal lab values, and interventions were recorded. The primary objective was to evaluate clinical interventions for uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors and determine if patients with mental illness were less likely to receive interventions. Clinical interventions were assessed for abnormal indices of blood pressure, glucose and lipids. The interventions included initiation or dose adjustment of pharmacologic therapy (or switch/discontinuation of atypical antipsychotic in cases) in response to the abnormal lab value. <bold>Results:</bold> Based on the inclusion criteria, 79 cases and 175 controls were evaluated. Of 79 cases, only 38% received an intervention in response to an elevated laboratory value (LDL, HgbA1c or BP) compared to 44% of controls. Subjects with mental illness received similar care for the management of MS (OR = 0.779, 95% CI 0.452-1.342). We further examined individual disease states to identify specific areas for improvement. Diabetes was analyzed and of 26 cases; only 4 (16.6%) received an intervention in comparison to 52 controls, of which 25 (48%) subjects received an intervention. Cases were 78% less likely to receive an intervention in comparison to controls (OR = 0.216, 95% CI 0.065-0.720). Cases and controls received similar care for hyperlipidemia (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 0.759-3.134) and hypertension (OR = 0.476, 95% CI 0.134-1.689). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with severe mental illness received similar care for MS in comparison to controls. However, cases received significantly poorer care for the management of diabetes; therefore the focus of efforts will be on improving glycemic control in the mentally ill.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> The newly established University of South Florida College of Pharmacy resides in the Tampa Bay, Florida area which has more than 480,000 (17.2%) individuals over age 65, and consequently numerous assisted living facilities/group homes, nursing homes, retirement villages, and other facilities that provide services to seniors. Practice faculty are establishing clinical practice sites in preparation for the experiential components of the program for the training of pharmacy residents and student pharmacists, and potentially other students in the health sciences. One of the College’s pillars includes geriatrics, and the College is committed to recruiting numerous faculty to address the needs of this population. Currently, three practice faculty members are utilizing two sites within the University’s Health Science Center for practice, and ultimately training. A needs assessment was performed by the faculty with practitioners of the Health Science Center to determine potential faculty involvement. <bold>Description of the Innovative Service:</bold> The faculty have participated in memory screenings, caregiver education workshops, healthcare professional trainings, and medical resident education since the development of the program. They will continue to provide these trainings and screenings, and are also implementing comprehensive medication evaluations, medication reconciliation services, patient assistance program support, serving as resources for patient and healthcare practitioner medication-related questions, and developing a database which will collect data regarding the use of potentially inappropriate medications. Faculty are also implementing mechanisms to further expand the delivery of patient care by providing immunizations, specialty care services, and establishing a transition of care program. <bold>Impact on Patient Care/Institution:</bold> The faculty hope to minimize polypharmacy, improve adherence, and improve overall medication utilization for geriatric patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. Faculty will be providing these services in a wide range of practice settings thereby reaching a previously underserved portion of the community. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> These innovative practices have the potential to expand the visibility of the skills of clinical pharmacists and faculty practicing in this area, involve pharmacists in nontraditional environments as service providers, and improve the delivery of pharmaceutical care.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background/Rationale:</bold> The Beers Criteria and STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Persons’ potentially inappropriate Prescriptions) Criteria were developed to identify potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) in the geriatric population. This study compared the STOPP criteria to Beers Criteria with the intention of implementing a process for assessing medication regimens for geriatric patients as a part of quality assurance for an inpatient psychiatric facility. Having this process in place would be expected to decrease adverse consequences in this patient population. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> As a part of routine patient care provided by a pharmacist, both Beers and STOPP Criteria were used to identify PIMs and recommendations were made to address the PIMs. A retrospective chart review was performed to evaluate whether utilization of the two different criteria led to a significant change in number of PIMs and associated adverse outcomes, including adverse drug events (ADEs), falls, and required transfer to an acute medical facility or referral to the medical clinic. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> Twenty-eight patients met inclusion criteria, and 76 recommendations were made. More PIMs were identified at baseline utilizing STOPP (mean ± SD 4.0 ± 2.3) versus Beers Criteria (mean ± SD 2.3 ± 1.3) (p &lt; 0.001). The number of PIMs decreased from baseline to follow-up using STOPP (−1.6 ± 1.5, p &lt; 0.0001) and Beers Criteria (−1.4 ± 1.1, p &lt; 0.0001). However, change in the number of PIMs for STOPP versus Beers Criteria was not statistically significant (p = 0.3753). The presence of ADEs decreased after applying both STOPP (p = 0.0027) and Beers Criteria (p &lt; 0.0001). The presence of falls and referrals/transfers decreased using both criteria, although the decrease was not statistically significant. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although change in number of PIMs between STOPP and Beers Criteria was not statistically significant, utilization of each set of criteria by the pharmacist separately led to a significant decrease in PIMs. There was a decrease in presence of all adverse outcomes at follow-up using both criteria, although only statistically significant for ADEs. As significantly more PIMs were identified using STOPP Criteria, implementation of a process for assessing medication regimens for geriatric patients utilizing STOPP Criteria would likely be beneficial to implement as a part of routine clinical pharmacy care at this institution.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Donepezil is indicated for the treatment of mild to severe dementia associated with Alzheimer’s disease; however it has also been studied off-label for other dementia types, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and tardive dyskinesia. Although well tolerated, one neuropsychiatric side effect not reported in clinical trials is the emergence of manic symptoms. <bold>Patient History:</bold> A 71 year-old male with a history of paranoid schizophrenia was transferred to a psychiatric facility after concerns of increased disorganization and response to internal stimuli. Past medical history included alcohol dependence, cognitive disorder NOS, hypothyroidism, hypertension and iron deficient anemia. Laboratory values on admission were not of clinical concern. Psychotic symptoms improved with the addition of quetiapine 400 mg at bedtime. During his stay, donepezil 5 mg daily was initiated and titrated to 10 mg after two weeks. After the dose increase, the patient began to exhibit euphoric mood with an increased rate and production of speech. The patient’s need for sleep decreased with a noticeable increase in psychomotor agitation and goal directed activities. Donepezil was suspected to have induced these symptoms which subsequently resolved once donepezil was discontinued. The patient was successfully discharged following placement to a nursing facility. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> There are no cases of donepezil-induced mania reported in randomized-controlled trials for the FDA approved use of Alzheimer’s dementia. However, a MEDLINE search revealed a few cases of mania associated with the initiation of donepezil. In addition, a study of donepezil aiming to improve memory impairment in bipolar patients suggested that donepezil may destabilize mood and worsen bipolar symptoms. The mechanism of donepezil-induced mania is unclear but may be a result of central cholinergic system activation causing noradrenergic and dopaminergic system activation. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this case there was a clear onset and dissipation of manic symptoms with the initiation and discontinuation of donepezil. While appearing to be rare, there is mounting evidence that donepezil may cause the emergence of manic symptoms in some patients. Clinicians should be aware of this potential side effect, especially as exploration of off-label uses increase.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic used in the treatment of schizophrenia. The typical daily dose is 300-600 mg divided twice daily with a maximum daily dose of 900 mg. There is a wide variation in serum levels for patients on a fixed dose of clozapine. An eight-fold inter-individual and a large intra-individual variation have been previously reported. Accepted standards of clinical practice do not include obtaining routine clozapine serum levels. However, certain clinical situations may warrant therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of clozapine levels. One indication for TDM is poor clinical response at typical doses. The medical literature postulates that the therapeutic range is between 350-400 ng/mL and one reference suggests a target of &gt;504 ng/ml. <bold>Patient-History:</bold> The patient was a 38 year old African American male who was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital with an Axis I diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. The time from first diagnosis was 19 years based on available records. The patient’s past medical history was noncontributory. The patient was a smoker and he smoked throughout his admission. Psychiatric medications included valproic acid throughout the admission, and olanzapine that was changed to clozapine early on. Clozapine was initiated at 12.5 mg at bedtime and titrated up to 800 mg per day over the course of one month. At the dose of 800 mg per day, the first clozapine serum level was drawn with results of: clozapine = 150 ng/mL, and norclozapine level = 140 ng/mL. Over the next four months the clozapine dose was titrated upward and clozapine serum levels were obtained accordingly. Upon discharge, the total daily dose of clozapine was 1300mg/day and his serum levels were: clozapine = 480 ng/mL and norclozapine = 260 ng/mL. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> A MEDLINE search revealed one trial published on clozapine serum concentration and clinical response that suggested targeting a level of ≥250 ng/mL. Two patient cases reported low serum levels with high doses (≥800 mg/day) of clozapine. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our case report, the patient needed clozapine doses exceeding the traditionally cited range to produce efficacy. Clinicians should be cognizant that TDM may be necessary to effectively treat specific patients taking clozapine.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> The utility of atypical antipsychotics has assisted in the management of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder with a decreased incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). There have been many studies to compare the efficacy, safety and adverse effect profiles of the available typical decanoate and atypical long acting injection formulations. Available data also compares these long acting injections with respect to readmission rates. However, there are no studies currently available that compare the long acting intramuscular injection paliperidone palmitate and its oral counterpart on the effect of psychosis stabilization and readmission rates. <bold>Methods:</bold> Patients discharged on paliperidone palmitate (IM) or paliperidone (PO) over a 12-month period with documented schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder were identified through the health system’s electronic medical record system. Readmission rates were assessed for 12 months following discharge. Patients under the age of 18 without a documented diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder were excluded from this study. Furthermore, patients discharged on multiple antipsychotic medications, with the exception of quetiapine for sleep, were also excluded. The following data was collected: patient age, gender, admission dates, readmission dates, admitting diagnoses, and discharge regimens. <bold>Results:</bold> Eighty patients were initially screened using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sixteen of these patients received paliperidone (IM) during the 12 months investigated. Two patients were excluded because of age. Twenty three patients were excluded from the study. There were three readmissions within 30 days for the patients on paliperidone (IM) and 13 readmissions within 30 days for the paliperidone (PO) group. The average length to first psychiatric readmission for the paliperidone (IM) was 133.8 days in contrast to 73.96 days for the paliperidone (PO) group. <bold>Discussion:</bold> Readmission rates for paliperidone (IM) were quantitatively lower than those of paliperidone (PO), though not statistically significant (p = 0.412). Length until first psychiatric readmission was twice as long in the paliperidone (IM) group compared to the paliperidone (PO) group, though not statistically significant (p = 0.55). Readmission rates and length to first psychiatric readmission may show a significant difference with a longer study and larger sample size.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> Several nicotine administration studies have been conducted in people with schizophrenia with varying results on psychiatric and cognitive effects. One source of heterogeneity in these studies could be the route of administration. To our knowledge, all studies to date have used either an inhaled or transdermal delivery; methods that have significant pharmacokinetic variability. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of nicotine on symptomology and cognition in schizophrenia using weight based intravenous administration. <bold>Methods:</bold> Medically stable participants with DSM-IV diagnosed schizophrenia who were nicotine dependent, participated in a three day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. The three test days were separated by at least 7 days in a counterbalanced order within 6 weeks. During each session participants received intravenously administered normal saline, nicotine 0.0315 mg/kg (low dose), or nicotine 0.054 mg/kg (medium dose) over 3 hours. Symptomology as measured by the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) at baseline and 3 time points during the infusion and one 30 minutes after. Cognitive testing included a computerized visual stimuli continuous performance task (Gordon Task) and the Stroop Color-Word Interference Task (Stroop). Participants also had vital signs monitored during the infusions and completed an 18-item Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) after each administration of the PANSS to evaluate subjective experiences. <bold>Results:</bold> Nine participants (8 males/1 female) received at least 1 infusion. No adverse events were reported but 2 people withdrew after 1 administration, both participants received placebo. No significant changes were detected between placebo and the low or medium dose of intravenous nicotine on the total of subscales of the PANSS. Similarly no improvements in cognition were detected from either dose of nicotine compared to placebo on the Stoop or the Gordon Task. <bold>Conclusions and Future Directions:</bold> Intravenous nicotine did not show any beneficial effect on psychiatric or neurocognitive symptoms in people with schizophrenia who are already nicotine dependent. However, this method proved to be safe and can be used in future studies to determine both behavioral and neurobiological effects (e.g. neuroimaging) of nicotine in schizophrenia using standardize doses to better control for pharmacokinetic heterogeneity between subjects.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background &amp; Purpose:</bold> Human carboxylesterase 1 (hCES1), encoded by the CES1 gene, is the predominant hepatic hydrolase responsible for the metabolism of many therapeutic agents, toxins, and endogenous substances. Genetic variants of CES1 can affect hCES1 function and expression and ultimately influence clinical response to drugs serving as hCES1 substrates. CES1 gene consists of three isoforms including the functional CES1A1 and CES1A2 genes and the nonfunctional pseudogene CES1A3. Natural variants of these isoforms exert differing impacts on hCES1 function. However, the existing CES1 genotyping methods are incapable of determining whether these variants belong to CES1A1, CES1A2, or CES1A3 because of the high similarity among these three genes, as a consequence they are unable to discriminate between heterozygotes and homozygotes. <bold>Methods:</bold> The development of a novel long-range PCR based, discriminative genotyping assay capable of specifically detecting the variants among CES1A1, CES1A2, and CES1A3 genes is described. This assay combined long-range PCR, individual exon amplification, and direct sequencing and was developed such that CES1A1 or CES1A2/CES1A3 would be specifically amplified in the long-range PCR reaction. This developed assay was tested against the widely utilized Taqman assay to screen for the Gly143Glu mutation in 107 children diagnosed with ADHD who were treated with dl-methylphenidate. <bold>Results:</bold> The novel genotyping assay identified one homozygote and two heterozygotes among these subjects. As predicted, the standard Taqman assay was unable to distinguish between the heterozygote and the homozygous recessive individual. The comparison of the genotyping results between this novel assay and those previously reported methods highlighted the necessity of applying the discriminative genotyping assay in pharmacogenetic studies involving CES1 gene.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> The purpose of this study was to characterize reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and pharmacist interventions to prevent ADRs in an extended-care state psychiatric hospital. Preventable adverse drug reactions were assessed for educational and quality improvement opportunities. <bold>Methods:</bold> Completed ADR reports from August 2007 to August 2011 were reviewed. Reports classified as probable or definite based on the Naranjo probability scale were assessed for reaction severity, pharmacological class of medication involved, preventability, change in therapy, and transfers to a medical facility. To assess prevention of ADRs, the pharmacist intervention database was queried for interventions classified as “prevention of ADR.” The reports were assessed for type of medication and physician recommendation acceptance rate. <bold>Results:</bold> 115 ADR reports were completed between August 2007 and August 2011; of these, 64 reports (55.7%) were classified as probable or definite. Medication classes responsible for probable/definite ADRs included mood stabilizers (30%), typical antipsychotics (25%), atypical antipsychotics (25%), antidepressants (8%), and antihypertensives (3%). 96.9% of probable/definite ADRs resulted in change in therapy, while 9% resulted in transfer to a medical facility. 34.4% of probable/definite ADRs were deemed preventable; mood stabilizers (41%) and atypical antipsychotics (27%) were the most common preventable ADR. The most common reasons an ADR was preventable were toxic serum concentrations, drug-drug interactions, and history of reaction. In reviewing the pharmacist intervention database, 87 interventions were classified as “prevention of ADR” and the acceptance rate of pharmacist recommendation was 96.5%. Mood stabilizers (20%), atypical antipsychotics (17%), and typical antipsychotics (11%) were the medication classes most commonly associated with prevented ADRs. Lithium accounted for 13.8% of prevented ADRs; the most common prevented ADR was a drug-drug interaction with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. <bold>Conclusions &amp; Future Directions:</bold> Over one-third of probable/definite ADRs in this population were considered preventable. Preventable and prevented ADRs were most commonly associated with mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. There is an opportunity for pharmacists to provide education to medical staff on therapeutic drug monitoring and drug-drug interactions for these classes, particularly for lithium.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background &amp; Purpose:</bold> The most widely utilized pharmacological treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the psychostimulant methylphenidate (MPH) consisting of the racemic mixture of d-threo-(R, R)-MPH and l-threo-(S, S)-MPH isomers. It is also used in the treatment of narcolepsy as well as a number of other neuropsychiatric conditions. In clinical use &gt; 50 years, dl-MPH is characterized by its low bioavailability, short half-life (2-3 hrs) secondary to a rapid and stereoselective metabolism via desterification (i.e. hydrolysis) via hepatic carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) forming the major, albeit inactive metabolite ritalinic acid (RA). Additionally, significant interindividual variability in dl-MPH pharmacokinetics and therapeutic response has been consistently documented in clinical practice. This variability, in part, has been attributed to variable hepatic CES1 function between individuals. Due to its short duration of action, several modified-release formulations varying in MPH release rate and pattern have been developed and are widely utilized. Despite advances in dosage formulations, a significant number of patients have inadequate responses to MPH or intolerable side effects. Accordingly efforts have been made to develop alternative therapeutic agents to MPH. A diverse group of analogues of MPH (dl-alpha-(2-piperidyl)-phenylacetic acid esters) have been synthesized with the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) as neuropharmacologic targets. <bold>Methods:</bold> Foundational studies of the isopropyl ester derivative of MPH, isopropylphenidate (IPH) were performed. The synthesis, monoaminergic transporter binding and cellular uptake profile, and assessment of metabolic hydrolysis and transesterification in the presence of ethanol using hCES1 transfected cell lines are described using dl-MPH as a comparator to dl-IPH. Finally, an in vivo assessment of dl-IPH stimulant effects (vs. saline) in rats was performed with locomotor activity as a pharmacodynamic outcome using established experimental methodology. <bold>Results:</bold> Isopropylphenidate displayed pharmacologic characteristics including a favorable yet unique DAT: NET binding and cellular uptake profile, a resistance to hydrolysis and transesterification via CES1 relative to dl-MPH, and pharmacodynamic effects suggestive psychostimulant properties and enhanced duration of action. All of these findings suggest further study and development of dl-isopropylphenidate as a neurotherapeutic agent are warranted.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> The primary objective was to determine whether or not patients who experienced an acute dystonic reaction from an antipsychotic received prophylaxis with an anticholinergic agent. Secondary objectives included determining which antipsychotics were associated with dystonic reactions and determining whether or not the demographics of these patients differed from the known risk factors. <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective medical record review was performed using data from June 2007 through June 2010. Data collection included patient demographics; prophylactic use of anticholinergics; time between first antipsychotic dose and dystonic reaction; antipsychotic drug, dose, and route of administration; and anticholinergic drug, dose, and number of doses received. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. <bold>Results:</bold> Of 461 charts reviewed, 49 patients experienced acute dystonia. Six (12.2%) of these patients were receiving anticholinergic prophylaxis at the time of their reaction. Benztropine (average daily dose 1.6 mg) was the prophylactic agent prescribed. Approximately two-thirds of patients included were African American (67.3%), and two-thirds were male (65.3%). Fourteen patients (28.6%) were black males ages 18 through 25 years. Schizophrenia (32%) was the most common Axis I diagnosis, followed by Bipolar Disorder (24%). Haloperidol monotherapy was received in 49% of these cases. Thirty-five percent of patients received two or more antipsychotics prior to the dystonic reaction. Of these antipsychotic combinations, 94% contained haloperidol. Patients receiving long-acting injectable antipsychotics had an average time to dystonia onset of 525 hours, compared to 52 hours in patients receiving oral and short-acting injectable antipsychotics. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients receiving anticholinergic prophylaxis can still experience acute dystonic reactions. However, the majority of patients that experienced acute dystonia were not receiving prophylaxis. Haloperidol was the drug most frequently prescribed in patients experiencing acute dystonia in this study. Black males, ages 18 through 25 years, encompassed the greatest proportion of patients experiencing acute dystonia. The average time to onset of acute dystonia can be skewed by the receipt of long-acting injectable antipsychotics. In patients not receiving long-acting injectables, the onset typically occurs within the first week of antipsychotic initiation. For patients initiating haloperidol, the addition of benztropine should be considered.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Objective:</bold> To determine typical efficacy outcomes in cervical dystonia (CD) patients treated with Dysport (known as abobotulinumtoxinA) in routine clinical practice. <bold>Background:</bold> ANCHOR-CD is an open-label, one-year, observational study enrolling approximately 400 idiopathic CD patients treated with Dysport. <bold>Methods:</bold> Efficacy assessments include: The Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS), Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIP), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM). <bold>Results:</bold> Baseline patient demographic, history, and health economic data were collected from 106 patients enrolled at 17 US clinical sites. Population comprised of 74% females and 26% males, mean age 58.8 years. Types of dystonic neck posturing include torticollis (81.1%), laterocollis (48.1%), retrocollis (28.3%), and anterocollis (17%). The median Dysport dose was 600 Units. The most frequently injected muscles were the splenius capitis, semispinalis capitis, levator scapulae, and sternocleidomastoid. Preliminary analysis included 73 patients who completed follow-up assessments for treatment cycle one. Mean (SD) TWSTRS total score was 39.3 (15.7) at baseline and 25 (14.1) at 4 week follow-up demonstrating -14.5 (9.0) mean change or 38.5% improvement compared to baseline. Mean (SD) Pain NRS score was 4.7 (3.0) at baseline and 3.2 (2.7) at 4-week follow-up demonstrating -1.5 (2.8) mean change compared to baseline. 72% and 45.3% of patients rated much improved and very much improved for the CGIC and PGIC, respectively. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Cervical dystonia patients treated with abotulinumtoxinA reported improvements in the severity, disability and pain of CD.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Objective:</bold> To report baseline patient demographic, history and health economics data of cervical dystonia patients treated with Dysport (known as abobotulinumtoxinA). <bold>Background:</bold> The clinical trials which led to the US FDA approval of Dysport were designed to measure standardized investigator-reported efficacy outcomes and safety data and did not contain comprehensive assessments or predictors of patient-related outcomes (PRO) and health economic outcomes (HEO). ANCHORCD is a prospective, open-label, observational study of adult idiopathic CD patients treated with Dysport designed to evaluate real life patient response and health economics data. <bold>Methods:</bold> Assessment scales include measures of CD disease severity, patient-reported outcomes, and global impression of change. Collection of HEO data is a primary focus of the registry. <bold>Results:</bold> Presently, there are 106 patients enrolled at 17 clinical sites in the US. The patients are 74% females, mean age is 58.8 years; mean 6.4 years from reported time of diagnosis; mean 40 months reported delay from symptom onset to diagnosis; 15.1% with positive family history of cervical dystonia. The primary type of cervical dystonia as evaluated by the enrolling investigators was: rotational torticollis (81.1%), laterocollis (48.1%), retrocollis (28.3%), and anterocollis (17%). Of these, 77.4% had previously received other botulinum toxin therapy for CD at median doses of 300 Units for onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), and 8500 Units for rimabotulinumtoxinB (Myobloc). AbobotulinumtoxinA 600 Units was the median dose injected at registry-entry. 54% of patients reported obstacles or delays that potentially hampered obtaining botulinum toxin therapy for CD including: travel distance to clinic (43%), treatment cost (32%) and time away from work/scheduling (33%). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Baseline patient demographic, history, and health economic data provide analysis of current real-world utilization of Dysport. This information may provide insights to help address obstacles to receiving treatment for cervical dystonia.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> To estimate differences in prescribing of new antidepressant medications, stress management, psychotherapy, and other mental health (OMH) counseling at physician visits where documented depression screening was performed. <bold>Methods:</bold> Cross-sectional data related to physician visits by adult patients from the 2005-2007 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) were used for this research. The final analytical sample included 55,143 visits representing a national estimate of 1,741,080,686 physician visits. Four dependent variables were considered: (1) order for new antidepressant medication(s); (2) referral to stress management; (3) psychotherapy; or (4) OMH counseling. The independent variable was documented provision of depression screening. Bivariable and multivariable associations between depression screening and each measure of depression follow-up care were evaluated using the design-based F statistic and individual multivariable logistic regression models. <bold>Results:</bold> New antidepressant prescribing increased from 4.09% of visits without depression screening to 15.49% at visits with depression screening. Referral to stress management was the behavioral treatment with the greatest absolute change as it increased from 3.31% of visits without depression screening to 33.10% of visits with depression screening, followed by psychotherapy (2.21% vs. 12.60%), and other mental health counseling (1.26% vs. 9.25%). After controlling for background sociodemographic characteristics, the adjusted odds of a new antidepressant order were significantly higher at visits involving depression screening (AOR = 4.39, 95% CI: 3.12-6.19), as were referral for stress management (AOR = 14.82, 95% CI: 10.50 – 20.93), psychotherapy (AOR = 6.82, 95% CI: 4.01 – 11.62), and OMH counseling (AOR = 7.67, 95% CI: 4.51-13.05). <bold>Conclusions and Future Directions:</bold> At the national level, depression screening is associated with increased new antidepressant medication prescribing and referral for behavioral health treatments. As recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force Guidelines, it is critical for policy planners to recognize and incorporate these changes when designing multidisciplinary depression screening programs to ensure availability of treatment and follow-up with adequate capacity.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Introduction:</bold> Nonadherence to antipsychotic medications is a barrier to effective treatment of psychotic disorders. Non-adherence leads to poor outcomes and increased cost. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Our primary objective was to determine overall adherence with antipsychotic therapy. Secondary objectives were to determine the relationship between adherence and patient demographics, the rate of antipsychotic polypharmacy, and the relationship between dose and adherence. <bold>Methods:</bold> This was a retrospective claims analysis of adult, antipsychotic claims from 2009 and 2010. HIPAA-compliant, de-identified database elements included NDC, fill date, quantity, days supply, age, behavioral health code, and gender. The data set was filtered for oral, solid antipsychotics. Adherence was evaluated using Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) and calculated as follows: MPR-LOT (total days supply divided by total treatment days); MPR180 and MPR365 are the total days supply over a defined period. Descriptive statistics were used to report demographics, utilization, and adherence. Inferential statistics were used to report relationships between adherence and other variables available. <bold>Results:</bold> The study period included 49,816 patients receiving 431,291 prescriptions. Of these, 21,503 patients received multiple fills of a single drug, 11,470 received more than one drug, and 4,192 received only one Rx (excluded from analysis). Mean age was 39.7 years, with 55% female. In patients on one medication, MPR180 was 0.802. Patients with a BH code of substance abuse (MPR180 of 0.643) and young adults (MPR180 of 0.721 in 19-24 year olds) were less adherent. No difference in adherence was observed by gender. Less than 35% of patients took more than one antipsychotic agent during the time period. Assuming all patients received monotherapy, MPR180 (1.017) was higher than in patients on single agents. This is likely due to concurrent use and cross titrations. MPR was analyzed in the subset of patients (n = 3,289) receiving court-ordered antipsychotic therapy (COT) using MPR365 (the minimum COT period). MPR365 in those on a single agent was 0.639. Finally, the impact of dosages was analyzed. MPR180 was highest in patients taking therapeutic doses (0.834) versus those on low (0.777) or high (0.791) doses. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Methods to improve antipsychotic adherence, particularly in COT patients, are needed.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Introduction:</bold> Although fall is the number one accident in hospitalized patients, only a few studies have looked into medication related falls in psychiatric patients. Benzodiazepines and zolpidem have been associated to increase the risk of fall. To compare the rate of fall occurrence between subjects on zolpidem versus hypnotic benzodiazepines (BZD). Secondary outcome: To compare the incidence of fall between elderly and non-elderly population related to study medications; to compare fall incidence among hypnotic benzodiazepines. <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart review from 02/01/2009-02/01/2011 was carried out. The study population were divided into 3 groups of zolpidem, hypnotic benzodiazepines (clonazepam, diazepam, oxazepam, or temazepam), and “other” medications. The study population was divided into three groups. Group 1 were subjects with falls related to zolpidem, group 2 subjects experienced falls associated with hypnotic benzodiazepines (hBZD), and group 3 patients had falls related to medications other than zolpidem and hBZD. Any fall that was categorized as “possible”, “probable”, or “definite” due to medications was included in the study. If Zolpidem or BZD was one of the contributing medications, then that fall episode was included in the corresponding group. Hypnotic benzodiazepines were defined as clonazepam, diazepam, oxazepam, or temazepam. <bold>Results:</bold> Baseline characteristics were similar between study groups. Incidence of fall was the same in zolpidem and BZD groups (n = 15). Also, the rate of fall among the elderly and non-elderly were similar in the study medications group <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Patient taking multiple sedating medications including but not limited to benzodiazepines, opioids, atypical antipsychotics, muscle relaxants, and sleep aid medications should be carefully monitored for sedation and risk of falls. Attempts should be made to lower the dose and possibly reduce the number of sedating agents in this population. There was no statistical significance in rate of falls associated with hypnotic benzodiazepines and zolpidem in the study. Furthermore, large scale randomized control prospective studies are needed to compare the risk of fall with hypnotic benzodiazepines versus zolpidem.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Objective:</bold> The purpose of this study was to assess detection and treatment rates for perinatal depression among women enrolled in the California State Medicaid (Medi-Cal) program in comparison to age-matched female beneficiaries who did not give birth during the same study period. <bold>Method:</bold> A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of women between the ages of 18 and 45 years old who were continuously enrolled in the Medi-Cal fee-for-service program between January 2006 and December 2009. The perinatal cohort consisted of women with live births occurring between October 2007 and March 2009. The control group consisted of age-matched women who were not pregnant during this timeframe. The primary outcome of this analysis was diagnosis of depression during the nine month antepartum period or the nine months following delivery, as evidenced by an ICD-9 code for any depressive illness. Secondary outcomes included a statistical comparison of treatment patterns among cohorts (e.g., receipt of pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy), and a multivariate analysis of demographic factors predicting a diagnosis of perinatal depression. <bold>Results:</bold> The analysis identified 71,718 beneficiaries eligible for study inclusion, with 615 in the perinatal cohort and 65,567 in the control group. The average age was 32.6 years, with 62% self-identified as Non-Hispanic White, and 23% Hispanic. Statistically significant differences were found in the percent of the perinatal cohort receiving a depression diagnosis during pregnancy (1.8% vs 5.3% with controls; p &lt; 0.0001) as well as during the postpartum period (2.2% vs 5.2%; p &lt; 0.0001). The perinatal cohort was also much less likely to receive an antidepressant during pregnancy (3.2% vs 16.9% with controls; p &lt; 0.0001) or the postpartum period (4.6% vs 17.2%; p &lt; 0.0001). The utilization of psychotherapy services was extremely rare in both cohorts. A random effects analysis of demographic factors predicting diagnosis and treatment is pending. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Results of this investigation suggest that depression is much less likely to be diagnosed or treated during pregnancy and postpartum in comparison to a non-pregnant cohort. These findings contrast with previous research demonstrating that perinatal women rare at increased for depression. It is hoped that future investigations may delineate factors underlying this apparent discrepancy in care.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> To improve psychiatrically-indicated medication management oversight to a severely mentally ill community-based population by developing a medication monitoring system to help ensure patients are evaluated for potential medication-related adverse effects. This project was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board (IRB). <bold>Methods:</bold> Medication regimens for 68 members of the Integrated Multidisciplinary Program of Assertive Community Treatment (IMPACT) program qualified for review. Fourteen medications, including four antipsychotics [available and used in both oral and long-acting injection (LAI) dosage forms] were identified. In total, 111 medications, including four LAIs, are used on a monthly basis with each member receiving more than one medication qualifying for review. <bold>Results:</bold> Following development and implementation of the monitoring program, the medical director reviewed charts for all members to evaluate the most recent scheduled lab work or other identified monitoring. Orders for fasting blood glucose were discontinued for 2 of 2 (100%) members with insulin-dependent diabetes and changed to glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) for these 2 members. Glycosylated hemoglobin tests were ordered every 6 months for all members of the PACT program qualifying for review. Annual lipid panels were changed to every 6 months for all members whose charts qualified for review. <bold>Conclusions and Future Directions:</bold> Multiple psychiatrically-related medications are used on a regular basis for persons enrolled in the IMPACT program to address their psychiatric needs. This monitoring program was developed to help ensure patients received the most effective care, minimizing potential medication-related adverse effects. It will be added to the continuous quality assurance measures used by the program as one component of patient care. Monitoring represents an ongoing quality assurance activity. Members are scheduled for clinic either once or twice a month. Lab results will be reviewed at those times. Psychiatric medication adjustments secondary to changes in lab work will be tracked. The monitoring program will be evaluated annually.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are associated with metabolic side effects and prescribed for off-label indications by non-psychiatric clinicians. Data in the literature indicate patients are not being adequately monitored for metabolic side effects by psychiatric clinicians. This study compares the rates of metabolic monitoring (MM) for patients prescribed SGAs by primary care providers (PCP) and psychiatric clinicians. <bold>Methods:</bold> Patients &gt;18 years old with a PCP in CHA, initiating a SGA were identified in the electronic medical records. A patient was considered to have a SGA if they were prescribed a SGA for any indication to be used daily by a PCP or psychiatric clinicians within CHA between June and August 2011. Laboratories ordered at baseline and 10-12 weeks after initiating a SGA were abstracted from the medical record of each patient. Prescriptions were categorized by prescriber type based on the prescriber of the index and three subsequent SGA prescriptions. Rates of MM ordered by PCPs and psychiatric clinicians were compared using a chi-square test for homogeneity of proportions. Data for those treated by both PCP and psychiatrists were not included in this analysis due to the small number of patients so treated. <bold>Results:</bold> 68 PCPs and 51 psychiatric clinicians prescribed SGAs for 94 and 165 patients, respectively. A total of 36.3% of patients prescribed a SGA had no psychiatric diagnosis recorded and 20.8% were prescribed SGAs for non-bipolar mood disorder. Few patients had a diagnosis of bipolar (14.7%) or psychotic (14.3%) disorders. At baseline fasting glucose was the most commonly ordered laboratory by PCP (61.7%) and psychiatric clinicians (59.4%). Baseline lipid panels were the least commonly ordered laboratories by PCP (27.7%) and psychiatric clinicians (29.7%). Rates of follow-up monitoring were poor with fasting glucose being the most commonly ordered laboratory by PCP (10.6%) and psychiatric clinicians (n = 8%). PCPs did not differ significantly from psychiatrists in the proportion of MM either at baseline or at 3 months (Chi-square all NS, df = 1, p &lt; .05). <bold>Conclusions and Future Directions:</bold> MM is poor for patients prescribed SGAs by PCP and psychiatric clinicians. Interventions to improve MM rates should be expanded beyond psychiatric clinicians.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> To determine if inpatients taking antipsychotics are routinely assessed for the presence of movement-related side effects, including tardive dyskinesia, and whether standardized rating scales are being used for this purpose. <bold>Methods:</bold> One-hundred inpatients receiving regularly scheduled antipsychotics at CAMH in Toronto, Canada were randomly selected for a retrospective chart audit. Each chart was searched for documented assessment(s) of movement-related side effects over the previous two years. <bold>Results:</bold> The mean age of the patients was 43 ± 15 years (range: 20-90) with 68% male and a median admission stay of 144 days. Most (56%) were receiving monotherapy with one atypical (40%) or one typical (16%) antipsychotic. There were a total of 95 documented assessments of movement-related side effects in 62 charts. Thirty eight subjects (38%) had no documented assessments during the two year period. Standardized rating scales (AIMS, BARS, or SAS) were used only12 times in total among 7 subjects. The remaining documentation (87%) was in the form of progress notes that did not mention scales. In these cases the most common movement-related side effects documented were tremor (21.5%), drooling (10.3%), tardive dyskinesia (9.4%) and akathisia (8.4%). Ten percent of the progress notes did not mention any specific symptom or class of symptoms. <bold>Conclusion and Future Directions:</bold> The results of this study support the hypothesis that antipsychotic-induced movement-related disorders are not routinely monitored in practice, particularly with the more recent shift in focus to monitor antipsychotic-induced metabolic side-effects. Next steps include implementing a training program for clinicians on how to properly conduct standardized assessments, and a follow-up assessment of practice will be conducted. In addition, more assessment tools (i.e. scales) have been added to the hospital’s electronic roster which will hopefully improve frequency of use. Future work will also include determining the impact of movement-related side effect monitoring on improved patient outcomes such as quality of life.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background &amp; Purpose:</bold> Organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3, SLC22A3) is a low-affinity, high-capacity transporter widely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and other major organs in both humans and rodents. It is postulated that OCT3 has a role in the overall regulation of neurotransmission and maintenance of homeostasis within the CNS. It is generally believed that all antidepressant drugs in current clinical use exert their primary therapeutic effects through inhibition of one or more of the high-affinity neuronal plasma membrane monoamine transporters, such as the norepinephrine transporter and the serotonin transporter. <bold>Methods:</bold> We investigated the inhibitory effects of selected antidepressants on OCT3 activity in OCT3-transfected cells to evaluate whether OCT3 inhibition may at least in part contribute to the pharmacological effects of tested antidepressants. <bold>Results:</bold> The studies demonstrated that all examined antidepressants inhibited OCT3-mediated uptake of the established OCT3 substrate 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide (4-Di-1-ASP) in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 values were determined to be 4.7 µM, 7.4 µM, 12.0 µM, 18.6 µM, 11.2 µM, and 21.9 µM for desipramine, sertraline, paroxetine, amitriptyline, imipramine, and fluoxetine, respectively. Both desipramine and sertraline appeared to inhibit OCT3-mediated 4-Di-1-ASP uptake via a non-competitive mechanism. Additionally, desipramine had an IC50 value of 0.7 µM for the uptake of NE by OCT3, while the IC50 value of sertraline was 2.3 µM for 5-HT uptake. In vivo studies are warranted to determine whether such effects on OCT3 inhibition are of sufficient magnitude to contribute to the overall therapeutic effects of antidepressants.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background:</bold> Tapentadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic. Preclinical studies have shown tapentadol is a mu-opioid receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and analgesia in animal models is derived from both properties. <bold>Purpose:</bold> Tapentadol extended-release (ER) oral tablets prescribing information warns there have been reports of serotonin syndrome with concurrent use of tapentadol and serotonergic drugs. We analyzed pooled safety data from 11 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to identify other potential pharmacodynamic drug interactions associated with concomitant use of tapentadol and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). <bold>Methods:</bold> Safety populations were pooled from 7 studies investigating oral immediate-release tapentadol vs. placebo over 3-10 days for acute pain and 4 studies of tapentadol ER vs. placebo over 15 weeks for chronic pain. All 11 studies permitted SSRIs if dose was stable at baseline and during study, but prohibited SNRIs to avoid confounding analgesic efficacy measurement for tapentadol. Some subjects deviated from protocol and took an SNRI. Across studies, 3269 subjects received tapentadol; 1901 received placebo. Adverse event (AE) incidences were compared for tapentadol vs. placebo using safety data from only subjects who took SSRI (n = 310), SNRI (n = 31), or both (n = 4). Thus, all subjects analyzed (N = 345) were taking an antidepressant (i.e., fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine, or duloxetine) at baseline. Since SSRIs/SNRIs have an established AE profile, the design of this analysis enabled comparison of AEs reported for Tapentadol+SSRI/SNRI (N = 208) vs. Placebo+SSRI/SNRI (N = 137) to assess if adding tapentadol (vs. adding placebo) to SSRI or SNRI therapy changed the profile. <bold>Results:</bold> Incidences of nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, pruritis, hyperhidrosis, and hot flush were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) for Tapentadol+SSRI/SNRI vs. Placebo+SSRI/SNRI. The incidences of these AEs were similar to those listed in tapentadol labeling. Other AEs occurred at numerically higher rates for Tapentadol+SSRI/SNRI vs. Placebo+SSRI/SNRI, but most were also expected for tapentadol alone. Unexpected AEs with rates &gt;2% for Tapentadol+SSRI/SNRI were pharyngolaryngeal pain (p = 0.045), abdominal pain (ns), and myalgia (ns). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> This post hoc analysis of pooled clinical trial data did not identify new clinically relevant adverse drug interactions associated with adding tapentadol to SSRI/SNRI therapy.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background:</bold> The prevalence of depression, personality disorders, and other mental health conditions has not been extensively studied among pharmacy students. The age at which most students enroll in pharmacy school correlates with the age of peak onset for many psychiatric disorders. Pharmacists also have personality traits that align with the diagnostic criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). <bold>Objective:</bold> The purpose of this study was to survey pharmacy students actively enrolled in a pharmacy school to determine prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and obsessive-compulsive personality traits. <bold>Methods:</bold> Approximately 320 pharmacy students enrolled at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) School of Pharmacy were sent an online survey. The survey asked a series of twenty-eight questions, three demographic, with the remaining assessing for symptoms of depression or OCPD. Questions were derived from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for OCPD. SIUE IRB approval and participant informed consent were obtained prior to survey administration. <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 166 participants completed the survey. The majority of survey respondents were female (67.5%, n = 112) and between 18 and 23 years of age. Each of the four graduating classes made up approximately 25% of the survey participants. The majority of students (80.1%; n = 133) declared that they had never been diagnosed with a mental health condition; 13.9% (n = 23) had been diagnosed with depression, 12.7% (n = 21) with an anxiety disorder, and 1.8% (n = 3) with an eating disorder. The prevalence of any type of depressive symptom (≥5 points on the PHQ-9 Scale) was 52.4% (n = 87). Of those sampled, 30.1% (n = 50) of students indicated the presence of at least 4 out of 8 symptoms of OCPD. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> This is one of the first studies to assess the prevalence of specific psychiatric disorders among pharmacy students. The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms, as well as students meeting the minimum criteria for OCPD found in this study was significantly greater than the average prevalence rates reported in the general population. Continued recognition and awareness of these disorders is critical to the overall health and wellbeing of pharmacy students.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> To evaluate the safety and tolerability of switching stable patients from various antipsychotics to asenapine(ASE) or olanzapine(OLA) monotherapy using regimens similar to clinical practice. <bold>Methods:</bold> This post hoc analysis incorporates pooled results from 2 randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trials (NCT00145496 and NCT00212836) and assesses safety profiles of ASE and OLA monotherapy as switch therapies from other antipsychotics for the treatment of persistent negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Patients were clinically stable, as shown by positive symptom control on previous antipsychotic(s) medication(s) for ≥5 months prior to screening plus a further 30-day prospective observation period. Subjects received ASE 5 mg bid (n = 485) or OLA 10 mg qd (n = 464) for 1 week, then ASE 5–10 mg bid or OLA 5–20 mg qd, and previous antipsychotic(s) were tapered off at variable speed (maximum tapering period: 28 days followed by monotherapy—total 26 weeks of treatment). <bold>Results:</bold> Median time to taper off previous antipsychotic(s) was 7 days. More than 40% of patients in both treatment groups switched on first day of study drug. 76.9% of switched patients in the ASE group and 75.2% in the OLA group reported ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) during treatment. Most frequently reported AEs were somnolence (ASE: 14.0%, OLA: 14.6%), headache (ASE: 14.9%, OLA: 11.0%), insomnia (ASE: 14.9%, OLA: 9.9%), and weight gain (ASE: 7.6%, OLA: 20.9%). 11.6% of patients in the ASE group and 6.0% in the OLA group experienced ≥1 serious AE(SAE) over the full treatment period. 15.8% in the ASE group and 10.6% in the OLA group discontinued because of AE/SAE, and 4.1% of ASE and 2.7% of OLA patients because of lack of efficacy. Most AEs occurred in the first 28 days of treatment and were predominantly mild or moderate. AE rates reported over the first 28 days for rapid (≤3 days) versus slow tapered switching (≥14 days) were 48.8% and 52.4% for ASE and 50.3% and 44.5% for OLA. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Switching to ASE from other antipsychotics, based on clinician's judgment, was generally well tolerated in patients with schizophrenia with persistent negative symptoms, and showed comparable results to OLA.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> Antipsychotic use in patients with schizophrenia is frequently associated with nonadherence. Consequently, there is a need for a noninvasive test to detect antipsychotic concentrations. The present study aimed to show proof of concept that the analytical assay developed by Ameritox, Ltd. can accurately detect antipsychotic concentrations in human urine specimens. <bold>Methods:</bold> Urine samples were analyzed to determine detection sensitivity for four antipsychotic medications (risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine and/or haloperidol) Participants were recruited for the pilot clinical study if they were between 18-75 years old, were taking uninterrupted antipsychotic as an inpatient for at least 5 days, and not taking medications which may interfere with antipsychotic metabolism. Subjects were excluded if they had significant hepatic or renal dysfunction or if they could not pass the Evaluation to Sign Consent. The study visit included demographic and clinical information as well as one urine sample that was forwarded to the Ameritox Laboratory and assayed for the presence of antipsychotic medications and/or metabolites using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS). <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Thirty-three urine were assayed for the following substances; haloperidol, risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, quetiapine, 7-hydroxyquetiapine, olanzapine, and N-desmethyl-olanzapine. All urine samples produced positive results for the antipsychotic(s) the participants were known to be taking in daily doses ranging from 10-40 mg haloperidol, 150-1600 mg quetiapine, 2-10 mg risperidone, and 5-40 mg olanzapine. The total urine concentrations ranged from 38-4130 ng/mL for quetiapine, 322-5716 ng/mL for risperidone, and 129-1055 ng/mL for olanzapine. Urine concentrations for parent drugs ranged from 5-417 ng/mL for haloperidol, 4-4017 ng/mL for quetiapine, 0-997 ng/mL for risperidone, and 57-700 ng/mL for olanzapine. Finally, urine concentrations for metabolites ranged from 23-1029 ng/mL for 7-hydroxyquetiapine, 289-5479 ng/mL for 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and 60-539 ng/mL for N-desmethyl-olanzapine. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The analytical assay produced by Ameritox, Ltd. using UPLC/MS/MS can qualitatively detect antipsychotics in human urine specimens. The present study highlights the potential utility of the urine assay to monitor adherence to antipsychotic medications. Larger samples and controlled timing between last dose and urine collection may lead to the ability to set expected urine drug level ranges based on the prescribed antipsychotic regimen. More research is encouraged.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background:</bold> The CPNP Consumer Relations Committee has worked closely with National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) over the last several years to help provide consumer education to patients, caregivers, and the general public. Over the last 5 years, CPNP members have helped participate in NAMI’s annual meeting by providing educational workshops and hosting the “Ask the psychiatric Pharmacist Booth”. Each year members have distributed surveys to consumers, caregivers and family members that evaluated consumer's awareness of psychiatric pharmacists and the services CPNP members provide to NAMI. <bold>Objective:</bold> The objective of this study was to determine if there has been an increase in awareness about psychiatric pharmacists amongst NAMI members attending the NAMI annual meetings. Secondary we assessed trends in Medication Education Fact Sheets awareness and understandability. <bold>Methods:</bold> A voluntary survey was administered to attendees of the 2007-2011 NAMI Annual Meetings. The survey consisted of 16 questions developed by the 2007 Consumer Relations Committee and included questions regarding: awareness and role of psychiatric pharmacists, where medication information is obtained, Medication Fact Sheet awareness and understandability, and pharmacist involvement in local NAMI chapters. <bold>Results:</bold> Since 2007, the number of surveys collected ranged from 34-171. Of those surveyed in previous years, 73-81% of respondents were not aware that pharmacists specialize in mental health. However, between 70-91% of respondents would like to know more about psychiatric pharmacists. This year's results were similar to results collected in previous years. A total of 122 surveys were completed, 82% of respondents were unaware of psychiatric pharmacists and 81% of respondents stated that they would like to learn more about psychiatric pharmacists. In 2007, only 12% of the respondents were aware that the medication fact sheets were available on the NAMI website. In contrast, in 2011, 42% of respondents were aware of the medication fact sheets located on the NAMI website. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The survey responses indicate that there continues to be a significant need to educate consumers, family members and providers who attend the NAMI Annual Convention about psychiatric pharmacists. Increased participation of CPNP members in local and state NAMI chapters may help increase awareness of psychiatric pharmacists.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> A medication utilization evaluation (MUE) was developed to evaluate current prescribing of in-patient psychiatrists and to determine potential opportunities for improvement. A 90-day follow-up was performed to monitor for changes in prescribing trends. <bold>Method:</bold> Patients receiving benzodiazepines were compiled by creating a report for the month of December 2009 using Pandora™, a program that monitors medications pulled from the automated dispensing cabinets. Patient profiles were reviewed and data was compiled in the following areas using Microsoft Access: Start and stop date; whether order was from outpatient, inpatient, or active upon discharge; prescribing psychiatrist; medication; dose/frequency; PRN status and indication; maximum received per day; and dose increase or decrease. Using the data collected, a detailed report was created and distributed in September 2010 to psychiatric facility administration and the psychiatrists. Prescribing data was shown for each psychiatrist; however, psychiatrists were assigned a number to blind the results. The following topics were covered in the report: Methods, patient diagnoses, pathophysiology of anxiety disorders, benzodiazepine pharmacology, areas of caution, suggestions for improvement, and finally a treatment algorithm for each anxiety disorder. A follow-up MUE was performed using patients from the month of December 2010. <bold>Results:</bold> The first MUE consisted of 118 patients and the follow-up MUE consisted of 121 patients. The following categories were compared: non-equivalent dose when switching benzodiazepines (2009 = 27; 2010 = 5), patients on two benzodiazepines (2009 = 21; 2010 = 19), high treatment doses (2009 = 53; 2010 = 22), percentage of orders for PRN dosing (2009 = 27%; 2010 = 30%), percentage of orders for dose decreases (2009 = 36%; 2010 = 42%), and percentage change in benzodiazepines on admission versus benzodiazepines upon discharge (2009 = +21%; 2010 = +22.5%). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Based on the findings of this evaluation, utilizing MUE data with the addition of education can help to improve prescribing of benzodiazepines by exposing current prescribing trends, focusing attention to areas of improvement, help in establishing goals, and creating accountability.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> The association of hypovitaminosis D with measures of depression, cognitive impairment and subsequent treatment is not well established. We evaluated this correlation and subsequent prescribing practices of therapeutic vitamin D supplementation in a population of psychiatric inpatients. <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective study of 607 patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital between November 2000 and November 2010 with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level measured on hospital admission were evaluated for the association of 25(OH)D deficiency with either the Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score or the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score. Additionally, prescribing tendencies for vitamin D deficiency in this patient population at hospital discharge were evaluated. <bold>Results:</bold> During this 10 year study period, there were 245 patients (40.4%) with a 25(OH)D deficiency, of which the majority, 221 (90.2%) had moderate (10-24 ng/mL) and 24 (9.8%) had severe deficiency ( &lt; 10 ng/ml). There were no significant associations between 25(OH)D deficiency and MMSE or PHQ-9 scores. Overall, 29.4% of patients with a moderate deficiency and 41.7% with severe deficiency were newly prescribed or had an increase in vitamin D dose at dismissal. The association between a newly prescribed or increased dose of vitamin D at dismissal and the presence of deficiency was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> There was no association found between vitamin D deficiency and depression or cognitive function in this psychiatric inpatient population. However, those patients with deficient 25(OH)D levels were more likely to be prescribed new vitamin D or a dose increase at hospital discharge.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Objective:</bold> There is a strong, positive correlation between chronic disease and depression. Patients with a chronic condition and co-morbid depression are more likely to have a condition-related hospitalization or emergency visit compared to patients with the condition alone. Observational studies have illustrated diminished self-management in patients with chronic disease (e.g., COPD, diabetes) and depression. This study aims to (1) determine the prevalence of depression in uninsured or underinsured patients with chronic disease(s) using a validated instrument for use in the primary care setting, (2) provide a referral to their PCP for depression management prior to disease management as needed, and (3) set up patients for chronic disease management services. <bold>Methods:</bold> Patients included in this study are enrolled in the St. Vincent’s Providing Access to Healthcare (P.A.T.H.) program – a program that provides primary care access, plus nurse and pharmacist-led disease management services. Adult uninsured or underinsured patients meeting the health system’s financial guidelines with one of the following ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC): Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Diabetes, Heart Failure, or Hypertension meet criteria. Initial data collection will occur between January 2012 and April 2012. All patients will be asked to complete the Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC) upon program enrollment. The BDI-PC is a 7-item questionnaire that focuses on symptoms of sadness, pessimism, past failure, loss of pleasure, self-dislike, self-criticalness, and suicidal thoughts or wishes. A cutoff score of 4 and above is indicative of further evaluation for depression. Should patients screen positively they will be referred to the primary care physician for follow-up services prior to entry into the disease management programs. Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate data. <bold>Results:</bold> NA <bold>Implications:</bold> Given the interrelationship between chronic disease and depression further studies are clearly warranted. The P.A.T.H. program will use this data to enhance existing disease management programs.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Currently, 8% to 12% of healthcare professionals have chemical dependencies and an increased risk of prescription drug abuse. This is thought to be due, impart, to their easy access to controlled substances. It is important for students of healthcare professions to be trained appropriately on the disease of dependency. Therefore, this study was designed to compare students in terms of risk factors for chemical dependence in different healthcare training programs to the incidence of chemical dependence in their respective fields. It is anticipated that these respective programs will utilize the information in developing or improving prevention, assistance, and education curricula. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1) Determine the prevalence of students that are at an increased risk for chemical dependence in different healthcare programs. 2) Assess the awareness of chemical dependence among healthcare professional students. 3) Compare students in terms of risk factors for chemical dependence between different disciplines. 4) Compare students in terms of risk factors for chemical dependence to the incidence of chemical dependence in their respective field. <bold>Methods:</bold> Participants will be recruited from the different health professional training programs in a large university. All students 18 years of age and older will be eligible and contacted for study participation. Demographic variables will be collected. A survey will be used to assess participants’ awareness and risks of chemical dependence. Students will be classified as at risk for chemical dependence if they self-report a score of ≥ 4 on the Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP) screening tool. Statistical analyses, such as Chi-square and t-tests will be utilized. The survey will be administered using Opinio survey software via the respective student affairs office of each different program. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the number and percent of students at increased risk of chemical dependence and analyze their awareness of chemical dependence in their respective fields.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Major depressive disorder (MDD) impacts approximately 2% of children and 4-8% of adolescents in the U.S. and is often treated with antidepressants. In 2004 the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a “black box” warning on antidepressant use in children and adolescents and made pharmacotherapy monitoring recommendations. Treatment of children and adolescents with MDD is essential however, there is currently a shortage of child psychiatrists trained to treat these patients so many children and adolescents receive treatment from primary care physicians such as pediatricians. This study will examine self-reported treatment, treatment rationales, and monitoring practices of pediatricians’. <bold>Objectives:</bold> This study is designed to determine pediatricians’ self-reported first-line of antidepressant treatment and the monitoring they conduct while the patient is being treated with antidepressant medication. The rationale for the choice of antidepressant treatment will be determined. Additionally, self-reported impact of the 2004 U.S. FDA black box warning upon treatment and monitoring practices will be collected. <bold>Methods:</bold> All pediatricians in a national physician database who practice in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia will serve as the sample for the current study (n = 3,146). This study utilizes survey methodology and modified Dillman method. Each pediatrician in the sample will receive a consent form, survey, and return postage-paid envelope. Content and face validity of the survey was assessed during the development of the survey. A pilot study was completed to evaluate the clarity of the survey instrument. The pilot study consisted of a random sample equal to 10% (315) of the total sample size. Based on the pilot study no adjustments to the content of the survey are required and the survey will be mailed to the remaining 2,831 pediatricians in the sample. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Reported outcomes will include pediatricians’ preferred first-line of treatment, preferred type of antidepressant treatment, rationale for antidepressant choice, and current monitoring practices. Additionally, the influence of the 2004 U.S. FDA black box warning on pediatricians’ treatment and monitoring practices will be reported. Pediatricians’ monitoring frequency will also be compared to U.S. FDA recommendations. Descriptive statistics and t-tests will be utilized to analyze the data.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> At our institution, lactobacillus has been used for possible weight gain benefits, to restore normal gut flora and make the refeeding process more tolerable. To our knowledge there is no evidence to support this rationale for the use of lactobacillus. It will be beneficial to examine patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) who received lactobacillus and compare their course of treatment to controls. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact lactobacillus has on weight gain and tolerability of weight gain in patients with AN. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1) To evaluate the impact lactobacillus has on weight gain in patients receiving inpatient treatment for anorexia nervosa as compared to those patients with anorexia nervosa who did not receive lactobacillus during their inpatient stay. 2) To evaluate tolerability of weight gain during inpatient treatment phase. <bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective, case-control study examining weight gain in patients with AN who received lactobacillus as part of their treatment as compared to patients with AN who did not receive lactobacillus. The hospital’s medical records were utilized to identify patients meeting study inclusion criteria. The study population was identified as having a diagnosis of AN during January 2009 to April 2011. Patients with a diagnosis of AN (ICD-9 307.1) who received lactobacillus will serve as cases while all others meeting study eligibility will serve as controls. We are collecting the percentage of weight gain over week time periods, cumulative percentage weight gain over duration of inpatient stay, bowel movements per day, number of days somatic complaints are noted (i.e. bloating, GI upset, etc.), number of consecutive days somatic complaints are noted, total number of “as needed” medications related to gastrointestinal upset required per day (i.e. simethicone, stool softeners, etc.), and necessity of “scheduled” gastrointestinal medications. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We intend to report the cumulative percentage of weight gain over the duration of the inpatient stay as well as analyze the information collected regarding tolerability and attempt to conclude whether lactobacillus increased weight gain or made the refeeding process more tolerable.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Patients with severe mental illness are at an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Obesity, genetics, tobacco use, poor diet, and minimal physical activity further increase the risk of developing chronic metabolic and cardiovascular disease this patient population. People with major mental illness lose, on average, more than 25 years of potential life primarily as a result of developing chronic medical illnesses. It has been established that many atypical antipsychotics negatively affect weight, lipid profiles, and glucose tolerance in as little as ten days. In 2004, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), American Psychiatric Association (APA), and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) developed and published consensus guidelines for the use of antipsychotics. Because diagnosis of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia remains underestimated and risperidone remains a first-line agents prescribed at James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC) we feel is important to evaluate our monitoring practices. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Evaluate adherence to Consensus guidelines that FPG and/or HA1C be measured prior to starting risperidone and again at 12 weeks, 2. Identify changes in A1C, FPG, or OGTT from baseline and calculate mean length of time between baseline and follow-up monitoring. <bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective cohort study will consist of a random selection of veterans from the James A. Lovell FHCC that are started on risperidone between January 1st, 2009 and July 1st, 2011. Subjects meeting inclusion criteria receiving risperidone for greater than 30 days will be evaluated. Demographic variables, medication history, laboratory (FPG, OGTT, A1C) results, mental health diagnoses, and duration of time between visits and lab monitoring will be collected. Baseline demographics will be assessed using descriptive statistics (mean + S.D, or percent, as appropriate). The primary endpoint will be assessed and presented as a prevalence or percent. Paired T-tests will be used to assess the secondary endpoints. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> IRB approval has been granted. We will report the prevalence of patients that are evaluated in accordance with Consensus guidelines and present mean length of time between baseline and follow-up laboratory monitoring as well as mean change in A1C and fasting plasma glucose.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Lithium is a well-established treatment option for the treatment of acute mania and maintenance therapy in adults with bipolar disorder, and is also approved by the FDA for use in children ages 12 and over. However, studies specifically evaluating the relationship between serum lithium concentration, efficacy, and cognitive performance in adolescents are lacking. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Assess the impact of lithium treatment on cognitive performance, and determine if these effects are related to lithium concentrations. 2. Assess the relationship between lithium serum concentrations and clinical response in subjects with pediatric bipolar disorder. <bold>Methods:</bold> The institutional review board approved this 8-week open-label, outpatient study. Medication-naïve, medically-healthy subjects aged 8-18 years meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition diagnostic criteria for manic or mixed episode, bipolar disorder type I are eligible. Target enrollment is 50 subjects. Subjects with additional major DSM-IV axis I diagnoses are excluded. Subjects will be initially treated with 300 mg lithium carbonate twice daily. Dose will be gradually increased based on response and adverse drug events. Dose escalation will be stopped if a) the subject meets the pre-determined criteria for clinical response, b) side effects significantly impair the subject’s functioning, or c) the serum lithium level is &gt;1.2 mEq/L. Clinical response will be defined by a decrease of &gt;50% on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and symptomatic remission will be defined as a score of 12 or less on the YMRS. Additionally, cognitive changes will be measured by performance on the California Verbal Learning Test to evaluate verbal learning and memory, and the Trails B portion of the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Battery as a marker of judgment and problem-solving. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Differences between 8-week and baseline cognitive tests will be analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA using matched untreated healthy controls receiving testing in parallel to assess practice effects. Receiver operating characteristic curves for clinical response and remission will be used to identify threshold lithium levels at which response or remission could be predicted in this study sample. Potential covariates in both analyses will include age, sex, baseline YMRS, and presence of ADHD or anxiety disorder diagnosis.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Alzheimer ’s disease is the most common type of dementia in the United States and has been linked to a loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. The most commonly prescribed drugs for Alzheimer’s disease are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) which reduce the rate of acetylcholine breakdown, thereby increasing acetylcholine concentrations in the brain. Most elderly patients also suffer from co-morbid conditions commonly treated with drugs producing anticholinergic effects. Anticholinergic drugs readily cross the blood brain barrier and bind to cholinergic receptors, competing with acetylcholine and antagonizing the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The use of multiple drugs with anticholinergic effects is not uncommon and their additive effects may have a greater clinical impact in an aging population. The opposing mechanisms of action may result in deleterious effects of the AChEIs, lead to adverse drug events, and aggravate cognitive decline. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the prevalence of concomitant use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and drugs with anticholinergic effects among veterans treated at the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center, and to calculate the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden which could lead to potential adverse effects and a decline in cognition. <bold>Methods:</bold> A medication use review will be conducted through a computerized patient record system (CPRS) to evaluate the concomitant use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with drugs known to have anticholinergic effects. Patient records will be reviewed to identify those who were prescribed acetylcholinesterase inhibitors from January 1 to December 31, 2010. All medications prescribed during this period will be reviewed to evaluate the concurrent use of drugs with known anticholinergic properties, their indications, and the duration of overlapping therapy. Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden will be calculated using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale based on overlapping therapies greater than 14 days at any time during their AChEI regimen. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> The Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden for veterans taking AChIEs will be reported, along with the most commonly prescribed anticholinergic producing drugs, and their average overlapping durations. If available, any adverse events resulting from the concomitant use of acetylcholinerase inhibitors and anticholinergic drugs will be reported.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Patients that are admitted to the Inpatient Psychiatric Unit at the William S. Middleton VA Hospital are patients in an acute mental health crisis and are on a locked inpatient psychiatric unit. These patients benefit from group therapy to learn coping skills while on the inpatient psychiatric unit. Mental health patients are often on numerous medications for medical conditions, mood medications, and sleep medications. The amount of medications may seem overwhelming for patients. Patients also can experience medication side effects from the medications. Patients may benefit from attending a group which educates patients that are in an acute crisis how to manage medication side effects and how to better manage their medications. The goal of this study is to assess the patient knowledge gained from the new pharmacist-run Inpatient Medication Education Group that was recently started on the inpatient psychiatry unit. Identifying common gaps in medication adherence and medication side effects knowledge in mental health patients will guide the future content and method of education of the group. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Evaluate medication adherence and medication side effect knowledge among patients on the inpatient psychiatric unit who have attended the new inpatient medication education group. 2. Compare the scores from the modified Medication Understanding and Use Self-Efficacy Scale (MUSE) medication adherence tool and modified Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Ratings (FIBSER) medication side effects tool between patients who attended the new group versus patients who did not attend the inpatient med group. 3. Identify if attending more than one Inpatient Medication Education Group increased assessment scores. <bold>Methods:</bold> Patients who are admitted to and discharged from the Inpatient Psychiatry Unit are asked to complete necessary paperwork. The addition of the medication education assessment survey tool will be included in the admission and discharge procedures and patients will be invited to fill out paperwork and participate in the study. Baseline demographic data collected includes the following information: gender, age, DSM-IV diagnosis at discharge, length of hospitalization, number of Inpatient Medication Education Groups attended, and psychiatric medications prescribed. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Pending and will be presented at the CPNP Annual Meeting.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Combination antipsychotics and aggressive dosing have been increasingly used to treat schizophrenia in clinical psychiatry. Although there is little supportive evidence, these practices are typically outside clinical practice scope and FDA prescribing guidelines. These strategies often lead to addition of medications to combat side effects, increased risk of drug interactions, decreased patient adherence to regimens, and increased healthcare costs. An initial assessment of prescribing patterns within Gallahue Mental Health Services (GMHS) was performed in 2010. This retrospective assessment including 48 patients found 55% of patients on combination antipsychotics, 17% of patients on high-dose antipsychotics, and 60% of cases had no documentation of rationale for use of these regimens. The initial assessment results have been used to implement additions to the electronic medical record system to improve prescriber documentation. It is necessary to continue this assessment to make continual improvements. <bold>Methods:</bold> The study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board. A retrospective chart review of GMHS patients from 9/1/2011 to 12/31/2011 will be conducted. One hundred patients is the goal for inclusion. Included patients will be 18-89 years or older with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, or psychotic disorder who are taking at least one antipsychotic. The Joint Commission Medication Management Standards for Behavioral Health states an organization must develop policies and procedures to monitor the use of psychotropic medications.8 The definitions of polypharmacy and high-dose antipsychotics in this study will be based on the policy developed by GMHS. Polypharmacy will be defined as the use of more than one antipsychotic and the addition of medications to treat adverse effects. High-dose will be defined as doses exceeding the maximum dose listed in the package insert. Prescriber documentation of rationale for regimen and adverse drug reactions will be evaluated via prescriber progress notes. Adverse reactions assessed will be extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, anticholinergic effects, sedation, and orthostasis. Patient compliance with regimen will be evaluated by patient report to prescriber and review of injection records for patients receiving long-acting injectable antipsychotics. <bold>Results:</bold> Data will be analyzed and results will presented at the CPNP annual meeting.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Falls are the most common safety event among hospitalized patients, occurring at a rate of up to 13 falls per 1,000 patient days. An estimated 30 percent of falls result in injury. Mendelson conducted a study at a large tertiary care medical center and found that patients who fell took significantly more antidepressants, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, and major tranquilizers than patients who did not fall. Both the initiation and dosage increases of benzodiazepines have been associated with falls. Hilmer et al. used the Drug Burden Index (DBI) to quantify the relative anticholinergic and sedative effects contributed by medications. The DBI is calculated as the sum of the following for each included drug: [(Daily dose received) divided by (Daily dose received plus the minimum FDA recommended daily dose)]. A higher DBI was associated with poorer physical function. In fact, each unit of DBI had a negative effect on physical function equivalent to three additional physical comorbidities. <bold>Purpose:</bold> The aim of this project is to characterize the dosing of sedatives and hypnotics in hospitalized patients who experienced a fall at Virginia Commonwealth University Health System (VCUHS). The primary outcome is to determine if there is a difference in DBI between the first 24 hours of admission and the 24 hours immediately prior to the fall. <bold>Methods:</bold> Inpatients aged 18 years or older will be included if they experienced a fall at least 48 hours after hospital admission. The University Healthcare Consortium Patient Safety Network database will be used to identify falls occurring at VCUHS from July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011. Hospital floor, length of stay, age, sex, weight, and qualitative remarks will be recorded for each event. DBIs will be calculated for each patient included in this study, both for the first 24 hours after hospital admission and for the 24 hours prior to the fall. All sedative and hypnotic medications on the VCUHS formulary will be included in the calculation. A paired t-test will be used for the primary outcome, and descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the population. <bold>Results:</bold> Data collection is currently in progress.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> A 2011 study suggested that the use of anticholinergic medications increased the risk of mortality in community-dwelling patients over the age of 65. <bold>Objective:</bold> To evaluate the association between anticholinergics and hospital-related outcomes, including mean length of hospital stay and survival at hospital discharge. <bold>Methods:</bold> Between July 2006 and March 2008, English-speaking patients over the age of 65 admitted to a general medicine ward at Wishard Hospital were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. The Regenstrief Medical Record System (RMRS) was used to gather demographic data, medication orders, length of stay, and mortality data for the study population. Data from the RMRS was used to measure Acute Physiology Scores (APS) and Charlson comorbidity scores to assess severity of illness. Baseline cognitive function and delirium were assessed using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) and Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), respectively. The Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale (ACB) was used to recognize orders for anticholinergic medications. Study participants were stratified into those who received no orders for anticholinergics (NA), those with orders for possible anticholinergics (PA), and those with orders for definite anticholinergics (DA). <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 991 patients provided consent for inclusion in the study. The mean age was 74.6 years with females representing 69% and African Americans representing 56% of the overall study population. Baseline demographics were similar between the groups (p &gt; 0.05) for percentage of females, mean age, mean baseline SPMSQ, and mean Charlson comorbidity score. The DA group was more likely to be younger and had higher severity of illness scores. Approximately 50% (N = 492) of participants received an order for a PA and 32% (N = 317) received an order for a DA. After adjusting for age, race, gender, Charlson score, and APS, the mean hospital length of stay was 5.5, 5.6, and 8.6 days in the NA, PA, and DA groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). The percentage of patients surviving at discharge was 100% in the NA group, 99.2% in the PA group, and 97.2% in the DA group (p = 0.036). No difference in readmission rates was found between the groups.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Objective:</bold> Investigate the association of antipsychotic medication initiation with serious adverse events (acute care hospitalization or death) in elderly veterans with dementia. <bold>Background:</bold> Behavioral and psychological symptoms are often present in those with dementia and are commonly treated with antipsychotic medications (APs). In 2005, the FDA mandated a black box warning on some atypical APs secondary to studies demonstrating an increased risk of death associated with use in elderly patients with dementia. In 2008, the warning was extended to all APs. In addition, manufacturer labeling specifies that these medications are not approved for use in this population. Despite the warnings, these medications continue to be commonly prescribed off-label to treat these symptoms in patients with dementia. Most subsequent studies have confirmed the association between antipsychotic use and serious adverse events, but few have been in the United States Veteran population. <bold>Methods:</bold> Study is a retrospective cohort design using data from the Salem Veterans Affairs Medical Center computerized record system. Veteran records will be reviewed to determine baseline characteristics, dementia type, comorbid diagnoses, and adverse events within three months of initiation of any AP. Case subjects are those &gt;64 years of age with dementia and/or related disorders (e.g. Alzheimer’s) treated in the outpatient or inpatient setting from January 1, 2010 to April 30, 2011 receiving an initial AP prescription/order. Control subjects will be from the same group without an AP prescribed. Case and control subjects will be compared to determine if case subjects experienced significantly more serious adverse events or deaths than control subjects using chi square and t-test analysis. A Cox proportional hazard model will be used to compare outcomes and control for comorbidity, living situation, and type of dementia if deemed appropriate based on initial analysis of data. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Of seventy-eight inpatient case subjects evaluated thus far that met inclusion criteria, twenty-six (33%) had a serious adverse event (21, 27%) or died (5, 6%) within three months of initiation of an AP. Pneumonia-induced respiratory failure was the most common cause of death. The study will be complete by April 1st, 2012.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background/Purpose:</bold> Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs in 2-4% of the adult population and is characterized by repetitive collapse of the upper airway. Several risk factors exist which place patients at high-risk of developing OSA, including obesity and type-2 diabetes. Atypical antipsychotic use increases a patient’s risk for developing obesity and type-2 diabetes as a result of the associated metabolic syndrome. In addition to these risks, recent studies have suggested atypical antipsychotics may be associated with OSA due to their tranquilizing properties and the effects antagonizing serotonin has on laryngeal tone. The purpose of this study is to determine whether atypical antipsychotics are independently associated with more severe obstructive sleep apnea. <bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective cohort study, with three matched patient groups: those taking atypical antipsychotics, typical antipsychotics, and those not taking any antipsychotics. Patients will be matched based upon age, gender and weight, and will be selected from all patients who have had a polysomnographic (PSG) study for which there is complete data and who are veterans at the Federal Health Care Center. Those who do not have complete PSG data available, are non-veterans, are taking both an atypical and typical antipsychotic at the time of the PSG study and/or are receiving a serotonergic antagonist will be excluded from the study. The primary endpoint is the number of obstructive respiratory events per hour of total sleep, while the secondary endpoint is the comparison of the number of obstructive respiratory events between the use of atypical antipsychotics and other tranquilizers known to increase the risk of OSA (benzodiazepines, opioids, and sedatives). The primary endpoint will be analyzed using ANOVA, with the appropriate post-hoc analysis depending on the distribution pattern of the study subjects. Secondary endpoints will be assessed using the paired t-test. <bold>Results:</bold> This study is IRB approved and results will be presented pending data collection.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Title:</bold> Citalopram: A Meta-Analysis Comparing Efficacy, Dosing &amp; Titration <bold>Background:</bold> Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is an incapacitating illness that drastically alters a person’s ability to complete activities of daily living. Despite this fact, providers often titrate antidepressants more slowly than permitted by the prescribing information. For example, although the manufacturer of citalopram recommends a starting dose of 20 mg with titration to 40 mg permitted after 1 week, providers often wait many weeks before titrating. This is often due to concerns about tolerability at higher doses, and the belief that 20 mg may be an adequate treatment dose. The practice of waiting multiple weeks before titration is reinforced by studies such as the STAR*D trial, where investigators waited 4 weeks before titrating citalopram. In other studies, citalopram was provided at (1) a fixed dose with no opportunities for titration, (2) a forced titration, or (3) a symptom-triggered titration. <bold>Objectives:</bold> This review will compare the efficacy and tolerability of these three dosing strategies by reviewing studies that use the various approaches. We hope to provoke more discussion and research in this area which could lead to changes in practice guidelines for the initiation of citalopram in patients with MDD. <bold>Methods:</bold> A literature search was performed to find randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded studies using citalopram to treat adults with confirmed MDD. To be included in this review studies also had to use the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) as an outcome. Studies were excluded if they included treatment-resistant patients (greater than three previous failed trials of antidepressants) or if they were focused on patients with concomitant psychiatric conditions in addition to MDD. Ten studies were identified and will be included in the review. Each study has been categorized as involving either a fixed dose, forced titration, or symptom-triggered titration strategy. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will compare the change in HAM-D scores over time for the three dosing strategies. Additionally, we will report differences in tolerability outcomes for the three approaches. This will provide meaningful insight into how different treatment practices affect outcomes in major depressive disorder.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Studies have shown that the incidence of QTc prolongation is 0.5-1.9% and citalopram is associated with dose-dependent QTc prolongation. In August 2011, the FDA announced that citalopram 60 mg/day resulted in an increased in QTc interval by 18.5 milliseconds; therefore citalopram should no longer be prescribed above 40 mg/day. Since &gt;40 mg/day of citalopram has not shown any clinical benefit in patients with depression, a dose reduction should not produce higher relapse incidences. This retrospective study aims to determine whether citalopram dose reductions attributed to QTc warnings led to clinical worsening in previously stable patients. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Evaluate the clinical impact/outcome of dose reduction of citalopram. 2. Analyze ECG to determine if there are any correlations in citalopram dose-dependent QTc prolongation; to evaluate compliance/findings of mandatory ECG monitoring in patients remaining on above the FDA recommendation. <bold>Methods:</bold> This is a randomized, retrospective chart review. Patients who received letters regarding citalopram changes (1519 patients) will be recruited with a target enrollment of &gt;210 patients to meet 80% power. Inclusion criteria includes: patients who are &gt;18 years old, who have received citalopram at doses &gt;60 mg/day and patients who have been taking citalopram for &gt;1 year. Exclusion criteria include citalopram that was initiated by non-VA providers. The patients will be divided into two age groups: 18-49 and 60+. Demographic variables (e.g. age, gender,, co-morbidities) will be collected. Psychiatric progress notes (GAF/HRDS/QIDS-SR) will be used to evaluate responses. Clinical assessments from the progress notes will be defined as: stable (defaulted answer if no changes were made and no hospitalization/visit to the Psychiatric Emergency Clinic), relapsed (“worse/worsened/less functional”) and improvement (“better/improved/functional”) <bold>Outcomes:</bold> This study will provide information on the safety risks associated with dose reduction in previously stable patients. The information obtained will be used to determine whether additional monitoring parameters are necessary. Study results showing no increased risk of relapse with dosage decrease would indicate that patients should not receive higher than 40 mg/day. However, study results showing an increased risk of relapse with dosage decrease should prompt prescribers to think of alternative options rather than decrease the dose for future patients.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Approximately 500,000 pregnancies in the United States each year involve women with psychiatric illnesses. This statistic is concerning due to the potential risk associated with treating mental illness during pregnancy using pregnancy category C or D psychotropic medications. Exposure to several psychotropic medications during pregnancy, including mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants, have been linked to an increased risk of congenital abnormalities. On the other hand, leaving a maternal mental illness untreated also poses risks to the mother and fetus. Therefore, it is important that female patients of child-bearing age prescribed psychotropic medications undergo screening for pregnancy and contraception on a routine basis. <bold>Objective:</bold> To determine if female veteran patients receiving psychotropic medications are being adequately screened for pregnancy and use of contraception. <bold>Methods:</bold> The study will be cross sectional in design, involving chart review of female veteran patients prescribed psychotropic medications at the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC). Electronic medical charts will be reviewed for female patients of child-bearing age (between ages 18-50) prescribed one or more psychotropic medications. Participants must be enrolled in the mental health and/or women’s health clinic at the FHCC and have at least one documented clinic visit during the study period of June 1, 2010 to May 31, 2011. For the primary endpoints, each patient’s chart will be reviewed for documentation of pregnancy screening and use of contraception (either an active prescription for a contraceptive agent or chart documentation of a birth control method) at any time during the study period. For the secondary endpoints, each patient’s chart will be reviewed for types of contraceptive methods being used and whether contraceptive counseling is being documented. The study will have three groups as follows: 1. Patients enrolled in the mental health clinic 2. Patients enrolled in the women’s health clinic 3. Patients enrolled in both clinics. Using contingency table analysis, the primary and secondary endpoints will be compared among the three groups to evaluate the current screening practices for pregnancy and contraception in this female patient population. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> The study is IRB-approved, and results are pending data collection and analysis.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> In August 2011, the FDA issued a safety warning stating that citalopram should no longer be used at doses greater than 40mg/day because of dose-dependent QT interval prolongation and subsequent risk of developing fatal heart arrhythmias. At this time, we are unaware of any observational studies that have been conducted to retrospectively determine the associated risk of QTc interval prolongation with citalopram at therapeutic doses in clinical practice settings. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Define the incidence and compare the relative risk of QTc interval prolongation &gt; 500 milliseconds in patients receiving citalopram at low-to-moderate doses (20-40mg/day) compared to high doses (41-80mg/day). 2. Identify concurrent associated risks of QTc interval prolongation by describing disease, metabolic and drug related risk factors that occur at the time of initiation and throughout citalopram treatment. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study is designed as a retrospective cohort study (Longitudinal follow-up). Through review of electronic medical records, approximately 2,000 patients in the VA Salt Lake City Health Care System that started taking citalopram during the study period (January 1, 2010 – December 31, 2011) will be assessed for development of QTc prolongation. Patient specific demographics (age, gender, race), ECG evaluations (QTc intervals), relevant risk factors for QTc prolongation (i.e. age &gt; 60, concurrent medications, cardiac disease, electrolyte abnormalities, and previous diagnosis of QTc prolongation) will be retrospectively collected. Analysis and characterization of data will be done primarily using descriptive statistics. The total number of documented events of QTc interval &gt; 500 msec will be used to calculate the incidence (rate) per person-years of exposure in each comparator group. Relative Risk will be calculated to determine the effect size between the number of events (QTc &gt; 500 msec) between the low-to-moderate dose group compared to the high dose group. All nominal data will be assessed using Chi-squared test. All parametric continuous data will be assessed using Student's t-test. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Results will be presented pending IRB approval. We will report the incidence and relative risk of QTc interval prolongation between the low-to-moderate dose group and high dose group. In addition, we will describe common risk factors observed in patients who experienced QTc interval prolongation.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> While many studies have evaluated the use of benzodiazepines in conjunction with psychotherapy for the treatment of anxiety disorders, the efficacy of this combination remains unclear in PTSD. To our knowledge, there are currently no published studies to determine the efficacy of this combination with only a few studies evaluating benzodiazepine monotherapy in the treatment of PTSD. Alternatively, psychotherapy as monotherapy in PTSD has been studied in multiple trials with well-established efficacy. In patients with other disorders, such as panic, the efficacy data for this combination has been controversial with deleterious effects shown in some studies. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Evaluate the effect of concomitant benzodiazepine use (overall; scheduled vs. as needed) on the treatment efficacy of psychotherapy (cognitive processing therapy (CPT), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), prolonged exposure (PE)) in Veterans with PTSD, 2. Determine the effect of concomitant benzodiazepine use on healthcare utilization in Veterans with PTSD. <bold>Methods:</bold> We are conducting a retrospective chart review from March 1, 2010 through March 1, 2011 of Veterans treated at VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS) with CPT, CBT, or PE for PTSD. Exclusion criteria include active substance dependence recorded within 6 months prior to psychotherapy. In terms of data collection, demographic (age, sex, race, other psychiatric diagnoses, type of trauma, combat era) and healthcare utilization (behavioral health hospitalizations 1 year pre-psychotherapy) data will be collected prior to psychotherapy. Psychotherapy (CPT, PE, CBT), medication (benzodiazepine therapy, scheduled vs. PRN dosing, therapy duration, antidepressant prescriptions, antidepressant type), and efficacy parameters (PTSD Checklist – Military Version (PCL-M) scores, compliance to psychotherapy) will be collected during psychotherapy with additional healthcare utilization data (behavioral health hospitalizations) collected within the one year post- psychotherapy completion. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the results of our comparisons of percentage of psychotherapy sessions completed, change from baseline and final PCL-M scores, and behavioral health hospitalizations both pre- and post-psychotherapy in Veterans both with and without concomitant benzodiazepine therapy. Because benzodiazepines are widely used to treat PTSD in combination with psychotherapy within the VASDHS, it is important to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this combination to determine if a treatment effect is present.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Recent trials have failed to demonstrate differences in efficacy between first generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second generation antipsychotics (SGAs). To reduce costs, many healthcare systems have restricted the availability of SGAs through use of prior authorizations. The United States General Accounting Office has placed risperidone as the first-line option of SGAs due to its lower cost and equal efficacy and if one wishes to prescribe a SGA other than risperidone, a restricted drug request (RDR) is submitted and reviewed. Restrictions for the off-label use of SGAs and the use of dual-antipsychotic therapy have also been implemented in many health systems. Since the introduction of these policies at the South Texas Veterans Health Care System (STVHCS), analyses of outcomes have not been conducted. This study aims to determine the effects of a prior authorization policy on the care of STVHCS veterans. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Primary Outcome: hospitalization rates of veterans with a denied request for SGA due to initial criterion failure. Secondary Outcomes: impact of antipsychotic RDR rejection on mental health as evidenced by (1) no-shows and cancellations for follow-up appointments (2) psychiatric emergency department visits, (3) suicidal ideation, (4) weight, (5) hemoglobin A1c, (6) number of psychotropic medications prescribed, and (7) extrapyramidal symptoms. <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart review of veterans denied an initial SGA request will be conducted from 3 months prior to 3 months post request denial (index date). Data to be collected will include: indication for SGA in request, reason for SGA denial, number of psychiatric hospitalizations, number of no-shows and cancellations for mental health appointments, number of psychiatric emergency department visits, number of reports of suicidal ideation or attempts, weight, hemoglobin A1c lab results, number of reports of extrapyramidal symptoms, length of time for request evaluation, and change in number of prescribed psychotropic medications. Results will be analyzed using Chi square and Fisher’s Exact tests for nominal data, standard t-test use for continuous data and the Mann-Whitney U test for ordinal data. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Pre and post SGA rejection data will be reported and analyzed to determine the impact on the veteran population as a result of antipsychotic prescribing.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Recently, an increasing number of studies have investigated vitamin D levels and effects on cognitive function and mental health. Treatment of depression includes both direct and indirect costs, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no data investigating whether low vitamin D levels in depressed patients leads to consumption of more resources and increased healthcare costs. This study aims to evaluate the amount of resources utilized to treat depressed patients with concomitant decreased vitamin D levels. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Determine whether there is a difference in severity of disease between depressed patients with low vitamin D levels (25(OH)D &lt; 20 ng/mL) compared to depressed patients with normal vitamin D levels (25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL) based on the amount of resources needed to treat their depression. 2. Evaluate number of changes made to medication regimens. 3. Conduct a cost analysis to determine the burden to the healthcare system caused by decreased vitamin D levels in depressed patients. <bold>Methods:</bold> A report of all patients admitted to Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center over the past 3 years with a vitamin D level and a diagnosis of depression will be generated. The study group will include those patients having a serum 25(OH)D level &lt; 20 ng/mL and the control group includes patients with sufficient vitamin D levels defined as serum 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL. Detailed information will be recorded for each patient in the study including number of antidepressants, number of changes to antidepressants (doses and medications), addition of adjunctive medications, number and length of hospitalizations, and final dose requirements of antidepressants. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report whether there is a difference in utilization of healthcare resources for the treatment of depression with concomitant decreased vitamin D levels through analysis of medication regimens and treatment course during hospitalization.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Diabetes is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and increased healthcare costs in the United States. Available evidence suggests that patients with depression and diabetes have poorer glycemic control and a higher risk of diabetic complications compared to non-depressed patients. Currently, there is minimal data investigating the longitudinal effects of depression on glycemic control in adults with diabetes. Consequently, current clinical guidelines lack recommendations for the screening and management of depression in patients with diabetes. <bold>Purpose:</bold> The purpose of this study is to evaluate the longitudinal effect of depression on glycemic control in diabetic veterans. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study was IRB and VA Research &amp; Development Committee approved. It is a retrospective, electronic chart review of patients at JBVAMC with uncontrolled diabetes, defined as a glycosolated hemoglobin A1c (gHbA1c) ≥9%, and depression, identified as those who have been prescribed an antidepressant within 3 months of the baseline gHbA1c. Exclusion criteria includes individuals with concomitant use of atypical antipsychotics, protease inhibitors, long term continuous systemic corticosteroids (≥3 months), patients prescribed trazodone monotherapy, or patients prescribed bupropion for the treatment of smoking cessation. The following data was collected: demographics, past medical history, gHbA1c, antidepressant and insulin information, medication compliance, therapeutic lifestyle changes, clinic appointment attendance, and depression screening information. The primary endpoint will be the mean difference in gHbA1c between depressed and non-depressed subjects with diabetes over a 3 year period of time. The secondary endpoints will be the mean difference in gHbA1c between patients diagnosed with diabetes less than 1 year and patients diagnosed with diabetes for at least 1 year within each study arm, completion of a depression screening, nutrition, managing overweight and/or obesity for veterans everywhere (MOVE!<sup>®</sup>), and diabetes education class appointment adherence, primary care clinic appointment adherence, and adherence to diabetic agents and antidepressants. <bold>Results/Conclusions:</bold> Data collection and analysis are ongoing.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. American Society of Health System Pharmacists Midyear Clinical Meeting, New Orleans, LA 2011 and The Ohio College of Clinical Pharmacy Fall Meeting, Beachwood, OH 2011.<bold>Background:</bold> A previous study conducted at the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center (LSCVAMC) determined that a typical antipsychotic, perphenazine, is being used as adjunct treatment for patients with PTSD.<sup>1</sup> Krystal and associates, evaluated adjunct risperidone for antidepressant-resistant symptoms of chronic military service-related PTSD and found it to be no more effective than placebo.<sup>2</sup> The purpose of this study is to evaluate perphenazine use as adjunct treatment for SSRI-resistant PTSD in veterans at the LSCVAMC and provide guidance for future practice. <bold>Objective:</bold> To evaluate the efficacy, defined by relapse rate, of adjunct perphenazine use in patients with SSRI-resistant PTSD. <bold>Methodology:</bold> A case-matched, retrospective chart review will evaluate the relapse rate, defined as hospital admissions and psychiatric ER visits, of adjunct perphenazine versus adjunct risperidone for SSRI-resistant PTSD. Relapse is defined as a composite of one or more of the following: discontinuation due to lack of effect; psychiatric hospitalization with a discharge diagnosis ICD-9 code for PTSD; increase in symptoms; intentional self-injury; new or increased suicidal ideation; homicidal ideation or violence. Secondary objectives will assess adherence and adverse effects. All patients with a prescription for perphenazine plus a SSRI for treatment of SSRI-resistant PTSD from October 2007 to October 2010 will be included. Patients will be excluded if they have a psychiatric indication for an antipsychotic (schizophrenia or bipolar), lack an adequate trial of perphenazine or lack an adequate trial of their previous SSRI as monotherapy. Patients who meet the study criteria will be matched based on demographics to patients on an equivalent dose of risperidone plus a SSRI for SSRI-resistant PTSD. Patients will be evaluated for the primary and secondary outcomes within 1 year of initiating perphenazine or risperidone. A t-test will be used to compare the relapse rate change between adjunct perphenazine and adjunct risperidone. <bold>Results/Conclusions:</bold> To be determined.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> The rare, but potentially fatal, side effect of agranulocytosis has caused the use of clozapine to be regulated more than any other antipsychotic medication. All patients must be registered in the Clozapine National Registry and frequent monitoring of WBC (white blood cell) count and ANC (absolute neutrophil count) must be performed every 7-28 days depending on the current duration of treatment. According to the clozapine monitoring guidelines provided by the Clozapine National Registry, a WBC count less than 3000/mm<sup>3</sup> or ANC less than 1500/mm<sup>3</sup> requires interruption of clozapine therapy. However, some physicians and patients are reluctant to discontinue clozapine. There are limited published reports in which clozapine was continued and the neutropenia was managed by adding lithium or granulopoiesis stimulating factors (GSFs), changing concomitant medications that might also be implicated in neutropenia, or observing to see if neutropenia is transient. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Compare clinical outcomes in patients who did and did not discontinue clozapine therapy as a result of a WBC count less than 3000/mm<sup>3</sup> or ANC less than 1500/mm<sup>3</sup>. <bold>Methods:</bold> The VA’s computerized patient record system will be used to retrospectively identify patients who, over a 17-year time period, have experienced a WBC count less than 3000/mm<sup>3</sup> or ANC less than 1500/mm<sup>3</sup> while actively taking clozapine for the treatment of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients who received clozapine for another diagnosis will be excluded. Patients will then be stratified into two groups: those who continued or discontinued clozapine therapy according to the national monitoring guidelines, and then they will be matched according to age and gender. Data collection will include ethnicity/race, diagnosis of Benign Ethnic Neutropenia, pertinent concomitant medications, and patient outcomes. Patient outcomes will be obtained via chart review of electronic medical records. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will compare clinical outcomes in patients who continued clozapine therapy despite moderate to severe leukopenia or neutropenia with those who discontinued therapy in order to determine if patients can safely be continued on clozapine when the clozapine monitoring guidelines suggest to stop.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> PTSD symptoms include isolation, avoidance, exaggerated startle response, flashbacks, nightmares, and cognitive impairment: poor memory, attention and learning. Incidence of PTSD in OEF/OIF Veterans ranges from 9-25%. Traumatic brain injury (TBI), where cognitive dysfunction is also seen, has been called the “signature injury“of OEF/OIF Veterans, and PTSD is commonly seen in Veterans with mild TBI (MTBI). While symptoms of MTBI usually dissipate within a few months, cognitive impairment can persist. Since MTBI should resolve on its own, it follows that in patients with both diagnoses, persistent symptoms of cognitive dysfunction may improve when PTSD symptoms improve negating the need for additional treatment for cognitive symptoms. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1.Determine whether there is a correlation between changes in PTSD symptoms and changes in cognitive function. 2.Compare performance on cognitive tests in Veterans with PTSD (group A) verses Veterans with PTSD and MTBI (group B) when treated for symptoms of PTSD <bold>Methodology:</bold> This study will include 50 OEF/OIF Veterans between 18 and 30 years of age with baseline scores below the normal range on at least one cognitive function test. Exclusion criteria include: previous treatment for PTSD, moderate to severe TBI, comorbid diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or neurologic disorder other than migraine headache, colorblindness and use of medications that may alter cognitive function. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline and 3 months for: PTSD symptoms using the PTSD Checklist-Military version (PCL-M), cognitive function using 7 cognitive function tests, mood changes using Beck Depression Inventory-2 (BDI-2) and Beck Anxiety Index (BAI), and alcohol consumption using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Medications used to treat PTSD will be assessed (by class). Spearman Correlation Coefficient will be used to evaluate the relationship between changes in PTSD symptoms scores and cognitive function test scores. Kruskal-Wallis test will be used to determine differences in changes in cognitive function between the two groups. Significance will be accepted at p &lt; 0.05. ANOVA will be used to evaluate nominal data for other independent variables associated with changes in cognitive scores including percent change from baseline in PCL-M, BDI-2, BAI, alcohol use, and medications used to treat PTSD.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Antipsychotics are associated with metabolic effects including increased body weight, cholesterol, and glucose. Patients with psychiatric disorders have also been found to have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes than the general population. This is thought to be attributed to undermonitoring and undertreatment of patients with psychiatric diseases. In 2004, the American Diabetes Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologist, and North American Association for the Study of Obesity released consensus guidelines (ADA/APA guidelines) for monitoring with second generation antipsychotics. Studies have shown low adherence to ADA/APA guidelines. Adherence to baseline glucose testing varies from 19-38.9%. Adherence to baseline lipid monitoring was found to be between 6-24.5%. In a single study, only 5% of patients had both baseline glucose and lipid testing. <bold>Objective:</bold> To evaluate if the metabolic monitoring form for antipsychotics initiated by pharmacists improves adherence to ADA/APA guidelines in an inpatient psychiatric population. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study was submitted to and approved by the Avera Institutional Review Board. Pharmacists will evaluate all patients admitted to the adult units between ages 18 and 65 within 48 hours of admission. If the patient is on a scheduled antipsychotic, the pharmacist will place a form on the chart with information regarding prior lipid panels, glucose testing, body mass index, and electrocardiogram and results. Physicians will have the option to order lipid panels, glucose testing, weight, height, or electrocardiogram on the form based on the information the pharmacist has provided. Retrospective chart reviews will be performed by the primary author on all patients admitted to the adult units between the ages of 18 and 65 for 1 month prior to and after implementation on a scheduled antipsychotic. The chart review will include evaluation of current admission and previous admissions (if available) for patient demographics, pharmacist documentation of review of patients, the ordering form, labs, antipsychotic start date, antipsychotic dose, and past medical history <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Rates of adherence to the ADA/APA guidelines will be evaluated before and after implementation of the monitoring form and possible confounding variable will be analyzed.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Second-generation antipsychotics are medications that have a significant impact on patients’ health and quality of life. The efficacy of these medications in the adult population has been well documented and studied, but fewer studies have focused on the pediatric population. Many of these medications have serious potential side effects. Therefore, monitoring for both efficacy and adverse effects is an important part of managing the disease states treated with second-generation antipsychotics. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Evaluate the frequency of all necessary monitoring and follow-up in pediatric patients on second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medications, regardless of medical diagnosis. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study will consist of a retrospective review of electronic medical records of all patients on a SGA at the university-affiliated pediatric clinic in a one-year time frame. All patients less than 19 years who are on at least one SGA for one year regardless of diagnosis and have been evaluated at the clinic for a minimum period of one year will be included in the study. Data collection will consist of all necessary laboratory monitoring, frequency of labs, patient specific information, and agreement between the consultant’s recommendation and patient’s medication list. Areas of improvement identified during the retrospective review will be incorporated into the development of a pharmacist-managed antipsychotic education service.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Patients with schizophrenia are at increased risk for developing osteoporosis, which has historically been attributed to poor diet and lack of exercise. However, more recent data suggests a link between antipsychotic use and osteoporosis due to increased prolactin levels Hyperprolactinemia can lead to suppression of hypothalamus-pituitary axis regulation of sex hormone production and over time, hypogonadism, which can affect bone health. There have been a few studies evaluating the link between antipsychotic use and osteoporosis, however the link is not well established and there is very little guidance regarding monitoring of prolactin levels. This study will help clarify the risk of developing osteoporosis in patients taking antipsychotics and the utility of prolactin monitoring. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1) Compare osteoporosis rates in patients receiving antipsychotic medications to a matched cohort group with no previous antipsychotic use. 2) Prolactin levels, effect of antipsychotic type, dosing and duration on osteoporosis rates, effect of confounding variables (other prolactin raising medications, Vitamin D levels, smoking status), and incidence of fractures. <bold>Methods:</bold> The study is a retrospective cohort study comparing patients ≥50 years of age receiving an antipsychotic at the Dallas VA Medical Center 1/1/2009-12/31/2009 to a matched cohort. Patients must have been taking the same antipsychotic for at least 1 year. Patients must not have significant comorbidities or take medications that increase osteoporosis risk. Patient demographics and antipsychotic information, Vitamin D, prolactin, testosterone and FSH/LH levels will be recorded. Use of other medications that may increase prolactin, smoking status, bone mineral density and history of fracture will also be recorded. Continuous data will be analyzed with the student’s t test and nominal data will be analyzed using Chi square or Fisher’s exact test when appropriate. Regression analysis will be performed to adjust for confounding variables and to evaluate primary objective. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the number and rates of osteoporosis development in both groups and p values comparing those rates. Additionally, information regarding type of antipsychotic used, dosing and duration of treatment, prolactin levels and osteoporosis rates when adjusted for confounding variables will be provided.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic with proven efficacy in a psychiatric patient population with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The prescribing of clozapine in this population is limited in part by its side effect profile, which includes the risk of agranulocytosis and other adverse hematological outcomes. Since successful clozapine therapy requires the maintenance of specific blood counts, care must be taken to avoid confounding factors that may precipitate reductions in WBC or ANC. It is known that the resolution of an infection produces an accompanying decrease in antibody production and WBC/ANC. Antibiotics have been implicated as a confounding factor of decreased blood cell counts when administered concomitantly with clozapine. However, these drops in the WBC and ANC have been noted to be related to the resolution of infection and not to a drug induced dyscrasia. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine if the drop in WBC/ANC for clozapine patients on antibiotics is a normal response to infection, or if the concurrent administration results in an abnormal dyscrasia and further reduction of WBC/ANC below baseline prior to infection. <bold>Methods:</bold> Data will be collected from inpatient recipients of clozapine therapy at Buffalo Psychiatric Center at any point from January 1, 2004 until June 30, 2011. Such data will include pre-infection baseline WBC and ANC, weekly ANC and WBC values, dates of clozapine therapy, frequency of clozapine monitoring and dates and types of antimicrobial therapy. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the differences between the pre-infection baseline and the result of the decrease of WBC/ANC during and after the completion of antibiotic therapy for clozapine patients. Antibiotics will be evaluated by type and duration of treatment.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Olanzapine was FDA-approved for schizophrenia in late 1996, seven years after Clozapine. The California Medicaid Program (Medi-Cal) established open access to atypical antipsychotics in October 1997. Clozapine and olanzapine are considered to be two of the most effective antipsychotics, but clinicians often resist initiating clozapine due to the burden of complete blood count monitoring during therapy. Several studies and clinician experiences suggest clozapine has superior efficacy compared to olanzapine. Therefore it is relevant to compare health care use between treatment episodes of clozapine versus olanzapine in Medi-Cal patients with schizophrenia. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Evaluate health care use and cost patterns for clozapine and olanzapine treatment categorized by four episode types: restarting after lapse in therapy, switching medication after a break in therapy, switching without a break and augmentation 2. Estimate utilization patterns of acute hospital, psychiatric hospital, nursing home or a suicide attempt 3. Estimate duration of antipsychotic treatment episode until use of acute hospital, psychiatric hospital, nursing home or a suicide attempt. <bold>Methods:</bold> Health care use will be captured during one-year treatment episodes between 1997 and 2002 when clozapine or olanzapine was initiated for adults with schizophrenia. Since there are less episodes of clozapine therapy, similar olanzapine episodes will be selected for comparison by propensity score matching. For objective 1: average cost for each health care service in dollars per year and number of each episode type with each antipsychotic 2: estimate logistic regression models for dichotomous outcome variables indicating the use of acute hospital, psychiatric hospital, nursing home or a suicide attempt during the first year after current episode of antipsychotic treatment 3: estimate Cox proportional hazard models until use of acute hospital, psychiatric hospital, nursing home or a suicide attempt or until last day patient data is available. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the health care costs for each health care service by the four treatment episode types with clozapine or olanzapine. We will also report estimated impacts of clozapine versus olanzapine on health care use and cost patterns categorized by these episode types.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Donepezil (Aricept <sup>®</sup>) is a selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Because of its selectivity for central cholinesterase, donepezil is associated with a decrease in the incidence of cholinergic side effects and is a preferred agent for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. According to information provided by the manufacturer in the package insert, it is recommended that donepezil be dosed once daily at bedtime; however, vivid dreams resulting in sleep disturbances is more likely to occur with nighttime administration. This study aims to demonstrate the relationship between nighttime administration of donepezil and sleep disturbances. <bold>Objective:</bold> Demonstrate the relationship between nighttime administration of donepezil and the occurrence of sleep disturbances. <bold>Methods:</bold> All study data will be collected from the pharmacy services reports at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital Neuroscience Center (TMH-NSC). Inclusion criteria are: age 55 or older, participation in a pharmacy consult interview at TMH-NSC between January 1st, 2001 and August 1st, 2011, reported nighttime administration of donepezil. Exclusion criteria include: age younger than 55 years, diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome, or coinciding (within 2 weeks) initiation or dose change of any narcotic or psychotropic agent other than donepezil. The following information will be gathered and recorded from the pharmacy consult interview transcripts: Patients’ gender, race, prescribed donepezil dose, dosing schedule, length of therapy, and report of sleep disturbances (vivid dreams, nightmares, insomnia, sleep-walking, sleep-talking, night time psychosis, etc.). The data collected from a minimum of 10% of the sample size will be included in the results and subsequent analysis. The collected data will be used to determine the relationships between dose, time of administration, concurrent medications, and incidence of sleep disturbances. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the number and percentage of donepezil users with nighttime disturbances (i.e. insomnia, nightmares, and vivid dreams). We will also analyze the occurrence of sleep disturbances as a function of dose, time of administration, and concurrent medications.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Following hospitalization, patients may be at risk of experiencing medication noncompliance due to complex medication regimens, complicated patient education, and challenges in continuity of care. These factors can lead to higher readmission rates as well as increased adverse drug events. Therefore, the focus of this prospective, single-center, cohort study will be to target specified areas where there lies a potential for pharmacist intervention to provide improved outcomes to the patients at Central State Hospital. <bold>Primary Objective:</bold> To determine the impact made by pharmacist medication discharge counseling on rates of recidivism in a high risk population at an inpatient psychiatric hospital. <bold>Methods:</bold> All high risk patients discharged from Central State Hospital between September 20, 2011 and April 30, 2012 will be included in this study. The high risk population is defined as those patients who have a history of readmission to Central State Hospital within 30 days of previous discharge date. Upon receipt of discharge orders from the physician, eligible patients will be counseled regarding medications to be continued after discharge and the importance of medication adherence and follow-up visit attendance. Each pharmacist who will be conducting discharge counseling will be given the checklist to minimize differences in styles of counseling as well as in the information provided to the patients. Each counseling session should require approximately 15 minutes, but sessions may exceed this approximation if necessary. Counseling will occur on the unit. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> This study will test the hypothesis that pharmacist medication discharge counseling will reduce the rate of recidivism by educating the patients about their medications, and therefore, increase medication adherence. If the hypothesis is correct, it will provide insight to mental health facilities in regards to the association between patient education and readmission. Improvement in medication adherence that leads to reductions in the frequency of hospitalization will also reduce the overall economic burden.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Poor medication adherence and failure to achieve therapeutic goals have been associated with re-hospitalization of patients with psychiatric illnesses such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Pharmacists providing psychiatric care in an outpatient setting have the potential to improve therapy and outcomes by monitoring patients’ progress by using various rating scales, improving medication adherence, and preventing adverse events and hospitalization. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of pharmacist-managed psychiatric clinic in achieving therapy goals, medication adherence, and satisfaction in patients in an outpatient setting. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Evaluate achievement of therapy goals in patients attending pharmacist-managed psychiatric clinics 2. Evaluate patients' medication adherence and satisfaction with pharmacist services 3. Determine whether patients' achievements of therapy goals correlates with adherence and satisfaction with pharmacist services. <bold>Methods:</bold> For this prospective study, patients visiting an outpatient psychiatric pharmacy clinic at a behavioral healthcare facility in California will be recruited. Subjects with ≥ 2 clinic visits over a 4 month period with pharmacist will be included in the analysis. During clinic visits, pharmacist will administer Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) to patients based on their diagnosis to determine if the patient is at goal with therapy by comparing rating scores from baseline to a later date. Patients' medication adherence will also be measured by Morisky scale while satisfaction will be measured by Patient Satisfaction with Pharmacist Services Questionnaire (PSPSQ). For objectives 1 and 2, number and percent of patients at goal with therapy, their level of adherence and satisfaction will be reported. For objective 3, correlational analysis will be performed to examine any association between achievement of therapy goals with medication adherence and satisfaction. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Changes in rating scores from baseline will suggest patients’ progress and the impact of pharmacist intervention on achieving therapy goals, whereas correlation between adherence, satisfaction and achievement of therapy goals will indicate degree of association. The results will help in advancing pharmacist services to improve medication adherence, health outcomes and quality of care in patients with psychiatric illnesses.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Purpose:</bold> Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is known to cause severe constipation, which can lead to bowel impaction, ischemic bowel, fecal vomitus, and even death. Monitoring suggestions for constipation caused by clozapine are minimal. The intent of this study is to evaluate the possible benefit of implementing a routine monitoring questionnaire to assess for clozapine-induced constipation (CIC). <bold>Methods:</bold> Prior to initiation of the study, Investigational Review Board approval will be obtained. This is a prospective, cross-sectional survey being conducted at Wishard Health Services/ Midtown Community Mental Health Center (CMHC). Patients who are being treated at Midtown CMHC, either on an Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Team or at the Clozapine Clinic, and who are currently being prescribed clozapine will be recruited for the study. Recruitment for ACT patients will be via the ACT Team Clinical Pharmacy Specialist. Recruitment for Clozapine Clinic patients will be via the clinic nurse with prescriber approval. Currently, there are approximately one hundred patients receiving clozapine between the two treatment groups. Data will be collected from the time of IRB approval until March 2012. After consent is obtained from the patient, the daily clozapine dose and current bowel regimen will be collected via Midtown’s electronic medical record system. In order to identify patients with CIC, a slightly modified version of the ROME III Functional Constipation Diagnostic Criteria Questionnaire will be administered. In addition to basic patient demographics, each questionnaire will assess the patient’s 1) current use of laxatives, 2) degree of difficulty of bowel movement, 3) description of feces, and 4) prior knowledge of CIC risk. If clozapine-induced constipation is identified, an appropriate therapeutic treatment option will be recommended to the prescriber. Prescriber acceptance of recommendations will be assessed via communication with the patient’s nurse. All data will then be used to assess the feasibility and possible benefit of implementing a standard clinician administered questionnaire that assesses the risk of clozapine-induced constipation.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Use of a symptom-triggered benzodiazepine administration strategy for treatment of alcohol withdrawal allows for individualization of dosing based on the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The majority of previous studies evaluating symptom-triggered dosing strategies used the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) rating scale as a basis for benzodiazepine dosing. The CIWA-Ar is well validated for use in evaluating alcohol withdrawal symptoms, though many of the items could be considered subjective measurements. The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) uses a locally-developed alcohol withdrawal scale, which incorporates more objective measures such as blood pressure, pulse, and temperature into the total score. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this study is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of a symptom-triggered benzodiazepine dosing protocol that is based on a locally-developed alcohol withdrawal scale in patients admitted to a combined internal medicine-psychiatry service. <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart review was conducted for all patients receiving a fixed-dose benzodiazepine taper for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal on the internal medicine-psychiatry unit from 7/1/2009 to 06/30/2011. The symptom-triggered dosing protocol was implemented on this service in July 2011, and an additional chart review will be conducted of patients who received alcohol withdrawal treatment according to this protocol from 7/1/2011 to 12/31/2011. Key variables used to compare the effectiveness and safety of the two benzodiazepine dosing strategies will include cumulative benzodiazepine dose, total number of benzodiazepine doses administered, duration of benzodiazepine therapy, and occurrence of seizure or development of alcohol withdrawal delirium after initiation of treatment. Independent samples t-tests and Chi-squared analyses will be used to compare variables between symptom-triggered and fixed-schedule dosing groups. If significant differences exist between the groups on baseline variables (age, gender, blood ethanol level at admission, history of alcohol withdrawal seizures, and history of alcohol withdrawal delirium), multiple linear regression and logistic regression equations will be used to control for the influence of these variables in comparisons between treatment groups on outcome variables. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report comparisons of demographic, effectiveness, and safety variables between patients receiving a symptom-triggered benzodiazepine dosing strategy for alcohol withdrawal and those receiving a fixed-dose benzodiazepine taper.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a disabling psychiatric illness and is defined by the occurrence of at least a single major depressive episode. The Sequenced Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial was a multi-center, prospective, randomized control trial with broad inclusion criteria that intended to evaluate the most specific, cost-effective, and practical next step treatment options for treatment-resistant depression. STAR*D provided recommendations on how to start and modify therapy for MDD. <bold>Objectives:</bold> to evaluate the efficacy of the designed treatment algorithm for MDD. The algorithm, based on the most cost-effective path through the STAR*D treatment levels, will be compared to conventional depression treatment not utilizing the treatment interventions developed by the investigators. <bold>Methods:</bold> Eligible participants in our active study arm will be enrolled in treatment level 1 of our study using escitalopram. Escitalopram (maximum dose of 20 mg/day) has been chosen to replace citalopram due to the recent FDA warning concerning the increased risk of QTc prolongation with doses &gt;40 mg/day that is less than the maximum dose of 60 mg/day used in the STAR*D Trials. Participants with an adequate clinical response at 6 weeks will carry out the treatment to 10 weeks. Patients who reach remission at the end of the 10 weeks will enter a 12-month follow-up phase. Participants who do not have a partial clinical response at the end of 6 weeks or remission at 10 weeks will enter treatment level 2, which either switches the patient to sertraline or augments with buspirone. Patient without partial response or reach remission will enter level 3, which either switches the patient to nortriptyline or augments the level 2 medication sertraline with T3 thyroid hormone. All participants who do not experience partial response or reach remission after level 3 treatments will enter level 4 and be switched to mirtazapine plus venlafaxine ER. <bold>Outcome:</bold> Clinical response will be measured using the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16), rating scale. Response and partial response will be defined as an improvement from baseline ≥50% and 25-49%. Remission will be defined as a QIDS-SR16 score of ≤5.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Inpatient behavioral health units serve a unique population of patients that would benefit highly from pharmacy intervention. A large predictor of mental health stabilization and success is compliance with psychiatric medications. An inpatient hospitalization often involves medication trials, dosage adjustments, and psychiatric medication symptom management. Frequently, patients are discharged on many new medications. The University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview (UMMC, Fairview) serves a large population of behavioral health patients, including eleven inpatient units with an average daily census of 160-180 patients. This pilot study will examine the feasibility of having a pharmacist more closely involved in the discharge process and the impact this can make on our patient population. <bold>Objectives:</bold> (1) Measure the feasibility of pharmacist provided discharge medication reconciliation and education. (2) Determine the impact on patient care and safety. <bold>Methods:</bold> Patients will be recruited from two inpatient behavioral health units at UMMC, Fairview. Upon placement of discharge orders by the medical team, a pharmacist will review all medication orders for appropriateness and consistency with the inpatient plan. Prescribing physicians will be contacted with any concerns. A pharmacist will then meet with the patient individually to provide medication teaching and answer any questions that the patient may have. Within ten days of discharge, the patient will be contacted to participate in a satisfaction survey. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> In order to evaluate feasibility of this service, the time needed to evaluate medications, time needed to contact physicians, and time spent counseling the patient will be documented for each encounter. To evaluate impact, data will be collected on the amount and type of discrepancies discovered on discharge orders. The pilot initiation date was January 13th, 2012 and preliminary data has shown a discrepancy rate in the range of 10-50% on discharge orders. The average time spent per patient is 65 minutes. We will continue to enroll patients through April 2012, at which time the data will be evaluated with the hopes of extending the trial and expanding to additional units.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Despite guideline recommendations for alternative agents, benzodiazepines are still widely prescribed for anxiety and related disorders. Patient specific factors including older age, concomitant disease states, and concurrent medications can lead to increased risk for adverse events such as central nervous system depression and subsequent injury including falls. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Determine the proportion of short-term versus long-term treatment episodes to evaluate the incidence of long-term benzodiazepine use in the Department of Veterans Affairs Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS). 2. Compare long-term benzodiazepine use in the TVHS veteran population to a similar population from a data analysis one decade ago (Hermos, et al). 3. Describe characteristics of veterans receiving long-term benzodiazepine prescriptions to determine clinical and pharmacologic predictors which may suggest complex or problematic management. <bold>Significance:</bold> Familiarize healthcare practitioners with current benzodiazepine prescribing practices within TVHS to improve medication use and identify veterans who may be at increased risk for adverse events including dependence, tolerance, abuse, rebound anxiety, and adverse drug reactions. <bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective analysis will be conducted within TVHS, serving veterans living in middle Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and Kentucky. This is an observational, retrospective analysis of veterans that have received commonly prescribed benzodiazepines in the outpatient setting within a 42-month period from January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2011. Patients will be identified through data extraction from the Veteran’s Integrated Service Network (VISN) 9 data warehouse by documentation of a medication order for alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, or lorazepam; a validation step will be performed to ensure accuracy. Analysis will be performed using a 2-sided chi square test. In order to achieve 80% power and identify a 10% (0.1) increase or decrease in the proportion of short-term to long-term episodes, a minimum sample size of 395 patients is needed (alpha = 0.5, beta = 0.2). <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the proportion of short-term to long-term treatment episodes of benzodiazepine therapy within the TVHS veteran population and determine the association between long-term benzodiazepine therapy and patient age, concomitant medications, and underlying disease states.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Studies analyzing influenza immunization rates in the mentally ill population have not been conducted to our knowledge. Moreover it is unclear if patients diagnosed with a mental illness have different perceptions relating to importance, efficacy, or safety. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a difference between the overall rates of flu vaccination in this population when compared to the general population. Additionally, we sought to describe patient’s attitudes and perceptions regarding the flu vaccine and determine what, if any, patient characteristics lead to lower vaccination rates. <bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective, non-interventional, cross-sectional study was used to investigate the vaccination rates and potential barriers to vaccination among patients with mental illness. A voluntary and confidential survey was offered to all adult patients who were at least nineteen years of age, able to read and communicate in English, have a diagnosed mental illness, and seeking care at our outpatient psychiatry clinic. The survey asked about perceived effectiveness and safety of the influenza vaccine and whether the patient was vaccinated in the past 2 years. Demographic data was collected from the patient medical record. <bold>Results:</bold> Data has been collected from surveys administered to 127 patients (300 planned) and an interim analysis was conducted. For the 2010 and 2011 flu season, 26.8% and 24.4% of patients, respectively, received the vaccine. Numbers of patients who received the influenza vaccine did not vary based on age, gender, race, living conditions, education level, primary psychiatric diagnosis, and disability status. Patients who were vaccinated viewed the effectiveness of the vaccine more positively than those who didn’t get vaccinated. About one-third (34.6%) of patients had a recommendation for a flu vaccine from a healthcare provider. This recommendation positively correlated with receiving the vaccine in the past 2 years. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> While data collection is ongoing, the interim analysis showed about one-fourth of mentally ill patients received the flu vaccine in the past 2 years, which is much lower than the rate achieved by the general population in 2010 (40.9%). Strategies should be developed to increase the influenza vaccination rates in this population.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Linezolid is an antibiotic used to treat resistant gram positive infections and linezolid is also a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Several reports submitted to the Adverse Event Reporting System prompted the FDA to post a warning on July 26, 2011 (updated October) about the risk for development of serotonin syndrome when linezolid is prescribed with pro-serotonergic medications<sup>1</sup>, specifically SSRI’s and SNRI’s. The FDA recommends discontinuation of SSRI/SNRI use 2-5 weeks prior to non-emergent use of linezolid. In emergent situations, the choice to continue, discontinue, or reduce SSRI/SNRI dose with linezolid initiation is physician preference. Oral linezolid makes it possible for patients to continue treatment as an outpatient. Thus, the development of symptoms of serotonin syndrome, disposition of SSRI/SNRI use after discontinuation of linezolid, and its effect on mental health symptoms after discharge are all unknown. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess in patients admitted to the hospital with an SSRI/SNRI and discharged on linezolid, (a) mental health symptoms post discharge, (b) return to pre-hospitalized dosing of SSRI/SNRI after linezolid discontinuation, and (c) incidence of symptoms of serotonin syndrome compared to patients not prescribed an SSRI/SNRI. <bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective telephone follow up study of patients initiated on linezolid inpatient and discharged on linezolid will be conducted. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome in patients admitted on an SSRI/SNRI and discharged on linezolid will be compared to patients discharged on linezolid without SSRI/SNRI use. Demographic variables, SSRI/SNRI (drug, dose, frequency, and indication), and disposition of SSRI/SNRI at discharge will be collected. Compliance with linezolid outpatient treatment, continuation/reinitiation of SSRI/SNRI within 2 weeks of linezolid discontinuation, symptoms of serotonin syndrome experienced during linezolid treatment, and worsening of mental health symptoms during and 2 weeks following linezolid use will be assessed in the survey. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Descriptive statistics will be used to assess the incidence of symptoms of serotonin syndrome, the incidence of worsening mental health symptoms, and whether patients reinitiated SSRI/SNRI treatment (if the dose was changed) after linezolid discontinuation.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Long-acting injectable antipsychotics are widely used for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in patients who are noncompliant with oral medication. Antipsychotic non-adherence is a significant issue, with estimates ranging from 40-60% in schizophrenia. Decreasing the medication burden associated with daily oral antipsychotics may delay or prevent relapse, improve quality of life, and reduce overall healthcare costs. However, oral antipsychotics are occasionally inappropriately used as adjunctive therapy with the long acting injectable antipsychotics. To date, there is no available literature describing the outcomes of patients receiving inappropriate concomitant oral and injectable therapy. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1) Compare the prevalence of inappropriate adjunctive oral antipsychotic use between patients exposed to Risperdal Consta<sup>®</sup> and Invega Sustenna<sup>®</sup>, 2) Evaluate the baseline characteristics of patients receiving Risperdal Consta<sup>®</sup> and Invega Sustenna<sup>®</sup> to determine if there is an association between certain characteristics and the appropriateness of prescribing and 3) Determine time to all-cause discontinuation of Risperdal Consta<sup>®</sup> and Invega Sustenna<sup>®</sup>. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study is a cross-sectional database analysis. All patients within the VA San Diego Healthcare System with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder prescribed treatment with Risperdal Consta<sup>®</sup> or Invega Sustenna<sup>®</sup> will be included in the study. Patient demographics, baseline characteristics, medication dispensing records, and healthcare utilization will be collected. For objective 1: prevalence will be analyzed using the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. For objective 2: descriptive statistics will be used to report patient demographics and baseline characteristics. A multivariate regression analysis will be performed to determine if there is a relationship among demographics/baseline characteristics and patients inappropriately prescribed oral adjunctive antipsychotic treatment. For objective 3: A survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier curve and a Cox proportional hazards regression will be used. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the prevalence of inappropriate adjunctive oral antipsychotic use in patients receiving Risperdal Consta<sup>®</sup> and Invega Sustenna<sup>®</sup> and determine if there is an association between certain characteristics and the appropriateness of prescribing as a function of patient demographics, baseline characteristics, and medication dispensing records.

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Chronic pain is estimated to affect more than 80 million Americans and 50% of veterans seen in primary care clinics. Most studies of opiate pain agreements exclude “high risk” individuals (substance abuse histories, mental illness, legal issues, homelessness, or self-pay patients). Veteran patients often fall into the “high risk” categories and may be seeking care through the VA for pain issues accompanied by mental illness, homelessness, substance abuse, or financial issues. <bold>Purpose:</bold> The purpose of the study is to describe the naturalistic outcomes of veteran patients on opiate agreements for chronic pain (those taking opiates for &gt;90 days) within the VA. By conducting this study, we are seeking to identify systemic factors that may influence the delivery of effective pain management to veterans in the primary care setting and improve our ability to prospectively identify veteran patients who would benefit from early referral to a multidisciplinary pain management team since traditional screening criteria used by specialty pain practices may not accurately apply to the VA setting. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study will be a retrospective chart review of veteran patients initiating treatment with opiates beginning on January 1, 2007 and proceeding consecutively until December 31, 2007. Data will be extracted from computerized patient record system using a case report form to develop a database which can then be analyzed. Information collected will include demographic information, pain diagnosis, chronic medical and psychiatric diagnoses, opiate medication(s) used, and other medications on patient profile. The charts will be reviewed for documentation of compliance assessments including urine drug screens, pill counts, appointment no-show rate, and pharmacy refill history. Each chart will be reviewed for outcomes including start/stop of opiate contract and reason for discontinuing if stopped. A minimum of 100 charts (patients initiating opiate therapy) will be reviewed to allow for statistical analysis and comparison. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report factors which may predict non-adherence to the opiate agreement guidelines in a VA population and describe the naturalistic outcomes of non-adherence to the opiate agreement guidelines (i.e., moves care to another provider, facility, utilizes non-opiate treatments, referral to pain clinic).</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are modifiable disease states that increase the risk of cardiovascular death. In 2005 and 2008, black box warnings for increased risk of death were added to both atypical and typical antipsychotics. Despite the warnings associated with antipsychotics and their use in elderly dementia patients, they are still being used to manage agitation and aggression. This study will determine if hypertension and hyperlipidemia (cardiovascular risk factors) are controlled effectively in patients taking an atypical antipsychotic. <bold>Objective:</bold> To further examine the potential cause of cardiovascular death in dementia patients focusing on those treated with an atypical antipsychotic versus those patients who are not. <bold>Methods:</bold> The charts of patients meeting inclusion criteria will be reviewed to assess the primary objective. Data collected will include age, sex, name/strength of cholinesterase inhibitor, atypical antipsychotic, antihyperlipidemic and/or antihypertensive agent, refill history, substance abuse history, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol readings. Patients who are at their blood pressure goal will be defined as less than 140/90 mm Hg (or less than 130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) according to American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. Patients who are low-density lipoprotein (LDL) goal will be defined by the Framingham Risk Assessment Tool. At least 240 patients are required to be able to reject the null hypothesis with probability (power) 0.8 and type I error of 0.05. An uncorrected chi-squared statistic will be used to evaluate the null hypothesis. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Our hypothesis is that hypertension and hyperlipidemia are being neglected because agitation and aggression are visibly treatable symptoms of dementia that take treatment priority. The primary outcome we will report on is the number of patients at their respective goals for blood pressure or cholesterol. These results will be used to compare those patients on an atypical antipsychotic to those who are not and result in acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. None <bold>Background:</bold> Evidence suggests that medication management of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly efficacious. However, both uptake of treatment and long-term adherence have presented a formidable task in clinical practice. Caregivers and practitioners may have different interpretations of the benefits and improvements of ADHD medication. Furthermore, it is likely that caregivers’ views impact adherence to treatment. Therefore, understanding caregivers’ assessments of treatment options and perceptions of improvement have tremendous implications for enhancing the uptake and ongoing use of mental health services. <bold>Objective:</bold> The overarching goal of this research is to explore caregivers’ perspectives of medication for the treatment of their child’s ADHD. The specific objective of the present analysis is to assess caregiver-reported measures of psychopharmacologic medication outcomes. <bold>Methods:</bold> Qualitative semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 48 caregivers of children who were newly diagnosed with ADHD. The interviews were performed at baseline, 6 months and 12 months following initial diagnosis. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using grounded theory methods to identify themes that emerged from the data. <bold>Outcome:</bold> Caregiver-reported outcomes of psychopharmacologic medication for their child relate to their adaptability to treatment and perceptions of improvement. Adaptability describes caregivers’ perceptions of the acceptability of psychopharmacologic medication and other treatments for their child’s ADHD. Perceptions of improvement is defined by the extent to which caregivers believe their child’s symptoms have been resolved and whether they are continuing to seek additional interventions to achieve further gains in their child’s progress. We will discuss how caregivers of children with ADHD adapt to using medication treatment for their child. In addition, we will present a continuum of different degrees of improvement in ADHD as perceived by caregivers. Finally, we will address the clinical implications of these findings and how these results can be used to guide medication therapy management based on caregiver-reported measures of treatment outcomes.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Despite a lack of extensive evidence or clinical guidance from authorities within the psychiatric community, antipsychotic polypharmacy is often utilized as a treatment strategy in schizophrenia. Currently, of the six major clinical guidelines in schizophrenia, five recommend polypharmacy involving clozapine and another antipsychotic, but only as a last line effort after monotherapy has failed multiple times. These polypharmacy recommendations are often weak and leave much to the individual practitioner. Additionally, these standards are not always strictly adhered to, and patients are often introduced to multiple antipsychotic combinations that either have little evidence or have been initiated during an inappropriate early treatment period. Furthermore, rates and descriptions of polypharmacy vary greatly. This lack of continuity describing incidences of multiple antipsychotics, and a lack of evidence concerning common combinations and strategies, leave many practitioners in the dark and creates an atmosphere of inconsistency within the psychiatric community. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Primary objective is to determine the rates of antipsychotic polypharmacy at admission, through hospital stay, and discharge and its rationale at a 100-bed community psychiatric hospital. Secondary objective is to describe the combinations of antipsychotics most often being utilized. <bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective chart review of adult patients admitted to a short-term inpatient psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder will be utilized. No exclusion criteria will be considered. Demographic variables (age, sex, race, concomitant psychiatric diagnoses), medications prior to admission, and reported past medication trials will be collected. The percentages describing polypharmacy at various points before, during, and after admission as well as rates of change in polypharmacy utilization will be reported. Additionally, descriptions and percentages on the most common combinations of medications will be reported. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Incidence of polypharmacy will be evaluated to aid in understanding both the rates and rational of prescribing more than one antipsychotic. Changes to polypharmacy occurrence through the continuum of care will be described to further understand the points in care that polypharmacy occurs.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Studies have shown that substance abusers can be more impulsive and may have more personality disorder traits than the general population. Additionally, patients treated for opiate dependence often relapse. Models of buprenorphine treatment for opiate dependence include maintaining patients on buprenorphine therapy long term, or having buprenorphine tapered off over time until the patient is no longer opiate-dependent and may be discharged from the Buprenorphine Clinic. Some patients may be tapered off of buprenorphine relatively quickly while others may be more difficult to taper off buprenorphine requiring a longer tapering period. Having the ability to predict which patients may benefit from a slower taper will allow clinicians to individualize a buprenorphine treatment plan to improve likelihood of treatment success and reduce relapse rates. <bold>Objective:</bold> This is a prospective pilot study to determine whether impulsivity and certain personality traits can predict how quickly buprenorphine dosage can be reduced, and in patients who withdraw from therapy, time to relapse. <bold>Methods:</bold> Male or female Veterans newly enrolled in the Buffalo VA Buprenorphine Clinic, aged 18-65 years old, and excluding those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or Bipolar disorder, are eligible for enrollment. Patients who consent to participate in the study are asked to complete two questionnaires: one to evaluate impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 - BIS 11) and one to evaluate personality traits (Temperament and Character Inventory - TCI-140). Patients are then followed through the VA electronic chart system to monitor their rate of dose reduction and time to relapse. <bold>Data Analysis:</bold> Two dependent variables will be evaluated: the rate of reduction in buprenorphine dosage and the time to relapse. Weekly rate of buprenorphine dosage reduction will be calculated as: (initial daily dosage – final daily dosage)/number of weeks of treatment. A student T-test will be used to evaluate the dependent variable, buprenorphine dosage reduction, and the two independent variables, BIS-11 scores and TCI scores. Cox regression analysis will be used to evaluate the potential relationship between BIS-11 scores, TCI scores and time to relapse. Statistical significance will be accepted at p &lt; 0.05.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Antipsychotics have become the mainstay of treatment for psychiatric and non-psychiatric conditions in children. A national survey from 2002 showed that there was a 6-fold increase, between 1993 and 2002, in the number of office visits among children and adolescents which resulted in a prescription for an antipsychotic medication. The survey showed that 92% of the total antipsychotic prescriptions were written for atypical antipsychotics. Concerns regarding the use of atypical antipsychotics in children are increasing because of the high rates of metabolic adverse effects associated with atypical antipsychotics in adults. Atypical antipsychotics have the propensity to cause rapid weight gain and to increase body mass index (BMI) (&gt;95th percentile) leading to medical complications (i.e., obesity, glucose abnormalities, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome). Increased weight gain during childhood is a known determinant of cardiovascular risk and a higher BMI during childhood is associated with an increased risk for developing fatal heart diseases as an adult. This study will examine the association between individual atypical antipsychotics and antidiabetic and antilipidemic agents in a pediatric population. <bold>Objectives:</bold> I) To determine and compare the prevalence of use of anti-diabetic and antilipidemic medications in children and adolescents treated with atypical antipsychotics to those not treated with atypical antipsychotics. II) To examine the relationship between the use of specific atypical antipsychotic agents and use of anti-diabetic and antilipidemic medications. <bold>Methods:</bold> Data from Virginia Medicaid will be used to compare the prevalence of use of anti-diabetic and antilipidemic medications in children and adolescents (between 2 and 17 years of age) receiving atypical antipsychotics (i.e., aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone) and those who do not. Anti-diabetic and antilipidemic medications will be identified using pharmacy claims data. Pharmacy claims for individual atypical antipsychotics received between August 2010 and August 2011 with concomitant claims for anti-diabetic and antilipidemic medications will be identified to evaluate the second objective. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Descriptive statistics will be reported. Logistic regression analyses, controlling for age, gender, dose, and duration of antipsychotic use, will be used to assess which antipsychotic agents are most associated with the use of anti-diabetic and antilipidemic agents.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Procarbazine (Matulane) is an anticancer agent used in the treatment of Hodgkin’s disease. Procarbazine also inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of various catecholamines, including serotonin. While this feature of procarbazine is unrelated to its anticancer activity, it may place patients at greater risk for serotonin syndrome when combined with an antidepressant. Clinical features of serotonin syndrome may include spontaneous clonus, tremor, hyperreflexia, agitation, diaphoresis and hyperthermia and can range in severity from mild to severe or fatal. The actual risk of developing serotonin syndrome due to the combination of procarbazine and an antidepressant is unclear and documentation of this interaction is not well supported. Drug interaction databases offer conflicting information and a literature review reveals no case reports signaling the development of serotonin syndrome from the combination of procarbazine and an antidepressant. Currently there is no guidance on antidepressant selection or the management of depression in patients who are treated with procarbazine. Because the incidence of depression in cancer patients may be more than four times greater than that of the general population, the interaction between procarbazine and antidepressants warrants further investigation. <bold>Objective:</bold> To determine the incidence of serotonin syndrome resulting from the combination of procarbazine and antidepressants and to provide evidence-based recommendations regarding the safe utilization of antidepressants in patients treated with procarbazine. <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart review of lymphoma patients was conducted at the University of Michigan Health System. Charts of patients who were treated with both procarbazine and an antidepressant, as well as procarbazine alone, were examined to determine if signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome existed based on Hunter’s Serotonin Toxicity Criteria and Sternbach’s Diagnostic Criteria. Information regarding patient demographics, relevant medical history, medication regimen, and specific symptoms related to serotonin syndrome diagnostic criteria was obtained. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Data collection is complete and data analysis is currently underway.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Objective:</bold> The aim of this study is to compare the outcome of depression management in patients with diabetes referred to the psychiatric pharmacist compared to patients whose depression was managed by their primary care clinician. <bold>Background:</bold> Depression and diabetes are both highly prevalent disorders, each with their own respective negative consequences when left untreated. The presence of untreated depression in patients with diabetes has been associated with a multitude of negative consequences, including poor self-care and treatment adherence, worsening glycemic control, increase in severity or number of diabetic complications, increased likelihood of cardiovascular risk factors, higher rates of functional disability, increase in health care use and expenditures and higher all cause mortality. A growing body of evidence suggests that collaborative care between primary care physicians and other healthcare providers may be an effective intervention to improve quality of care and outcomes in patients with depression and diabetes. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study is a retrospective chart review of individuals receiving care for a diagnosis of diabetes and also receiving treatment for depression from the psychiatric pharmacist or their primary care physician. Inclusion criteria for analysis is a diagnosis of diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) by a physician, a PHQ-9 score ≥ 10, greater than 17 years of age and being treated for depression by the psychiatric pharmacist or primary care provider. Patients will be excluded if they had a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder or Schizophrenia, have co-morbid substance abuse not currently in remission or were lost to follow-up. Patients currently receiving an anti-depressant will not be excluded, providing they met the inclusion criteria. Data will be abstracted from the medical chart for each group. Baseline characteristics to be collected include age, gender, weight, BMI, PHQ-9, ethnicity, Axis I diagnosis, co-morbid diagnosis, Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), anti-depressant therapy (if applicable) and type of diabetes. The primary outcome of this study is the change in PHQ-9 score from baseline after four months in patients receiving care from the psychiatric pharmacist compared to those receiving care from their primary care provider. <bold>Results:</bold> In progress. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> In progress.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Antipsychotic drugs are among the most widely prescribed psychotropic medications for elderly people<sup>1</sup>. When using antipsychotic medications, there is a common concern of QT interval prolongation, which may predispose patients to cardiac arrhythmia, Torsade de Pointes and even sudden death. The degree of risk for each patient varies depending on their risk factors, such as underlying pathologies, the antipsychotic medication and dosage used, and concurrent use of other medications. The study will help identify the risk of QTc prolongation in the very old population (&gt;70 years old), who are initiated on antipsychotic therapy. <bold>Objectives:</bold> A retrospective chart review to examine the link between the use of atypical antipsychotics with QTc prolongation in patients &gt;70 years old. Additionally, we will examine whether the concomitant use of other medications increase the risk of QT prolongation. <bold>Methods:</bold> Subjects will be current or past patients &gt;70 years old admitted to the acute geropsychiatric unit. Individuals not initiated on antipsychotic medication and those who choose not to participate will be excluded from the study. Selection will be based on availability of charts for review. All subjects will receive a number to conceal identity. Approximately 30-60 medical charts will be reviewed, looking for trends of QTc interval prolongation in subjects that are started on antipsychotic medication, including the concurrent use of medications that may increase QTc prolongation risk. A data collection form, which we designed, will be used to obtain data, including current medications and ECG readings of QT/QTc at baseline and after 1 week of initiating antipsychotic therapy. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report of any significant trends of QTc prolongation risk in the very old population, in regards to the antipsychotic and dosage used and concomitant use of other medications. We will also consider underlying preexisting heart conditions and see if this contributes to confounding the results above.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Alcohol is the most frequently abused substance after nicotine and caffeine. One in four patients admitted to general hospital meet the criteria for alcohol dependence. When these patients stop drinking, they are at risk for alcohol withdrawal. The severity of alcohol withdrawal can range from mild and asymptomatic to severe episodes causing nausea, vomiting, tremors, and disorientation. Patients with a recurrent history of alcohol dependence and withdrawal may be at risk for delirium tremens, seizures, coma, and even death during alcohol withdrawal. The severity of alcohol withdrawal a patient will experience is difficult to predict making proper management of alcohol withdrawal also difficult. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The Chillicothe Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) is in the process of implementing the Chillicothe VAMC Alcohol Withdrawal Protocol. The purpose of this study is to perform a quality analysis to see if there has been a positive or negative effect on patient outcomes as a result of this new protocol. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study will be completed as a retrospective cohort analysis. Group 1 will be patients admitted to the SCU for alcohol withdrawal prior to the staff using the Chillicothe VAMC alcohol withdrawal protocol. Group 2 will be patients admitted to the specialty care unit (SCU) for alcohol withdrawal after the protocol has been initiated. All patient's charts are solely from the Chillicothe VAMC, with a goal of obtaining n = 100 eligible for inclusion into the study. Inclusion criteria: any patient at least age 18 who was treated between the dates of June 1, 1998 and June 30, 2012 for alcohol withdrawal. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> To compare the following criteria before and after initiation of the protocol: 1. Length of stay on medical floors, 2. Total amounts of benzodiazepines used during alcohol withdrawal, 3. Time from administration of first benzodiazepine to last and 4. Reports of adverse events related to alcohol withdrawal.</p>

A retrospective, case-control review will be conducted between January 1, 1998 – December 31, 2008 using the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) throughout the Veterans Integrated Service Network section 9 (VISN-9). Cases will be patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age and who were dispensed typical or atypical antipsychotics. Controls will consist of patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age who were not taking antipsychotics. Patients using more than one antipsychotic at a time and/or those with less than a one-year washout period between using different antipsychotics will be excluded. The following data will be collected: patient demographics, name of antipsychotic, dose, duration, directions, and fill history; related co-morbidities and medications that may influence the incidence of CVE (e.g., heart failure, atrial fibrillation, clopidogrel, antihypertensives), and CVE type. Statistical analysis will utilize the propensity score to estimate the probability of receiving an atypical antipsychotic, given the observed covariates. The propensity scores will be used to match treated subjects to control subjects. Logistic regression will be used to determine the odds ratio associated with incidence of CVE between the two populations.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are FDA-approved, first-line treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, many PTSD patients fail to respond fully to SSRI treatment. Increasingly, second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are being used adjunctively. This study examined the pattern of use of SGAs in veterans with PTSD over a 10-year period. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Determine the percentage of PTSD patients who were prescribed SGAs each year during the study period. 2. Determine prescribing patterns for individual SGAs. 3. Evaluate the effect of various patient characteristics in regards to predicting use of SGAs. <bold>Methods:</bold> De-identified clinical data were retrieved from the VISN-7 Data Warehouse (includes 8 VA Medical Centers [VAMCs] in AL, GA, and SC). Patients with an ICD-9 code for PTSD (excluding bipolar, psychotic, and dementia diagnoses) in fiscal years 1999-2008 were selected for inclusion, and the electronic pharmacy database was examined for prescriptions for SGAs. Descriptive statistics were used to report data concerning prescribing patterns. Multivariable regression models were used to examine patient characteristics vs. prescribing of SGAs. <bold>Preliminary Results:</bold> Data analysis is ongoing. The number of unique PTSD patients increased steadily from 8,247 in 1999 to 28,309 in 2008. The percentage of PTSD patients prescribed an SGA was 11.7% in 1999, increased each year until reaching a peak of 31.9% in 2004, and then decreased each year to 18.5% in 2008. Approximately 50% of PTSD patients who received SGA therapy in 1999 were prescribed risperidone, but that percentage declined steadily to approximately 20% in 2008. A similar pattern was found for olanzapine, except that the rate of decline was more rapid, resulting in only 4.1% of PTSD patients receiving the agent in 2008. Quetiapine use increased dramatically over the years, as approximately 66-76% of PTSD patients who received SGA therapy were prescribed this agent each year during the time frame of 2003-2008. Approximately 1-5% of PTSD patients who received SGA therapy were prescribed ziprasidone each year during the time frame of 2001-2008, and approximately 1-15% of PTSD patients who received SGA therapy were prescribed aripiprazole each year during the time frame of 2004-2008.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Less than one-third of adults with a mental illness obtain mental health treatment in a given year. Unfortunately, when patients do seek treatment, there are many barriers that may prevent them from achieving the desired outcomes. Overall, psychiatric patients have a medication adherence rate of roughly 50%. In order to combat the problem of non-adherence in psychiatric patients, it is necessary to increase patient knowledge about medications, change patient attitudes regarding medication, and assist patients in developing skills to take medications as prescribed. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a pharmacist-led education group on psychiatric patient self-reported attitudes and knowledge about medication management as well as confidence in their ability to self-manage medications. <bold>Methods:</bold> Recruited patients must be admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit at a local disproportionate share hospital for an acute psychiatric complaint and between the ages of 18 and 55. Patients will be selected based on participation in a pharmacist-led medication education group. Target enrollment will be 100 patients. Demographic variables to be collected include age, gender, race or ethnicity, education level, whether this is the patient’s first psychiatric hospitalization, and the presence of a patient-pharmacist relationship when an outpatient. Also, information on the number and duration of education groups attended will be collected. A retrospective pre-post survey will be used to assess the patient perceived changes in perspectives after attending the medication group. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> The primary dependent variables include patient self-reported knowledge about medication management, attitudes towards medications, and confidence in adherence post-discharge.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been used to optimize medication therapy with antidepressants, mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. TDM is a complex process involving six essential steps: 1) Identifying a specific indication for TDM, 2) Collecting the blood sample, 3) Processing the sample in the laboratory, 4) Reporting the results, 5) Evaluating the results and 6) Optimizing therapy. Given the complexity of the process, there are many points for errors to occur. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Assess the utilization of antipsychotic TDM at an adult inpatient state psychiatric facility; 2. Identify and describe steps in the TDM process where TDM was inappropriately utilized; 3. Examine the pharmacoeconomic implications of “appropriate” and “inappropriate” antipsychotic TDM. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study is a retrospective descriptive review of antipsychotic TDM completed at an adult inpatient state psychiatric facility between December 1, 2009 and June 30, 2011. To evaluate if TDM was appropriately utilized, specific data will be collected from each step of the TDM process for each antipsychotic serum level drawn. Data will be extracted from eLabCorp<sup>®</sup> (a secure web-based laboratory result retrieval system), the patient’s medical record, Morris &amp; Dickson Co. LLC (pharmaceutical wholesaler) pharmaceutical pricing catalog and Quadramed<sup>®</sup> (pharmacy computer software). Chi-squared test and analysis of variance will be used to evaluate any differences in the indication for TDM, the steps in which inappropriate utilization of TDM occurred and the action or intervention performed following notification of the antipsychotic serum concentration. Student’s t-test will be used to evaluate differences in mean daily medication cost, mean total number of scheduled medications per patient and presence of antipsychotic polypharmacy between patients with “appropriate” antipsychotic TDM compared to “inappropriate” antipsychotic TDM. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> The following will be reported: percent of “appropriate” antipsychotic TDM levels; percent of inappropriately utilized antipsychotic TDM at each step in the TDM process; potential cost-savings if “inappropriate” TDM had been avoided; daily medication cost, total number of medications per patient, and presence of antipsychotic polypharmacy in patients with “appropriate” antipsychotic TDM compared to “inappropriate” antipsychotic TDM. Upon completion of this study, opportunities for educational interventions and pharmacist driven TDM will be evaluated.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Complications experienced by hospitalized patients as a result of falls can contribute to extended hospitalization, longer recuperation time, additional co-morbidities, and even death. Decreasing falls during hospitalization is an important goal for all healthcare facilities. With 754 licensed beds, CoxHealth System has a Falls Committee comprised of nurses, occupational and physical therapists, pharmacists, and hospital administrators. The committee evaluates falls that occur within the facility to discover trends, examine areas of concern, and develop fall-prevention programs. Pharmacists on the committee evaluate medication profiles of patients involved in fall incidents for medications that may have contributed to the fall. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Create a relational database to correlate fall incidents with medications the patient was receiving near the time of the fall. 2. Compile and evaluate data to determine high risk medications. 3. Prevent falls by presenting definitive data trends in an easy to interpret format grouped by medication class, age range, and nursing station location. <bold>Methods:</bold> Using Microsoft Access(R), a relational database was built to associate fall incidents with medication profiles. The data points tracked are: incident ID, nursing station, age of patient, medication, dose and frequency, PRN or scheduled, and whether or not a medication could have been related to the fall. The Coxhealth formulary was imported into the database, and drug class information assigned. The medication profile of every patient with a reported fall incident is evaluated and recorded into the database. Reports grouping the data by nursing unit, medication class, and age range are reported to the Falls committee quarterly. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We are able to demonstrate a correlation between medication classes and patients involved in falls. Using the collected data, we can determine where we should focus our fall-prevention efforts. Preliminary findings have been utilized to identify those medication classes most likely to contribute to falls on each nursing station, identify those stations with the greatest number of falls, and determine average time of PRN medication to time of fall. We have provided education by sharing our findings through our facility’s Falls Tip of the Month Newsletter.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> In recent years proper disposal of medications has become an area of great concern. Disposal of medications in the trash is not considered appropriate as it leaves room for theft and drug abuse. Traces of medications found in streams, lakes and even drinking water have resulted in rules against flushing medications. A medication should not be given to someone other than for whom it was prescribed, as it poses danger to that person. Storing medications after they have been discontinued increases the risk of consuming the wrong medications. The presence of large amounts of unused medication is a risk factor for successful completion of suicide by over dosage. It is well known that veterans attempt and are successful at suicide much more frequently than non-veterans. If veterans are not routinely practicing appropriate methods of disposal, medications may accumulate in the household and present a risk for over dosage in patients who are or may become suicidal. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Conduct a survey of veterans to identify their practices and beliefs concerning the disposal of unused medications in order to: 1. Better understand veterans' educational needs with the goal of promoting recommended methods of disposal. 2. Facilitate development of an effective educational program intended to improve veterans’ knowledge of proper disposal and the frequency of use of proper procedures for medication disposal. <bold>Methods:</bold> A short questionnaire has been designed by investigators to elicit information pertinent to achieving the study objectives. Over a three-month period, veterans at the Charles George VA Medical Center in Asheveille, NC, who are receiving prescriptions at the outpatient pharmacy will be asked to complete the questionnaire by a pharmacist. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Results are pending. We will report demographic information and aggregate data reflecting veterans’ practices and beliefs regarding medication disposal. Data will be analyzed to determine if there are differences in practices and beliefs based upon demographics, previous education about medication disposal, or medication burden. The results will be used to facilitate development of an educational program to improve the frequency of use of proper medication disposal.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Many antipsychotic medications do not have FDA approval for use in children. This population appears to be at similar or greater risk than adults for a variety of adverse effects related to the use of antipsychotic medications. Concerns that antipsychotic agents may be overutilized/undermonitored in this population, along with limited efficacy data in children, led the North Carolina Division of Medical Assistance (NCDMA) to develop a web-based registry to encourage use of evidence based safety and outcomes monitoring practices. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Objectives include improving the use of evidence based safety monitoring for child/adolescent patients when antipsychotics are prescribed. Data obtained from the registry will be used to educate/shape practice improvement initiatives for providers treating this population. <bold>Methods:</bold> Provider training/educational efforts regarding the registry use/objectives began March 2011. Implementation of the registry was conducted in phases by recipient age with phase one launched April, 2011 for Medicaid eligibles 12 years and younger, with the 13-17 cohort implemented four months later. Data elements collected are intended to reinforce evidence based outcomes/safety monitoring practices for the prescribed antipsychotic. Providers are requested at baseline to answer clinical questions including the medication, diagnosis, target symptoms, and consent. More detailed metabolic, side effect, and outcomes assessment questions are requested at the 6 month and subsequent decision points. <bold>Results:</bold> Baseline data for the initial 0-12 year cohort: 960 providers registered 5531 unique cases (mean age 8.75 years, 72% male); risperidone (51.5%), aripiprazole (28.4%), quetiapine (13.8%) were most commonly prescribed; diagnoses ranged from unspecified mood disorder (22.5%), autism spectrum disorder (15.0%), ADHD (13.7%), bipolar disorder (12.5%), oppositional defiant disorder (9.5%). Target symptoms identified were aggression (48.4%), irritability (18.9%), impulsive/agitation (11.2%), and mood lability (5.9%). Data analysis is ongoing for provider type, specialty, the 13-17 cohort, and initial metabolic and side effects/outcome questions from the first 6 month decision point. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first web-based registry for antipsychotic safety monitoring in this at risk population, with the goal of maintaining open access to medications while improving appropriate safety and outcome monitoring.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> In 2008, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) chartered the VHA Academic Detailing Service through the Office of Mental Health and Pharmacy Benefits Management Services. A team of clinical pharmacists trained as academic detailers deliver targeted information through the use of key messages to providers during individual or group educational outreach visits. The objective of academic detailing is to influence prescribing behaviors to provide safe and cost-effective treatment modalities. Messages over the last year have focused on the appropriate use of antipsychotic medications and medication safety. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> Various modalities of the educational programming were implemented to engage members of the healthcare team. Information was delivered directly to clinicians and patients via mailing letters, prescribing reports, brochures, and technical tools to convey key messages. In the Pacific Islands, a clinical pharmacist with supportive personnel improved lipid monitoring parameters with laboratory reminder phone calls to patients. A clinical pharmacist performed monthly patient medication classes for a mental health recovery group. Height, weight, and blood pressure were measured at each encounter. In Southern California, Academic Detailers aimed to impact metabolic monitoring parameters by mailing laboratory reminder letters to patients taking atypical antipsychotics in the VA San Diego Healthcare System. Posters and electronic notices were implemented to increase patient compliance in laboratory monitoring and weight measurement. Throughout VISN 21 and 22, patient letters addressing recent FDA citalopram safety changes were mailed directly to patients, requesting they receive further evaluation from their provider while on the medication. A counter-advertisement designed for insomnia reinforced the appropriate treatments and highlighted adverse effects of low-dose quetiapine when taken for the wrong indication. Technical tools such as the Mental Health Dashboard, titration order sets, and a clozapine inter-facility consult were created to facilitate management of patient panels in an easily retrievable and organized mode. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> Through Academic Detailing, members of the healthcare team and the veterans themselves are more aware of the role they play in patient centered care. Improving care for mental health conditions is promising given an increased awareness of metabolic monitoring, inappropriate use of antipsychotics, and medication safety.</p>

With help from CPNP National, the student chapter was recognized as a student organization. The collegiate constitution and bylaws were approved by both CPNP National and Purdue University. Over the past two years of the chapter's existence, CPNP Purdue’s members have made an impact in the mental health community in the Lafayette area. <bold>Description:</bold> CPNP Purdue has been reaching out to provide community service to the local Mental Health America organization, by preparing on average two meals a month for the homeless in Lafayette, IN. Members organized and participated in several fundraisers to pay for bus transportation for MHA clients to the Tippecanoe County Fair in 2011. Several members participated in a suicide training seminar, as well as, other activities including continual support of the Jay Cooperider Memorial (JCM) 5 k runs, the Homeward Bound Walk for Tippecanoe County, visiting with MHA clients, and drafting patient medication guides for the MHA Tippecanoe website. <bold>Impact on Psychiatric Pharmacy:</bold> As members of Purdue’s CPNP chapter, we have had the opportunity to show the community and our patients the instrumental role a psychiatric pharmacist can play in their health and wellbeing. By forming a strong partnership with Mental Health America of Tippecanoe County, we, as student pharmacists, have come to be active volunteers, friendly faces, trusted healthcare professionals, and a staple of medical help and information for mental health patients. Our services and outreach continue to grow, with our current focus aimed at writing and distributing medication guides for patients. We hope our dedication and involvement in CPNP will allow us to continue to make strides in the role of the pharmacist in psychiatric medicine. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The Purdue collegiate chapter is proud to make an impact on mental health in Tippecanoe County through community service. Purdue’s CPNP chapter demonstrates a strong passion for pharmaceutical care in psychiatric medicine. We are motivated to raise awareness and promote the role of a pharmacist in psychiatry.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>1.Background/Rationale:</bold> The updated opioid detoxification protocol and alcohol detoxification protocol excluded phenobarbital and clonidine, respectively, from their original protocols. The purpose for the updates was to help better control the withdrawal symptoms from opioids/alcohol detoxification to improve patient care. Our study was designed to compare the efficacy of the opioid detoxification protocols with and without phenobarbital in controlling systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). In addition, we compared the efficacy of the alcohol detoxification protocols with and without clonidine in controlling SBP, DBP and HR. <bold>2.Description of the Innovative Service:</bold> We conducted a retrospective study of the subjects who received the opioid or alcohol detoxification from January 2010 to January 2011. For the opioid detoxification, we measured the number of subjects whose average SBP, DBP and HR on day 4 reached their targets in the phenobarbital group vs. no-phenobarbital group. Mean ± SD values were calculated for the reduction from baseline to the 4th-day average. For the alcohol detoxification, we measured the number of subjects whose average SBP, DBP and HR on day 3 reached their targets in the clonidine group vs. no-clonidine group. Mean ± SD values were calculated for the reduction from baseline to the 3rd-day average. <bold>3. Impact on Patient Care/Institution:</bold> In the opioid detoxification, all subjects in both groups met the targets for their 4th-day average SBP, DBP and HR. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean 4th-day average DBP between phenobarbital group and no-phenobarbital group (79 ± 4 mmHg and 74 ± 8 mmHg, respectively; p = 0.008). In the alcohol detoxification, all subjects in both groups met the targets for their 3rd-day average SBP, DBP and HR, except one subject in the no-clonidine group with the 3rd-day average DBP &gt; 100 mmHg. However, this was not statistically significant. <bold>4. Conclusion:</bold> The opioid detoxification protocol without phenobarbital and the alcohol detoxification protocol without clonidine may be effectively implemented to patients, because phenobarbital and clonidine do not seem to provide additional benefit in controlling SBP, DBP or HR. However, further studies with a bigger sample size comparing other aspects of withdrawal symptoms are needed for better evaluation of the protocols.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> The Behavioral Medicine Clinic (BMC) is a multidisciplinary clinic at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Patients with psychiatric comorbidities referred from MUSC specialty clinics (e.g. neurology, transplant) are managed by a multidisciplinary team including physicians and psychologists. This model allows for intensive individual and group therapy as well as psychiatric medical management. We sought to incorporate a psychiatric pharmacist into the clinic model. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> In an effort to optimize medication related patient outcomes, a psychiatric pharmacist was incorporated into the clinic model to collaborate with psychiatrists and psychologists. Following a needs analysis, an afternoon clinic time was arranged for a pharmacy resident to see patients. An electronic note template was designed and agreed upon by the interdisciplinary team. The updated model consists of patients seeing the psychiatric pharmacist immediately prior to their appointment with the physician. Pharmacy appointments are fifteen minutes long and consist of comprehensive medication reconciliation followed by assessment of medication safety, medication compliance, and medication efficacy. Pharmacy assessment and recommendations are documented in the electronic medical record in real time so they can be accessed during the subsequent appointment with the psychiatrist or psychologist. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> In this pilot study, patients seen in BMC (n = 20), on average, had 3 Axis I diagnoses (range = 2-6), 5 Axis III diagnoses (range = 0-14), were on 3 psychiatric medications (range = 1-8) and 8 non-psychiatric medications (range = 0-18). On average, patients were 47 years old (range 26-69) and female (74%). Treatment interventions were recommended in 79% of patients. Interventions ranged from dosing adjustments to drug interaction and side effect management. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Permanent integration of a psychiatric pharmacist into the BMC is logistically feasible and has potential to improve multiple patient care outcomes. Future research should be directed toward financial viability and stability and long-term patient outcomes.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background/Rationale:</bold> CommUnity Care Clinics of Austin/Travis County offer non-profit health services to medically underserved patients. CommUnity Care health services include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, women’s health, behavioral health, and dental services. The CommUnity Care Clinics utilize clinical pharmacists in diabetes and anticoagulation management services. The behavioral health service component of the clinic included social workers and psychiatrists. A clinical pharmacist trained in psychopharmacology was introduced to help meet the increase demand of psychiatric consult visits. The role of the pharmacist in the psychopharmacology clinic was designed similarly to the diabetes and anticoagulation services. <bold>Description of Service:</bold> A half-day clinic was started in February 2009. A protocol was developed and then modified according to the new 2009 Texas State Law. At the time of protocol submission to the State of Texas, the psychopharmacology clinic was the first pharmacy protocol with a psychiatric focus. In October 2010, the PGY-2 Psychiatric Pharmacy resident started in the clinic. The resident was observed by the preceptor in the clinic starting with orientation and progressing to independent patient visits. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> In the last two years, the psychopharmacology clinic has grown. This pilot program has expanded to include psychopharmacology clinic services at another location within CommUnity Care. Current, endeavors include options for reimbursement. Specific data regarding impact on primary care and psychiatrist visits will be presented. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The creation of the psychopharmacology clinic helped in meeting clinic and patient needs along with meeting the needs of the PGY-2 Psychiatric Residency Program.</p>

Failure to fill prescriptions, reluctance to maintain adherence to medications, lack of insight into mental illness, and the disbelieve of medication effectiveness negatively impact patient care. These can lead to frequent readmission to the hospital. While mental illnesses are chronic, relapsing disorders, lengthening the time between acute hospital readmissions can increase availability of acute care beds for seriously ill patients. Decreasing unnecessary readmission to the acute care setting also allows patients to be treated in a less costly outpatient setting and subsequently improves patient quality of life. Pharmacists can influence rapid rehospitalization due to non-adherence by providing filled prescriptions and counseling patients just prior to discharge. <bold>Description of the Innovative Service:</bold> From October 2010 to October 2011, home-bound patients being discharged from the hospital’s behavioral health unit during weekday clinical pharmacy hours were provided with filled psychiatric prescriptions for self-administration at the time of discharge. Attending psychiatrists gave discharge prescriptions to the pharmacist during the discharge process. In conjunction with the utilization nurse, the pharmacist verified coverage and sought insurance prior authorizations as necessary. The prescriptions were then faxed to the outpatient pharmacy for filling. Filled prescriptions were subsequently delivered to the hospital pharmacy for storage. Prior to discharge, the pharmacist counseled the patient on their medications, side effect management, importance of adherence and follow-up, and assessed patient comprehension. Filled prescriptions were then stored with patient belongings and given to the patient at the time of discharge. Thirty day readmission data was compared to data collected during the year prior to program initiation. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> Five hundred and two patients received discharge counseling and prescriptions during the first year of the program, with mean number of prescriptions of 2.57 per patient. Thirty day hospital readmissions rates amongst home-bound patients given medications were decreased by 15.5% compared to the previous year (12/502 versus 17/601; p = 0.004). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Providing medications and counseling to home-bound acute psychiatric patients at discharge yields positive outcomes regarding the avoidance of frequent hospitalizations to the acute care hospital.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare NeuroScience Center is a multidisciplinary clinical initiative that provides services to patients with neurological disorders. The NeuroScience Center houses a Memory Disorder Clinic, Parkinson's Center, and Multiple Sclerosis Clinic. It also provides supportive services for patients with seizures, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological disorders. Pharmacists work with neurologists, social workers, neuropsychologists, speech therapists, and nurses to individually and collectively assess patients with these disorders. Practice faculty from Florida A&amp;M University College of Pharmacy provide comprehensive medication reviews and other services such as patient and caregiver education. <bold>Description of Services:</bold> Through a collaborative drug therapy management protocol, the faculty provide clinical services two half days per week, with patient visits scheduled for 45 to 60 minutes. Prior to clinic visits, the pharmacists assists with medication reconciliation, and patients are reminded to bring their medications to the visits. The pharmacists evaluate appropriateness of medications, adherence, mood, sleep, cognitive status, motor function, neurological disease symptoms, propensity for falls, presence of pain, and other medication related problems. A written consult is disseminated to the patient and their family, and all of the clinicians involved the care of the patient. The consults provide information regarding medication administration, use of nonprescription, herbal, and vitamin products, dosing, alternate treatment options, strategies to minimize drug interactions, side effects, and other counseling tips for existing and newly prescribed medications. Patients and caregivers are contacted within a month after the clinic visit to assess the outcome of the recommendations. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> Polypharmacy coupled with a high utilization of vitamins and herbals is commonplace in patients with neurological disorders. Providing information about appropriate timing of medication administration, and use of nonprescription and prescription medications appears to decrease polypharmacy, lighten the burden on the caregiver and improve clinical outcomes for patients. Since 1998, over 1000 patients have been evaluated. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Including pharmacists in the assessment and monitoring of medication use in patients with neurological disorders can minimize complications from the neurological disorders, improve adherence, and broaden the awareness of patients and other healthcare disciplines about the value of using pharmacists as service providers.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Objective:</bold> To develop recommendations for healthcare worker protection if occupationally exposed to toxic substances used in illicit methamphetamine (METH) manufacturing. <bold>Background:</bold> Illicit METH production results in the release of a number of harmful, and potentially deadly, chemicals and gases. Improper production techniques may result in fires, explosions, and chemical burns. For healthcare workers, risk factors included direct contact (skin, fabric) and inhalation. The risks posed by such substances are not confined to the immediate area of release and may pose long-term exposure risks. Hazardous wastes and definitions have been published. First responders and emergency personnel are most at-risk and may enter the environment without protective equipment. The nature of the environment may not be reported to healthcare workers. No guidelines were found regarding healthcare worker protection if exposed to METH-related by-products. Based on these findings, recommended precautions were proposed. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> The multidisciplinary integrated program of assertive community treatment team provides services to the severely mentally ill. The healthcare workers may be inadvertently exposed to areas where METH production occurred. Literature was accessed and reviewed. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> The types or injuries and symptoms sustained by healthcare workers secondary to METH-related exposures were identified. These included respiratory, central nervous system, gastrointestinal and eye/skin. Contaminants, their form, and protection recommendations were developed. These included (1) use of mask; move to open air; evaluate for asthma or other respiratory irritation for gases, (2) use of latex gloves and other protective wear, prompt hand washing, eye irrigation, presentation to emergency department as indicated for liquids, and (3) use of latex gloves and other protective wear, prompt hand washing/eye irrigation, presentation to emergency department as indicated for solids. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Based on the literature findings, healthcare workers experience injuries as a result of exposure to hazardous wastes created by and used in the production of METH. Recommendations for healthcare workers exposed to chemicals involved in the illicit production of METH are proposed.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> The College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists (CPNP) was founded in 1998 and was originally comprised of pharmacists with an expertise in psychiatry and neurology. In the last three years, Nova Southeastern University’s collegiate chapter has offered students opportunities to explore psychiatric pharmacy practice. We have transformed from a nascent organization in the College of Pharmacy to a group with a strong membership following. We provide support and education for dedicated students interested in pursuing psychiatric/neurologic pharmacy. <bold>Objective:</bold> Our chapter has encouraged students to take an active role in learning about psychiatric/neurologic pharmacy and promoted awareness about mental illness within the community and on campus. Our chapter has enabled students to become more involved in research, education, and community outreach. We strive to create partnerships within the community and with local institutions. <bold>Methods:</bold> Our collegiate chapter mirrors the mission, goals, committees, and officer positions of the national CPNP organization. Our mission is to promote excellence in pharmacy practice, education, and research. Furthermore our chapter strives to optimize treatment outcomes for current and future patients of pharmacy students. The goals of our chapter are to educate the community and promote research among pharmacy students through mentorship. <bold>Results:</bold> Since 2009, we have successfully recruited students to our organization, participated in community events, and promoted awareness about mental illness. We have educated students with monthly training seminars, encouraged participation in community events and offered shadowing opportunities. Current projects for 2012-2013 include promoting discussion of current events in psychiatric pharmacy, inviting additional guest speakers to detail their experience in psychiatric pharmacy, teaching students how to implement the mini-mental status exam, and continuing to participate in local events. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The NSU CPNP chapter has been a positive endeavor for both club members and the local community. Students have promoted the chapter through active participation in various club functions and activities. As a result of offering assistance to patients and their caregivers, pharmacy students have gained relevant insight and experience into the field of psychiatry and neurology.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> Medication nonadherence, intentional or unintentional secondary to lack of medication access, leads to increased risk of worsening symptomatology, rehospitalization and lapses in sobriety. Obtaining refills at the emergency department causes undue financial expenditure. Wait time for psychiatrist appointments may be 6-8 weeks for new patients. Psychiatric pharmacists (PP) can provide timely medication services which may eliminate unintentional nonadherence and engage patients earlier in treatment. <bold>Description of Services:</bold> A continuity of care clinic (COCC) was established for new patients or existing patients who had been recently hospitalized and required follow-up earlier than their psychiatrist’s schedule allowed. A proposal for a PP run COCC was made to the medical director. Two afternoons a week were devoted to the COCC. Referrals were received from intake clinicians who identified patients who were running out of medications. Patients were interviewed and assessed by the PP and treatment recommendations were formulated. Assessments and treatment recommendations were presented to an attending psychiatrist for approval. Prescriptions were written as verbal orders and filled at the clinic pharmacy or telephoned to an outside pharmacy. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> From 7/2009 to 10/2010, 129 clients were seen, with a total of 142 appointments. The time to COCC appointment was typically 1-2 weeks. Existing patients comprised 58% of the total patients, while 42% were new patients. Primary diagnoses included thought, mood and anxiety disorders. Nearly half had a co-existing substance use disorder. Medication regimens were changed for 45 patients (35%), 27 patients (21%) had medications discontinued and 32 patients (25%) had labs ordered. Eighty-two percent of patients attended their next medication appointment. For non-COCC patients, 2010 second and third quarter appointment show rates were 62% and 53%, respectively. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> A PP run COCC provides opportunities for direct medication services delivered in a timely manner, reducing reliance on emergency department refills. Psychiatric pharmacists ability to assess, treat and engage patients earlier in the process of establishing care may have led to increased show rates at subsequent psychiatrist evaluations. Further, this type of service helps ensure continued medication therapy, which may increase adherence, and lower the risk of relapse and rehospitalization.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Objective:</bold> To develop recommendations for healthcare professionals exposed to second- and third-hand smoke while providing home-based services to patients with severe mentally illnesses (SMI), such as schizophrenia. <bold>Background:</bold> Healthcare professionals who service those with SMI face many unique challenges. One particular challenge is exposure to second- and third-hand smoke. According to a study done on mentally ill patients in South Australia, only 31.5% of patients with SMI are likely to have smoke-free homes. Smoking rates in persons diagnosed with schizophrenia are significantly higher compared to the general population: up to 90% compared to approximately 30% for the general population. The multidisciplinary integrated program of assertive community treatment (IMPACT) team provides home-based services to the severely mentally ill. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> Currently there are no guidelines available for minimizing the effects of second- and third-hand smoke on healthcare professionals. Strategies for minimizing the effects were proposed. The literature and resource information from the Centers for Disease Control website were used to formulate recommendations to minimize adverse effects due to second- and third-hand cigarette smoke exposure. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> Potential strategies for minimizing second- and third- hand smoke exposure were developed and proposed. These included conducting the meeting with the patient outside the residence, meeting in a neutral location, fresh clothes, and use of an air filter in the room for the meeting. All recommendations require patient participation, which may be a limitation. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Most literature dealing with second-hand smoke focused on the potential occupational hazards of exposure and advocated the use of anti-public smoking laws to control the problem. Data are limited on steps that may be taken by individuals to minimize second hand smoke exposure other than avoidance. Additional methods to protect healthcare workers from exposure to second- and third-hand smoke are needed.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> The use of antipsychotic agents in children and adolescents has increased dramatically in recent years. From 1993 to 2002, there was a 6-fold increase in antipsychotic prescriptions for those under age 21. In 2003-2004, approximately 1% of all outpatient pediatric visits resulted in an antipsychotic prescription. Given the few FDA approved indications for antipsychotic use in youngsters, the extensive use in those served by the public sector and their potential toxicity, greater scrutiny of their use is required. In the fall of 2011, the Maryland Medicaid Pharmacy Program with the support of the Maryland Mental Hygiene Administration contracted with the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy to develop a peer review education and prior authorization program for the use of antipsychotics in those under the age of five. Key partners included the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center and Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, University of Maryland School of Medicine, family advocacy groups and other stakeholders. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> The Peer Review Program establishes criteria for use of the antipsychotic agents in those under age five, collects data on compliance with the criteria and educates prescribers regarding appropriate use and monitoring. The criteria address age, diagnosis/indication, prior treatment, concurrent support services, drug/dose/regimen and patient monitoring. Additional baseline data includes height/weight, BMI, glucose, lipid profile, liver function tests, electrocardiogram (when appropriate) and movement disorder monitoring. Prescriber and patient groups were educated prior to the program’s initiation. Prescribers may initiate the process or are alerted by pharmacists through an alert when prescriptions are submitted for approval. Psychiatric pharmacists provide the initial interaction and education for prescribers. A child psychiatrist provides further interventions and consultation as necessary. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The Peer Review Program has increased the awareness of prescribers concerning the appropriate use and monitoring of antipsychotic agents in young children. This Program helps assure that antipsychotics are used in clinically appropriate regimens for legitimate reasons in a vulnerable population. Furthermore, the Program assures that youth exposed to these powerful agents receive appropriate safety monitoring. The program will be expanded to include older children in the near future.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background/Rationale:</bold> There is an increased incidence of metabolic syndrome in patients with major mental illness. This may be due in part to unhealthy lifestyle and genetics, but there is growing evidence that treatment with antipsychotics may also be a factor. Cardiometabolic Syndrome monitoring guidelines set by the American Diabetes Association and American Psychiatric Association include the following: Personal/Family history: baseline and annually; Weight/BMI: baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, quarterly; Waist circumference: baseline, annually; Blood pressure (BP): baseline, 12 weeks, annually; Fasting plasma glucose (FPG): baseline, 12 weeks, annually; Fasting lipid panel (FLP): baseline, 12 weeks, annually. Monitoring and treatment of cardiometabolic syndrome continues to be suboptimal despite the large amount of attention that has focused on this issue. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> A clinical dashboard was created to identify all patients prescribed antipsychotic medications in VISN 21 of the VA healthcare system. This dashboard was used to identify patients who were not being properly monitored for cardiometabolic syndrome. Using this list, the clinical pharmacist manually reviewed patients with monitoring parameters that were overdue and contacted them via telephone or letter requesting that they have fasting blood work drawn at their local clinic or come into clinic to have their BP or weight checked. The patient was then contacted by the clinical pharmacist via telephone to review the lab results and discuss any possible lifestyle or medication changes that may be needed to help them reach the goals. <bold>Impact on Patient Care/Institution:</bold> All cardiometabolic syndrome monitoring performance measure goals were met at the Martinez site following intervention from the clinical pharmacist. Pre-intervention data was not captured, but the impact can be seen when comparing this with data from another site within the Northern California Health Care System which did not have a clinical pharmacist working on this measure. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Use of a clinical dashboard and intervention from a clinical pharmacist in the mental health clinic had a large impact on the rate of cardiometabolic syndrome monitoring.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Although not FDA approved for smoking cessation, e-cigarettes may play a future role in the development of an alternative treatment option. The purpose of this case report is to describe early smoking cessation with the use of e-cigarettes. <bold>Patient History:</bold> The patient is a 51 year old Caucasian female who was referred to the psychiatric pharmacist for comprehensive medication management due to elevated liver enzymes and poly-pharmacy. The patient’s current Axis I diagnoses included: Bipolar I Disorder, Anxiety disorder NOS, recent adjustment disorder (bereavement); alcohol dependency in remission, and tobacco dependency. Her past medical history included: obesity, diabetes mellitus, type II, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, myopia including astigmatism, adrenal nodules, and fatty liver. During the course of follow-up visits, the patient disclosed that she wants to quit smoking and was prescribed nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patches (21mg/14mg/7 mg) and nicotine lozenges 2 mg by her primary care provider. The patient set a tobacco cessation quit date and was given instructions to initiate the nicotine replacement therapy on her quit date. She also was educated on diet control. Weeks later, the patient reported quitting smoking two days prior to her original quit date because she purchased and started using an e-cigarette along with one nicotine lozenge per day. She described that the nicotine patch “fell off” so she discontinued it. Weeks later she stopped the nicotine lozenge. After 5-months, the patient had decreased her use of e-cigarette to three cartridges per week and denied using any tobacco cigarettes. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> This is the first reported case of a patient with severe mental illness who self-initiated e-cigarettes and was able to remain smoke free for 5 months. The major concern about e-cigarettes is the lack of safety and efficacy research. An OVID Medline search using the keyword “electronic cigarettes” found only 15 references pertaining directly to e-cigarettes. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> As the FDA imposes more regulations and controls upon e-cigarette companies, some of the uncertainties surrounding e-cigarettes will diminish. However, additional research of e-cigarette products is needed before they can be widely recommended by clinicians for smoking cessation.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Constipation is a well-known and usually benign side effect of antipsychotic therapy; however, clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility can be associated with significant morbidity. Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO), or Ogilvie’s syndrome, is a functional obstruction of the colon leading to decreased intestinal motility due to autonomic dysregulation. <bold>Patient History:</bold> This is a 42-year-old Caucasian male with a history of undifferentiated schizophrenia, Tourette’s syndrome, type 2 diabetes, urinary incontinence, and hypothyroidism. Social history is noncontributory. He has been treated with clozapine (700-800 mg daily) for over 10 years as an inpatient in a state psychiatric hospital. Other chronic medications include chlorpromazine, benztropine, omeprazole, levothyroxine, lorazepam, and metformin. In November 2010, he experienced severe constipation and was placed on a bowel regimen consisting of routine use of lactulose, senna, milk of magnesia, docusate, and bisacodyl suppository. In both March and May 2011, he was admitted to an acute care hospital for large bowel obstruction and fecal impaction. In June 2011, he complained of abdominal pain and distension. He was sent to the acute care hospital and was admitted to the intensive care unit. He was diagnosed with Ogilvie’s syndrome. His bowel regimen at that time was changed to polyethylene glycol, lactulose and bisacodyl. In December 2011, he complained of abdominal pain and distension, and was in acute distress. He was sent to the emergency room and was admitted to the intensive care unit. His exam showed a markedly distended and tense abdomen with diminished bowel sounds. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed marked dilation of the stomach, small bowel, and large intestine. He was diagnosed with ACPO. He was treated conservatively with IV neostigmine, metoclopramide, and erythromycin. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> A MEDLINE search revealed several reports of clozapine-induced constipation but only a few reports of clozapine-induced ACPO. The product information for clozapine warns about varying degrees of impairment of intestinal peristalisis including rare fatalities. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> ACPO secondary to clozapine was responsible for acute care hospitalizations in this patient. Clinicians should be cognizant that this complication can occur despite the use of a seemingly adequate bowel regimen.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Hyperprolactinemia is a common side effect of antipsychotics especially haloperidol and risperidone. Prolactin levels for men greater than 20 ng/mL are indicative of hyperprolactinemia. Symptoms of hyperprolactinemia include: lactation, breast pain, loss of libido, hypogonadism, infertility, gynaecomastia, erectile dysfunction and possibly osteoporosis. <bold>Patient-History:</bold> The patient is a 29 year-old Indian male diagnosed at age 25 with chronic paranoid schizophrenia. Past medical history includes: dyslipidemia, status post uvulectomy for benign growth; and nicotine dependence. Patient was hospitalized in July 2009 after attempting to jump off a bridge. During inpatient stay on 8/11/2009, patient was started on risperidone Consta<sup>®</sup> 25 mg IM every 2 weeks and risperidone 1 mg BID. Patient responded to treatment and was continued on this regimen. A routine serum prolactin concentration was drawn on 11/2010 showing slightly elevated prolactin levels 21.9 ng/mL (reference 2 – 14). Oral risperidone was discontinued on 12/2010 but risperidone Consta<sup>®</sup> was continued allowing patient to attend college and work. On 9/2011 a repeat serum prolactin level was drawn showing an elevation in prolactin to 29.8 ng/ml. In October of 2011 patient started to report transient left breast tenderness and redness (no drainage) along with sexual dysfunction. On 11/23/2011 patient was prescribed aripiprazole 2.5 mg PO daily to treat signs and symptoms of hyperprolactinemia. In January 2012 patient returned to clinic reporting moderate adherence with aripiprazole (taking 4-5 times a week). Patient reports a resolution of breast tenderness and redness with no change in psychiatric symptoms. Patient was ordered a repeat prolactin level but did not go to lab for procedure. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> Several recent studies have been published establishing the safety and efficacy of using aripiprazole for a treatment of antipsychotic induced hyperprolactinemia in people with schizophrenia. However, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case where aripiprazole was used to treat hyperprolactinemia with injectable antipsychotics. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> In cases where people with schizophrenia are stabilized on an injectable antipsychotic and have symptoms of hyperprolactinemia, low dose aripiprazole is a potential therapy to improve side effects while continuing treatment.</p>

The specific mechanism has not been elucidated, but hypotheses include effects on dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, p-glycoprotein, and/or impaired cortical activity<sup>2</sup>. <bold>Patient-History:</bold> The patient is a 24 year-old female with noncontributory medical history. The patient was started on Chloroquine 250 mg weekly for malaria prophylaxis. Within four days of the first dose, family members noticed subtle changes in the patient’s demeanor. Manic symptoms including insomnia, severe anorexia and pressured speech began approximately 9 days after the first dose. After two weeks of administration, the patient began exhibiting psychotic symptoms including visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. The patient was treated as an in-patient for ten days and eventually responded to a combination of a mood stabilizer and atypical antipsychotic. Patient reported occasional symptoms of auditory hallucinations for several months. Approximately eight months after exposure to chloroquine, the patient also developed symptoms of recurring distressing dreams, flashbacks, and generalized anxiety. These symptoms eventually resolved after several weeks. Ten months later, the patient is stable and exhibits no further symptoms. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> A MEDLINE search revealed dozens of individuals that have been reported to have psychosis secondary to chloroquine administration. The onset is normally 4-10 days and the doses of chloroquine usually range from 1.5-2g<sup>3</sup>. The vast majority of individuals recover with discontinuation of the drug within a couple days to weeks. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case diverges from previously reported cases because of the exceedingly low dose of chloroquine (500 mg total), length of psychiatric symptoms (approximately 6 months), and occurrence of PTSD symptomology. This could be due to a genetic susceptibility or large variation in the patient-specific pharmacokinetics of chloroquine<sup>2</sup>. Clinicians should be aware of the frequency of this type of reaction, as well as the potential for a genetic predisposition to psychosis.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Lewy Body Dementia is the third most common cause of dementia affecting 1.3 million individuals. Clinical features include gradual memory loss and function, motor symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease, and visual hallucinations. Cholinesterase inhibitors are recommended in an attempt to slow the decline in memory and function. However, treating the motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms can be challenging. <bold>Patient History:</bold> A 78-year-old male patient diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia presented to the clinic in July 2011 for a routine visit. At the July appointment, the patient was taking both donepezil and memantine and was noted to be doing well. The wife noted occasional hallucinations which would quickly disappear. The patient was still functional to where the wife could leave him at home while she went to work 4 hours a day. Due to recent memantine prescribing restrictions initiated by the VA Healthcare System, the patient no longer met criteria for the medication. The patient was instructed to taper and discontinue the memantine. At the next appointment two months later, the wife reported a decline in function. She stated the patient was experiencing incontinence, had episodes where he did not recognize her, and visual hallucinations were occurring daily. Memantine was restarted and titrated to 10 mg twice daily. After taking the full dose of memantine for a week, the hallucinations decreased significantly. At the most recent appointment, the patient was functioning as well as he was in July. The wife stated episodes of disorientation and hallucinations were rare. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> Three small studies were found addressing memantine treatment for Lewy Body Dementia. Overall, the studies only showed a small benefit in cognition. However, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms worsened when patients taking memantine were discontinued from therapy. One small study found Neuropsychiatric-Inventory (NPI) and hallucination scores improved significantly for patients taking memantine. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Literature investigating the use of memantine for the psychiatric symptoms of Lewy Body Dementia is limited but there is a small amount of data supporting its use. Memantine appeared to be helpful in treating this patient’s visual hallucinations.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Methadone, a synthetic opiate, is one of the mainstays of therapy for detoxification in opioid dependency. Similar to other opiates, constipation is one of the common adverse effects observed during treatment with methadone. Constipation results from delayed gastrointestinal transit, reduced propulsion, increased anal sphincter tone, reduced gastrointestinal secretions and contraction strength. Perforation of the colon can result from pressure of an impacted fecal mass, due to severe constipation. Unlike other adverse effects of methadone, such as nausea and sedation, tolerance to the constipating effects rarely develops. <bold>Patient-History:</bold> The patient is a 71 year old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for IV heroin abuse, emphysema and right iliac arterial occlusion with stents, was brought into the emergency department with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and multiple episodes of emesis over the past 24 hours. The patient was being managed on Methadone 50 mg daily for the past 20 years. Presenting symptoms included decreased appetite, pain upon swallowing, abdominal pain and nausea for 3 days and admitted for generalized abdominal pain. A CT scan showed that the patient had a dilated colon, with distended loops of both the large and small bowel, and severe fecal impaction. The patient was taken to the operating room and received a sub-total colectomy. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for management of fecal peritonitis. Two weeks later, the patient developed acute respiratory failure and was placed on a ventilator. Several attempts to wean the patient for the ventilator had failed. Thirty-three days after admission, the patient expired due to complications of bowel perforation. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> A MEDLINE search revealed few cases of methadone induced bowel perforation and fecal peritonitis. This has rarely been reported to be fatal. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this patient case, bowel perforation developed secondary to maintenance treatment with methadone, which proved to be fatal. When managing a patient on methadone maintenance therapy, it is important to complete a thorough evaluation and monitor the patient for constipation. Clinicians should implement effective regimens preventative strategies and treatment plans in patients at risk.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a known potential adverse effect of antipsychotics, including clozapine. Characteristic signs and symptoms of NMS include altered mental status, fever, autonomic instability, and muscle rigidity. Lamotrigine is associated with dermatologic reactions ranging from a benign rash to Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Adverse reactions to clozapine or lamotrigine can be life threatening if unrecognized or untreated. We present a case of clozapine-induced NMS diagnosed on the same day as a lamotrigine drug rash. <bold>Patient History:</bold> The patient is a 44 year-old African American female with a past medical history significant for schizophrenia, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and iron deficiency anemia. She was admitted for psychiatric stabilization with a home medication regimen including clozapine, lamotrigine, and olanzapine. Due to persistent psychotic symptoms clozapine and lamotrigine were titrated. Olanzapine was discontinued to prevent potentially unnecessary polypharmacy. On hospital day 8, the patient complained of dizziness and lower extremity stiffness. She was found to have a fever of 38.5°C. Laboratory evaluation showed a creatine kinase of 3553 IU/L and a clozapine/norclozapine level of 885 ng/mL. The same day, the patient was found to have a rash bilaterally on her upper extremities. A dermatologist classified the rash as a lamotrigine drug reaction. Clozapine and lamotrigine were discontinued, with subsequent resolution of symptoms. Following two weeks, clozapine was reinitiated without any symptoms of NMS. However, two weeks into the titration, the patient developed agranulocytosis with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.47/mm3 requiring clozapine discontinuation. The patient was discharged one week later with minor residual psychotic symptoms on a regimen of haloperidol and olanzapine. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> A PubMed search resulted in two other potential cases of an interaction between clozapine and lamotrigine. One with adverse effects from clozapine in a patient with a lamotrigine-induced rash, the other with a significant elevation in clozapine levels upon initiation of lamotrigine. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In our case report, a patient with schizophrenia developed apparent NMS from clozapine in addition to a lamotrigine-induced rash during dose escalation of both medications. Clinicians should be cognizant of the risks with these two medications, especially when used concurrently.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Hypothermia is an adverse event that occurs rarely with the administration of antipsychotics. It may also be an unusual symptom of phenytoin toxicity. The Michaelis-Menten pharmacokinetic metabolism of phenytoin necessitates nonlinear dose adjustment that nonpharmacists may undervalue. Additionally, various factors such as body temperature, renal failure, hypoalbuminuria, and trauma cause further alterations in phenytoin binding, distribution, and metabolism leading to complications in phenytoin monitoring and dose adjustment. <bold>Patient-History:</bold> The patient is a 53 year old African American female transferred to Western State Hospital for long-term psychiatric treatment of schizoaffective disorder from an acute care hospital. Past medical history includes hypertension, history of thromboembolism, pancytopenia, seizure disorder, and myelodysplastic syndrome. The patient was transferred to an acute care hospital when her temperature decreased to 85.9 degrees Fahrenheit. Phenytoin level was 21mcg/ml but albumin was low at 2.5g/dl, and corrected phenytoin level was 35mcg/ml. Temperature increased to normal, but patient had a recurrent episode of hypothermia possibly related to continued elevations in phenytoin level, exaggerated by low albumin. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> A Pubmed search reveals three case reports detailing phenytoin-induced hypothermia, multiple case reports involving various antipsychotics and hypothermia, and one case report specifically involving risperidone and hypothermia. A 2011 report by Bookstaver et al published in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics describes a case remarkably similar to this report also involving both phenytoin and risperidone. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case report highlights a temporal relationship between elevated phenytoin levels and hypothermia either manifesting as phenytoin toxicity or as an adverse effect associated with risperidone.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Delusional parasitosis (DP) is a psychiatric disorder that presents with the belief that the body and/or intimate environment is infested with parasites. In secondary DP, another disorder is the cause of the delusions, such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. <bold>Patient History:</bold> A 57 year old Caucasian female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type presented with multiple excoriations on her extremities. She stated that there were bugs and worms on her body. She had been treated with mebendazole by a dermatologist with no resolution to her condition. The patient was already being treated with quetiapine XR 200 mg daily for psychosis and mood stabilization. It was decided to increase the quetiapine XR to 450 mg. Over the next 30 days, she showed some improvement with the “outbreaks” occurring less often, but she was still reporting infestation as well as depression and anxiety. Her quetiapine XR dose was increased to 900 mg daily. Symptoms were controlled for approximately 4 months. At this time, the patient brought a jar containing dead skin cells, stating that she had captured some bugs to verify their existence. The dose of quetiapine XR was then increased to 1200 mg daily. One month later, the patient reported “the bugs were gone and the worms all died off”. She also no longer reported depression or psychosis associated with her primary diagnosis. For 4 months the patient endorsed no delusions or other psychotic symptoms. Eventually, believing she no longer needed the medication, the patient self-terminated treatment and consequently was admitted to the local psychiatric hospital. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> Currently, there is no standard for treatment of DP. Only two placebo-controlled studies have been conducted, both utilizing pimozide. There are case studies reporting aripiprazole, risperidone, and olanzapine as successful treatments for primary DP or DP secondary to organic disease. Also, case reports have been published utilizing quetiapine successfully, but only in low doses and in combination with sertraline. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this case report, high-dose quetiapine was successfully with no reports of adverse effects. This supports the use of quetiapine in delusional parasitosis secondary to schizoaffective disorder.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Synthetic cannabinoids are available in many states in the US and are sold as K2, Spice, or incense products labeled “not for human consumption.” They have become a popular alternative to marijuana, partly because they are not detected by common urine toxicology screens and they may produce more potent effects than marijuana. Acute concerns with synthetic cannabinoid use include potential for serotonin syndrome, anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, paresthesias, tremors, hypokalemia, tachycardia, chest pain, heart palpitations, and seizures. <bold>Patient History:</bold> This patient is a 28 year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for partial seizures secondary to a closed-head injury sustained as a teenager. He presented to the ED with confusion and altered mental status. The patient experienced one episode of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure in the ED. The patient reported using K2 intermittently for the past several months. During the past week, he reported hyperacusis, paresthesias, extreme sensitivity to external stimuli, anxiety, and insomnia after K2 use. Supplemental history was given by his father at bed-side. Home medications include levetiracetam 750 mg daily for partial onset seizures, which was well controlled for several months. Urine toxicology was negative. He was transferred to the ICU for observation, and experienced two to three more 10 to 15 second seizures. After 48 hours with no significant events he was discharged with levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily and follow up appointments with neurology and psychiatry for seizure disorder and anxiety disorder, respectively. He refused substance abuse follow up. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> A PubMed search<sup>1</sup> revealed two case reports of seizures associated with confirmed synthetic cannabinoid use and several review articles citing possibility of seizures with synthetic cannabinoid use. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Synthetic cannabinoids may be more readily available may produce more toxic effects than marijuana. Healthcare providers and individuals should be aware of these adverse effects.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> A diagnosis of schizophrenia is associated with a two- to three-fold increase in mortality. A number of medical comorbidities have been theorized to increase the mortality rates in this population. Diabetes is of particular interest. Diabetes self-care monitoring increased following the implementation of a color-coded glucose monitoring log. <bold>Patient-History:</bold> The patient is a 25-year-old African-American man with comorbidities of schizophrenia and insulin-dependent diabetes. Glucose readings ranged from the 400 s to the low 100 s (normal range 65-99 mg/dL). Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) results were high (10.2%, goal for a diabetic = 6.5%). The patient expressed interest in using a different glucose monitoring log. One was developed that incorporated visual cuing and a simpler design. The design of the log was based on research findings for visual cuing in persons with schizophrenia. The form was changed from one monthly page to weekly with more white space, enlarged (from 8 to 12) and simplified font (Times New Roman to Calibri). Color was added to facilitate visual cueing. Insulin was grouped by type. The patient was in-serviced at the time the form was implemented. Following a six-week pilot program, documentation completion averaged 64.3% (range 7.1 to 90.5%) for the insulin given and 70.3% (range 14.3 to 90.5%) for the blood glucose readings. The patient reported he was able to locate the form, take a blood glucose reading, and record the information more consistently. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> Persons with a diagnosed of schizophrenia respond to visual stimuli differently compared to the general population. When faced with numerous distracting stimuli, they focus on central position cues. Reaction time depends on the relative frequency of specific distracters and they respond better with fewer distracters within a display. Visual cues enhanced reaction time. Response to color also decreased attention-requiring tasks. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> We present the case of a patient with a comorbidity of diabetes and schizophrenia. By applying visual cuing research, we developed a glucose monitoring form that increased documentation.</p>
