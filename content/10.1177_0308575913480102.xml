            <title>Reviewed by Liz Burns, Independent Family and Systemic Psychotherapist, Penzance, Cornwall, UK</title>
            <p>Whether you are a social work student, learning for the first time to meet clients in their intimate social contexts, a busy professional working to satisfy the ever-increasing demands of child protection practice or just someone seeking to understand the full sweep of skills needed to perform adequately in the safeguarding arena, this is a book for you. The author succeeds in presenting a striking picture of the ever-moving task of the social worker while meeting children and their families on their own territory, carrying their professional knowledge and skills with them, yet also drawing on their own minute-to-minute experience, learning to trust and use the emotional reactions they feel in each part of the working day.</p>
            <p>Take the example of the social worker’s essential car. Ferguson rehabilitates this and the time spent in it, from relative emptiness to an ideal space to make therapeutic links with children and their parents, and a secure base where the worker can reflect on practice, alone or with colleagues, and go forward refreshed and informed. I would expect this to be especially resonant for those working intensively or over long periods with looked after children, perhaps in foster care and/or in the run-up to adoption, where places to talk may be at a premium and a neutral space hard to find.</p>
            <p>The book argues for a new way of thinking about safeguarding work, which the author calls ‘intimate child protection practice’. While this way of looking at social work child protection may be ‘new’ for recent generations of professionals, as someone who qualified in social work in the early 70s, I like it for its return to wisdom, which I feel was endemic at that time, when ‘child protection’ as a discrete entity was just beginning to enter our consciousness. This is not to say that it harks back to a previous era, but more that it brings knowledge and skills that may have been in danger of being lost, into the contemporary world. They are then interpreted in the light of new interest in the social sciences in such topics as ‘mobilities’ and the meanings that are generated in different spaces, for example, houses, cars and offices.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Child Protection Practice</italic> is a good read and an original one. I find it an exemplary choice for anyone who is interested in child protection and those professionals whose daily task is to practise it. The style is very digestible. The chapters are relatively brief, which makes it an ideal book for busy professionals to consume on the run. It is well organised and its structure is transparent. It is easy to dip in and out and find just what one is looking for. Its message is always clear. Chapter headings are both specific and intriguing and the index does what a good index should.</p>
            <p>I did find some chapters more rudimentary than I expected. While I was delighted to find ‘working with mothers’ and ‘working with fathers’ given prominence, I would have liked to see more use made throughout of thinking around family systems and the relational embeddedness of problems of abuse and neglect. These understandings have also moved forward in psychosocial theory and practices since the 70s and 80s. They are particularly represented in the personal and professional experience of people like myself, who used to be social workers and moved on – when social work seemed to be gaining in bureaucracy and in danger of losing its more therapeutic aspects – to make the focus on family systems more central in our work.</p>
            <p>I also had questions about some of the urging towards more ‘intimate’ practices, as this seems to cry out for more discussion and perhaps a more critical, or do I mean circumspect, debate? What, for example, should social workers do with any suspicions they may have that too much touching might land them in trouble, or that too much time spent in the car might be misinterpreted?</p>
            <p>Having raised these questions, however, I am left with a sense of gratitude to Harry Ferguson for putting not only sights and smells but feelings – both the ones that help and the ones that hinder – back onto the agenda in the approach to safeguarding our children, and for drawing our attention to the meanings which we, our colleagues and society in general, attach to these activities. I am especially grateful for the opportunity to share in the first-hand experiences of social workers, past and present, through the supply of painstakingly gathered, and generously presented, key historical texts and contemporary research material.</p>
