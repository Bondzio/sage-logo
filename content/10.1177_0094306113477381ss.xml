<p>Black students’ academic underachievement compared to their white peers is an important topic that has received a great deal of academic and popular discussion. One widespread explanation for this phenomenon is that black students have adopted an oppositional culture that equates doing well in school with “acting white.” <italic>Integration Interrupted</italic> challenges this conventional wisdom (most famously put forth by Signithia Fordham and John Ogbu) that black students learn to adopt cultural patterns that disparage academic achievement and oppose mainstream white culture in their communities.</p>
<p>Karolyn Tyson’s argument is two-fold. First, she contends that many black students do not see a relationship between race and academic achievement. Second, when black students do point to such a relationship, it is something that they learn in school—neither at home nor in their communities. <italic>Integration Interrupted</italic> is Tyson’s attempt to get at when, why, and how some black students began associating academic achievement with “acting white,” and the consequences for this association.</p>
<p>Tyson draws on an impressive amount of material for this work. She analyzes data from four research projects. Two of these studies, of which Tyson was the principal investigator, focused on black students attending all-black or predominantly black elementary schools in the Southeast in 1996–1997 and 2000–2001. Tyson was co-principal investigator with William Darity, Jr. and Domini Castellino on the other two projects, which were conducted in 2000–2001 and 2001–2004. These projects focused primarily on high-achieving students. The former study recruited racially diverse respondents. The latter concentrated on black students. The book focuses primarily on adolescents from these two studies, and highlights the experiences of approximately 200 students in 28 schools—most of which were in North Carolina. Tyson and colleagues use school and classroom observations, in-depth interviews, and surveys to collect the data.</p>
<p>Tyson asserts that the first published research on the connection between “acting white” and high academic achievement among black students appeared in the 1980s. The “acting white” reference itself has been around for at least 100 years and was used in relation to demeanor, style of dress and speech, friendship choice, musical preference, and other tastes. Essentially, the slur was used to question whether a person’s presentation of self was “authentically black.” The practice of accusing high-achieving black students of “acting white” did not occur until shortly after meaningful school desegregation began earnestly in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The author argues that long-term exposure to “racialized” tracking increases the likelihood that black students will believe there is an association between race and achievement. Tracking has become very common in American high schools. Tyson notes that in predominantly white and racially diverse schools, this often results in white students being overrepresented in gifted, honors, and Advanced Placement classes while racial-ethnic minorities are concentrated in lower-level or general education classes. Tyson’s most important point is that the “acting white” slur is only used in reference to academic achievement in schools where “racialized” tracking is the norm. The relationship between race and tracking has been well researched by Jeannie Oakes, Gary Orfield, Samuel Lucas, Charles Clotfelter, and many others. However, with the exception of a few scholars (Prudence Carter, Roslyn Mickelson and Anne Velasco, Carla O’Connor) the connection between “racialized” tracking and use of the “acting white” slur has been under-examined.</p>
<p>The meat of Tyson’s analysis comes in Chapters Two through Four. In Chapter Two, she focuses on 65 high-achieving black high school students—13 of whom reported being accused of “acting white” due to their academic achievement. All 13 students attended predominantly white or racially diverse schools and took advanced classes where they were the only black student or one of a handful of black students. Tyson argues that the “acting white” slur is used to problematize white students’ overrepresentation in advanced classes and to challenge the relevance of the school’s evaluation of students’ academic abilities. She contends that using the slur allows lower-achieving students to possess “symbolic power” while coping with a humiliating experience. Chapter Three analyzes the experiences of 36 high-achieving black teens who had either been taunted or anticipated being taunted as a result of achievement-related behaviors. Tyson places the teens in two categories based on their responses to this peer influence. “Secure” adolescents were not concerned with others’ perceptions of them and were able to resist oppositional peer cultures when necessary. Twenty-five of the thirty-six teens fell into this group. In contrast, “vulnerable” adolescents wanted to be liked by their peers and to “fit in.” Chapter Four analyzes semi-structured interviews with 61 racially diverse North Carolina high school students to investigate how they selected courses. Tyson argues that the first priority for all students was to choose classes in which they believed they could do well. However, she finds that almost 75 percent of respondents who took advanced classes in high school had been previously designated as “gifted.” (White students were more likely than black, Hispanic, and American Indian students to have been so designated.) To explicate this relationship, Tyson runs a logistic regression on North Carolina Department of Public Instruction data (N = 43,000). After including measures for students’ race, elementary and middle school test scores, and other relevant factors, “gifted” students continued to have higher odds of enrollment in advanced placement classes.</p>
<p>Tyson acknowledges limitations in her study. The sample is not representative of all North Carolina high school students because, partially by design, most students who participated were high-achieving. She also notes that elementary school principals suggested teachers who would likely participate in her classroom study. Similarly, school counselors distributed consent forms to high-achieving high school students of their choice. Tyson notes that these decisions on the part of school officials may have increased the likelihood that students who had the best rapport with the school participated in her research projects.</p>
<p>The author mentions that future research should examine differences in male and female students’ responses to “racialized” tracking and to being accused of “acting white.” I would like to reiterate this contention and highlight several other places in the book where gender may be relevant. Tyson notes that almost two-thirds of the students who were not affected by oppositional peer cultures in high school were female. She also mentions that high-achieving males seemed to have more difficulty reconciling being “cool” with being smart and were less likely to talk to their friends about school. Similarly, Tyson suggests that class differences may be at play. Middle-class black students who attended schools with “racialized” tracking seemed to struggle more than their working-class peers with creating an “authentic” black identity. This, in turn, could cause these students to be even more vulnerable to oppositional peer cultures. Future research should interrogate these relationships more fully.</p>
<p><italic>Integration Interrupted</italic> is an important contribution to the literature on race and academic achievement. Tyson effectively shifts the focus of the “acting white” debate from black students’ culture to local school structures such as the demographics of the student population and the racial composition of advanced classes. The author highlights how “racialized” tracking in schools works to undermine the academic and social benefits we have come to expect from students’ attendance at integrated, racially diverse schools.</p>
