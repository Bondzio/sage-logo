<abstract>
<p>Peptide dendrimers are attractive nonviral gene vectors. But a biological barrier for their application in gene delivery is the fast degradation catalyzed by proteasomes. Proteasome inhibitors are efficient at prohibiting the degradation of peptide nonviral vectors, thus enhancing gene transfection efficiency. In this study, N<sup>α</sup>-Boc-protected leucine vinyl ester proteasome inhibitor Boc-Leu-Leu-Leu-ve was synthesized by the liquid-phase method and was then immobilized onto poly(<sc>l</sc>-lysine) dendrimers. Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC was used as fluorimetric substrate and the inhibition capacity of Boc-Leu-Leu-Leu-ve immobilized onto G<sub>3</sub> and G<sub>6</sub> poly(<sc>l</sc>-lysine) dendrimers for the chymotrypsin-like activity of ACHN cell proteasome was tested. The results indicated that both Boc-Leu-Leu-Leu-ve peptide and the peptide immobilized on G<sub>3</sub> dendrimer showed low inhibition capacity when the concentration was below 0.2 μM. When the inhibitor concentrations were increased to 5.0 μM, however, the percentage inhibition of Boc-Leu-Leu-Leu-ve peptide and the peptide immobilized on G<sub>3</sub> dendrimer became about 50% and 25%, and that of peptide immobilized on the G<sub>6</sub> dendrimer was 7.5% only. These results indicated that dendritic structure and linker length could be the main factors affecting proteasome inhibition capacity. The cytotoxicity of the dendritic inhibitors was found to be low. Thus, whilst the synthetic production of poly(<sc>l</sc>-lysine) dendrimers immobilized with peptide inhibitors was successful and these modified dendrimers could work to inhibit proteasome activity, further studies will need to be carried out to improve inhibition capacity.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328210386821" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dendrimers are hyper-branched polymers comprised of three parts: a central core, branching units, and branches. They are usually prepared by divergent or convergent synthetic approaches and their general properties include monodispersity, spherical structure, nanosize, and dense peripheral functional groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328210386821">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328210386821">2</xref></sup> Peptide dendrimers are constructed by peptide bond linkages from natural or unnatural amino acids. They share common features with proteins such as globular structure, water solubility, biocompatibility, and biodegradability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328210386821">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328210386821">5</xref></sup> Unlike native proteins, however, the surface functional charges and branching morphology are prone to modifications. Thus, dendrimers are potentially attractive as vectors for drug and gene delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328210386821">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328210386821">9</xref></sup> For cationic dendrimers, the multiple surface cationic amino groups are considered to be effective at condensing anionic nucleic acids such as DNA, RNA, and antisense oligonucleotides to form complexes through electrostatic interaction. The complexes are mostly in nano-scale sizes. This size range is believed to be vital for gene transfection both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328210386821">8</xref></sup> Although peptide dendrimers have already been used as nonviral gene vectors, there were still barriers in cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking which limit their gene transfection efficiency and effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328210386821">6</xref></sup> Recently, evidence has emerged that the cationic peptide vectors could be metabolized by intracellular proteasomes, resulting in low gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210386821">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328210386821">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>A series of inhibitors and their derivatives have been reported that could be immobilized on the active sites of proteasomes via reversible or irreversible covalent bonds. The reversible approaches included reactions of peptide aldehyde (MG132 and MG115) and peptide boronates, and the irreversible approaches included uses of lactacystin and its derivatives, peptide vinyl sulfones and peptide epoxyketones. The proteasome inhibitors first used in gene transfection were reported by Duan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328210386821">13</xref></sup> These authors found that the transduction level of viral vectors increased 200-fold in the presence of tripeptide proteasome inhibitor Calpain inhibitor I or MG 132. Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328210386821">12</xref></sup> assumed that the peptide-mediated nonviral vectors had the similar metabolism route to the viral vectors. They administrated peptide vectors with tripeptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitors which resulted in a 30-fold increase of luciferase expression whilst no significant enhancement was found for lipofectamine and polyethylenimine mediated transfer condensates under the same conditions. This kind of inhibitors was cytotoxic with the LD<sub>50</sub> as 2 μM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328210386821">12</xref></sup> In order to disclose whether an intrinsic peptide proteasome inhibitor would enhance gene expression, a GA (Gly-Ala) repeat unit, which was derived from Epstein-Barr virus and demonstrated to block the action of proteasomes, was incorporated to the linear gene transfer peptide. This new class of gene delivery agents showed direct inhibition of proteasomes, but their inhibition effects were weaker than MG 115 and MG 132.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328210386821">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Marastoni et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328210386821">14</xref></sup> synthesized a new class of peptide vinyl ester proteasome inhibitors that showed efficient inhibition for trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like proteasomes with low IC<sub>50</sub> values. The inhibition mechanism was similar to that of peptide vinyl sulfone inhibitors with a Michael addition with the N-terminal catalytic threonine residue of β subunit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210386821">15</xref></sup> Martin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210386821">16</xref></sup> constructed another class of intrinsic proteasome inhibitory peptides such as WK<sub>18</sub>-LLL-ve, WK<sub>18</sub>-LLLnV-ve, and WK<sub>18</sub>-FQL-ve. The C-terminal side of the linear peptide WK<sub>18</sub> was modified with a tripeptide vinyl ester inhibitor sequence Leu-Leu-Leu-ve or Phe-Gln-Leu-ve. When it was transfected in HepG 2 cells, 100-fold gene expression was enhanced when compared with the noninhibitor peptide WK<sub>18</sub>.</p>
<p>Poly(<sc>l</sc>-lysine) dendrimers were a new type of polypeptide dendrimers, which have been explored as gene and drug delivery systems in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328210386821">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328210386821">18</xref></sup> In order to overcome the fast enzymatic degradation of polypeptide dendrimers, we have synthesized the proteasome inhibitor Boc-Leu-Leu-Leu-ve and immobilized it on the third (G<sub>3</sub>) and sixth (G<sub>6</sub>) generation of poly(<sc>l</sc>-lysine) dendrimers by a linker. With Suc-LLVY-AMC as fluorimetric substrates, the inhibition behavior of peptide inhibitor Boc-LLL-ve and its modified dendrimers was investigated for chymotrypsin-like activity of ACHN cell proteasomes. CCK-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8) method was applied to test the cytotoxicity of proteasome inhibitors and modified dendrimers. The binding ability of inhibitor modified dendrimers to plasmid DNA and the zeta potential of the complexes with different N/P ratios were studied. The results together suggested that dendrimers tagged with peptide proteasome inhibitors could work as more effective gene delivery vectors.</p>

<p>The proteasome contents vary in different tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328210386821">23</xref></sup> and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an important role in physiological processes, especially in the development of many human diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328210386821">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328210386821">26</xref></sup> We analyzed proteasome activity from kidney cancer cells (ACHN cell).

After regression analysis (equation: <italic>y</italic> = 7.88<italic>x</italic> + 0.84, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.999), the obtained total protein content was 0.9 g L<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>The proteolytic activity of proteasome was calculated upon the increase rate of free AMC (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) groups released from substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC (specific substrate for chymotrypsin-like activity). The intensity increased linearly within the initial 20 min and stabilized after 40 min reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328210386821">Figure 2</xref>). The fluorescence intensity within the initial 15 min was statistically analyzed through the slope to obtain the proteasome activity as 0.39, showing a modest chymotrypsin-like proteolytic activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-0885328210386821"><title>Assay for chymotrypsin-like activity inhibition</title>
<p>Boc-Leu-Leu-Leu-ve (7), G<sub>3</sub>-COOMe (11) and G<sub>3</sub>-linker-LLL-ve (15<bold>′</bold>) were tested for activity inhibition of chymotrypsin-like proteasome with final concentrations at 0.05, 0.2, and 5.0 μM. Samples were dissolved in DMSO and 70 µL proteasome lysate was incubated with sample at 37°C for 30 min in activity buffer which contained 0.03% SDS in 96-well blank plate. Substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC (DMSO solution) was added and incubated at 37°C for another 30 min. Compounds <bold>7</bold> and <bold>15′</bold> both showed poor inhibition at the concentrations below 0.2 μM. As the concentration increased to 5.0 μM, the fluorescence intensity of AMC obviously decreased. The relative fluorescence intensity was about 53% for compound <bold>7</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210386821">Figure 3</xref>(a)), showing that the percentage of inhibition was about 47%. Thus, for the inhibition activity of chymotrypsin-like proteasome, the IC<sub>50</sub> of compound <bold>7</bold> was &gt;5 μM in ACHN cell strain. The Boc-group was obvious ineffective for chymotrypsin-like activity inhibition. This was similar to inhibitor Boc-Guv-Val-Ser-Leu-ve (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 10 μM) and unprotected Guv-Val-Ser-Leu-ve (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.54 μM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328210386821">14</xref></sup> The percentage of inhibition of compound <bold>15′</bold> was about 24% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210386821">Figure 3</xref>(b)), which was only half of compound <bold>7</bold>. The difference suggests that the linear peptide and the dendrimer peptide with inhibitor linked to the N-terminals have different inhibition effects. The incorporated inhibitors in the linear peptide could become extensively exposed in solution, resulting in enough space to bind with the subunits of the proteolytic cores and adduct with the N-terminal residues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210386821">16</xref></sup> Poly(<sc>l</sc>-lysine) dendrimers possess a compact structure that would hide the inhibitor molecules and prevent the inhibitor groups to approach proteolytic cores. If the third generation dendritic molecules are substituted with larger ones, the percentage of inhibition should be decreased correspondingly. In order to verify this point, a dendrimer with higher generation (compound <bold>16′</bold>) (Boc-deprotected compound) with identical linkers was synthesized and its inhibition function was tested under the same conditions as used for compound <bold>15′</bold>. The fluorescence intensity ratio changed apparently when compared with compound <bold>15′</bold>, with the percentage of inhibition decreased abruptly to 7.5% at 5.0 μM. The difference thus suggests that the inhibition capacity of proteasome inhibitors conjugated with dendrimers was strongly affected by dendritic structure and linker length. The poly(<sc>l</sc>-lysine) dendrimers G3 and G5 without modification showed no inhibition activity on proteasome at the same conditions (data not shown).

<p>Tripeptide vinyl ester inhibitors Boc-Leu-Leu-Leu-ve and its modified poly(<sc>l</sc>-lysine) dendrimers (G<sub>3</sub>-linker-LLL-ve and G<sub>6</sub>-linker-LLL-ve) were successfully synthesized. Their inhibitory capacity was tested. G<sub>3</sub>-linker-LLL-ve showed about 25% inhibition for ACHN cell proteasome, while G<sub>6</sub>-linker-LLL-ve displayed only 7.5% inhibition under the same conditions. In contrast, free tripeptide inhibitor could prohibit about 50% proteasome activity, showing that the chemical bonding of the tripeptide inhibitor resulted in the reduced capacity of proteasome inhibition. The cytotoxicity and DNA binding ability of the modified dendrimers were studied. The results showed that the higher generation of dendrimer G<sub>6</sub>-linker-LLL-ve could bind and complex with DNA better than the lower generation of G<sub>3</sub> derivatives. Further studies are under way to examine how dendrimer structure, morphology, and the linker length affect inhibitor activity, thereby achieving the goal of inhibitor modified dendrimers with substantially improved capacity against proteasome degradation.</p>
