<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Rapid control of the disease is essential in the management of patients with critical and symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer. Pharmacological castration has become the main form of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer, with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists being used in more than 90% of cases. Surgical castration has become the less preferred modality. This article aims to explore the clinical and economic advantages of bilateral sub-capsular orchidectomy (BSCO).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1875974212465549">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Pre- and post-operative serial testosterone levels were taken from patients who had BSCO for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The half-life of testosterone was calculated. The cost of surgical castration on the National Health Service (NHS) was compared to the cost of LHRH agonists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1875974212465549">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Ten patients with a median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 93 ng/ml (range 26 to 4557 ng/ml) were included. Their mean random pre-operative testosterone level was 13.8 ng/ml (range 6.8 to 21.8 ng/ml). The mean half-life of testosterone was 61.7 minutes when calculated from the first two hours, and 67 minutes when calculated from the total drop with no significant variation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.464). Four patients reached castrate levels of testosterone within four to six hours. The total cost of an inpatient BSCO in the NHS was £850 to £1154. This was more or less equivalent to one year’s worth of the commonly used LHRH agonists without including the cost of medical services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1875974212465549">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Testosterone has a short half-life and reaches castrate levels within hours of the BSCO procedure. Rapid castration by BSCO would benefit patients with critical metastatic disease. BSCO on the NHS in patients with more than one year of life expectancy is also economically beneficial.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The management of organ-confined prostate cancer is in the centre of concentrated research and technological advancements. The ever-increasing use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and public awareness has resulted in a shift in the stage of prostate cancer at diagnosis. Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of patients are still diagnosed at an advanced and symptomatic stage of the disease. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is the accepted modality of treatment for these patients. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1875974212465549">1</xref></sup> for the management of prostate cancer recommends luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and states that bilateral sub-capsular orchidectomy (BSCO) should be offered to all men with metastatic prostate cancer as an alternative to continuous LHRH agonist therapy. Sub-capsular (i.e. with preservation of tunica albuginea and epididymis) orchidectomy is a simple and virtually complication-free procedure, and the 2012 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1875974212465549">2</xref></sup> on prostate cancer describe BSCO as the ‘gold standard’ method of hormonal treatment. In practice, the use of BSCOs has declined because of the availability of equally effective pharmacological methods of castration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1875974212465549">3</xref></sup> However, the current standard treatment strategy does not address a minor group of patients who present with critical metastatic disease. Patients with obstructive renal failure, impending cord compression and other aggressive symptomatic complications of metastatic disease (pain, pathological fractures, etc.) need to be managed with a sense of urgency. LHRH agonists achieve castrate levels of testosterone by 21 days from commencement of treatment, and cyproterone acetate does the same by the seventh day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1875974212465549">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1875974212465549">5</xref></sup> This article aims to emphasise the advantage of BSCO over its pharmacological counterparts by virtue of its rapid action.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>Patients with diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the prostate who planned for ADT were offered surgical as well as pharmacological options. Ten patients who opted to have BSCOs were recruited for the study. Pre-operative total serum testosterone (ST) and PSA levels were measured. Post-operatively, total testosterone levels were taken after the second, fourth and sixth hour. The half-life of testosterone was calculated by using the exponential decay method, which is used to calculate drug levels and half-lives. Since circadian rhythm and various metabolic factors would affect the decay, a range of values were expected. Two half-lives were calculated for each set of values: one from zero hours (pre-operative) to two hours and the other from zero hours to final ST level. The half-lives were analysed using a paired <italic>t</italic> test. Although the testosterone levels tend to decrease naturally during the evening time, the variations have been found to be insignificant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1875974212465549">6</xref></sup> Castrate level of testosterone was defined as &lt; 0.7 nmols/l (20 ng/dl).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1875974212465549">7</xref></sup> The cost of BSCOs on the National Health Service (NHS) was estimated from the document on payments by result tariffs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1875974212465549">8</xref></sup> for admitted patient care released by the Department of Health for the year 2011 and compared to the cost of pharmacological alternatives.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Ten patients who underwent BSCO were included in the study. Their mean age was 76.4 years (range 72 to 85). The disease stage ranged from T2 to T4 and the median PSA level at diagnosis was 93 (range 26 to 4557). Bone metastasis was detected in six patients. Four patients underwent a simultaneous channel transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) at the time of their BSCO. Two patients with Gleason 3+3 disease had BSCO performed as deferred treatment because of increasing PSA. All 10 patients had their pre-castration, second- and fourth-hour post-castration ST levels tested. Of the 10 patients, two also had their sixth-hour post castration ST levels checked (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1875974212465549">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>BSCO was first described in 1942,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1875974212465549">9</xref></sup> and is as effective as total orchidectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1875974212465549">10</xref></sup> The survival and effectiveness of BSCO is equivalent to LHRH agonists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1875974212465549">11</xref></sup> When critical metastatic disease is detected, the need for rapid control of disease is self-evident. The mean half-life of testosterone as per this study was 67 minutes. Previous studies have shown that ST would reach castrate levels from two to 12 hours after orchidectomy and have shown similar half-life values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1875974212465549">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1875974212465549">13</xref></sup> The pharmacokinetics of any substance in elimination loses 95% of its quantity in five half-lives and 99% in seven half-lives. The rate of decline of ST in the first two hours is similar to the overall decay rate.</p>
<p>The EAU guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1875974212465549">2</xref></sup> 2012 recommend immediate (within <italic>six</italic> weeks) hormonal treatment in patients with asymptomatic metastatic malignancy to prevent serious disease progression-related complications. Although there is no evidence to suggest that rapid castration is of any measurable advantage over anti-androgen-covered LHRH agonists in controlling/preventing acute complications, the risk-to-benefit considerations would dictate this urgency. Moreover, a small percentage of patients on LHRH agonists fail to achieve or maintain castrate levels of ST in the first three months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1875974212465549">14</xref></sup> For patients at risk of cord compression, hormonal means other than LHRH agonists with anti-androgen cover have been recommended in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1875974212465549">15</xref></sup> In the absence of substantial evidence regarding the adverse effects of the testosterone surge (flare phenomenon) and delay in reaching castrate levels, the use of LHRH agonists with pre-injection anti-androgen cover continues to be the popular option. Suppression of flare effect and ability to cause castrate levels of testosterone in 72 hours make LHRH antagonists a valid alternative in the acute setting. The need for further evidence and the monthly formulation have been stated as the caveats in the long-term use of LHRH antagonists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1875974212465549">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Psycho-social considerations have been stated as factors affecting the patient’s choice of treatment. The patients with critical metastatic disease, who would potentially benefit from rapid control of the cancer activity, are more likely to choose the fastest effective therapy. Most quality-of-life studies seem to favour BSCOs, with reports of patients experiencing better quality of life,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1875974212465549">16</xref></sup> higher quality-adjusted survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1875974212465549">17</xref></sup> and less worry and physical discomfort, and are more likely to feel ‘free of cancer’ than those on LHRH agonists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1875974212465549">18</xref></sup> Avoiding repeated out-patient visits for injections is a fringe benefit for those with advanced disease or poor general status. The percentage of patients who choose the surgical option has declined in the past two decades,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1875974212465549">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1875974212465549">19</xref></sup> but the evidence regarding ‘the well-informed’ patient’s choice is lacking. The decline could be due to an array of factors such as the option not being offered, fitness for anaesthesia, logistics of theatre time and bed occupancy, etc. The ideal candidate is a patient who has been deemed suitable for continuous ADT and adequately counselled regarding irreversibility of BSCO and non-surgical alternative options. The patient needs to be made aware that the procedure does not result in an empty scrotum and prevents the need for repeated out-patient visits for treatment. The irreversibility of the surgical option should become a consideration only if intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) becomes routine practice in the future. In current practice, IAD is used in a minority of patients as an option for those with biochemical progression and generally not considered for those with advanced or symptomatic disease. Therefore, these two treatment options are very unlikely to be suitable for the same patient. In younger patients and patients suitable for IAD, the BSCO can be a delayed option when continuous ADT becomes relevant.</p>
<p>The cost of hormonal treatment of prostate cancers is roughly two-thirds of the total cost of prostate cancer management and is almost entirely from the use of LHRH agonists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1875974212465549">20</xref></sup> The economic advantage of treatment by BSCO when compared to other forms of hormone manipulation has been recognised in the past,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1875974212465549">21</xref></sup> and the cost-effective advantage of BSCOs over long-term LHRH agonist treatment has been recognised in various currencies and health care systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1875974212465549">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1875974212465549">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1875974212465549"/>– <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1875974212465549">24</xref></sup> The survival period needed to realise the economic benefit was nine months in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1875974212465549">21</xref></sup> and two years in Norway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1875974212465549">16</xref></sup> The cost of a BSCO on the NHS is comparable to the cost of one year’s worth of LHRH agonists or antagonists without including the cost of delivery. Therefore BSCO would be an economical option for any patient with more than one year of life expectancy. A study comparing the cost effectiveness of different treatment options concluded that for men who can accept it, bilateral orchidectomy is the most cost-effective form of hormonal treatment providing a higher quality-adjusted survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1875974212465549">17</xref></sup> In addition to saving the patient multiple out-patient visits for treatment, the procedure will also cut the logistical cost of delivery. As stated by Zeliadt and Penson: ‘It is essential that we address the weaknesses in our understanding of the economic consequences of therapies for prostate cancer and find ways to include economic information into the process of determining optimal therapy’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1875974212465549">25</xref></sup></p>

<p>Four of the 10 patients in the study group had channel TURP procedures under the same anaesthetic episode. When combined with another essential hospital admission or procedure under anaesthesia, the cost would be considerably reduced as the charges apply to the most expensive among multiple procedures, which in this case would be the TURP. This can also apply to patients who are already on LHRH agonists who undergo other urological procedures under anaesthesia and could be offered the option of BSCO as a combined procedure. Combining the BSCO with other planned operations on patients already on LHRH agonists will not only be cost effective but <italic>will</italic> give the patient a second opportunity to consider the surgical option. The trend to avoid the surgical option in the NHS is probably more due to the logistics of waiting lists.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Testosterone has a short half-life and reaches castrate levels within hours of the BSCO procedure. In patients with critical metastatic disease, rapid castration by BSCO would be the ideal standard of care and should be routinely offered as a treatment option when ADT is intended. BSCO as an inpatient in the NHS, in patients with more than one year of life expectancy, is economically beneficial.</p>
