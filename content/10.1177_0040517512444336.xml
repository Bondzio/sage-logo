<abstract>
<p>The long-term monitoring of biophysiological signals requires new types of sensor systems that are wearable and at the same time convenient for the users. This paper describes the design of a novel garment-based sensing system for the long-term monitoring of breathing rhythm. The system concept was realized in a prototype garment, integrated with coated piezoresistive sensors. The prototype garment was tested by five subjects, and compared with a standard piezoelectric respiratory belt. Each signal was quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated in the time and frequency domain to make sure that no medical and diagnostic information was lost. The results showed a good agreement between the garment-based sensors and the standard reference, where errors occurred only when the breathing rate was extremely high. The garment-based sensor system could also distinguish the predominance breathing compartment (chest versus abdominal breathing). The system could detect a 10 s pause in breathing, which could be of importance in studies of sleep apnea. A garment-based sensing system maintains the accuracy of the signal quality without reducing the comfort for the user. It makes possible long-term ambulatory monitoring and has home-based healthcare applications.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0040517512444336" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The task of integrating biophysiological sensors into clothing is a growing research area aimed at improving e-health services. E-health services facilitate access to healthcare; patients with heart problems can be monitored with a system that alerts their doctor if their condition changes, and still allows them to continue their daily lives. In such systems, new types of sensors play an essential role, since the systems need to be wearable and at the same time convenient for the user. Advances in novel textile materials and structures as well as in communications technology have opened the way for a new generation of healthcare systems. The integration of intrinsic sensing functions into textile structures is an elegant way to measure the environment, and the use of textile sensors has been presented in several research projects. The most common ones are sensors monitoring physiological parameters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512444336">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512444336">3</xref></sup> Sensors integrated into clothing are considered to be particularly attractive for wearable interfaces, due to their soft, pliable and washable characteristics.</p>
<p>The monitoring of breathing has the potential to benefit the medical field as a cost-effective and non-invasive diagnostic tool for the early detection and prevention of serious illness. The interpretation of the breathing pattern provides rich information for clinical and diagnostic treatment. For example, a sudden pause in a continuous breathing indicates a sleep disorder problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512444336">4</xref></sup> and the relative contributions of the rib cage and abdominal compartments provide information on respiratory muscle fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512444336">5</xref></sup> Further, the breathing pattern provides important information in stress studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512444336">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the conventional monitoring of breathing, a direct spirometic method is used. This method requires a mouthpiece or a mask in order to measure the volume change of the lung. Such items are uncomfortable to the users in a long-term situation and do not allow monitoring outside the medical institutions. According to Konno and Mead,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512444336">7</xref></sup> the chest wall has two moving parts: the rib cage (RC) compartment and abdomen (ABD) compartment, and the volume change of the lung is equal to the sum of the volume changes of the rib cage and abdominal compartments (<italic>V = V<sub>RC</sub> + V<sub>ABD</sub></italic>). This implies that sensors placed on the chest and abdomen can indicate the volume change of the lung and thus be an alternative to the spirometic method. In practice, there are three different methods of non-invasively measuring the breathing rate: changes in electrical impedance, changes in electrical inductance and piezoelectric changes. The electrical impedance is measured using two or four electrodes attached to the skin. A weak alternating electrical current is passed through the electrodes and the human body, allowing the body impedance to be measured. During inhalation and exhalation, the body cross-section changes and the impedance thus changes. A critical issue in the measurement of electrical impedance is that the frequency range may interfere with other electrical equipment in the environment. In addition, this method yields a non-linear signal and is useful only as a qualitative measure of chest or abdominal movement. Changes in electrical inductance are measured using a loop of wires around the chest and/or abdomen. The measurement of inductance results in an accurate linear signal, which represents the change in the body cross-sectional area. However, the placement of the sensor is crucial; the actual cross-section change of the chest or the abdomen can be changed or restricted if the sensor is placed tightly or loosely. In piezoelectric measurements, the response from a piezoelectric sensor, mounted around the chest or abdomen, is used to record the breathing rate. This method is simple and inexpensive. However, the sensor is sensitive to any mechanical pressure, and a change in body position can lead to a false signal.</p>
<p>Using smart garment is an alternative to conventional systems. Since the 1990s, the first generation of smart garments were reported in US patents, (e.g. US patent US5295490,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512444336">8</xref></sup> US6450168<sup>9</sup> and US5454376<sup>10</sup>). However these systems were mainly made by assembling conventional electronics into the garments. One of the first successful smart garment systems where the textile electrodes were used was made in the EU project WEALTHY<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512444336">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512444336">12</xref></sup> in 2005. In this system four impedance pneumography electrodes were placed in a thoracic position to monitor the breathing frequency. The Myheart,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512444336">13</xref></sup> Proetex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512444336">14</xref></sup> and Ofseth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512444336">15</xref></sup> projects also attempted to obtain breathing signals with piezoresistive sensors or optical fibres. In the Myheart project, a piezoresistive sensor made of knitted piezoresistive fabric (KPF) was produced. A qualitative comparison with commercial respiratory transducers was made by visual inspection, and the result showed that there was an agreement between the knitted sensors and the commercial transducer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512444336">16</xref></sup> In the Ofseth project, another type of sensing element was used by integrating optical fibres into textile structures. Using this method, the electrical noise is effectively eliminated, but the manufacture and the maintaince of the system become more complex.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the use of various textile structures as breathing sensors has been reported as a substitute for conventional sensors. Although textile-based sensors are seen as attractive, due to their soft and washable characteristics, the flexibility of the material also causes signal disturbances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512444336">1</xref></sup> In a laboratory situation, where each sensor is tested as a single element, this is not as critical as in a user scenario, where the sensor is integrated into a garment and worn by different users in different activities. Signal noise due to motion artefacts has earlier been reduced in heart rate monitoring using a multi-channel method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512444336">1</xref></sup> Besides signal processing there are other techniques that could improve the sensor performance, such as the integration of the sensor and the garment design. These challenges are rarely mentioned or reflected in earlier studies, but knowledge of the whole smart textile system is decisive for a better understanding and development in the smart textile area.</p>
<p>In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a garment-based sensing system for monitoring breathing activity compared with a commercial piezoelectric sensor. The concept was achieved in a prototype garment integrated with two piezoresistive sensors placed on two different moving parts of the body in order to overcome posture artefacts. The prototype garment was worn by different test persons in a continuous respiratory monitoring application. To assess the validity of the performance, we qualitatively and quantitatively compared the signals collected from the prototype garment with those from reference belt.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0040517512444336"><title>Piezoresistive fabric sensor development</title>
<p>The piezoresistive fabric sensor used in this project was produced with a coating of conductive silicone on an elastic textile substrate. The conductive silicone was made of silicone rubber filled with carbon-black particles (ELASTOSIL® LR 3162), and it was commercially available from Wacker Chemie AG (Munich, Germany). The textile substrate was a double-faced elastic knitted fabric, 95% PES (Supplex) and 5% Lycra, which holds good elastic properties and an ability to recover in form which is important for good sensor sensibility. The application of the conductive layer was applied with the knife-over-roll<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512444336">17</xref></sup> laboratory coating equipment. The size of the whole testing strap was 100 mm × 25 mm, and the effective coated area was 100 mm × 10 mm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040517512444336"><title>Prototype garment development</title>
<p>A prototype garment was used to monitor the breathing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512444336">Figure 1</xref>). The garment was developed with a focus on accuracy of fit, integration of sensors and protected data transmission. Accuracy of fit should ensure accurate sensor performance by a rather tight fit to the body and at the same time be comfortable to the user. Hook-and-loop fasteners with the brand name Velcro were used in the shoulder and side positions. The special design makes the garment easy to wear. The side Velcro also guaranteed a customized tight fit on different users in order to ensure the high sensitivity of the sensor.

</fig></p>
<p>The two piezoresistive fabric sensors were placed on the chest and abdominal positions respectively. The sensors were coated directly on a front pattern to permit future adjustments and refinement of the sensor performance by adjusting material combinations in the construction.</p>
<p>Conductive yarns (Shieldex® 235f34 dtex 4-ply HC, Statex) were connected to the sensors and used as data transmission wires. In order to protect the wires from abrasion and humidity, the conductive yarns were integrated into the braiding as a core and piped into the seams of the vest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512444336">Figure 2</xref>). All conductive yarns were assembled on the right-hand bottom of the garment and three snap buttons were used as the interface between the garment and the portable electronic box.

<sec id="sec5-0040517512444336"><title>Reference sensor</title>
<p>A piezoelectric sensor, EZ-Resp belt and EZ-Amp (EPM Systems, Midlothian, VA), was chosen as a reference sensor in order to evaluate and validate the performance of the garment-based sensors. The belt consisted of a piezoelectric transducer mounted on an elastic band. The sensor records the micro-length change and converts it into an electrical voltage change. The sensor is widely used in sleep monitoring and intensive care units in hospitals, and it has an excellent performance as a standard for comparison. For all the measurements, the piezoelectric respiratory belt was placed between the two coated sensors as a reference. The correct tension is critical; the belt must be slightly tight at the maximum expiration.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0040517512444336"><title>Electromechanical property of the sensor</title>
<p>The electromechanical transduction property of the sensor was determined by a tensile tester. Since a well working sensor should have high sensitivity, a large working range and a high linearity over the entire working range. The change in resistance of the piezoresistive fabric sensor was measured and recorded as a function of elongation. The test was done using a custom-designed electro-dynamic testing system made by the School of Engineering at the University of Borås.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512444336">18</xref></sup> The device has a fixed end and a moveable end, which has a variable speed between 5 mm/s and 50 mm/s. The length of the whole testing device is 400 mm, and 64 different steps can be customized by varying the speed and position of the moveable end.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0040517512444336"><title>Testing of prototype garment</title>
<p>Breathing movements lead to changes in the circumference of the rib cage and the abdominal compartments. The circumference change creates a signal modulated between maximum and minimum resistance which could be measured as the voltage difference across the sensors. In order to measure the output signal from the sensor, a voltage divider circuit connected to a 9 V battery was developed and attached to the garment. The output signal was collected by a data acquisition (DAQ) device from National Instruments (NI). The DAQ device amplified and converted analogue signals to digital signals, so that the signals could be transferred to a personal computer for further data processing. A LabVIEW program was developed to record and visualize the signal data in graphical waveform in order to be able to analyse and monitor the breathing patterns in real time. The system is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512444336">Figure 3</xref>.

<sec id="sec9-0040517512444336"><title>Breathing manoeuvres</title>
<p>The prototype garment was tested by five subjects, three females and two males, aged between 25 and 45 years (average 35 years). All subjects were asked to put on the prototype garment and tightly fix the Velcro in order to ensure that there was a pre-stretch of about 2%. The subjects were then requested to manipulate their breathing pattern and keep the breathing rhythm for some minutes. The signal was recorded after a few minutes without the subjects being informed. The test persons were instructed to follow a sequence of breathing manoeuvres as below:
<list id="list1-0040517512444336" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Breathing normally for three minutes in an upright position;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Breathing normally while reading a book for twenty minutes in a sitting position;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Breathing rapidly for one minute in an upright position;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Breathing slowly for one minute in an upright position;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Breathing normally three times and then holding the breath for approximately 10 s in the supine position (apnea simulation).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In addition, to verify that the sensors were able to distinguish the predominated breathing compartment, the subjects were trained to apply chest dominated breathing in the upright position and abdomen dominated breathing in the supine position for one minute respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0040517512444336"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>To study the electromechanical transduction property of the fabric sensor, the characteristic curve of the fabric sensor was determined by plotting the fractional increase in electrical resistance value <italic>(ΔR/R</italic>) against the strain value (<italic>ε = ΔL/L</italic>). The linear range was defined as the strain interval in which the resistance behaviour of the sensor was linear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512444336">19</xref></sup> This interval was calculated by means of a linear regression analysis, and the coefficient of determination (r<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512444336">2</xref></sup>) was estimated.</p>
<p>For the garment-based sensing system, firstly, Pearson’s correlation was studied to verify the agreement between the garment-based sensors and the reference piezoelectric belt. The correlation was also calculated to investigate if the sensors placed on the chest and abdomen positions were synchronized. Since the test was done on five subjects, both the mean value and standard deviations were considered. Secondly, the response time of the garment-based sensors were compared with that of the reference belt by means of cross-correlation to determine if there was any delay between the sensors on the prototype garment. Thirdly, power spectra of all the recorded signals were determined using the fast fourier transform (FFT) method, in order to check the accuracy of monitoring of the average breathing frequency. Finally, the root mean square (RMS) of the amplitudes from both sensors placed on the garment was calculated to verify that the garment-based sensors could be utilized to differentiate the chest dominated breathing with the abdomen dominated breathing. In addition, the apnea simulation was evaluated qualitatively.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512444336">Figure 4</xref> shows that the resistance of the sensor increased with increasing elongation. A possible explanation of this behaviour is that the distance between carbon-black filler particles increases with elongation so that the conductive path reduces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512444336">20</xref></sup> The curve is linear when the elongation is between 2% and 40%, and the coefficient of determination r<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512444336">2</xref></sup> is equal to 0.99.

Another observation was that the signal from the reference sensor picked up more noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512444336">Figure 7</xref>), which was probably caused by the high sensitivity of the piezoelectrical crystal in the reference sensor in combination with the very low breathing frequency (only 4 breaths/min). Still, this indicated that the garment-based sensors may be more suitable for the long-time monitoring in a real situation, in particular during night-time when the breathing frequency can be low.

<p>In many clinical situations, the instantaneous breathing frequency is more meaningful than the average breathing frequency. By calculating the cross-correlation of the response times in each peak between the garment-based sensors and the reference belt, we found that both sensors in the prototype garment have a slight delay in response time relative to the reference sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512444336">Figure 8</xref>). We also discovered that the length of delay depended on the breathing rate; slow breathing generated the longest delay (1 s), while fast breathing produced almost no delay in time (0.15 s). A large delay may lead to a misinterpretation of the breathing pattern, but the delay detected between the garment-based sensors and the reference sensor was rather low (≤1 sec). This delay does not affect the accuracy of measurements. However, we could not determine in which of the two sensor systems the delay was larger compared to the actual respiratory movements of the chest.

A visual inspection of the signals acquired from the five subjects indicated that there were neither false positives nor false negative peaks (i.e. no falsely detected breaths), found during normal breathing and slow breathing for all subjects.

<p>A general assumption is that the breathing manoeuvre consists of a balance between the upper and lower compartments of breathing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512444336">7</xref></sup> When the breathing is in balance, the percentages of upper and lower compartments of breathing should each be around 50%, a percentage that can vary in different situations. For example, in the upright position the rib cage compartment excursions predominate, whereas in the supine position the abdomen compartment contributes to more of the total breathing for the majority of healthy subjects. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0040517512444336">Figure 10</xref> shows the breathing patterns of a subject performing chest and abdomen dominated breathing respectively. It can be seen that in chest dominated breathing, the average signal amplitude collected from channel 1 (sensor placed in chest position) was larger than from channel 2 (sensor placed in abdomen position), and the opposite fact can be observed in abdomen dominated breathing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517512444336">Figure 11</xref> illustrates an overview of the percentages of the chest and abdomen compartments for all subjects, the percentage of the chest compartment is calculated by 100 × RMS<sub>ch</sub>/(RMS<sub>ch</sub> + RMS<sub>abd</sub>); while the percentage of the abdomen compartment is calculated by 100 × RMS<sub>ab</sub>/(RMS<sub>ch</sub> + RMS<sub>abd</sub>). Although two subjects (s2 and s5, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517512444336">Figure 11</xref>) failed to apply the chest dominated breathing, the results indicated that the garment-based sensors can be used to determine the predominated breathing compartment.

<sec id="sec17-0040517512444336"><title>Apnea simulation</title>
<p>Sleep apnea is a common disorder, characterized by brief interruptions of the breathing during sleep. These interruptions usually last for 10 s or more and occur repeatedly throughout the night. The interruption of breathing is the most distinguished symptom of sleep apnea, and if the interruptions happen too often, that may cause excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517512444336">23</xref></sup> Therefore, a sensor system is required to detect an interruption that lasts for more than 10 s. The system should be able to send the information to the doctor for further therapy. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0040517512444336">Figure 12</xref>, the apnea lasted from 30 to 40 s after the start of the recording; the lengths of these regions are almost the same, indicating that the sensors are sufficiently sensitive to detect the apnea.

<sec id="sec18-0040517512444336"><title>Conclusions and further research</title>
<p>In this project, we have developed a garment-based sensing system that was used to monitor the breathing frequency of a number of individuals, without interrupting their physical activity or general comfort for up to 20 min and from the previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512444336">20</xref></sup> we studied the sensor stability up to 2 weeks, which indicates that it is possible to monitor the breathing over a longer period of time. The results showed that the breathing in different circumstances can be successfully detected and monitored using the garment-based sensing system. The quality of the signals from the garment-based sensors shows very little deviation from the piezoelectric reference sensor. The overall construction of the system provides a good signal quality, combined with comfort and ease of use. In addition, combining two sensors positioned in different places on the garment has improved the signal qualities as well as detected the predominated breathing compartment. One limitation of the current garment-based sensing system is that movement artefacts cannot easily be eliminated: the sensor reacts not only to the breathing activity but also to posture changes, to bending of the torso and to vibrations of the body due to acceleration forces. Accurate data may only be reliably obtained in upright, sitting and supine postures. Further research should focus on reducing the movement artefacts, which can be done by further improvement of the signal-processing software and by a multi-channel solution where several sensor areas are integrated into the garment. The system is expected to be used for the ambulatory monitoring of breathing parameters, while a patient is awake, asleep and active. Therefore, clinical tests are another aspect to be considered, in which the system is evaluated in a larger testing population covering subjects of all ages and weight groups. Last but not least, the long-term performance of the garment-based sensing system should be investigated, since one apparent area for application of the garment-based sensors is the monitoring of breathing patterns over extended periods (e.g. in the study of patients with respiratory disorder diseases). By combining the system with modern wireless communication techniques, important data can be sent to medical centres in real time, home healthcare and monitoring applications of the system can be expected.</p>
