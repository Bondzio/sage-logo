<p>Infusion of soybean oil-based Intralipid is a major risk factor for parenteral nutrition (PN)–associated cholestasis that often occurs in infants treated with prolonged PN for short bowel syndrome. Parenteral fish oil–based lipid emulsion (Omegaven) has been reported to treat this condition, but it is not readily available in the United States and still requires a central venous catheter for administration. Enteral administration of Microlipid has been shown to decrease ostomy output and facilitate weight gain in infants with enterostomies. We describe 2 premature infants with short bowel syndrome who received early supplementation with enteral Microlipid and fish oil after bowel resection, and became independent of PN without cholestasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Short bowel syndrome (SBS) occurs following significant resection of small intestine, resulting in malabsorption and malnutrition. Necrotizing enterocolitis is the most common etiology for SBS in premature infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412472698">1</xref></sup> The incidence of SBS has been reported at 7 in 1000 very low birth weight infants and 11 in 1000 extremely low birth weight infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412472698">2</xref></sup> <bold>Nutritional support for infants with SBS is a great challenge.</bold> Although maximizing enteral nutrition is the primary goal of therapy, prolonged parenteral nutrition (PN) is often indicated because of the inability to provide adequate nutrition from enteral feeding. However, PN-associated cholestasis (defined as serum direct bilirubin level &gt;2 mg/dL) is a major complication of prolonged PN with intravenous lipid and is associated with high mortality and morbidity in infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412472698">3</xref></sup> Soy-based Intralipid (IL; Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL) is associated with cholestasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412472698">4</xref></sup> In addition, a decrease in IL administration leads to improved cholestasis, suggesting that IL infusion is one of the risk factors for PN-associated cholestasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412472698">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412472698">5</xref></sup> The use of fish oil (FO)–based fat emulsion (Omegaven, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) has emerged as treatment for PN-associated cholestasis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412472698">6</xref></sup> but it is neither readily available in the United States nor approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Microlipid (ML, Nestle Nutrition, Florham Park, NJ), containing safflower oil, is a rich source of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-6 PUFA) as seen in IL. Supplementing ML to the diet was found to decrease ostomy output and improve weight gain in premature infants with enterostomies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412472698">7</xref></sup> Elimination of IL combined with supplementation of enteral FO (n-3 PUFA) improved cholestasis in infants with SBS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412472698">5</xref></sup> We previously reported a new intervention of early supplementation with enteral ML and FO using an appropriate ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412472698">8</xref></sup> to prevent PN-associated cholestasis in the treatment of 2 premature infants with SBS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412472698">9</xref></sup> Here we demonstrate that this novel nutritional approach is repeatable in another 2 premature infants who had less residual bowel and a more complicated hospital courses than those previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412472698">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Case Reports</title>
<sec id="section3-1941406412472698">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A male infant was born at 34 weeks gestational age with a birth weight of 2179 g. He was prenatally diagnosed with duodenal atresia by ultrasound. A postnatal exploratory laparotomy on day of life (DOL) 2 found multiple small bowel atresias, which were resected. This resulted in a total of 38 cm of small bowel remaining (8 cm of jejunum, 10 cm of mid small bowel, and 20 cm of distal ileum). A jejunostomy (8 cm distal to ligament of Treitz) was created. Fourteen days after his bowel resection, continuous enteral feedings of maternal breast milk were initiated on DOL 16. He received 14 days of PN prior to the initiation of enteral feedings. Once tolerating enteral feeding at 20 mL/kg/d, enteral ML was started at 1 g/kg/d, then increased by 0.5 g/kg/d up to 2.5 g/kg/d; simultaneously the IL was decreased from 2 g/kg/d by 0.5 g/kg/d until off on DOL 23. The enteral FO (Major Fish Oil 500 mg, Major Pharmaceuticals, Livonia, MI) was started on DOL 19 at 0.25 g every 12 hours and increased to 0.5 g every 8 hours over the subsequent 2 days. On DOL 42, the first attempt at reanastomosis was aborted because of an abscess and adhesions in the small bowel. Extensive enterolysis was performed and a new jejunostomy (6 cm distal to ligament of Treitz) was created. On DOL 58, enteral feeding was restarted with an elemental formula, NeoCate, because of unavailability of maternal breast milk. The ML and FO were reinitiated on DOL 61 and 62, respectively. Ostomy output from DOL 16 until DOL 91 averaged 58.7 mL/kg/d. Although ostomy output volume and consistency limited the ability to discontinue PN, addition of ML and FO facilitated decreasing IL to 1 g/kg/d while still providing adequate essential fatty acids for growth and development. Reanastomosis occurred on DOL 91. Enteral feeding resumed on DOL 102 followed by reinitiating ML and FO. Feeding advancement after reanastomosis was limited because of frequent watery stools related to his SBS. Often infants with this severity of short bowel do not reach full enteral feedings during their hospitalization and are discharged on PN. However, remarkably, he reached full feeds on DOL 170 and his central venous catheter was removed on DOL 174. He was discharged home on DOL 202 on ad lib oral feeding with 27 calorie NeoCate plus some stage I baby food. He had normal liver function with neither cholestasis nor infection during his hospital stay.</p>

<sec id="section4-1941406412472698">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A male infant was born at weeks gestational age with a birth weight of 785 g. He received PN for 31 days, while feedings of maternal breast milk with human milk fortifier were advanced to full volumes. He was ad lib feeding for 11 days, prior to developing abdominal distension. He developed necrotizing enterocolitis with intestinal perforation on DOL 70 and was transferred to a facility with a pediatric surgery service. After 4 exploratory laparotomies, he lost all ileum, cecum, ileocecal valve, and half of ascending colon. The remaining 30 cm of jejunum was reanastomosed to his distal ascending colon. Fourteen days after his last surgery, on DOL 90, continuous enteral feedings of maternal breast milk were started at 10 mL/kg/d. At this time, enteral FO (Rugby Sea Omega 50, Rugby Laboratories, Inc, Corona, CA) was started with an initial dose of 0.5 g every 12 hours and was gradually increased to 0.5 g every 6 hours over the subsequent 24 days. The ML was initiated on DOL 93 at 1 g/kg/d and gradually increased by 0.5 g/kg/d up to 2.5 g/kg/d over the subsequent 6 days. The IL was started at 2 g/kg/d and decreased by 0.5 g/kg/d with each increase in ML and discontinued on DOL 99. Small volume bottle feedings of 3 mL thrice daily were initiated on DOL 100. He was made NPO on DOL 146 for bloody stools at which time IL was restarted. He received bowel rest for 4 days and feedings were resumed on DOL 150. Fish oil was resumed at previous dose of 0.5 g every 6 hours on DOL 152. ML was resumed on DOL 153 at 1 g/kg and advanced over 2 days to previous dose. IL was again stopped on DOL 155. The enteral feedings, including continuous and bottle feeding, were slowly advanced to full feeds on DOL 174, and the central venous catheter was removed on DOL 192. A gastrostomy tube was placed on DOL 179 to facilitate continuous feedings after discharge. He was discharged home on DOL 204 on full volume enteral feedings with a combination of continuous gastric tube feeding at 30 mL/h plus bottle feeding 35 mL every 4 hours with maternal breast milk fortified with EleCare powder to 24 calorie per ounce. From initiation of enteral feedings to discharge, his averaged weight gain was 20.2 g/d. He had normal liver function with neither cholestasis nor infection during his hospital stay.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for treating infants with SBS is to achieve the transition from PN to enteral nutrition. Long-term PN is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and financial costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412472698">3</xref></sup> Prevention of PN-associated cholestasis is of primary importance as high rates of mortality and morbidity occur in infants with PN-associated cholestasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412472698">10</xref></sup> IL, a soybean-based intravenous lipid emulsion, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PN-associated cholestasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412472698">4</xref></sup> The main goals of treatment for SBS include promoting intestinal adaptation, minimizing exposure to PN and IL, and maximizing enteral nutrition. Animal studies have shown that enteral feeding contributes significantly to intestinal adaptation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412472698">11</xref></sup> and long-chain fatty acids, especially long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) enhances intestinal adaptation in SBS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412472698">12</xref></sup> Concern for fat malabsorption in infants with SBS has led to the reluctance in advancing feedings and the wide spread use of elemental formulas when human milk is not available. These formulas contain less fat and LCPUFAs than human milk. In fact, premature human neonates are at a significant advantage for intestinal adaptation after bowel resection because of their continued rapid growth of the intestine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412472698">13</xref></sup> Since the intestine is continuing to grow, premature infants would appear to benefit from an increased amount of dietary fat to provide the enterocytes with sufficient fat supply for bowel growth and adaptation. However, in these case reports, bowel length was only assessed at the time of resection. Future research should include bowel length adaptation as a measure of the effectiveness of the intervention. Compared with carbohydrate and protein, fat is a larger molecule with the highest caloric density, thus it creates the least osmotic load. As a result, fat is unlikely to cause osmotic diarrhea, instead, it would increase the amount of calories absorbed.</p>
<p>N-3 and n-6 PUFAs are 2 groups of essential fatty acids necessary for the growth and development of neonates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412472698">8</xref></sup> ML is enriched with n-6 PUFA from safflower oil, and FO is the main source of n-3 LCPUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We provided these 2 premature SBS infants with both ML (n-6 PUFA) and FO (n-3 LCPUFA) at a very early stage of feeding to not only maintain a balance of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412472698">8</xref></sup> that is, ML (n-6 PUFA):FO (n-3 PUFA) 3.75-5:1 in these 2 cases but also to promote postresection intestinal adaptation. The starting dose of FO was based on the human uterine accretion of DHA (50 mg/d).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412472698">14</xref></sup> The maximum dose of FO was determined based on data that DHA ≤315 mg/d appears safe in breastfed infants 1 to 6 months old when fed a human milk diet with DHA content at high end of normal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412472698">15</xref></sup> In case 2, the infant received a higher dose of DHA than case 1 because of the change in our facility’s fish oil product vendor (from Major Fish Oil 500 mg to Rugby Sea Omega 50). Both brands of FO are USP certified. No adverse effects were noted with the higher dose of DHA.</p>
<p>Both infants tolerated early supplementation of enteral ML and FO without increasing ostomy output, allowing us to decrease the use of IL. The average total dietary fat intake after eliminating IL was 5.6 g/kg/d in case 1 and 6.8 g/kg/d in case 2, which meets the fat intake goal of 5-7 g/kg/d as <bold>recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for the growth and development of a well preterm infant.16</bold> Both infants also tolerated enteral feeds well and maintained appropriate growth before and after reanastomosis. In addition, both infants had normal liver function, and they developed neither PN-associated cholestasis nor infection during their hospitalization. Both went home on full enteral feedings without a central venous catheter.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the early supplementation of enteral ML and FO, is a simple, inexpensive, and noninvasive nutritional approach. It expedited the discontinuation of intravenous IL, decreasing the risk of developing PN-associated cholestasis while providing the necessary enteral nutrition to promote growth and intestinal adaptation in premature infant with SBS. These authors recognize other factors may also have contributed to the prevention of cholestasis in the case studies. One variable could include aggressive advancement of enteral feedings. However, in infants with significant bowel resection, as in these cases, prolonged PN with inability to advance enteral feedings is common. We theorize that starting FO and ML supplementation early during the advancement of feedings in infants with SBS facilitates the discontinuing of PN preventing PN-associated cholestasis. Therefore, the effectiveness of this intervention should be researched.</p>
