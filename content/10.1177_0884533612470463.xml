<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: In 2005, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism released guidelines for the use of pediatric parenteral nutrition (PN). The purpose of this study was to compare PN prescribing patterns in preterm infants with current guideline recommendations. <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>: Six neonatologists in Germany conducted observational, retrospective medical chart reviews on preterm infants &lt;28 days postnatal, hospitalized from October 2009 to April 2011. Infants with a complete medical record who received PN for a minimum of 4 days were enrolled. Patient weight and the change in daily amino acids and intravenous fat emulsion (IVFE) doses administered for the first 7 days of life were abstracted. Median data were used to determine quartiles to compare study results with the current guidelines. <italic>Results</italic>: Only 30% of patients met current guidelines that recommend all preterm infants receive amino acids on the first day of life. When amino acids were given, the dose was lower than recommended in the current guidelines. The start of IVFE by day 3 of life was given only to 34% of patients despite the guideline recommendation of 100%. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: This study identified several gaps between the current guidelines and patient care that should be explored further.</p>

<p>Parenteral nutrition (PN) is critical for the care of neonates unable to tolerate oral or enteral feeding during this important growth period. PN for preterm infants is a highly complex combination of amino acids (AAs), carbohydrates, fat emulsions, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals that differs significantly from adult PN. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) has developed evidence-based guidelines for pediatric PN that suggest initiating PN shortly after birth in small preterm infants when it is clear that enteral feeds will not be tolerated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612470463">1</xref></sup> The recommendation is based on the premise that starvation for just 1 day in the small preterm neonate may be detrimental. Starting parenteral AAs together with glucose from the very first postnatal day helps prevent hyperglycemia in this population. In general, infant weight, age, and individual circumstances are used to determine when PN should be initiated. The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) practice manual also recommends starting PN as sole-source or adjunct nutrition support within 24 hours of birth in infants who cannot be fed enterally, with nutrient doses varying based on condition and weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612470463">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since the 2005 ESPEN guidelines were released, there has been little information published on how well they have been adopted into clinical practice. In 2009, the German Society of Nutritional Medicine updated the ESPEN guidelines to provide additional information and guidelines for clinicians in Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612470463">3</xref></sup> In these guidelines, all premature infants &lt;35 weeks of pregnancy and critically ill term infants are recommended for full or partial PN with the gradual introduction and advancement of enteral nutrition (EN) as tolerated. Some full-term infants with gastrointestinal tract motility, absorptive, and gut barrier integrity derangements may develop necrotizing enterocolitis or other serious illnesses. These infants may be unable to tolerate adequate amounts of EN until their clinical conditions improve and will require immediate PN in most cases.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying the indication for PN use, the ESPEN and German guidelines provide specific dosing ranges for energy, glucose, AAs, fat emulsions, vitamins, and minerals. With limited studies in pediatric patients, data from adult studies were used to help establish parameters for these nutrients. AA administration in preterm infants is recommended to start on the first postnatal day at a dose of 1.5 g/kg/d to prevent a negative nitrogen balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612470463">3</xref></sup> A.S.P.E.N. guidelines are similar, suggesting an initial dose of 1.5–2.0 g/kg/d in extremely low-birth-weight neonates, with slightly lower doses for septic infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612470463">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The postnatal day for starting intravenous fat emulsion (IVFE) is less specific in the guidelines since intolerance may be a factor, especially in premature infants weighing &lt;1000 g. Continuous IVFE vs intermittent infusion has been shown to improve tolerance in this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612470463">4</xref></sup> A minimum linoleic acid intake of 0.25 g/kg body weight is recommended<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612470463">3</xref></sup> in premature infants to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), which can be shown biochemically to occur after only a few days without IVFE. A.S.P.E.N. guidelines recommend an initial IVFE dose of 1–2 g/kg/d in preterm infants, with a goal dose of 3 g/kg/d. Lower doses are suggested for patients with hyperbilirubinemia, sepsis, and severe respiratory distress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612470463">2</xref></sup> At present, little is known about the clinical practice of pediatric PN in Germany, especially the start day for macronutrients (ie, AAs and IVFE) and the amounts provided, to know if they are aligned with guidelines. The present study conducted a review of medical charts for preterm infants in Germany. The purpose was to compare PN prescribing patterns with current guideline recommendations. These findings are expected to increase awareness of the current trends in pediatric PN prescribing in Germany.</p>
<sec id="section1-0884533612470463" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>An observational, retrospective medical chart review was conducted in early 2011 across Germany. Six neonatologists representing 6 diverse institutions (2 large teaching hospitals, 1 children’s hospital, 2 regional teaching hospitals, and 1 community hospital) were recruited to act as study investigators with responsibility for patient selection and chart data abstraction. Neonatologists were included if they had a minimum of 2 years in clinical practice and had cared for at least 6–8 hospitalized neonates on PN during the 12 months prior to study launch. Note that although the neonatologists were required to treat this minimum number of patients on PN, these patients did not necessarily represent the patients enrolled.</p>
<p>This study was conducted in accordance with International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology (ISPE) Guidelines for Good Epidemiology Practices and all applicable regulatory requirements. As a retrospective chart review study, no personal patient identifiers were collected. Informed consent was not required from individual patients under internal review board exemption status. The physician investigators, who provided data from their own hospital, followed their internal institution requirements for ethics review.</p>
<p>Data on all preterm infants &lt;28 days postnatal who received PN, hospitalized from October 2009 to April 2011, were screened. The study investigators enrolled patients who received PN for a minimum of 4 days and who had a medical record that included complete patient demographics, treatment information, PN administration details, and adverse events experienced during hospitalization. Preterm infants were not eligible if they were enrolled in any clinical trial related to PN or transferred to or from another facility within 72 hours of birth.</p>
<p>Data from the first 7 days of life were abstracted, including the patient weight and the change in AAs and IVFE doses administered by day. The change in patient weight over time, change in macronutrient composition over time, and change in macronutrient doses were analyzed separately. Median data were used to determine quartiles to compare study results with the current guidelines.</p>

<title>Patient Weight</title>
<p>There were 191 medical records eligible for abstraction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612470463">Table 1</xref>). On day 1, 10% of patients weighed less than 870 g, 50% patients weighed between 1245 and 1785 g, and 10% of neonates weighed more than 2 kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612470463">Figure 1</xref>). Over the next 7 days, median patient weight began to drop on day 3, reached a median of 1410 g on days 5 and 6, and began to increase on day 7. Patients in the lowest 10th percentile of weight saw the decline of weight occur on day 2 and recovery on day 4, whereas patients in the 90th percentile trended similar to the median.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This retrospective chart review provides important information on the real-world use of PN among preterm infants in Germany. Our study is different from prior studies on pediatric PN practice, which surveyed hospital professionals to understand pediatric PN practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612470463">5</xref></sup> Only 30% of patients met current ESPEN guidelines that recommend all preterm infants receive AAs on the first day of life. The majority of patients (92%) did not meet this guideline until day 3 of life. Overall AA doses were also lower than guideline recommendations. Median AA doses only reached 1.4 g/kg/d on day 6, despite the recommendation to give 1.5 g/kg/d AAs on the first postnatal day.</p>
<p>A greater deviation from guidelines was realized in the administration of IVFE. Since several different types of IVFE products are available in Europe, each with different concentrations of essential amino acids, this study was unable to calculate the dose of linoleic acid administered based on the gram dose of IVFE to compare with guideline recommendations. However, we do know that the use of IVFE varied greatly, as demonstrated by the start day. Only 72% of patients received IVFE on day 4 of life. By day 7, fewer patients were receiving PN overall, but a greater proportion were receiving IVFE. These data suggest that IVFE were eventually prescribed when it became apparent the patients needed to remain on PN beyond a few days. However, there was a risk of developing EFAD in the IVFE-free patients. More than 21% of the patients on PN never received a source of IVFE which varied by day of therapy. Essential fatty acids are indispensable for cell membrane synthesis in the retina, brain, and other neural tissues in preterm infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612470463">6</xref></sup> Although the clinical consequences of EFAD in adults will manifest initially with dermal symptoms, the consequences of deficiency in neonates are less well defined but may be associated with cognitive development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612470463">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The misalignment between PN use in neonates and guideline recommendations was previously recognized by Grover et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612470463">5</xref></sup> in 2008. A survey of neonatal pharmacists in the United Kingdom found that only 25% of neonates received full PN by day 7 of therapy. They also found that although 39% of neonates received IVFE on day 1, another 23% delayed the start of IVFE until day 3 or day 4. Although these findings suggest that a greater number of patients are started on IVFE on day 1 compared with our results, the trend in delaying and omitting IVFE from therapy is similar between the 2 studies.</p>
<p>Another study to identify the gap between neonatal PN prescribing and guideline recommendations was reported by Lapillonne et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612470463">7</xref></sup> in 2009. In their survey of neonatal departments, more than half of the respondents did not start protein on the first day of life. When protein was started, the initial dose was only 1g/kg/d, 33% lower than recommended. More than half of the respondents did not initiate IVFE until after day 3 of life.</p>
<p>Our study, as well as those previously published, highlights the gap between the current guidelines and clinical practice. Since patient outcomes were not studied in conjunction with these clinical practice observations, it is impossible to determine which is more appropriate. The rationale behind the prescribing decisions is equally unavailable, leading to speculation that either intolerance or concerns of intolerance were the driving factor behind the nutrient doses. When given in excess, AAs can lead to an elevation in serum urea nitrogen and ammonia, especially in the neonate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612470463">8</xref></sup> Excess glucose leads to hyperglycemia and the risk for osmotic diuresis, another neonatal concern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612470463">8</xref></sup> The acute phase of respiratory distress and other life-threatening conditions have been reported to delay the start of IVFE until day 3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612470463">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of interest in our data was the difference in recovery of weight loss compared with data published by Ehrenkranz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612470463">9</xref></sup> Our finding showed that patients in the lowest 10% demonstrated both weight loss and weight recovery on day 6, 1 day sooner than the median. Ehrenkranz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612470463">9</xref></sup> reported that the mean age for regaining weight was significantly lower in patients with the lowest birth weight, and many of those patients did not return to their birth weight until after 18 days. Similarly, data used to develop growth curves for very low-birth-weight infants estimated about 14 days to recover birth weight in patients &lt;1500 g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612470463">10</xref></sup> The unknown variable between these findings is the amount of nutrition provided.</p>
<p>A limitation of this study was the lack of data gathered on EN intake. It was assumed that attempts were made to advance EN in patients receiving PN. Whether or not doses of parenteral nutrients were adjusted during enteral advancement was not evaluated. Although the use of PN was clearly documented, glucose concentration was not always collected. This prevented an analysis of the overall energy provided to patients to determine if they were indeed underfed, as suggested by the lack of IVFE. In addition, data relating to patient outcome and duration of PN therapy were not gathered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0884533612470463" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The administration of PN in neonates in Germany differs from the current guidelines, particularly in the day of start for AAs and IVFE and the dose of both these nutrients. Although this observation does not suggest that either the guideline or the care provided to these patients is inappropriate, the gap should be explored. A better understanding of how PN doses are adjusted when EN is advanced would help to narrow the gap. Further study on patient outcomes related to the day of starting AAs and IVFE as well as the doses used would also be helpful in determining if the guidelines are appropriately aligned.</p>
