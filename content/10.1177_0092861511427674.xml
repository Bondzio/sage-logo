            <p>This study compared the assessment models and the regulatory review processes conducted in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. A questionnaire was completed by the 7 GCC regulatory authorities (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates [UAE], and Yemen) providing details of the regulatory review processes and timelines in the region. The results showed that Kuwait, Qatar, and Yemen use the verification model; Bahrain and Oman use an abridged review; and Saudi Arabia and UAE conduct a full review. There were 3 common phases in the GCC regulatory review process: submission, evaluation, and authorization. Key milestones within each phase were also common—receipt and validation, queuing, scientific assessment, sample analysis, sponsors’ interaction, pricing, and decision making—but target approval times and the order of some activities were different among the member states as some processes are performed in parallel rather than sequentially. The resulting similarities and differences provided an opportunity to propose a standardized regulatory review process for the GCC region.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Modern-day licensing began in the 1940s with the formation of the World Health Organization (WHO) recommending global standards to be established in relation to the safety and efficacy of medicinal products, as well as their labeling and advertising.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511427674">1</xref>
            </sup> However, there is little conformity between countries worldwide as to how the review is conducted, including what stages comprise the process, who carries out each stage, what criteria are employed, how long it takes, or, indeed, whether there is a formal review process at all. About 30% of WHO member states have only a very rudimentary drug regulatory authority or none at all, whereas only 20% are thought to have a well-developed drug registration system.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511427674">2</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Since the establishment of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981, the Gulf states have experienced major challenges in view of the rapid change in the regulatory environment around the world. However, because of their strategic importance and rich oil resources, they present significant potential for the growth of the pharmaceutical market, which encouraged the GCC authorities to establish their regulatory systems to cope with the pace of development in their individual markets.</p>
         <p>The 7 GCC states (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates [UAE], and Yemen) have encountered the need for regulatory reforms during the past 10 years to improve patients’ access to high-quality medicines throughout the region. Therefore, the 7 GCC review processes were evaluated with an emphasis on key milestones and common practices within the review process for each of the 7 GCC authorities to develop a standardized regulatory review process that can improve the consistency, competency, efficiency, and timeliness of the drug approval system in the region.</p>

            <title>Study Instrument</title>
            <p>A questionnaire was designed that enabled details of the regulatory review process to be determined in each of the 7 GCC states. A face-to-face meeting with the senior personnel from the region took place in Kuwait in 2010 to introduce the participating authorities to the research goals and objectives and to provide an overview of the contents of the questionnaire for collecting the data required for this study.</p>
            <p>All authorities were able to complete the questionnaire on time. The data were then standardized into a word document, and the resulting reports were sent to the authorities for auditing, correction, and comment. At the end of this month, the participating authorities were contacted by e-mail to confirm the accuracy of the information contained in the respective country reports.</p>
            <p>A general review process map based on procedures followed in “established” and “emerging” regulatory agencies<sup>

            <title>Regulatory Assessment Models</title>
            <p>To describe the assessment being carried out in each GCC state, the types of review models were classified as type 1, “verification review,” which requires that the new medicine should be approved in countries with advanced and competent regulatory authorities to ensure that a full reliable review has been conducted before it can be accessed by local patients; type 2, “abridged review,” which conserves resources by not reassessing scientific supporting data that have been reviewed and accepted elsewhere but includes an independent review of the product in terms of its use under local conditions; and type 3, “full review,” which requires the availability of qualified and multidisciplinary experts in various areas of the regulatory science field. The 3 types of assessment models were explored and the extent of the scientific reviews was examined for each GCC authority.</p>

            <title>Types of Assessment</title>
            <p>For all applications, Kuwait, Qatar, and Yemen perform a verification review. This is because they wish to conserve resources that would be required for a full review. Their main responsibilities are to ensure that the medicine is registered in 1 or more reference agencies and that the product characteristics, finished product specifications, and prescribing information conform to that agreed in the reference agency for local marketing. Oman performs only an abridged review as this still conserves resources by not duplicating the efforts made by reference agencies, but it also performs some independent review of the product in terms of its local conditions such as benefit-risk assessment and its use in local ethnic populations. Saudi Arabia (SFDA) performs only a full review because the authority has suitable resources that include the appropriate skills and expertise to fully evaluate the supporting scientific data. However, the SFDA still requires evidence of registration in reference agencies before the local authorization can be finalized. Bahrain and UAE perform 2 models of assessment depending on the type of product being registered. For biological and biotechnology products registered in reference agencies, Bahrain performs a verification review, as well as an abridged review for all other applications, whereas UAE conducts an abridged review on biological and biotechnology products, but for all other applications, it performs a full review.</p>

            <title>Extent of Scientific Assessment</title>
            <p>The GCC authorities were asked about their review processes, and the extent of scientific assessment was explored accordingly. The results showed that the 7 GCC regulatory authorities perform an extensive assessment of the chemistry and manufacturing control (CMC) data. In Oman, an extensive assessment is performed only when the product is not authorized in countries with reference agencies. In contrast, nonclinical and clinical data are assessed extensively in Saudi Arabia for all products, whereas they are only studied in detail in UAE for products that are not authorized by reference agencies.</p>

         <sec id="section8-0092861511427674">
            <title>Regulatory Review Processes</title>
            <p>The study examined 3 common phases in each of the 7 GCC regulatory review processes—namely, the submission phase, the evaluation phase, and the authorization phase.</p>
            <sec id="section9-0092861511427674">
               <title>Submission Phase</title>
               <p>The submission phase involves all the stages and processes carried out by the authorities’ administrative staff prior to the scientific assessment of the medicine. These include the receipt and validation stage and the queuing stage.</p>
               <sec id="section10-0092861511427674">
                  <title>Receipt and validation stage</title>
                  <p>The 7 authorities record the date of receiving the registration dossier, and 5 authorities carry out a validation process to ensure that the documents submitted for registration are complete before they can be accepted for review. Kuwait and Yemen accept the dossier for review and carry out the validation process as part of the scientific assessment stage where all questions, queries, and missing data are requested from the sponsor after completing the scientific review process. Nonetheless, all the GCC authorities request the availability of the initial basic registration requirements listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092861511427674">Figure 2</xref>. It is important to note that the patent protection status of the active ingredient is recognized in 6 authorities, whereas Yemen does not respect patent protection because of its lower gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the other Gulf states, which gave the government the mandate to allow patients’ access to affordable generic medicines and to prevent the monopoly of expensive medicines that are protected by patents.</p>

                  </fig>
                  <p>Furthermore, all the GCC authorities, except Qatar, apply fees for the registration of medicines. The range of fees varies significantly from country to country according to the funding structure and the services provided by each authority. It is agreed by all the authorities that to improve the regulatory review process, they need to improve their resources by increasing the number of expert reviewers, developing the information technology (IT) structure, and establishing training and continuing professional development (CPD) programs. However, without proper funding, the authorities will always face difficulties in improving their regulatory systems.</p>
                  <p>A considerable difference was observed in the perception and time taken to validate the registration dossier from one country to another, with UAE performing the validation process within 24 hours, whereas Bahrain takes up to 14 days. Kuwait, however, indicated that it is a time-consuming process, particularly when carrying out a simple verification assessment.</p>

               <sec id="section11-0092861511427674">
                  <title>Queuing stage</title>
                  <p>A queuing process was identified in all the Gulf authorities except Yemen. However, when the GCC authorities recognize the therapeutic urgency of a medicine, they carry out a priority review. Saudi Arabia expressed concerns in conducting priority reviews without having a set of guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOPs) that direct them toward appropriate decisions. The queuing time varies considerably across the Gulf region, ranging from 14 days in Bahrain and Oman to more than 180 days in UAE. However, for a medicine to remain in this stage for several months unjustifiably delays patients’ access to medicines.</p>

            <sec id="section12-0092861511427674">
               <title>Evaluation Phase</title>
               <p>The evaluation phase includes all the stages that involve the scientific assessment and quality control analysis carried out to ensure that the medicine is safe, effective, and of the desired quality standard to be given to patients. This phase consists of 3 stages that are common to the 7 GCC authorities: scientific assessment, sponsor’s interaction, and sample analysis stage.</p>
               <sec id="section13-0092861511427674">
                  <title>Scientific assessment stage</title>
                  <p>The scientific assessment stage is the major part of the regulatory review process where the product’s quality, safety, and efficacy dossier are evaluated. The starting date of the scientific assessment is generally recorded in most of the GCC states, except in UAE and Qatar, probably because the review process starts from the date of submission and ends at the date of granting the approval. Internal reviewers assess the quality, safety, and efficacy dossiers in 6 GCC states, whereas Yemen depends on external reviewers to provide a clinical opinion about the medicine. For a self-sufficient authority with a low fee structure in a country with a low GDP value ($58 billion) and a population of 23 million people,<sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861511427674">4</xref>
                     </sup> hiring internal reviewers would be costly and, therefore, employing external reviewers without a legal agreement between the 2 parties is the most appropriate cost-effective option for Yemen.</p>
                  <p>External reviewers are used in Kuwait for assessing clinical studies for selected new active substances (NASs). Oman hires external experts to provide advice on certain technical issues under no contractual agreement with the authority. Saudi Arabia has an expert panel that consists of 10 to 15 consultants who provide a detailed assessment report and recommendation to the authority’s staff. In general, investing time and resources to acquire skill sets using external assessors is advantageous as it may add a broader perspective to the GCC authorities and could also benefit the review process.</p>
                  <p>Five regulatory authorities in the Gulf region have scientific committees as part of their assessment process. Kuwait and Qatar do not have scientific committees, and the quality of the review report depends on the assessors’ experience and skills in evaluating the registration dossier. It is considered valuable by advanced regulatory authorities to have committees review the scientific assessment reports and make an appropriate recommendation about the final product approval decision as this provides in essence a peer-reviewed system that in turn adds to the quality and robustness of the review.</p>
               </sec>
               <sec id="section14-0092861511427674">
                  <title>Sponsor’s interaction stage</title>
                  <p>The sponsor’s interaction process is where communication occurs between the sponsor and the authority with regard to the registration of new medicines in each GCC State (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0092861511427674">Figure 3</xref>). Questions and queries arising during the scientific assessment are collected into a single batch to be sent to the sponsor by 6 of the GCC authorities. Yemen, however, communicates these questions to the sponsor as they arise during the assessment process. In Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and UAE, interaction with the sponsor is permitted with the internal staff under the supervision of the section manager, whereas Saudi Arabia has expressed concerns with regard to the logistics of the communication process, specifying the need for proper guidelines and SOPs on how to monitor sponsor-staff interactions. Qatar applies restrictions to the handling of the authority’s communication process with the sponsor and limits these interactions to official letters, e-mails, faxes, or scheduled meetings with senior managers only. Interaction and the ability to communicate effectively are necessary to maximize the value of this stage and its contribution to the review process.</p>

                  </fig>
                  <p>The sponsor’s response time varies significantly between the 7 GCC states, with the shortest time limit being 30 days enforced by the SFDA and the longest being approximately 365 days in Qatar. The clock-stop concept is perceived differently across the region. In Kuwait, for example, the authority does not enforce a limit for the response time, but if the sponsor fails to respond in 2 years, the authority ceases the registration process and returns the dossiers to the local agent. Subsequently, a new application is officially requested should the sponsor be still considering the product registration in Kuwait. Bahrain and UAE, however, do not have a clock system but target a specified limit for the response time. A clock stop is an important practice that has several advantages for the review process, including controlling the approval time, keeping the sponsor alert to the time limit and the consequences of delays, improving the interaction and follow-up practices, and minimizing the backlog problem.</p>

                  <title>Sample analysis stage</title>
                  <p>In general, the sample analysis stage is an essential part of the review process that affects the overall approval time for medicines in the 7 GCC authorities. It is carried out in parallel with the scientific assessment stage in some countries (Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Yemen) and after the scientific assessment in others (Bahrain and Kuwait). The outcome of the sample analysis affects the final approval decision.

                  <p>The Kuwait regulatory authority has a separate pricing department, and the pricing process goes in parallel with the registration procedure. Once the product is registered and the proposed price is calculated and compared against other products in the GCC region, the director of the authority presents the price to the pricing committee, chaired by the deputy minister of health to finalize the pricing decision, which subsequently is approved by the health minister.</p>
                  <p>The pricing step in other Gulf states is part of the regulatory review process, and registration committees are responsible for both the product registration and pricing decisions. Because of its political sensitivity, the medicines’ prices are approved by the minister of health in Kuwait, Qatar, and UAE and by the head of SFDA in Saudi Arabia.</p>
                  <p>It is important to evaluate the quality, safety, and efficacy of the medicinal product to protect the public health, but ensuring that the product price is affordable by local patients is another important aspect to be considered. Unfortunately, GCC authorities do not perform any cost-effectiveness analyses or value-based pricing for locally marketed medicines. They rely on comparative analyses of prices between countries within and outside the region, and pharmaceutical companies set prices to achieve a target profit margin in the region. A clear sense of value of a medicine being considered for marketing is an advantage during the negotiation process and could improve the access to quality medicines in the private sector at affordable prices.<sup>

                  <title>Approval stage</title>
                  <p>In general, most authorities do not perform separate negotiations about the product information or package insert after the scientific opinion is reached or prior to issuing the final approval. However, if issues require further clarification, they can be dealt with in official face-to-face meetings or by other appropriate means of communication with the company representative.</p>
                  <p>Bahrain, Qatar, and UAE were not able to specify their target approval times as several factors are involved in their judgments such as the types of products being registered (ie, whether they are NASs, EASs [existing active substances], or therapeutically important or lifesaving products), the quality of the submitted dossiers, and the level of follow-up and interaction between the pharmaceutical company and the authority. The other 4 authorities showed slight differences in their overall target approval times, with the shortest being in Oman (120 days). The time taken from reaching a positive opinion by the scientific committee to the final approval decision varies considerably across the region, taking less than 30 days in Kuwait, Oman, and Saudi Arabia; 90 days in Bahrain, Qatar, and UAE; and more than 180 days in Yemen. This is the time period to complete the final administrative procedures before granting the registration approval in each country.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The rationale for this study was to gain a better understanding of the GCC states’ regulatory review processes so that comparisons between these authorities can be made. A common ground for a standardized review process in the GCC region was generated by identifying the stages common in the GCC review processes and defining the most appropriate timeline for accomplishing each milestone efficiently and effectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0092861511427674">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

         </fig>
         <p>The validation process is the first contact between the sponsor and the regulatory authority. Although Kuwait and Yemen have a slightly different approach for implementing the validation process, it is considered necessary by the other 5 GCC authorities and certainly by advanced agencies such as the FDA and the EMA. Validation is an important step to ensure the correctness and completeness of the submitted data before entering the scientific assessment stage. However, it should not be a lengthy process and requires the use of an advanced IT system and the appropriate human resources specifically to complete the validation task successfully in a timely manner. However, if the application is incomplete, time is allocated for the sponsor to complete the missing data. The electronic submission minimizes the risk of there being missing data while the authority’s staff ensure that the submitted dossiers are complete and accurate. Therefore, by examining the current GCC validation times, it is possible to minimize steps that may cause unnecessary delays in the overall approval time. Therefore, 5 days should be sufficient depending on the number of submissions and the availability of human resources.</p>
         <p>Furthermore, depending on the clarity and specificity of the submission requirements, a maximum of 30 days would allow sufficient time for the sponsor to complete or amend the submitted data. The overall receipt and validation stage should be carried out according to established guidelines and SOPs as well as the availability of appropriate facilities and human resources to support the electronic submission and carry out the accurate and efficient validation process.</p>
         <p>The queuing process allows proper handling of the received registration dossiers in an organized fashion. However, the lack of regular monitoring of queue time could lead to a backlog. Managing the priority review is recognized by all the GCC authorities and should be dealt with according to established guidelines and SOPs that clearly specify the conditions under which products can be taken out of the queue for a priority review. Therefore, appropriate human resources and electronic handling should be provided to support accurate follow-up of the pending dossiers as well as priority reviews. It is suggested that 45 days should be the maximum queue time for standard reviews, and fast-track/priority products can be taken out of the queue.</p>
         <p>The scientific assessment stage is the major part of the review process. Therefore, it is essential to focus attention on providing the proper skill sets and the facilities as well as establishing appropriate guidelines, SOPs, training, and CPD programs to achieve the desired standard of review practices. However, there should be a rational time limit for the scientific assessment process, which includes the fundamental sections of the registration dossier assessed by internal and external reviewers—namely, the quality, safety, and efficacy sections. The GCC authorities sometimes perform in-depth scientific reviews, although, in general, they carry out abridged or verification reviews. Therefore, it is suggested that 180 days be allocated for a full review of safety and efficacy, 90 days might be appropriate for an abridged review, and 30 days should be adequate for a verification review. However, hiring sufficient experts, using suitable training and continuing educational programs, and establishing appropriate guidelines and the availability of facilities and information technology and resources to aid the review process require adequate funding to achieve the desired objectives of the review process.</p>
         <p>The sample analysis stage is a common practice and is performed either in parallel or sequentially with the scientific assessment in the GCC states. Even though no information was provided regarding the sample analysis timeline in the GCC authorities, there was a general agreement that it has a considerable impact on the overall approval time. However, having a time limit for the sample analysis stage can improve the handling of the analytical procedure to meet the target time with the required quality control test results. Furthermore, carrying out the quality control analysis in parallel with rather than after the scientific assessment would be a rational decision to avoid any impediment to timely patient access to the medicine. Therefore, a proposed 1-month time limit should be applied to complete the sample analysis for standard applications. After completing the scientific assessment and sample analysis procedures, the questions and queries should be collected into one batch to be sent to the sponsor. These questions, along with the scientific review reports from the external experts, internal reviewers, and quality control (QC) laboratories, and the batched questions should be presented to the scientific committee.</p>
         <p>Clock stop is another important approach that is not fully enforced in the GCC authorities but practiced in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia to control the overall approval time. The sponsor response time varies across the Gulf states, and after examining the time ranges, a target time of 90 days should be allowed for the sponsor to respond. It should be noted that the clock stop time will not be included in the overall authority’s assessment time.</p>
         <p>Although the pricing process has a significant impact on patients’ access time to medicines, it is considered a separate procedure from the review process. Advanced regulatory authorities have independent committees or units for the pricing of medicines. In Health Canada, for example, a specialized Medicines Pricing Board is responsible for determining the cost-effectiveness of appropriate products in Canada.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861511427674">6</xref>
            </sup> Therefore, the pricing process in the Gulf region should preferably be carried out in parallel to the review process rather than after granting the registration approval. After examination of the current pricing process in the Gulf states, a period of 100 days is proposed to allow sufficient time to complete the pricing step during the review process. The approval decision should then follow immediately after the availability of the pricing information.</p>
         <p>According to the proposed standardized GCC regulatory review process illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0092861511427674">Figure 4</xref>, an overall target approval time of 110 days for a verification review, 170 days for an abridged review, and 260 days for a full review is suggested. Therefore, the authorities should adjust their assessment processes according to the type of product and the model of review(s) they are conducting. In addition, if they were able to reduce their queue time of 45 days, then this would bring the Gulf states in line with Singapore, which is considered by many to be a model agency conducting all 3 reviews, with its target timelines being 90 days for verification, 180 for an abridged review, and 270 days for a full review.</p>
         <p>These timelines may be considered challenging when compared with the target approval times of 180 days in Kuwait for a verification review, 170 days in Oman for an abridged review, and 260 days in Saudi Arabia for a full review.</p>
