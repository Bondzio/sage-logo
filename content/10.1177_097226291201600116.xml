<p>The book is essentially aimed at the sales and marketing professionals who have to convince customers and make them buy their products from a competitive set. Thus, the focus is on understanding the ‘buy buttons’ in the customer’s brain.</p>
<p>The basic premise is that the complete human brain can be conceptualized to consist of three brains, the new, middle and the old. The book focuses on ‘marketing’ to the old brain as this is considered to be the final decision-maker as far as purchase decision goes. Thus the standard sales process of need satisfaction selling, which includes uncovering customer needs, supporting them with specific benefits and closing the sales is mapped on to the way the old brain functions.</p>
<p>The book starts with understanding the characteristics of the old brain. These characteristics are: brain is self centered, works with contrast, seeks tangible inputs, focuses on beginning and end, is visual and reflexive, and is only triggered by emotions. So the basic idea is to sell to a ‘person’, who can be understood as a ‘feeling machine that thinks’ rather than the prevalent notion of a rational man.</p>
<p>The selling process has been thus broken down to four sequential steps. They are—pain identification, making differentiated claims, demonstrating the gain to the buyer and appealing to the old brain. The emphasis has been given to appealing to the old brain as it holds the key. The book gives numerous examples and simple tools for any practitioner to implement each element of the sales process. Notable among them are the Gain—proof matrix which classifies the possible gains as financial, strategic or personal. It classifies proofs as Consumer story, demonstration, data or vision. Another tool which has been shared is the attention/retention curve. This curve essentially depicts that the attention level of old brain is high during the start and the end and low during the middle of any communication. These understandings may be used to provide a sales pitch which is appropriate to the context and maximizes the impact on the old brain.</p>
<p>The major part of the book gives various tips on how to relate to the old brain and making an impact on its decision. Each chapter deals with one particular strategy of building the communication with the old brain, like grabbing attention, putting up a big picture, ways to make the claim and providing proofs, handling objections and closing. Significant weight has been given to boost the impact on the old brain, by using techniques of enhancing seller credibility, creating contrast in the mind of customer, using emotions and stories to build the connect. The main point is how to do it in a concise manner so that there is higher effectiveness with old brain which also seeks brevity.</p>
<p>The authors bring in the notion of Human Resistance Curve, which plots the natural five natural stages of human reactions to any new idea. The curve demonstrates that an attention grabber can decrease the entire process time as well as increase the positive impact. This method helps in directly appealing to the old brain and thus eliciting a positive decision. The authors advise creation of big picture for the consumers, as it helps the old brain to visualize the benefits of the proposed solution. The idea is to help the brain realize the pain first and then the relief gained by the solution provided by you. As far as the unique benefits provided by you, keep it to a maximum of three key selling points and repeat it throughout the message to be effective.</p>
<p>While handling the valid objections (which are very common in any sales situation), it is important to keep in mind that logic alone is insufficient to elicit the appropriate response from the old brain. Hence, a story or metaphor that helps handling the objection may be more effective. The body language should be calm, confident and respectful; this helps the old brain to decide favourably.</p>
<p>The critical insight about the customer is the specific learning channel used by the customer. Research has indicated that 40 per cent people are primarily visual; 40 per cent are kinesthetically dominant while 20 per cent are strongly auditory as far as learning is concerned. Hence the communication has to use all the channels or be very selective to match the specific channel of learning of the recipients. The surest way however is to use a method which would cut across all the possible learning channels and the way to achieve the same would be to tell stories, use good visuals and involve the audience. The stories are predominantly received and stored in auditory form, however they also create sensory impression on the mind as the event has happened to him or her. Visual impression helps in registration and retention, while audience participation makes use of the kinesthetic channel and paves the way to reach the old brain.</p>
<p>There are quite a few repetitions which may not be very appealing to a savvy reader but may be appropriate for stressing the point to a less avid reader. The short chapters are likely to appeal to the main target audience—the sales force, who may not be able to read it in one reading and hence some amount of repetition may also be justified. The serious limitation that can be attributed to the book is that it is very limited in scope and does not do full justice to the scope of the title. It is possible that the reader may get a very constricted view of the discipline of neuromarketing.</p>
<p>There is a lot more research and conceptual understanding which could be used to enrich the book. For example, the book could have dwelled on the interplay on the different brains as it experiences the stimuli from the environment. It could have differentiated the marketing context of high involvement, low involvement level of the consumers with the specific product. How the competitive claims are processed would have helped the sales people who work in intensely competitive markets.</p>
