<abstract>
<p>Recurrence rates of psychological maltreatment (PM) and the services that may reduce those rates have not been systematically evaluated. The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System was used for 2003–2007 to study a cohort of children in 18 states with PM reports first confirmed by child protective services (CPS) during 2003. PM recurrence rates after counseling and other referrals were assessed while controlling for factors associated with service referral and other maltreatment. A total of 11,646 children had a first CPS-confirmed report with PM, and 9.2% of them had a second-confirmed PM report within 5 years. Fewer than one fourth of families were referred for services after PM, with service referrals being more likely for families with poverty, drug or alcohol problems, or other violence. Controlling for these factors, counseling referral was associated with a 54% reduction in PM recurrence, but other services were not associated with statistically significant reductions. Few families in which PM was confirmed receive any services, and most services provided were not associated with reductions in PM recurrence. Clarification of key services associated with efficacious prevention of PM is needed.</p>

<body>
<p>Psychological maltreatment (PM) and has been described as a pattern of damaging parent–child interactions that becomes typical of the relationship. PM occurs when a person conveys to a child that he or she is worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted, endangered, or only of value in meeting another’s needs by spurning, terrorizing, isolating, or ignoring the child’s socialization. It can be chronic and pervasive or can occur only when triggered by certain potentiating factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077559511433817">Hart &amp; Brassard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077559511433817">Kairys, Johnson, &amp; the Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, 2002</xref>). PM encompasses emotional abuse, emotional neglect, verbal abuse, and mental abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077559511433817">Goldman, Salus, Wolcott, &amp; Kennedy, 2003</xref>). PM is associated with a variety of negative and lasting effects which vary according to age, gender, and other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077559511433817">Shaffer, Yates, &amp; Egeland, 2009</xref>). It has strong links to depression, problems with relationships and attachment, and more rapid onset of major and minor mental illness which are dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077559511433817">Allen 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077559511433817">Gibb, Benas, Crossett, &amp; Uhrlass, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077559511433817">Liu, Alloy, Abramson, Iacoviello, &amp; Whitehouse 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077559511433817">Reyome, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077559511433817">Steinberg, Gibb, Alloy, &amp; Abramson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077559511433817">Uhrlass &amp; Gibb, 2007</xref>). The effects of PM in childhood and adolescence also represent important risk factors for other victimization since children with high levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms which can result from PM are particularly likely to experience increased peer victimization, maltreatment, and sexual victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077559511433817">Turner, Finkelhor, &amp; Ormrod, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although 56,356 U.S. children were found to be victims of PM after investigation by child protective services (CPS) agencies in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077559511433817">U.S. DHHS, 2010</xref>), PM has received far less attention in the literature than other forms of maltreatment, leaving at least three major knowledge gaps. First, the true rate of PM recurrence following a first case of substantiated PM is unknown. Published recurrence rates of child maltreatment (CM) in general have ranged from 9 to 67% depending on the age of the child, length of follow-up, type of initial or subsequent CM, services provided, and whether the study looked at reports, hospitalizations, or actual victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077559511433817">Fluke &amp; Hollinshead, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077559511433817">Levy, Markovic, Chaudhry, Ahart, &amp; Torres, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077559511433817">U.S. DHHS, 2010</xref>). State CPS agencies have identified recurrence risks ranging from 1 to 2% for “low-risk” families to over 50% for “high-risk” families over 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077559511433817">Dakil, Sakai, Lin, &amp; Flores, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077559511433817">DePanfilis &amp; Zuravin, 1998</xref>). More CM recurrence has been noted for children who are neglected, among White families, disabled children, or when parental young age, alcohol and substance abuse, or poverty are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077559511433817">Bae, Solomon, &amp; Gelles, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077559511433817">Connell, Bergeron, Katz, Saunders, &amp; Tebes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077559511433817">Dakil et al., 2011</xref>). Rates for rereporting to CPS are highest right after the prior substantiated report and decline over time, but important numbers of rereports are noted even 5 years later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077559511433817">Hindley, Ramchandani, &amp; Jones, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077559511433817">Lipien &amp; Forthofer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077559511433817">Marshall &amp; English, 1999</xref>). The time required to manifest the effects of PM suggests that longer duration studies are needed to assess PM outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077559511433817">Shaffer et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the frequency and factors associated with service referrals in cases of confirmed PM have not been reported. Children with long histories of maltreatment in general have been found to be more likely to be referred for some services, especially out-of-home care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077559511433817">Kinard, 2002</xref>). Certain services seem more likely to be provided after specific types of confirmed CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077559511433817">Garland, Landsverk, Hough, &amp; Ellis-MacLeod, 1996</xref>) such as physical abuse with the maltreating caretaker no longer in the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077559511433817">Swenson, Brown, &amp; Sheidow, 2003</xref>) and for unsubstantiated cases when the report comes from a mandated reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077559511433817">Drake, 1996</xref>). Referral for mental health or substance abuse treatment is affected by demographic factors, perceived risk, and prior receipt of services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077559511433817">Barth, Gibbons, &amp; Guo, 2006</xref>), and better CPS-agency linkages additionally improve service provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077559511433817">Hurlburt et al., 2004</xref>). Regarding PM, we do know that a higher proportion of the over 11,000 substantiated emotional maltreatment cases in Canada were referred for specialized services than were children after other forms of CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077559511433817">Trocmé et al., 2011</xref>). However, a full evaluation of the extent to which PM is receiving adequate attention in the child welfare system requires an understanding of how children are confirmed as victims and the factors affecting how often families are referred for specific services when PM is present, whether alone or in combination with other forms of CM.</p>
<p>Third, and of most direct relevance to policy in this area, we have not identified published research examining the extent to which services after PM confirmation—when provided—are associated with decreases in later PM recurrence. Studies evaluating the effects of services on CM recurrence in general have noted that service referral is often associated with no significant change or with increased rather than decreased recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077559511433817">Barth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077559511433817">Fluke, Shusterman, Hollinshead, &amp; Yuan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077559511433817">Fluke, Yuan, &amp; Edwards, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077559511433817">Palusci, Smith, &amp; Paneth, 2005</xref>). Additionally, it has been noted that services may be associated with increased CPS rereporting because of surveillance bias during service provision or because services are offered preferentially to families perceived to be at greater risk of recurrence, making it more difficult to demonstrate the real effects of services on recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077559511433817">Chaffin &amp; Bard, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the paucity of research regarding the frequency of service referrals, recurrence, how service referrals are provided, and their effectiveness in CPS-confirmed PM cases, we do not offer any hypotheses in these areas. The objectives of the present study were to examine: (a) rates of PM recurrence in a large population of CPS-confirmed psychologically maltreated children, (b) rates of CPS service referral and their association with child and family characteristics and concurrent CM among children after their first CPS-confirmed report for PM, and (c) the association between services and recurrence while controlling for factors associated with service referral.</p>

<title>Data Set Preparation</title>
<p>The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) collects data from U.S. states and territories and offers large annual samples of CM reports since 1990. Data have been reported about PM in CPS-confirmed cases since 1995. State CPS agencies voluntarily submit expanded case-level information about child, family, and service characteristics for what is now called the Child File (National Data Archive on Abuse Child Abuse and Neglect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077559511433817">[NDACAN], 2009</xref>). Although precise definitions vary from state to state, CM-type categorizations in NCANDS are based on federal guidelines for evidence of one or more instances of physical abuse, sexual abuse, PM, neglect, or medical neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077559511433817">U.S. DHHS, 2010</xref>). When state agencies find credible evidence that abuse or neglect has occurred, the report is labeled “substantiated” or “indicated” based on state law and is considered a CPS-confirmed report. More recent years also contain “alternative response victims” which are also considered confirmed reports, although the investigation process is different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077559511433817">NDACAN, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>NCANDS public use data sets were obtained for this study for 2003–2007 from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect at Cornell University (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077559511433817">U.S. DHHS, 2009</xref>). The SAS statistical software package, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for data management and analysis. Data from multiple years were merged by state and year after confirming that child identifiers were consistent across years for that state. New date variables were created to standardize formats across years. Duplicative reports occurring on the same day were deleted using a “roll up” procedure provided with the data set. Variable fields were assessed to determine whether they were missing, categorical or continuous in nature. Records were sorted by state and year in the data set and were compared with published information to assess overall data set integrity.</p>
<p>Several steps have been taken in the data set preparation, distribution and use to protect the privacy of children and families. Names and other identifying information had been removed and replaced with unique child and report identifiers prior to distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077559511433817">NDACAN, 2009</xref>). Files were transmitted using secure servers and were stored on secure computers. Because of these protections, the New York University human subjects committee deemed this research to be exempt from further review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077559511433817">
<title>Study Sample</title>
<p>The study sample used for this study was derived from the NCANDS data set from 2003 to 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077559511433817">U.S. DHHS, 2009</xref>). This 5-year group of NCANDS records has been used successfully in prior research looking at other forms of CM, and a 5-year time frame was also chosen because our prior analyses of NCANDS suggested that many children have recurrence beyond the standard 6-month recurrence period reported in NCANDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077559511433817">Palusci, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077559511433817">U.S. DHHS, 2010</xref>). After aggregation, the overall data set had 7,411,108 reports for 5 years from the 22 U.S. states included in 2003. All initial and subsequent reports for children labeled as having prior confirmed reports prior to the index year (2003) were removed from further analyses. Counter variables were created to identify the first- and second-confirmed reports with PM, and the total number of CPS-confirmed and unfounded reports for each unique state–child pair was calculated over the 5-year period for children with first-confirmed reports of PM during 2003. Confirmed reports could have up to four confirmed CM types, and an additional variable was created to identify records with additional confirmed PM. From an original sample of 177,568 children in the 18 states with continuous, child ID matched data over the 5-year period, we identified 11,646 children with confirmed PM reports in 2003 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077559511433817">Figure 1</xref>
). CPS-substantiated and indicated reports as well as alternate response-victims were treated as confirmed reports for all analyses.</p>

<title>Study Variables</title>
<p>NCANDS case-level data include fields with information concerning child age in years, gender, race (mutually exclusive categories of Native American, Asian, Black, Pacific Islander, or White), Hispanic ethnicity, CPS report date, source and disposition, services provided, and one to four type/types of abuse or neglect. PM as defined in NCANDS reflects a pattern of caregiver behavior or extreme incidents that convey to children that they are worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted, endangered, or only of value to meeting another’s needs. This can include parents or caretakers using extreme or bizarre forms of punishment or threatening or terrorizing a child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077559511433817">Fluke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077559511433817">NDACAN, 2009</xref>). Within these minimum standards, each state is responsible for providing its own definitions of child abuse and neglect. Records were stratified into groups of children with confirmed PM alone or those with PM and additional CM. NCANDS includes response items regarding whether the child does or does not have special medical needs, developmental delays, drug or alcohol exposure, impairments, disabilities, and behavior and chronic medical problems. Caretaker characteristics include the presence or absence of identified drug or alcohol problems, emotional or physical problems, mental retardation, disability, medical problems, violence between caretakers, receipt of financial assistance, or problems with money or housing. These factors are determined by the CPS worker during investigation and do not necessarily reflect the independent determinations of clinicians or other child welfare professionals involved in a case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077559511433817">NDACAN, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Information is provided in NCANDS regarding referrals for broad categories of services potentially helpful for preventing additional PM for children and families, including counseling (defined in NCANDS as services that apply therapeutic processes to personal, family, situational, or occupational problems to bring about a positive resolution of the problem or improved individual or family functioning), mental health treatment (services to overcome issues involving emotional disturbance or maladaptive behavior adversely affecting socialization, learning, or development, usually provided by public or private mental health agencies and including residential and nonresidential services), substance abuse treatment (services or activities designed to deter, reduce, or eliminate substance abuse or chemical dependency), foster care (services or activities associated with 24 hr substitute care for all children placed away from their parents or guardians and for whom the state agency has placement and care responsibility) and juvenile court petition (a legal document filed with the court of original jurisdiction overseeing matters affecting children requesting that the court take action regarding the child’s status as a result of the investigation). These postinvestigation services are entered into the child’s NCANDS record if they were provided or arranged by the CPS agency, social services agency, or the child welfare agency for the child or family within the first 90 days after the disposition of the report.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077559511433817">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis took place in three major steps. In the first step, we sought to identify the rate of PM recurrence in the sample of 11,646 families with confirmed PM, and to further identify the association of a number of child, family, and maltreatment characteristics with PM recurrence. PM recurrence was defined as a child with a second CPS-confirmed report containing PM in the same state during 2003–2007.</p>
<p>In the second major step, we identified the rate of referral for services of any type among the sample of 11,646 children with confirmed PM. Unadjusted associations between service referrals and PM recurrence were first calculated; we then identified child, family, and maltreatment characteristics associated with service referral in multivariate models. To do this, we first assessed the association between child/family factors/CM subtypes and service referral in bivariate comparisons to report unadjusted associations, and then used a logistic model that simultaneously regressed all variables that were significant in bivariate analyses onto the outcome of service referral. This identified a set of key variables associated with service referral.</p>
<p>In the third major step, we sought to identify the association, if any, of any service referral with PM recurrence. The key variables associated with any service referral were entered as covariates along with the dichotomous service referral variable into Cox proportional hazards, right-censored models of time to PM recurrence. This yielded an association for PM recurrence in an adjusted model. Hazard risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and survival curves were constructed using standard methods. Finally, in order to evaluate the association of specific service categories with PM recurrence, we identified specific service referrals relevant to PM which were recorded for 500 or more cases to assure adequate power. These were counseling, mental health treatment, substance abuse treatment, foster care, and juvenile court petition. The models noted above were repeated with each of these five service categories in order to evaluate their unique contribution to PM recurrence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077559511433817">
<title>Missing Data</title>
<p>Using complete cases, we excluded records from analysis when one or more of the covariates or outcomes in a model were missing. Missing data were assessed to see if there were any significant associations in those records with child and family factors or service referrals. We did not use data imputation for several reasons. Most importantly, the number of cases in the cohort retains sufficient statistical power to address the objectives in logistic regression models without missing data. There does not appear to be bias in the data that is missing, which appears to be absent primarily because 7 of the 18 states did not submit certain service or child factor information. These states represent only 7% of the original cohort, and there does not appear to be any association among the factors and their missingness for the remaining states. Other studies have used a similar approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077559511433817">Fluke et al., 2008</xref>). Despite missing data, the records available had &gt;.80 statistical power to detect a 10% change in recurrence while controlling for covariates.</p>

<title>Rates of PM Recurrence</title>
<p>The selection of study reports with CPS-confirmed PM is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077559511433817">Figure 1</xref>. Of the 11,646 children with a first-confirmed report containing PM in 2003, 1,069 (9.2%) had a second CPS-confirmed report containing PM within 5 years. There were an additional 1,422 second-confirmed reports with PM which were not included in the study cohort as their first-confirmed reports did not contain PM. Mean time to PM recurrence after first-confirmed PM was 310 days (<italic>SD</italic> = 374), ranging from 15 to 1,627 days, with 70% recurring within 6 months. An additional 10% recurred in months 6–11, Year 2, and Years 3–5.</p>

 shows PM recurrence in the cohort stratified by CM cooccurrence, child gender, age, race, ethnicity, and poverty, using reference groups with only PM, females, young children, Whites, non-Hispanics, and those not receiving public assistance. Fewer than half of confirmed PM cases listed PM without other cooccurring maltreatment, and more than half occurred among White, non-Hispanic, or female children. There was less PM recurrence when PM was combined with other types of CM, but the difference was not statistically significant. Young children and families receiving public assistance had significantly more recurrence. There were no significant differences based on race or gender.</p>

<p>Additional bivariate analyses were performed for all child and family factors contained in NCANDS, and several of these factors had significant association with PM recurrence (data not shown). Child emotional problems (odds ratio [OR] = .65, 95% CI [0.43, 0.97]), behavior problems (0.50 [0.28, 0.88]), medical problems (0.11 [0.02, 0.80]), and drug use in the family (0.62 [0.46, 0.82]) were all significantly associated with decreased PM recurrence. Learning problems in the family (1.57 [1.27, 1.80]) and other family violence (1.63 [1.42, 1.87]) were significantly associated with increased PM recurrence.</p>

<title>Rates of Service Referral Among Children After Their First CPS-Confirmed PM</title>
<p>After first-confirmed PM, 2,391 of the 11,646 children (22%) received referrals for one or more of the NCANDS-recorded services. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077559511433817">Table 2</xref>
 shows the ORs and CIs for the association of child and family factors with referral for any postinvestigation service by CPS. Referral patterns varied significantly based on a number of these and cooccurring CM types. Significantly more CPS referrals for any services were made for Native Americans and families receiving public assistance, with alcohol problems, visual sensory or physical problems, or other violence. Fewer referrals were made with cooccurring neglect and for Hispanic children.</p>

 lists the child and family factors significantly associated with counseling, foster care, juvenile petition, mental health, and substance abuse service referrals. In multivariate models, counseling was offered significantly more when there was cooccurring physical or sexual abuse or neglect, for Hispanic children, for children with learning disabilities, or family drug problems. Other services had varying association with different child and family factors, and race, family medical and physical problems, and other violence had greater association with service referrals besides counseling.</p>

<p>For the five specific service referral types, we first identified significant covariates for each specific subtype (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077559511433817">Table 3</xref>) and used those covariates in adjusted Cox regressions. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077559511433817">Table 4</xref>, foster care, juvenile court petition, and mental health treatment were statistically associated with increased PM recurrence in bivariate analyses, but no significant effect was seen for counseling or substance abuse treatment. However, after adjustment, counseling was associated with a statistically significant 54% reduction in PM recurrence while the other services were associated with either an increase or no change.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PM affects large numbers of U.S. children, and this study confirms that an important proportion of children with a confirmed report of PM have CPS-confirmed PM recurrence within 5 years. Our 6-month recurrence rate is comparable to rates reported by NCANDS and in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077559511433817">Palusci, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077559511433817">Palusci et al., 2005</xref>). While higher recurrence rates have been noted over 3–5 years after neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077559511433817">Dakil et al., 2011</xref>), it is important to note that almost one third of recurring PM cases were confirmed 6 months or more after their first CPS-confirmed report. More PM also recurs when PM is identified by itself in the initial report, supporting findings that PM independently contributes to further victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077559511433817">Schneider, Ross, Graham, &amp; Zielinski, 2005</xref>) and that we need to address PM specifically with services over longer periods of time if we hope to reduce long-term recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077559511433817">Egeland, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077559511433817">Turner et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It is unclear why service referrals were not provided for most confirmed PM victims. When used, referrals for counseling and foster care services were made more for children with other CM, particularly for older children and the poor. While one could postulate that young children are more likely to be referred for services because they are perceived by CPS to be at greatest risk, fewer infants and young children received any services at all. High proportions of Native American, Pacific Island, and military families received services, but these numbers are difficult to interpret given the small number of these children and the number and type of services in these populations which are affected by geography or additional federal policy.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the most notable finding from this study is that in analyses controlling for bias in referral to service, most services—including the referral for any service—were associated with increased PM recurrence. This suggests that current services may not be succeeding in their goal of reducing recurrence, but there may be additional confounding factors in the selection of recipients for services beyond variables available in NCANDS. Those with more CPS reports and participating in postinvestigation services for PM are often more disadvantaged, have other risks, and are known by the child welfare system for a longer time, although the degree to which surveillance bias affects recurrence is debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077559511433817">Chaffin &amp; Bard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077559511433817">Drake, Jonson-Reid, &amp; Sapokaite, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077559511433817">Fuller &amp; Nieto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077559511433817">Hélie &amp; Bouchard, 2010</xref>). It is also possible given risk assessment procedures used in CPS agencies that CPS workers preferentially provide service referrals to families at greater actuarial risk of recurrence. While we did not use formal propensity score methods to control potential biases in service selection, it is thought that a point estimate of a treatment effect from an analysis of covariance using multivariate adjustment for treatment allocation is equal to the estimate obtained from the two-step adjustment used in propensity scores when the same sample covariance matrix is used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077559511433817">D’Agostino, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>There are several other potential reasons why the present study was unable to demonstrate that services provided to families with CPS-confirmed PM resulted in lower overall rates of recurrence. One strong possibility is that services offered through CPS do not address specific caretaker or child needs and are therefore not effective in preventing future PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077559511433817">Chaffin, Bonner, &amp; Hill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077559511433817">Kinard, 2002</xref>). The evidence base for a variety of services such as parenting classes, parent education, pediatric anticipatory guidance, and family wellness/preservation programs remains weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077559511433817">Palusci &amp; Haney, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077559511433817">Reynolds, Mathieson, &amp; Topitzes, 2009</xref>). CPS practices regarding assessment, confirmation, and recording variables have not been standardized and there is wide variation in state PM definitions. It has been theorized that these differing definitions lead to varying rates of PM confirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077559511433817">Hamarman, Pope, &amp; Czaja, 2002</xref>). This is further complicated by the fact that CPS acceptance and investigation of reports varies across states and has varied over time with increased use of alternative response reports, leading to several potential differential and nondifferential biases in confirmation and service referral. While reported cases have been shown to have risk profiles similar to those with confirmed victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077559511433817">Hussey et al., 2005</xref>), we could not include unconfirmed reports in our analyses because NCANDS contains only limited information about unsubstantiated and unfounded reports.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that in contrast to the other four service types, counseling was statistically associated with a decrease in PM recurrence. Counseling is defined in NCANDS as “services or activities that apply therapeutic processes to personal, family, situational, or occupational problems in order to bring about a positive resolution of the problem or improved individual or family functioning or circumstances” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077559511433817">NDACAN, 2009</xref>, p. 40). Counseling therefore appears to be most directed at potential causes of PM, but, as with all services contained within the NCANDS data set, no information is available regarding whether counseling was actually provided for the parent, child or both, its duration or extent, or whether it was completed.</p>
<p>Mental health treatment, while defined as “services to overcome issues involving emotional disturbance or maladaptive behavior adversely affecting socialization, learning, or development,” is categorized separately from counseling in NCANDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077559511433817">NDACAN, 2009</xref>, p. 42). Mental health services should also therefore theoretically decrease PM recurrence, although their efficacy is unclear for children in foster care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077559511433817">Bellamy, Gopalan, &amp; Traube, 2010</xref>) or for those with symptoms associated with PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077559511433817">Bachmann et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, a recent review of mental health treatment concluded that, while helpful in treating the effects of PM in general, recognized evidence-based treatment models have not been designed to address PM specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077559511433817">Baker, Schneiderman, &amp; Pelcovitz, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, substance abuse and mental health treatment have been associated with increased risk of CPS rereporting in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077559511433817">Barth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077559511433817">Jonson-Reid, Emery, Drake, &amp; Stahlschmidt, 2010</xref>). In our study, other services such as foster care and juvenile court petition, while potentially helpful in reducing recurrence, also had increased PM recurrence. This is puzzling given that foster care has been shown to produce better long-term outcomes for children (such as less substance abuse, less arrest, less destructive behavior, and higher educational achievement) than does reunification and is associated with decreased CM recurrence overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077559511433817">Horwitz, Balestracci, &amp; Simms, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077559511433817">Taussig, Clyman, &amp; Landsverk, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077559511433817">Taussig &amp; Culhane, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It is also important to stress that we studied later reports of CM where the allegations were confirmed by CPS and the confirmed allegations included PM. This is potentially a very small subset of actual PM since most CPS agencies report small numbers. The definitions for PM used by states for CPS investigation and services vary markedly from state to state, ranging from less than 0.1% to over 36% of all confirmed CM cases in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077559511433817">U.S. DHHS, 2010</xref>). While our data does give some idea about the incidence of identified PM, the NCANDS data set is not able to answer questions about the factors or biases in reporting, underreporting, or confirmation for recurrent CM in general or the CPS focus on PM in particular. It does tell us that most children do not receive CPS services after PM, and it is possible that poor service implementation quality or variability, inadequate provider training, surveillance bias, the relatively low recurrence of PM, and inadequate length of follow-up all contributed to service inefficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077559511433817">Reynolds et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite being large, NCANDS is not nationally representative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077559511433817">U.S. DHHS, 2010</xref>) and contains information which was not collected specifically for our analyses. While this has not precluded multistate analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077559511433817">Fluke et al., 2008</xref>), several states submitted incomplete data in one or more years limiting its usefulness. NCANDS also does not address the specific nature, duration, or completion of services, using global labels for CM types and child and family factors that do not always approximate known causal mechanisms. Moreover, important variables such attachment, maladaptive personality, parental history of child abuse, maternal education, depression, single parenting, sociopathy, marital quality, social well-being, and prenatal and perinatal factors are not included and cannot be measured using NCANDS data. In addition, perhaps it is the engagement in services that is more important than the type or number of services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077559511433817">Hindley et al., 2006</xref>), and specific service programs and attendance, the factors associated with less recurrence, are not available in NCANDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077559511433817">DePanfilis &amp; Zuravin, 1998</xref>). Information is lacking about child functioning before and after service utilization, and we may not be able to adequately disentangle the relationship among services and outcomes with the information available.</p>

<sec id="section12-1077559511433817">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>It has been noted that “re-entry into CPS is a complex interaction of risk to children and system factors tied to the intervention they receive” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077559511433817">Fluke et al., 2008</xref>, p. 76). An important number of children are psychologically maltreated a second time within 5 years and may re-enter CPS. Most are not referred for services at initial identification, and for most who do receive services, they appear to be ineffective in preventing recurrence. We should temper our optimism for preventing PM, given that several key services available to CPS are associated with increased PM recurrence, reminding us that there remains a great deal of work to do when examining the key features of efficacious postinvestigation services for this important subgroup of maltreated children. Only counseling appears to hold promise at present, but further research is needed to identify the specific counseling characteristics that are associated with reductions in PM recurrence.</p>
