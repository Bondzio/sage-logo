<sec id="section4-0363546512472978">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The current data were gathered from 2 experiments evaluating ACL reconstruction and repair techniques. In the first experiment, pigs underwent unilateral ACL transection and received (1) ACL reconstruction, (2) ACL reconstruction with collagen-platelet composite (CPC), or (3) no treatment. The surgical legs were harvested after 15 weeks of healing. In the second experiment, pigs underwent ACL transection and received (1) ACL reconstruction, (2) ACL reconstruction with CPC, (3) bioenhanced ACL primary repair with CPC, or (4) no treatment. The surgical legs were harvested after 52 weeks. The harvested knees were imaged using a T2*-weighted 3-dimensional constructive interference in steady state (CISS) sequence. Each ligament was segmented from the scans, and the intra-articular volume and the median grayscale values were determined. Mechanical testing was performed to establish the ligament structural properties.</p>

<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used as a clinical tool for qualitatively monitoring anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft health after surgical reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512472978">12</xref></sup> With the advent of stronger magnets and new imaging protocols, MRI can now accurately measure the geometry of complex structures, such as the ACL. In addition, MRI can provide information about tissue quality by using different sequences to determine water content, fiber alignment, and tissue density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472978">11</xref></sup> Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that MRI also has the potential to provide a quantitative method for assessing the structural (failure) properties of an ACL graft or repaired ligament during healing in vivo. A noninvasive MRI method for predicting the structural properties of the graft or ligament would allow researchers to document functional healing within a patient in preclinical animal studies and clinical trials.</p>
<p>Determining the structural properties of the native ACL or reconstructed graft ex vivo is a common method for evaluating graft strength and documenting healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472978">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472978">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472978">20</xref></sup> However, these methods require destructive testing and are not suitable for in vivo longitudinal assessment. Alternatively, signal intensity (also termed grayscale), an MRI parameter that is a function of tissue type and water content, has been used to evaluate ACL graft integrity and maturation after ACL reconstruction surgery in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512472978">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512472978">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512472978">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512472978">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472978">18</xref></sup> The use of grayscale as an outcome measure is founded on research showing that the graft grayscale values decrease with time postoperatively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472978">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472978">20</xref></sup> and negatively correlate with its structural properties in an ovine model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472978">20</xref></sup> It has recently been established that graft volume when measured in situ via MRI also correlates with the graft structural properties and that the correlation could be improved by normalizing the volume to the graft T2 relaxation time 3 months postoperatively in the caprine model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472978">5</xref></sup> While these findings are promising, the relationship between graft volume, grayscale value, and the graft structural properties throughout the healing process remains undocumented. Because bioenhanced primary repair of the ACL is now proving to be efficacious in animal models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512472978">19</xref></sup> it is also important to validate the relationships between graft volume, grayscale, and the structural properties of repaired ligaments.</p>
<p>To date, there have been no studies evaluating volume (a measure depicting the amount of tissue) and grayscale (a surrogate measure of tissue quality) as separate quantifiable MRI variables to predict the structural properties of an ACL graft or ACL repair over the course of the healing process. The objective of this study was to assess a novel noninvasive method for predicting the structural properties of a porcine ACL-reconstructed ligament (graft) and a bioenhanced ACL suture repair using 3-dimensional (3D) models derived from T2*-weighted MRI at 2 time points in the healing process. We hypothesized that intra-articular graft or ligament volumes and grayscale values would be significant predictors of the structural properties of the reconstructed ligament and bioenhanced ACL repairs after 15 weeks and 52 weeks of healing. Additionally, we hypothesized that the combination of volume and grayscale values, as 2 separate defining characteristics of the ligament, would improve that prediction in a multiple linear regression model.</p>

<p>Fifty adolescent Yucatan minipigs (approximately 15 weeks of age) underwent either ACL transection (10 animals), ACL transection immediately followed by ACL reconstruction with a patellar tendon allograft (10 animals), or ACL transection immediately followed by bioenhanced ACL reconstruction with a patellar tendon allograft and collagen-platelet composite (CPC) (30 animals) as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512472978">4</xref></sup> All surgical procedures were performed by the same orthopaedic surgeon.

<p>A surface knee coil on a 3-T MRI scanner (TIM Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) was used to image the joints.

<title>3D Model and Volume Generation</title>
<p>Using commercially available software (Mimics 13.1, Materialise, Ann Arbor, Michigan), the reconstructed, repaired, and untreated ACL-transected ligaments were segmented from the MRI stacks in both the coronal and sagittal planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512472978">Figure 1</xref>). The 3D surface models and grayscale volumes were created from the segmented images on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Intra-articular volumes and median grayscale values were determined for the reconstructed ligaments, repaired ligaments, and untreated transected ligaments (note that residual healing does occur in the transected ligaments in this animal model so segmentation is possible). The median grayscale values from the ligaments or grafts were normalized to the grayscale value of the femoral cortical bone to account for any interscan variability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512472978">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512472978">17</xref></sup>

<title>Structural Properties of the ACL/Graft</title>
<p>An established tensile testing protocol was used to determine the structural properties of the reconstructed, repaired, and transected ACLs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512472978">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512472978">14</xref></sup> The specimens were thawed to room temperature. The femur was transected just distal to the hip, while the tibia was transected just proximal to the ankle to preserve the length of the long bones. The soft tissues were dissected from the tibia and femur while leaving the joint capsule intact. The proximal end of the femur and the distal end of the tibia were potted in 6- and 4-inch lengths of a 38.1-mm polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, respectively, using a urethane resin (Smooth-On, Easton, Pennsylvania). All residual soft tissue and joint structures were then removed from the joint, leaving only the femur-ligament-tibia complex intact. Using a servohydraulic materials testing system (MTS 810, Prairie Eden, Minnesota), the tensile loads were applied at 20 mm/min to failure as previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512472978">14</xref></sup> Initially, the joint was placed at 30° of flexion so that the mechanical axis of the ligament was collinear with the direction of pull of the tensile testing actuator. Starting with a tibiofemoral compressive force of 5 N, the entire load-displacement curve was recorded until a precipitous drop in load occurred. Yield load, maximum load, and linear stiffness values of the ligaments were calculated as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512472978">14</xref></sup>

<title>Relationship Between MRI-Derived Parameters and Structural Properties</title>
<p>Because the grayscale values were not normally distributed, the log base 2 transforms of the grayscale values were used for all subsequent analyses. The reconstructed, repaired, and untreated transected ligaments at both 15- and 52-week time points were grouped together and analyzed as a single data set. First, linear regression models were used to separately test the relationships between (1) MRI volume and structural properties and (2) median grayscale value and structural properties. Subsequently, both volume and median grayscale were included in a multiple linear regression model to predict the structural properties (a fit plane). The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values for models were reported as indicators of the strength of the relationships because <italic>P</italic> values alone may indicate a highly consistent or nonrandom relationship even in the presence of relatively poor prediction. The individual <italic>P</italic> values of the covariates of the volume and median grayscale value in the regression were used to test the contribution of these variables to the regression and as a check against concerns over multicollinearity. As an additional check of the model fit, the predicted maximum loads across specimens were plotted against the actual experimental maximum loads to visualize the standard error of the regressions.</p>

<title>MRI-Derived Parameter Differences Between 15- and 52-Week Treatment Groups</title>
<p>The means of the MRI-derived reconstructed, repaired, and transected ligament volumes at 15 and 52 weeks were 944 ± 380.7 mm<sup>3</sup> and 908 ± 435.2 mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively, although the difference was not significant (<italic>P</italic> = .724). The means of the median grayscale values of the reconstructed, repaired, and transected ligaments at 15 and 52 weeks were 1.06 ± 0.48 and 0.61 ± 0.44, respectively. The ligaments at 15 weeks had a significantly higher mean median grayscale value than ligaments at the 52-week time point (<italic>P</italic> ≤ .001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512472978">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A quantitative method for accurately monitoring the postoperative healing of an ACL reconstruction or bioenhanced primary ACL repair would be extremely valuable in both research and clinical settings. Magnetic resonance imaging is already widely available as a tool for noninvasive knee imaging, and its ability to differentiate between joint structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472978">11</xref></sup> and indirectly quantify graft maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472978">20</xref></sup> makes it an ideal technology to evaluate ligament and graft healing. In our study, T2*-weighted MRI-derived volumes and median grayscale values were significantly related to the magnitude of maximum failure load, yield load, and linear stiffness of reconstructed, repaired, and untreated transected ligaments. Expanding on this, we found that by combining the volume and median grayscale values of the reconstructed, repaired, and transected ligaments, the predictions for the structural properties were improved when compared with each variable alone. This prediction method may be advantageous for evaluating results noninvasively at early time points, thus removing the need for euthanasia and mechanical testing at those time points and reducing the number of animals required for a study. Furthermore, these findings may have clinical implications for tracking postoperative changes with graft healing in patient cohort studies and randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p>Our findings align with a previous study that found that intra-articular graft volume, when normalized to the MRI T2 relaxation time of the graft, increased the correlations to graft structural properties over volume alone after 6 weeks of healing in the caprine model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472978">5</xref></sup> However, the prior study did not find a significant correlation between structural properties and T2 values as a separate quantifiable variable. This could be explained by the single 6-week time point investigated with this study, which would have limited T2 values to one phase of graft healing. By including an additional time point, the current study encompasses more than one phase of the healing response and the associated range of grayscale values. With this time point included, a significant relationship was found between the grayscale parameter and structural properties alone as well as combined with volume in a multiple linear regression. Furthermore, in previous studies, quantitative MRI grayscale parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472978">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472978">20</xref></sup> or clinician-graded grayscale-based scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512472978">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512472978">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512472978">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512472978">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472978">18</xref></sup> were determined using 2D midsubstance MRI slices of a graft. The method presented herein analyzes the median grayscale value of the whole graft by reconstructing high-resolution 3D images of the graft volume. This could minimize inaccuracies associated with consistently locating a “midsubstance” slice with a 2D method.</p>
<p>Traditionally, standard imaging techniques have been used to predict the strength of intact cadaveric ACLs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512472978">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512472978">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472978">7</xref></sup> These methods rely on photographic technology to generate 3D morphological models of the ACL. Results from these studies suggest that ACL volume could be used in a regression model to predict the structural properties of the native ACL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472978">7</xref></sup> These standard imaging techniques provide a valuable method for predicting the structural properties of an intact ligament and may also be useful for the evaluation of the integrity of ACL grafts or repairs. However, these techniques require destruction of the joint to expose the ACL and obtain measurements and as a result could not be used with in vivo clinical applications. The regression results of the noninvasive MRI technique in our study support the human cadaveric findings of volume being predictive of ACL structural properties. We found that 2 noninvasively obtained quantifiable variables, volume and median grayscale values, could both be used in a multiple regression analysis to characterize structural properties of a reconstructed, repaired, and transected ligament. The significant contribution of the volume and grayscale parameters in the multiple regression equations indicates that the role of both independent variables should be considered in a predictive model. This was verified by the increased <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values seen in the multiple regression predictions of structural properties compared with the single predictor <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values (<italic>P</italic> ≤ .0001). This signifies that the combination of volume and median grayscale value offers a more complete evaluation of graft integrity than either parameter alone. The relatively low standard errors of the predictions suggest that the measured volume and median grayscale values could be effective in the future use of regression prediction models after further validation.</p>
<p>In addition to the correlation between reconstructed ligament grayscale (signal intensity) and structural properties, a prior MRI investigation also looked at signal-to-noise quotient (another MRI parameter assessing grayscale) differences over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472978">20</xref></sup> Histological results from the graft healing process were used to indirectly confirm the remodeling process in parallel with signal-to-noise quotient changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472978">20</xref></sup> While the study conducted herein did not include histological evidence of the healing process, the grayscale differences observed between the 15- and 52-week groups show a similar decreasing trend with time and could indicate healing and maturation of the graft or ligament on a tissue level. For the volume parameter, no difference was observed between the 15- and 52-week groups.</p>
<p>There are study limitations that should be considered. First, the knees were imaged postmortem. In a clinical situation, in vivo artifacts due to blood flow may affect the results. Nonetheless, the noninvasive MRI method utilized in the present study, which is based on graft volume and grayscale, shows considerable promise for use in vivo. Second, the grayscale variable used to represent signal intensity can vary depending on MRI parameters. We normalized the grayscale values to that of cortical bone within each image to minimize this concern. For this analysis, we did not separate out the group effects. It is possible that the CPC could affect the prediction. However, this possibility seems unlikely given the high coefficients of determination and the fact that the addition of CPC did not affect the slope of the prediction of the structural properties relative to the MRI graft volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472978">5</xref></sup> Finally, inherent differences between the reconstructed, repaired, and transected ligament treatments could affect the relationship of the volume and grayscale parameters with structural properties. However, taking into account that the failure mechanism for all specimens was midsubstance and that the intra-articular portion of each ligament analyzed was consistent between the reconstructed, repaired, or transected ligaments, it can be reasonably assumed that the MRI-derived variables represented the same functional unit between specimens. Despite these limitations, we have shown that MRI-derived morphology and grayscale can be used to predict structural properties of a reconstructed, repaired, and untreated transected ACL. We now plan to longitudinally validate this noninvasive MRI-based prediction method for documenting within-patient temporal changes relating to ACL strength and healing between treatment groups.</p>
