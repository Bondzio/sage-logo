<abstract>
<p>Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a rare manifestation of primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). We describe a patient with primary APS and refractory recurrent episodes of DAH. The patient was admitted 15 times due to recurrent episodes of DAH in a period of 18 months. Multiple immunosuppressive drugs did not improve his condition. Two years after his presentation, he was treated with rituximab (two doses of 1 g, 2 weeks apart). Six months later, the attacks of DAH have gradually disappeared. In a follow-up of more than 2 years after he received rituximab, the patient has had no further admissions due to DAH. Levels of antiphospholipid antibodies were measured during follow-up of 4 years. Anti-β2 glycoprotein IgG titer decreased to normal 6 months after therapy but anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody titer increased. We conclude that rituximab caused a dramatic clinical response in this patient. Anti-β2 glycoprotein IgG correlated better with the clinical response in this patient than aCL.</p>

<p>The patient is a 32-year-old male, previously healthy, who initially presented to our medical center with catastrophic APS. Anticardiolipin (aCL) IgG was 155.7 Units/ml (cutoff &gt; 10), aCL IgM 100.3 Units/ml (cutoff &gt; 7), anti-β<sub>2</sub> glycoprotein I (aβ<sub>2</sub> GPI) IgG &gt; 200 Units/ml (cutoff &gt; 8) and aβ<sub>2</sub> GPI IgM 190 Units/ml (cutoff &gt; 8). Activated partial thromboplastin time was 99.6 s, lupus anticoagulant (LA) ratio 9.5 (cutoff 1.4), dilute Russell's viper venom time 2.37 (cutoff 1.35), anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were negative. He had recovered completely, but 1 year later he began to have recurrent episodes of fever and hemoptysis. High-resolution non-contrast chest computed tomography showed transient ground glass appearance. Bronchoscopy revealed iron-laden macrophages. A diagnosis of DAH due to primary APS was made. The patient was admitted to the hospital 15 times over 18 months due to repeated episodes of alveolar hemorrhage. Acute episodes were treated with oxygen and occasionally with corticosteroids, with prompt clinical improvement. In an attempt to prevent recurrent episodes, the following therapies had been tried without success: prednisone 40–60 mg per day for 6 months, azathioprine 2 mg/kg per day for 6 months, intravenous immunoglobulin 2 g/kg over 3 months, hydroxychloroquine at doses of 400 mg/day for 2 years, six monthly pulses of IV cyclophosphamide, with a cumulative dose of 7.5 g and courses of plasmapheresis. The patient was treated with anticoagulation therapy during this period, which was stopped only during episodes of bleeding. Despite all of these treatments, the patient continued to suffer from recurrent episodes of DAH. Therefore, 2 years after his initial presentation, intravenous rituximab 1 g infusion was administered, and repeated 2 weeks later. Since therapy, there were no episodes of DAH which necessitated admission. Mild attacks of hemoptysis continued to occur. Six months after therapy, these episodes have gradually disappeared and aβ<sub>2</sub> GPI IgG became normal (10 Units/ml). Anticardiolipin IgG and IgM levels increased to 276 Units/ml and to 189 Units/ml, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203311422713">Figure 1</xref>). Two years after therapy, the patient now has rare and mild episodes of hemoptysis. Prednisone was stopped gradually. The patient was admitted to the hospital on two occasions after rituximab was given, due to transient neutropenia and to pneumonia.

<sec id="sec2-0961203311422713" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Variable APS manifestations have been treated successfully with rituximab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311422713">5</xref></sup> Trappe and colleagues report a patient with primary APS treated with rituximab for refractory thrombocytopenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311422713">6</xref></sup> A good correlation was demonstrated between aCL IgM titer reduction and platelets count improvement. Other antiphospholipid antibodies did not correlate with the platelets count.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311422713">6</xref></sup> Erdozain et al. reported a patient with APS and refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia treated successfully with rituximab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311422713">7</xref></sup> The patient had a sustained response for 10 months of follow-up. Anticardiolipin IgM decreased after treatment from 600 MPL to below 100 throughout the time of follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311422713">7</xref></sup> Erre et al. describe a 50-year-old man with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and primary APS treated with immunosuppressive therapy plus rituximab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311422713">5</xref></sup> Anti-β<sub>2</sub> GPI and aCL IgG level fell dramatically and no further thromboembolic episodes occurred. Ahn et al. reported a 30-year-old woman with APS treated with rituximab due to life-threatening hypercoagulable state with a good clinical response as well as disappearance of LA. Also aCL IgM decreased. Harner et al. described a patient with Sjögren's syndrome and secondary APS treated with rituximab for lymphoma. Anticardiolipin IgG decreased from 156 to 0 U/ml and aCL IgM from 110 to 6 U/ml.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311422713">8</xref></sup> Recently, a case of successful rituximab therapy in a lupus patient with DAH was reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203311422713">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our patient, both aCL and aβ<sub>2</sub> GPI levels were high during initial presentation with APS. Antibody levels decreased after his recovery and continued to decrease 1 year later, although the patient had suffered at that time from recurrent episodes of DAH. Six months following rituximab administration, the patient had marked clinical improvement and aβ<sub>2</sub> GPI IgG titer has reached normal values. Surprisingly, aCL titer increased. We conclude that aβ<sub>2</sub> GPI IgG level correlate better with the clinical response than aCL in this patient. This would support the idea that aβ<sub>2</sub> GPI IgG are the pathogenic antibodies in DAH related to APS.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge<bold>,</bold> this is the first report of rituximab given for DAH in primary APS. Due to the dramatic and sustained clinical response in this patient, we suggest that rituximab should be examined as a new therapeutic option in refractory DAH in primary APS. Modulation of B cells in APS has to be confirmed by further studies.</p></sec>
