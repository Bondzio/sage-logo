<abstract>
<p>This article examines the issues that are at stake in the current resurgence of interest in the subject of habit. We focus on the role that habit has played in conceptions of the relations between body and society, and the respects in which such conceptions have been implicated in processes of governance. We argue that habit has typically constituted a point of leverage for regulatory practices that seek to effect some realignment of the relations between different components of personhood – will, character, memory and instinct, for example – in order to bring about a specific end. In reviewing its functioning in this regard across a range of modern disciplines – philosophy, psychology, sociology – we explore the tensions between its use and interpretation in different lineages: in particular, the Cartesian–Kantian/Ravaisson–Bergson–Deleuze lineages. The article then identifies how these questions are addressed across the contributions collected in this special issue.</p>

<title>Why Habit?</title>
<p>And why now? What issues are at stake in its analysis? How might these best be addressed? These questions have been insistently pressed upon us in editing this special issue of <italic>Body &amp; Society</italic> and, before that, in organizing the workshop at which the articles gathered together here were initially presented.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1357034X13485881">1</xref>
</sup> They are also questions which both reviewers and the journal’s editors have raised in urging the authors to step back from their immersion in the particularities of their topics to clarify why and how their accounts of habit and the processes of habituation matter. They are, though, most of all, questions that are posed by the resurgence of interest in the topic of habit that has been in evidence for some time now.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1357034X13485881">2</xref>
</sup> If habit once hummed quietly in the background as one of those conceptual black boxes that Bruno <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1357034X13485881">Latour (1987</xref>: 2, 81–2) has made so famous, that box has now been well and truly opened in critical work that has focused on the history of the concept and the spheres and forms of its practical uses and applications.</p>
<p>Questions about habit – its inner workings and its role in human behaviour – have long been a staple of philosophical inquiry. It has a long history in modern Christian theology, particularly after Aquinas’s interventions in favour of habit, and first emerges as a concept denoting a specific field of action in the positive role that Aristotle’s <italic>Nicomachean Ethics</italic> attributes to habit in the cultivation of morality and civic virtue (see Carlisle, this issue).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1357034X13485881">3</xref>
</sup> A topic of philosophical inquiry in the early development of liberal political thought, it has, from the early 19th century onwards, been brought under the more clinical dissection of a range of empirical disciplines: medicine, biology, neurology, psychology and sociology, for example.</p>
<p>Such inquiries, however, have never been disinterested. Since habit is central to the formation of human capacities, it has also constituted a problem space in the sense that it has always been a point of entry into conduct that is oriented to bringing particular behaviours under the direction of either secular or religious authorities. It is, of course, not only habit – understood as a form of more-or-less automated repetition – that is the primary target of such interventions. Rather, habit has more typically constituted a point of leverage for regulatory practices that seek to effect some realignment of the relations between different components of personhood – will, character, memory and instinct, for example – in order to bring about a specific end. Habit is always figured in relation to these other coordinates of personhood, caught up with them in processes of habituation, dis-habituation and re-habituation.</p>
<p>In recent years, these questions have taken on new urgency for many scholars in the humanities and social sciences attempting to understand the relations between the human and the non-human. As a meeting point between natural and cultural determinants of conduct, and between the human and non-human components of personhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1357034X13485881">Heiner, 2009</xref>), habit has become a key component in various conceptualizations of modernity; at the same time it has become one of the points of entry for critical engagements which call into question the notion of ‘modernity’ itself. The dividing lines that have been drawn to separate modern subjects from their predecessors have typically been posed in terms of the degree to which conduct is habitually determined or brought under the influence of the will, reflexivity or some other mechanism through which the force of habit is broken, moderated or redirected. At the same time, however, it is clear that the project of modernity depends in many respects upon the utilization of particular ‘modern’ habits, particularly in its governmental dimensions, as outlined above, and in several contributions to this volume.</p>
<p>Habit has also been a key site for interrogating body–society relationships. This is clear in the significance accorded it in current debates focused on the relations between body and affect,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1357034X13485881">4</xref>
</sup> as well as in the radically new ways of conceiving body–society relationships prompted by the development of genome and nanotechnologies and the new conceptions of personhood that these make possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1357034X13485881">Rose, 2012</xref>). Our approaches to body–society relations are also currently under revision as it becomes increasingly clear that the histories of human and animal bodies and forms of sociality are, and always have been, inextricably enmeshed even – and perhaps especially – through the history of their differentiation as separate spheres of governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1357034X13485881">Derrida, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1357034X13485881">Nimmo, 2010</xref>). If these developments complicate where and how – and, indeed, whether – habit can inform our understanding of the relations between animals and humans, so does the insistence, from various quarters, on the significance of material actors in the constitution and functioning of social and cultural assemblages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1357034X13485881">Bennett and Healy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1357034X13485881">DeLanda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1357034X13485881">Latour, 2005</xref>). The processes through which habits are formed and re-formed have to take account of the imbrication of human conduct within socio-material environments in which the agency of deceptively simple things, like schoolroom desks,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1357034X13485881">5</xref>
</sup> complex infrastructures, like logistical systems, and regional ecologies have to be taken into account.</p>

<title>Rethinking Habit</title>
<p>Although he did not have much to say about habit as such, Foucault’s more general arguments concerning the regimens through which intellectual, spiritual and moral authorities intervene into the conduct of conduct by partitioning the self – splitting it up into different parts so as to open up spaces for the action of self on self and to equip the part which acts with the resources required to bring the parts that are acted on into good order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1357034X13485881">Foucault, 1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1357034X13485881">1988b</xref>) – have been influential in rethinking habit. There is now a considerable body of literature concerned with the role played by habit in liberal political thought, and the influence it has exercised on the development of governmental technologies that have sought either to cultivate a liberal disposition within the person or to compensate for such a disposition where the capacities for exercising it are judged to be lacking or deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1357034X13485881">Joyce, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1357034X13485881">White, 2005</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1357034X13485881">6</xref>
</sup> In the Catch 22 of disciplinary logic, late 19th-century medicine, the psy-disciplines, and the life sciences identified a number of conditions in which the capacity of the will was judged to be lacking owing to the excessive sway of habit, only to prescribe a reinforcement of the disciplinary rigours of habit as the only effective means of guiding conduct until the incapacity of the will was repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1357034X13485881">Valverde, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1357034X13485881">1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1357034X13485881">1998b</xref>).</p>
<p>There is also a considerable literature on the roles that different conceptions of habit have played in the development of colonial practices of governance, enough, certainly, to make it clear that these vary considerably across the different periods of colonialism, as well as across the relations between settler and conquest forms of colonialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13485881">Bennett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1357034X13485881">Helliwell and Hindess, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1357034X13485881">Hindess, 2001</xref>). There are also a number of difficulties that cluster around the relationships between habit and the neighbouring, but by no means identical, concepts of custom and tradition in view of the roles that these have played in justifying the denial of a capacity for liberal forms of self-inspection and self-government to those populations positioned as lagging behind the temporal dynamics of modernity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1357034X13485881">7</xref>
</sup> This denial of a coeval status to the colonized as primitive has also served as a template for the application of liberalism’s discriminations across other social relations, notably those of class and gender, albeit that these discriminations have their autonomous determinations that are not reducible to this consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1357034X13485881">Poovey, 1995</xref>). These aspects of liberal political thought have had a significant influence on 20th-century social and aesthetic modernisms, particularly those critiques of everyday life which, running from Georg Lukács through to Henri Lefebvre, have castigated various populations, and particularly women, as lagging behind the progressive dynamics of history in view of their undue susceptibility to the force of habit and the rhythmic pleasures of repetition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1357034X13485881">Bennett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1357034X13485881">Crook, 1998</xref>; Felski, 1999–2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1357034X13485881">Johnson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1357034X13485881">Swandwell, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>These post-Foucauldian literatures have focused largely on those discourses and practices in which habit is viewed negatively. The coordinates for this negative evaluation of habit derive, in the main, from Kant for whom habit – understood as automatic, unthinking repetition – served as a key marker of the boundary line separating nature from culture as the historically accumulating realm of free human agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1357034X13485881">Kant, 2006</xref>: 229–30). Habit had, of course, its earlier detractors – notably Descartes (see Crossley, this issue) – but it had been more positively viewed by both Locke and Hume (see Dodsworth, this issue). It is, however, Kant’s construction of habit as a negative counterpoint to the processes of human self-making through which freedom is progressively won that has exercised the more decisive influence on 19th- and 20th-century accounts of habit. These have interacted, in complex phenomenological accounts of the subject from Husserl through Merleau-Ponty to Bourdieu – a point we return to – and, in Anglophone traditions, with the legacies of John Stuart Mill’s account of the role of character in mediating the relations between culture, habit and volition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1357034X13485881">Mill, 1967</xref>).</p>
<p>The still unfolding influence of Deleuze’s <italic>Difference and Repetition</italic> has pointed in a different direction, opening up lines of inquiry in which habit forms part of a nature–culture continuum in which human history, culture and freedom emerge out of capacities for change and adaptation that humans share with other forms of life and, indeed, with matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1357034X13485881">Deleuze, 2004</xref>). As Brian Massumi puts it:
<disp-quote>
<p>Habit lies at the hinge of nature and these divergent process lines of culture. Habits are socially or culturally contracted. But they reside in the matter of the body, in the muscles, nerves, and skin, where they operate autonomously. Although they are contracted in social/cultural context, they must be considered self-active autonomies: spontaneous self-organisations that operate on a level with movements of matter. (Massumi, 2002: 236–7)</p>
</disp-quote> It is through habit that the past is accumulated and stabilized, providing a point of anchorage for action in the present through which processes of open-ended becoming are perpetuated. This re-evaluation, in placing habit at the heart of the relations between the virtual and the actual, has also led to a significant revival of interest in Henri Bergson’s account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1357034X13485881">Bergson, 2004</xref>) of the relations between habit and memory. This, in turn, has prompted a renewed interest in the work of Félix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1357034X13485881">Ravaisson (2008</xref>) to provide, in the Ravaisson–Bergson–Deleuze lineage, an account of habit as a nature–culture hinge that serves as a counter to the dualities of the Descartes–Kant–Husserl–Sartre line of descent (see Grosz, this issue).</p>
<p>It was also Deleuze who prompted the renewed attention that has since been paid to the work of Gabriel Tarde, whom he praises, toward the end of his introduction to <italic>Difference and Repetition</italic>, for having elaborated better than anyone else the forces ‘in mind and nature’ working to effect ‘an ever more perfect correspondence between difference and repetition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1357034X13485881">Deleuze, 2004</xref>: 29). The centre of the Tardeian revival has fallen mainly on the implications of Tarde’s work for rethinking the social against the grain of the Durkheimian inheritance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1357034X13485881">8</xref>
</sup> His account of the roles of suggestion, imitation and repetition in the constitution of the social is, however, one that accords a significant role to the mechanisms of habit or habituation while also detaching those mechanisms from some, albeit not all, of the oppositions governing its devaluation in the Descartes–Kant tradition.</p>
<p>Three aspects of Tarde’s understanding of the role of imitation in social life merit our attention here. The first is his refusal, equivocal and patchy though it is, to differentiate societies according to the degree to which they are subject to the force of imitation reinforced, via habit, through repetition. He thus pours cold water on the suggestion that the ratios between voluntary and involuntary imitation change in favour of the former with the advance of civilization. The savage, he argues, was no less conscious of imitating his ancestors than the modern labourer or bourgeois has. Indeed he contends, that the ratio of self-determined acts to automatic habits has tended to increase with civilization owing to the greater weight of the accumulated force of past cycles of imitation that characterizes advanced civilizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1357034X13485881">Tarde, 1903</xref>: 192–3).</p>
<p>Tarde derives many of his formulations here from the late 19th-century fusions of post-Darwinian biological, anthropological and archaeological thought which articulated the relations between the social mechanism of habit and the somatic mechanisms of inheritance differently across the relations between primitive and modern societies: as mutually reinforcing mechanisms of social stasis in the former case, and as opening up a space of freedom that might act to counter the tyranny of ancestral inheritances in the latter (see Bennett, this issue). These were perhaps most influentially condensed, in late 19th-century French social thought, in Durkheim’s account of the anatomical foundations of the division of labour as the outcome of mechanisms of racial inheritance that were opposed to the force of individuality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1357034X13485881">Durkheim, 1964</xref>: 304). In place of Durkheim’s account of a division between primitive and modern societies as one of complexity driven by increasing functional differentiation in which the force of racial inheritance is diminished, Tarde proposes a mechanism of social variation that operates continuously in the same manner, thus denying any basis for a division of societies into different types based on different central coordinating principles. And in place of the linear and teleological accounts of evolution that governed post-Darwinian social theory, Tarde – as the second point we wish to stress – substitutes the more contingent, circumstantial and random mechanisms of social change that result from unplanned innovations. These introduce new principles of social variability whose differentiating powers are, in turn, consolidated and perpetuated through habitual mechanisms of repetition. It is thus in the relations between habit and invention that the ‘curves of desire’ through which change is effected are subject to periodic cycles of closure and openness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1357034X13485881">Tarde, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Our third point has to do with what is tied up in Tarde’s conception of ‘the social man as a veritable somnambulist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1357034X13485881">Tarde, 1903</xref>: 76). In discussing Tarde’s affiliations to late 19th-century conceptions of the role of contagion in crowd behaviour, Christian Borsch (2007) highlights the role that Tarde’s frequent references to somnambulism play in constructing an account of action as a complex amalgam of affect and desire, irrationality and purposiveness, that takes place in an in-between state of semi-consciousness. When he discusses how memory and habit, as two different forms of repetition that are inscribed, respectively, in the nervous system and in the muscular system, interact to shape perception at the level of the individual, Tarde refers to this as ‘an unconscious imitation of self by self’, a case of ‘<italic>presocial</italic> or <italic>subsocial</italic>self-imitation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1357034X13485881">Tarde, 1903</xref>: 75). When he discusses the operation of imitation at a collective societal level he defines it as ‘the action at a distance of one mind upon another’, an action which he likens to ‘the quasi-photographic reproduction of a cerebral image on the sensitive plate of another brain’ (1903: xiv). Brains might act on each other through the mediated networks of social and material relations which establish ties between them, fashion systems being a case in point.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1357034X13485881">9</xref>
</sup> However, there is no space for a form of consciousness that is fully present to itself in Tarde’s thought. And, consequently, no space either for distinguishing between different kinds of humanity in terms of their differential capacities for self-reflexive forms of consciousness. These, then, are among the aspects of Tarde’s work that have made it a rallying point for sociologists seeking an alternative to the neo-Kantian heritage of the Durkheimian tradition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1357034X13485881">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While Tarde was a significant force in late 19th- and early 20th-century social thought, his influence did not last much beyond the 1920s, after which, as Matea Candea notes, he was largely air-brushed out of the histories of continental and Anglophone sociology prior to the Deleuze-led rediscovery of his work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1357034X13485881">Candea, 2010b</xref>: 6). Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1357034X13485881">Camic (1986</xref>), for example, pays no attention to Tarde in his influential account of the role accorded habit in European and American sociology up to and including the 1950s. Moreover, in arguing that habit became largely the territory of behaviourist psychology, Camic fails to register the significance that the concept of habit enjoyed in the social psychology of George Herbert Mead and William McDougall, both of whom shaped their accounts of habit in a critical dialogue with Tarde’s work. In doing so, they also reverted to the role that habit had played in earlier forms of liberal thought in stratifying populations in terms of the forms of personhood they exhibited. Their accounts reinstated the significance of distinguishing between rigid and fixed, flexible and plastic, forms of personhood in drawing the boundary lines between superior and inferior groups, between governors and governed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1357034X13485881">Blackman, 2007</xref>, this issue; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1357034X13485881">Leys, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Tarde’s influence in France was equally short-lived, eclipsed almost entirely by the translation of the Durkheimian heritage into the inter-war project of Maussian ethnology, which consolidated its position in the French intellectual field through the institutional bases it established in the university, the Musée de l’Homme and the Institut d’ethnologie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1357034X13485881">Sibeud, 2007</xref>). If habits are, for Durkheim, the true regulatory forces governing conduct, it was as important for Durkheim as it was for Mill that such habits should periodically be broken down so that conduct, in being dis-habituated, could be subjected to programmes of re-habituation that were brought under the direction of consciousness. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1357034X13485881">Camic (1986</xref>) shows, however, the cultivation of the reflexive capacities that this required was, in Durkheim’s conspectus, limited to the elite students who attended secondary schools, while those whose education was restricted to elementary schooling were expected merely to conform to prescribed codes of conduct. In this way, the relations between consciousness and habit were translated into the terms of the operative social divisions of the Third Republic just as, as we have seen, they informed Durkheim’s hierarchical conception of the relations between primitive and civilized races. These hierarchized dualities continued to inform the inter-war programmes of Maussian ethnology and the role it played, in terms of the governmental problematics of Greater France, in differentiating the mechanisms through which France’s colonial populations and the popular rural classes were to be governed from those applicable to its metropolitan citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1357034X13485881">Lebovics, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Although, ultimately, a more complicated story, Bourdieu’s account of habit – and, more crucially, as he always insisted, of habitus as a set of dispositions distinct from habit – brings together elements of the Durkheimian heritage together with, first, the stronger focus on habit as a set of embodied practices that he derived from Mauss’s work on body techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1357034X13485881">Mauss, 1973</xref>) and, second, the focus on the subjective processes of habituation he derived from phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1357034X13485881">Noble and Watkins, 2003</xref>). Simultaneously a theory of socialization and a theory of action, Bourdieu’s concept of habitus was concerned to determine the weight to be accorded to the embodied past relative to present contexts of action in shaping the practices of social agents. His resolution of these issues was, however, shaped by the traditions on which he drew. For he too distributed the capacity to reshape the influence that the past exercised on embodied practices within the present by differentiating the habitus of different social groups and classes according to the scope for reflexivity that they offer (Bennett, this issue). The limitation of Bourdieu’s account of habitus that is most striking in the context of current debates, however, lies in his relative lack of attention to the role of material agencies in shaping conduct. This is, in truth, a limitation that is shared by most of the traditions reviewed above. It is, however, an aspect of Bourdieu’s work that Bernard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1357034X13485881">Lahire (2011</xref>: 139–142) has brought into sharp focus in noting Bourdieu’s failure to take into account the use that social agents make of material devices to review and change their behaviour, focusing instead on the degree to which different habitus equip agents with the capacity to swivel on the history that has made them by reflexively monitoring and adjusting its force.</p>
<p>The work of John Dewey has served as a useful counterfoil to such conceptions in his rejection of the view of habit as solely an internal property of the person. Habits, he argues, have rather to be seen as ‘things done <italic>by</italic> the environment by means of organic structures or acquired dispositions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1357034X13485881">Dewey, 2002</xref>: 14). ‘All virtues and vices’, he writes, ‘are habits which incorporate objective forces’ (2002: 16). It would, then, he argued, be fruitless to pose the task of changing habit as one of calling for the transformation of a self abstracted from its social and material environment. The regulation of habit is not something that can be accomplished via direct action on the self; it involves a ‘selecting and weighting of the objects which engage attention and which influence the fulfilment of desires’ (2002: 20). Habits require things beyond themselves in order to be put into action:
<disp-quote>
<p>And whenever they are in action they are cooperating with external materials and energies. Without support from beyond themselves the eyes stare blankly and the hand moves fumblingly. They are means only when they enter into organisation with things which independently accomplish definite results. These organisations are habits. (2002: 26)</p>
</disp-quote> It is not surprising, then, that Dewey’s work is increasingly looked to as a resource that can be brought into alignment with approaches to habit, evident in contemporary debates about climate change and waste management, which interpret habits as parts of mind–body–environmental assemblages, and in which questions of dis- and re-habituation are longer posed as matters of ‘changing the subject’ but as ones of modifying the arrangement of such assemblages.<sup>

<title>The Contributions</title>
<p>The first four articles engage with these issues by addressing two prominent sets of ideas about habit that have informed some of the defining antinomies of western liberalism. As we have seen, these ideas, which focus on the role habit plays in human agency and the formation of subjectivity, involve whether human beings are capable of self-determination and self-governance or are so ruled by nature and appetite that they require external control. These ideas are most explicitly articulated in theological and philosophical writings: on the one hand, authors otherwise as different as Martin Luther, Kant and Herbert Spencer considered habit a sign of human enslavement; on the other hand, philosophers like Aquinas, Hegel and Bourdieu have found in habit openings for self-determination. These two philosophical positions have also been expressed in two approaches to criminality, one in which bad habits figured as one of the factors that led to criminality, which could thus be corrected by government intervention; and the second, which assumed that some individuals were disposed from early childhood to acquire criminal habits and thus could not easily be turned away from crime.</p>
<p>Clare Carlisle’s ‘The question of habit in theology and philosophy: from hexis to plasticity’ explores the theological roots of habit to evaluate their influence on modern philosophy. She begins with the 13th-century theologian Thomas Aquinas’s attempt to synthesize Aristotle’s claim that habit promotes virtue with the Christian tradition, which has generally viewed habit in negative terms. From the Thomist synthesis, which emphasizes the individual’s ability to appropriate grace through habit, Carlisle moves to the 16th-century theologian, Martin Luther. Luther was much more critical of habit than Aquinas, for he viewed grace as a gift from God that could not be appropriated or earned by human effort. Modern responses to these two strains of theological thought have focused on the question of human freedom: Are human beings essentially free? Or is our behaviour determined by moral or physical laws? Carlisle aligns Kant and Kierkegaard with Luther, for, like Luther, they viewed habit as a sign of human enslavement. Hegel and Felix Ravaisson, by contrast, have developed Aquinas’s more positive assessment of the role habit can play in cultivating virtue.</p>
<p>In ‘Habit and the limits of the autonomous subject’, Simon Lumsden focuses on Hegel’s treatment of habit. Lumsden argues that the norms that many philosophers associate with reasoned, free choices are better understood through the analytic Hegel offered: as habitual articulations of self-feeling, not reason. Because habits and the norms they help sustain are intimately linked to human identity, moreover, these norms are very difficult to dislodge – even after they have outlived their social utility. According to Lumsden, the implications of Hegel’s view of habit are that, because habits ‘want to repeat themselves’ and individual identity is deeply invested in this repetition, modern forms of living cause deep anxiety. We live in and through outmoded habits, he argues, yet find them difficult to change.</p>
<p>Francis Dodsworth’s ‘Habit, the criminal body, and the body politic in England, c. 1700–1800’ explores the social implications of various views of habit. Examining the way that 18th-century writers construed criminality and the justice system that was supposed to control it, Dodsworth argues that during the period in which the structures of liberal government were created, the ‘crime problem’ was frequently argued to result from the external factor of temptation, the social problem of imitation, and the ‘internal’ or subjective factor of habit. When these three factors coincided, individuals could become criminals; and the best way to prevent this was to halt the accumulation of criminal behaviours or break the power they exercised by cultivating good habits. According to this argument, then, habit was the <italic>explanation</italic> for the problem of crime, as well as one possible corrective, not the <italic>problem</italic> that now seems to require explanation, as we worry about ‘habitual criminals’ who seem psychologically predisposed to uncorrectable behaviours. The argument that character required a long time to develop, and was thus amenable to reformation, figures in an array of sources ranging from Newgate records to Henry Fielding’s works on police and was central to the legitimization of the mechanisms of prevention and punishment which governed the fate of the criminal. At the same time it presented a very particular relationship between the individual and their society, one in which individual habits of virtue or vice, embedded in the body and the mind through particular actions and personal histories, were intimately connected to the social and commercial circumstances in which they were located.</p>
<p>Tony Bennett’s ‘Habit: time, freedom, and governance’ also examines philosophical engagements with habit and human freedom. Bennett’s analysis is distinctive for two reasons: he focuses on the ‘architecture of the person’ and the role that various ways of understanding human interiority and biology have played in accounts of liberal governmentality; and he touches on the implications such accounts can have for actual social arrangements, such as one group’s domination of another. Indeed, Bennett argues, the way most post-Foucauldian philosophers have construed the capacity for self-determination tends to install a division within the body politic, separating those who are thought capable of governing themselves from groups who are thought to lack this capacity. Thus, aligning habit with instinct has been used to assign groups, like the Australian Aborigines or other ‘primitives’, to a subordinate position, while aligning it with will has justified allowing other groups self-determination. Bennett explores the questions related to habit’s place in various architectures of the person: in the ‘organic memory’ tradition, represented by Herbert Spencer and Théodole Ribot; the line of thought developed by Ravaisson, Bergson and Deleuze that viewed habit as a mechanism of change; and Bourdieu’s account of ‘habitus’, which views the ‘second nature’ that habit creates as the source of at least intermittent directed action.</p>
<p>Following on from Bennett’s examination of the relations between habit, time, freedom and governance, Nick Crossley’s ‘Habit and habitus’ takes a different course. While touching on some similar issues and drawing on some similar theorists, in particular Dewey and Bourdieu, Crossley focuses on teasing out the differences and similarities between the concepts of habit and habitus. He does this by interrogating how the concepts are variously deployed in the work of Mauss, Bourdieu, Dewey and Merleau-Ponty, not in order to arrive at any definitive definition of each but to raise a number of key points central to understanding their role in relation to human conduct. In doing this, Crossley determines that there is very little difference between the two and that Mauss and Bourdieu’s preference for habitus relates more to wanting to dissociate themselves from the mechanistic understandings that habit can denote. Crossley also attributes the use of habitus in their work to the appropriation of habit by psychology and, in particular, the reductive formulations of the behaviourists. Drawing on Camic’s (1986) influential account that maps the erasure of the term within sociology, Crossley similarly views the use of habitus over habit as a result of this disciplinary disjuncture. Yet Crossley and Camic both stress that Mauss and Bourdieu also enlist habitus to perform a slightly different and much broader role than habit. Rather than individual conduct, which habits tend to signify, habitus, as used by Mauss and Bourdieu, has a distinct social function. It is used to signify behaviours and traits common to specific social groups that are in turn, through close association, reproduced over time. To complicate matters, Crossley points out that habitus is not always used in this fashion and that in Husserl’s work, for example, it has a more individualistic meaning. The sociological dimension of habitus, however, is also implicit in some uses of habit. Crossley explains how Dewey and Merleau-Ponty not only share none of the reservations of Mauss and Bourdieu in their foregrounding of the enabling potential of habits but, in viewing their formation as a function of social interaction and engagement with the world, see them as undeniably socio-cultural phenomena.</p>
<p>This is very much the way in which Greg Noble conceives of habit in his discussion of cosmopolitanism and the capacities of intercultural conviviality. Rather than draw on habit to examine ingrained attitudes and practices of racism, a well-trodden field of enquiry, Noble is interested in how habit might be used to explore everyday encounters of negotiating difference. Noble’s intent is not to romanticize what he terms ‘everyday cosmopolitanism’ but to pinpoint the particular proclivities that promote conviviality within culturally complex societies. To Noble, however, this poses key methodological questions. How, he asks, do you study habits? Wanting to move beyond the limitations of psychological research that tends to simply measure frequency of actions within clinical settings to determine habituated behaviour, Noble stresses the value of ethnography in capturing <italic>how</italic> and <italic>where</italic> habits are acquired. He is critical of the neglect of this form of investigation in the literature on habit, pointing out that ‘Turning their backs on such methods has meant that theorists of habit refrain from dealing with it in anything but abstract philosophical terms’. Wanting to ground his own exploration of habit firmly in the empirical, Noble draws on a number of snapshots of everyday practice within the context of a culturally diverse school. He examines a series of encounters between parents and students of various cultural and linguistic backgrounds, and how these routine negotiations across difference provide the backdrop for a more significant display of intercultural conviviality in the form of a school musical evening in which the cosmopolitan virtues of irony, openness and appreciation of otherness are profoundly on display. It is these that Noble conceives as habits, formed and firmly rooted in the myriad of everyday transactions of sociality of this school and its community.</p>
<p>It is often claimed that the classic theoretical binary between structure and agency has long been overcome and abandoned. Any brief perusal of current debates in the humanities and social sciences will reveal this is as a nonsense, but the return of habit as a focus in scholarship allows us to highlight ongoing conceptual tensions which, rather than return us to the arid debates of the 1970s and 1980s, provide a productive way of grappling with these issues. As we suggested earlier, habit has been typically used to black-box complex social processes of subjectification. Once it takes the form of a black box, of course, it becomes a euphemism for ‘structural determination’: if we can’t or don’t examine the intricate patterns of social interaction that produce human conduct then we assume that there must be some inevitable logic within the black box. And once it is placed on the side of ‘structural determination’, then it necessarily becomes identified negatively. But, as William <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1357034X13485881">James (1899</xref>: 64) reminds us, ‘our virtues are habits as much as our vices’. In this sleight of hand, two crucial aspects of habit are backgrounded: its plasticity and its role in human creativity. The final run of articles in this special issue effect a critical conjunction of past and present approaches to habit in order to deepen our understanding of habit as an expressive mode linked intimately to questions of affect and mimesis.</p>
<p>Lisa Blackman uses the ‘forgotten’ history of 19th-century psychology for her investigation of habit: particularly the work of the neglected William McDougall, alongside the better-known work of Tarde, Bergson and James. This period represents a moment when the boundaries between what are now recognized as the discrete disciplines of psychology, sociology and philosophy, and others, were porous. Working genealogically with the concept of habit that travelled across disciplinary boundaries allows her to look at how different concepts of habit have been put to work in different ways, rather than making a claim about the ‘true’ definition of the concept.</p>
<p>Blackman uses this history to focus on the way an interrogation of habit disrupts our presumption of a clear and distinct boundary between nature and culture, inside and outside, self and other, the psychological and social. Central to her article is the foregrounding of the paradoxical nature of habit as entailing both regulation and the body’s potential for change and creativity, particularly in relation to affect modulation. McDougall is best known for developing a theory of instincts, and seeing habit in terms of the disciplining of bodies. However, as Blackman points out, his writing also draws upon vitalist traditions within philosophy and on the contemporary interest in hypnotic suggestion, mimesis and telepathy which, she argues, may contribute to a better understanding of the affective capacities of bodies and what she calls the ‘trans-subjective ontologies of personhood’.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Grosz’s article also captures the paradoxical nature of habit, arguing that habit, rather than being reduced to stasis, can also be understood as a mode of engagement. Drawing on Ravaisson, Bergson and Deleuze, her article works with various binaries – fixity/transition, past/future, action/milieu, mute/intensify, accommodation of/ accommodation to – but rather than try to resolve them, Grosz accepts them as productive, paradoxical junctures. Her approach allows her to foreground habit as a complex phenomenon which cannot be reduced to mechanical behaviour. The key to habit for Grosz is the way it provides an ‘anchor’ in an unstable world of endless change. It offers a predictability through compressing action. Habit, then, is the way the living adjust to the non-living and transform the non-living into an ‘accompaniment’ of life. Through habit, she argues, we tame our surroundings, rather than being tamed by them. Habit is therefore regulated by a double-law: through repetition it both mutes the impact of external forces and intensifies the impact of internal forces. In other words, habits enable one to get used to external forces; and habits enable one to use less and less force on internal forces. As the contraction of past activities into present actions, habit brings the past and the virtual to bear on the present and the actual. Through contraction, the present and the material come to be laden with potential, and the possibility of being otherwise. Habit thus orients the body to temporality.</p>
<p>This links nicely with Melanie White’s article contrasting Bergson and Durkheim. Her article focuses on the recurrent use of the metaphors of <italic>leaping</italic> in Bergson and <italic>lifting</italic>in Durkheim to explore how each thinker conceptualizes the social dimensions of habit. White argues that Bergson uses the theme of leaping to mark the difference between the pressure of habit found in ‘closed’ societies and the aspiration to creative emotion in ‘open’ societies. In contrast, Durkheim uses the language of lifting to describe how society elevates the individual from their egoistic tendencies by the collective effervescence that energizes collective habits. She contends not simply that the language of leaping and lifting gives us powerful conceptual tools to examine these writers’ contrasting conceptions of the social, but also that these offer different perspectives on the way emotion, as a creative force, attaches us to the social. While Durkheim uses emotion as a way of turning <italic>to</italic> habit, White argues, Bergson uses it as a means to turn <italic>away</italic>from habit.</p>
<p>Our final two articles, comprising the Commentary section, provide something of an overview on the subject of habit and its historical role in liberal government, and its relation to our attempts to understand that history through our own practices of research. Mary Poovey raises these issues through a study of the role of habit in classical liberalism pursued through the means of the electronic search function of a digital archive, in this instance the database of the Online Library of Liberty maintained by the Liberty Fund, an organization with a high profile in the dissemination of a particular canon of texts in the history of political thought. In a sense, then, Poovey’s research is on the relationship between habit and liberalism as portrayed in the texts selected by this organization which, as Poovey notes, with a few notable exceptions, is significantly biased towards the western, particularly Anglo-American intellectual traditions with the greatest weight placed on the 18th and 19th centuries. This research bears out the findings of many of the other texts here in pointing to the complex relationship between liberalism and habit, with some authors suggesting that enslavement to habit is contrary to the notion of individual self-fulfilment, while others develop a sense that the cultivation of good habits was central to the operation of free society.</p>
<p>In essence habit figures as both problem and solution in liberalism. There was certainly a strand of liberalism that sought to stigmatize subjects of colonial rule in terms of their habitual behaviour, in opposition to wilful or reasonable behaviour. Equally there were English traditions that explained their apparently unique retention of liberties, in contrast to the apparent triumph of despotism on continental Europe, to the customary practices of the English. This tension is explored through the conception of habit as a ‘switchpoint’. If it provided a means through which individuals could operate as parts of large social wholes, it also functioned as a way for social scientists to extend their analyses from the individual to the social scale. This Poovey locates in a general trajectory in which the treatment of habit shifts from the metaphysical to the moral-psychological to the relationship between the individual and the social–though not, it should be noted, in a straightforward chronological transition. This problematic lies at the heart of liberalism: how can the individual be understood as free and self-determining if they are also subject to the wider forces of society?</p>
<p>These issues are further explored in Tom Crook’s response to Mary Poovey’s text. Crook takes up Poovey’s point that the term ‘habit’ originally had a twin meaning: referring, first, to one’s dress and outward appearance and, second, to internal dispositions. In terms of the latter he draws out the Victorian distinction between habit and custom, the former figuring as the consequence of the latter, or the individual acts of behaviour rather than practices common to bodies of men: customs are followed and are national and social, habits are acquired and are personal. Habit in this sense is rooted in the mind or body of the individual. Once again, we return to habit as the switchpoint between the individual and the social, but modified in relation to the concern with the ‘avalanche of printed numbers’, the development of statistical analysis which was so characteristic of the early Victorian period, coupled with the new social scientific methods of social investigation. Of course, these concerns are radically different from Poovey’s meditations on the search term in the digital age, but they once again draw out the significance of habit in relation to the history of the social scientific enterprise itself, and especially the extent to which ‘habit’ has functioned as an explanation in social science, particularly an explanation for that most problematic of relationships: between the individual and the social, the body and society, mankind and the environment. The malleability of habit as a concept and its capacity to function as ‘switchpoint’, Crook suggests, has been the source of its success as a mode of social explanation which can be deployed in an array of contexts, of which liberalism is only one.</p>

<title>Habit Now</title>
<p>Where, then, is habit now? The question is different from our opening questions – why habit? and why now? – and more difficult to answer. This is partly because, although we have ranged across discussions of habit from Aristotle through to Deleuze, we have focused more on some traditions than on others and, indeed, have neglected some entirely. Our treatment of the spheres of practical application in which discourses of habit have become entangled has been similarly selective. There are many spheres of life we have not engaged with in which questions of habit and their transformation are matters of widespread everyday, practical concern. Wikepedia reports that Stephen Covey’s <italic>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change</italic>, a self-help manual for success in business, had logged up combined book and CD sales of over 40 million by 2011. If popular manuals of this kind abound, there is similarly no diminution of interest on the part of governments or other agencies with regard to how habit, or habits, might be changed. This is nowhere more evident than in the campaigns around healthy living, specifically eating, drinking, smoking, and taking regular exercise, which are frequently voiced in terms of habit as both problem and solution to the apparent problems of obesity and unfitness which are a contemporary obsession.</p>
<p>A second difficulty is that different approaches to the question are suggested by the range of positions that are canvassed across the different papers. As Elizabeth Grosz asks, and answers, the question as to where habit is today more directly in her contribution to this special issue than the other contributors, it will repay our attention to look briefly at the answer she proposes. While the significance of the Ravaisson–Bergson–Deleuze lineage is engaged with across a number of articles (Bennett, Carlisle and White, for example), these do not all share Grosz’s assessment of the ‘utterly transformative’ effects of this tradition. These consist, she argues, in its calling into question the assumption ‘that habits are that part of us that can be adjusted, altered, oriented in one way or another, manipulated to attain various goals’. The result of philosophical reflection rather than of any specifically interested form of knowledge concerned with bringing about changes in specific regions of behaviour, the Ravaisson–Bergson–Deleuze lineage is to be valued for its production of concepts. Its productivity in this regard consists in its reconceptualization of habit as occupying ‘the border between the absolutely constrained and the radically free’, and thereby transforming ‘the constrained into degrees of freedom, degrees of openness’. This ‘not only opens up the living being to the acquisition of new characteristics and capacities; it also opens up the universe to being otherwise … with its necessary complication of the present and the actual with the unspent forces of the past and the virtual’.</p>
<p>This is a compelling distillation of the effects of this lineage when understood on its own terms: that is, in acceding to philosophy its Deleuzeian conception as a practice that creates new concepts through processes that are distinct from the procedures informing the empirical disciplines of the life sciences and social sciences. From another perspective, however, such conceptions are interpretable as among the moves that philosophy makes as a means of organizing its own distinctive forms of power and effectivity – its own spheres of intervention – relative to the empirical disciplines. Ian Hunter’s work has pointed in this direction for some time in reviewing the mechanisms and devices though which philosophers, from Kant through Husserl to the moment of theory, have cultivated various ways of withdrawing from the world in order to produce distinctive forms of authority within it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1357034X13485881">Hunter, 2006</xref>). From this perspective, the Ravaisson–Bergson–Deleuze lineage would need to be assessed in terms of the forms of authority it has opened up for philosophy relative to other disciplines with regard to the debates about the ways of shaping and directing behaviour that the concept of habit has always been implicated in. It is also in this connection pertinent to recall Foucault’s strictures in <italic>The Birth of Biopolitics</italic>(2008) against posing questions of governance and questions of freedom as opposites. Freedom, he argues, has constantly to be made up as a set of attributes that liberal forms of government work through and depend on for their exercise. And philosophy, in its various accounts of the relations between habit, will and instinct, between innovation, creativity and innovation, has been no idle historical bystander with regard to these processes.</p>
<p>All of which is by way of saying that, as these articles attest, habit today is still disputed territory, still an aspect of conduct whose interpretation is contested, and still a significant locus for debates and empirical research concerning the issues that are at stake in the variable ways in which freedom, human capacities and governance are understood and interpreted.</p>

<p>The workshop ‘Habit, Governance, the Social’ was held in April 2010 at the Centre for Cultural Research (CCR, now the Institute for Culture and Society) at the University of Western Sydney (UWS) in Parramatta. We jointly organized the workshop on behalf of CCR, the ESRC Centre for Research on Socio-cultural Change (CRESC) at the Open University and the University of Manchester, and the Institute for the History of the Production of Knowledge at New York University. In addition to the articles collected here, papers were presented by Barry Hindess from the Australian National University (ANU), Shannon Sullivan from Penn State University, Ghassan Hage from the University of Melbourne and Megan Watkins from CCR. The workshop was greatly enriched by the contributions of our discussants: Ien Ang and Kay Anderson from CCR, David Bissell from ANU, Anna Gibbs from the College of Arts at UWS and Ruth Barcan from the University of Sydney.</p>

<p>The British Phenomenological Society, for example, convened a symposium on ‘Habit as Second Nature’ at the University of Oxford in April 2010. An edited selection of the papers presented at this symposium has since been published as a special <italic>Habit</italic> issue of the <italic>Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology</italic> (42 (1), January 2011). Habit has also become a lively topic in the ecological humanities, where its role in programmes of environmental management and climate change has been foregrounded: see, for example, Gay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1357034X13485881">Hawkins (2006</xref>) and Matt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1357034X13485881">Grist (n.d.)</xref>.

That said, the distinction he proposes (seeing habit as involuntary and participation in custom and tradition involving some kind of elective component) is merely one variant among many possibilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1357034X13485881">Tönnies (1961</xref>) distinguishes custom and habit clearly, but on quite different grounds. Interpreting habit as a kind of congealed will – ‘that is, will which has become lord and master through practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1357034X13485881">Tönnies, 1961</xref>: 34) – he casts custom in the role of a conservative halter on the dynamics that translate new cycles of volition into the real and essential form of will as habit.</p>

<p>The Tarde revival has so far paid little attention to Tarde’s influence on the tradition of Americanist anthropology represented by Franz Boas and his students. Yet this was significant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1357034X13485881">Boas (1911</xref>) drew on Tarde in his account of the significance of imitation in both civilized and savage societies while Clark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1357034X13485881">Wissler (1923</xref>), one of Boas’s students and his successor at the American Museum of Natural History, drew on Tarde’s account of imitation as crucial to the diffusion of cultural traits from one cultural area to another.</p>

<p>Tarde’s work is somewhat less singular if viewed from the perspective of the role that he accords the aesthetic and genius, as sources of creative innovation, in relation to processes of imitation. Vincent-Antonin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1357034X13485881">Lepinay (2007</xref>) usefully highlights these questions in his discussion of the role that ‘germ capital’ plays in Tarde’s rebuttal of the labour theory of value. The product of genius, germ capital introduces discontinuity into the purely repetitive processes which convert labour into capital accumulation; it provides a new model which labour henceforth merely copies mechanically and automatically. It is only the capacity for innovation provided by genius, the sole source of value, that provides the conditions for new cycles of accumulation. As such the accumulation of value is dependent on the unequal distribution of leisure as the necessary precondition for creative innovation. The purely repetitive role of labour adds nothing. Tarde’s argument here echoes the distinction between liberal and mechanical occupations that was central to the role that the aesthetic played in the early formulations of liberal government in distinguishing its subjects (those with free time) from its objects (those subject to the constraints of necessity and the intellectual closures produced by the routines of repetitive labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X13485881">Klein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1357034X13485881">Poovey, 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1357034X13485881">1994b</xref>]).</p>

<p>These are not, though, the only perspectives from which Dewey’s work has been returned to in the context of present debates on habit. Shannon Sullivan’s work attempts to effect some rapprochement between Dewey’s work and post-Freudian theory in her approach to racism as a form of unconscious habit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1357034X13485881">Sullivan, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1357034X13485881">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1357034X13485881">2006</xref>). Terrance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1357034X13485881">Macmullan (2009</xref>) has taken issue with the uses Sullivan makes of Dewey for this purpose.</p>
