<abstract>
<p>Maternal imprisonment can disrupt the mother–child relationship, resulting in social, emotional and physical consequences for both mothers and their children. There are a number of programmes that seek to foster this relationship during imprisonment. However, research to date can only comment on any short term impact of these programmes. On the basis of a review of the existing research, this article argues that a much stronger evidence base is needed, particularly in relation to the longer term impact of prison programmes that support the mother–child relationship. With many mothers typically resuming their parenting responsibilities post-release, we must be clear that these programmes provide women with the foundation, knowledge and skills to support and strengthen their family relationships upon release. </p>

<title>Imprisoning mothers – punishing children</title>
<p>The negative impact on children of sending a mother to prison is axiomatic within current literature. Since the 1960s, studies have shown that maternal incarceration is linked to poor outcomes for children and their mothers. Maternal incarceration and its associated separation can disrupt the mother–child relationship, partly because mothers can no longer fulfil the roles associated with being a parent. Maternal imprisonment also has significant practical, economic, interpersonal, social and emotional implications for families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0264550513478318">Woodward, 2003</xref>). Therefore, children as well as offenders are punished though imprisonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0264550513478318">Cunningham, 2001</xref>). Although the majority of research has focused on describing the impact of maternal incarceration on children, there is a growing interest in examining the effectiveness of prison programmes that aim to negate this impact and support the mother–child relationship. </p>
<p>In line with international trends, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of women being imprisoned in Australia over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0264550513478318">Gelb, 2010</xref>). Although women represent a very small proportion of the total prison population, this increase is problematic due to their primary carer responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0264550513478318">Department of Justice, 2005</xref>) and the range of complex problems they present with. Recent initiatives, for example the <italic>Better Pathways Policy</italic> in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0264550513478318">Department of Justice, 2005</xref>) and in the UK, the <italic>Corston Report</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0264550513478318">Corston, 2007</xref>) challenge authorities to focus on the particular needs of female prisoners, particularly their connections to their families and children. It has been reported that approximately two-thirds of women in prison are mothers to dependent children (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0264550513478318">Glaze and Maruschak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0264550513478318">Sheehan, 2010</xref>). </p>
<p>Incarcerated mothers and their children are an extremely vulnerable and marginalized social group. This is partly because a range of pre-, during and post-imprisonment factors have the potential to break the bonds of the mother–child relationship (Murray, 2005). Life before imprisonment is often characterized by chronic poverty, unstable housing, poor education and employment outcomes, substance abuse, mental health problems including self-harm and suicide, family violence, poor physical health and child abuse and neglect; characteristics that reduce effective parenting and provide a unique pathway to female incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0264550513478318">Byrne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0264550513478318">Commonwealth Office for the Status of Women, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0264550513478318">Dalley, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0264550513478318">Department Of Justice, 2002</xref>, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0264550513478318">Greene et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0264550513478318">Loucks, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0264550513478318">Sheehan, 2010</xref>). These pre-existing vulnerabilities are further compounded by experiences during the prison sentence, which can negate women’s role and confidence as mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0264550513478318">Barry and Eigenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0264550513478318">Enos, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0264550513478318">Martin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0264550513478318">Raikes and Lockwood, 2009</xref>), leading to mental health concerns and fear that they will lose their children’s love (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0264550513478318">Barry and Eigenberg, 2003</xref>). Returning to the community after imprisonment is also problematic for mothers. They have poor access to community support services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264550513478318">Arditti and Few, 2006</xref>); experience stresses associated with family reunification – partly due to financial stress and children’s challenging behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0264550513478318">McIvor et al., 2009</xref>); with limited supports being available specifically for mothers exiting prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0264550513478318">Flynn and Lawlor, 2008</xref>). It is clear that the impact of incarceration on the mother–child relationship extends beyond confinement.</p>
<p>Children themselves directly display negative outcomes arising from the imprisonment of their mothers. The literature commonly identifies practical problems such as displacement from their home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0264550513478318">Murray and Murray, 2010</xref>), and unstable care arrangements (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0264550513478318">Healy et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0264550513478318">2001</xref>). Problems for children are also seen to be personal – in their physical, behavioural, emotional, social and academic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0264550513478318">Woodward, 2003</xref>). Social isolation/withdrawal, social stigma and a range of strong emotions such as grief and loss, depression and shame are also common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0264550513478318">Flynn, 2008</xref>). The extent to which these become problematic is likely to be mediated by other factors occurring pre-, during and post-imprisonment (Murray, 2005).</p>

<title>Supporting the mother–child relationship</title>
<p>A large number of prison-based programmes have been developed around the world to address the challenges faced by mothers and their children. These programmes aim to enhance parenting skills and contact during the imprisonment period. Despite this growth in service provision, there are very few published long term effectiveness studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0264550513478318">Perry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0264550513478318">Young and Smith, 2000</xref>), with research to date typically focusing on the short term, prison-based, impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0264550513478318">Young and Smith, 2000</xref>). It is vital, however, to determine the long term impact of these programmes as mothers will typically resume their parental responsibilities post-release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0264550513478318">Healy et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0264550513478318">2001</xref>). Female prisoners must have the skills to maintain and strengthen their relationships with their children, as the post-release environment has the potential to disrupt these relationships (Murray, 2005). Therefore, mothers must leave prison with better skills and knowledge than when they entered. </p>
<p>To distil and examine the broad key features of these programmes, this review grouped these programmes into four categories: children in prison, contact maintenance, family support and parenting programmes. </p>

<sec id="section3-0264550513478318">
<title>Children in prison programmes</title>
<p>Children in prison programmes, or prison nurseries, are an internationally emerging trend within female correctional facilities. These programmes typically provide a finite number of mother–child beds for women; specifically for those who are pregnant or have young children when they enter the facility, who have been convicted of a ‘non-serious’ crime and do not have a past history of child abuse/neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0264550513478318">Villanueva et al., 2009</xref>). The programmes provide the mothers with professional, educational and parenting support throughout their stay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0264550513478318">Villanueva et al., 2009</xref>). The goal of these programmes is to support the bonding between the mother and child, provide the mothers with tools to enhance parenting and reduce recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0264550513478318">Villanueva et al., 2009</xref>). </p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0264550513478318">Carlson (2001</xref>) conducted a review of the prison nursery at the Nebraska Correctional Centre for Women, which at the time, was one of the few in-prison nurseries in North America. Self reports from mothers involved indicated that they felt that the nurseries fostered strong bonds with their children and increased their self-esteem and confidence; with the review indicating that overall the nursery and its associated policies and practices reduced misconduct reports, drug use and recidivism rates amongst the imprisoned mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0264550513478318">Carlson, 2001</xref>). A more recent review of prison nurseries in nine US states reiterated these trends, indicating that involvement in these nurseries reduces recidivism, prevents child placement in foster care and allows for the formation of mother–child bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0264550513478318">Villanueva et al., 2009</xref>). Supporting this, Byrne et al.’s (2010) assessment of the attachment of 30 infants residing with their mother in a New York prison nursery indicated that imprisoned mothers can raise infants who are securely attached to them at rates which are comparable to normative community samples (60% : 62%). This finding was mediated by the length of stay in the nursery, with secure attachment styles more likely in prolonged, year-long, than brief stays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0264550513478318">Byrne et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that for some women the prison context can have a protective effect due to the support from other mothers and professionals, the provision of parenting education and the absence of drug and alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0264550513478318">Byrne et al., 2010</xref>). Outside of the US, there appears to be little published data on children in prison programmes, especially within an Australian or a United Kingdom context. Furthermore, research addressing the longer term outcomes of these programmes, aside from recidivism, is nascent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264550513478318">Goshin and Byrne, 2009</xref>). Media coverage in recent years, for example in Montreal, Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0264550513478318">Stone and Herald, 2011</xref>) about prison nurseries highlights the need for clear evidence about the impact of such programmes. </p>

<sec id="section4-0264550513478318">
<title>Contact maintenance programmes</title>
<p>Contact maintenance programmes include any prison policy or program that facilitates contact though telephone calls, letter writing and visiting, provides the mother and child with different contact experiences and opportunities for intimacy and dependability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0264550513478318">Murray and Murray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0264550513478318">Tuerk and Loper, 2006</xref>). It is difficult for imprisoned mothers and their children to remain in contact as most correctional facilities control the number and length of phone calls and place restrictions on the days and times of visitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0264550513478318">Snyder, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, visitation is limited by the distance and costs associated with travel to prisons, prison procedures and policies such as non-contact, insensitive custodial staff/officers, the intimidating prison environment and caregiver opinions around contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0264550513478318">Snyder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0264550513478318">Tudball, 2000</xref>). Research suggests that contact may reduce the trauma caused by separation and improve reunification upon release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0264550513478318">Tuerk and Loper, 2006</xref>). </p>
<p>The ‘incarceration of a parent should not be the sole criterion used to sever parental rights’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0264550513478318">Snyder et al., 2002</xref>: 39), with the literature suggesting that maintaining meaningful contact during the prison sentence can benefit both mothers and children. Frequent contact ensures the continuation of child and parental rights, reduces anxiety for the mothers and their children, allows children to adjust to maternal incarceration and fosters mother–child attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0264550513478318">Snyder et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0264550513478318">Healy et al. (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0264550513478318">2001</xref>) in one of the few Australian studies found that maintaining family relationships is important as it provides the inmate mother with a link to the outside world and a concrete motivation for change, including the reduced likelihood of recidivism.</p>
<p>There is, however, conflicting evidence surrounding the immediate benefits of contact maintenance programmes for mothers and children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0264550513478318">Poehlmann (2005</xref>) found that children aged two to seven years who visited their mother had a less positive representation of their mother than children who did not. In contrast, with older children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0264550513478318">Block and Potthast (1998</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0264550513478318">Trice and Brewster (2004</xref>) reported positive effects for adolescents who had regular contact with their imprisoned mothers. The age of children is an area which would benefit from further examination. In relation to the imprisoned mothers themselves, similar contrasting evidence exists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264550513478318">Casey-Acevedo et al. (2004</xref>: 425–426) found that women who had visits showed ‘a higher probability of engaging in both serious and violent infractions’ post visitation. The authors speculated that this may be a result both of visiting being an emotional experience and women having little or no capacity to intervene in any difficulties children may be experiencing in the community; they acknowledged, however, that their findings did not indicate a cause–effect relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264550513478318">Casey-Acevedo et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, a consequent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0264550513478318">Tuerk and Loper (2006</xref>) found that increased visits reduced the levels of parenting stress reported by the mothers, particularly in relation to feelings of competence and attachment. Again, these authors caution that these findings do not indicate a causal relationship. In comparing these two studies, it seems probable that measurements of mothers’ behaviour and their reports of stress are not equivalent. To date, the focus of these evaluations has been on the visiting experiences during the prison sentence; there appears to be little focus on the effectiveness of such programmes over the longer term. </p>

<sec id="section5-0264550513478318">
<title>Family support programmes</title>
<p>Family support programmes encompasses a range of programmes that offer one-to-one support, advocacy and referral for prisoners and their families, with the goal to maintain and strengthen family ties and promote resettlement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264550513478318">Boswell et al., 2010</xref>). In a study conducted in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0264550513478318">Loucks (2005</xref>) used a mixed method approach with prison staff, non-government organizations, prisoners and their families to determine good family support practice. The study found that family support workers were able to promote better ties between prisoners, their families and prison staff resulting in improved communication and reduced tension between these groups. However, this effect was dependent on appropriate training, resources and support from prison staff and management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0264550513478318">Loucks, 2005</xref>). Similar issues, on a much smaller scale are noted in Flynn and Lawlor’s (2008) case study detailing how support and services were managed for a large sibling group whose mother was imprisoned. A defining feature of successful collaborative practice and positive outcomes for the children was the role of the prison-based family support worker. This worker was identified to play a key role in communication; bridging the gap between the prison and the community, as well as ensuring attention to the imprisoned woman’s role as a mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0264550513478318">Flynn and Lawlor, 2008</xref>). Broadly, however, similar to the other programme categories, no evidence was found on the longer term effects of such programmes, aside from reducing re-offending after release. This may be an consequence of the challenge of defining ‘maintaining family ties’; this is a subjective outcome which is hard to quantify and measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264550513478318">Boswell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0264550513478318">Loucks, 2005</xref>) </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0264550513478318">
<title>Parenting programmes</title>
<p>Many correctional facilities provide educational programmes as a means for improving prisoner knowledge and skills in parenting, communication and child development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0264550513478318">Loper and Tuerk, 2011</xref>); with evidence suggesting that the parenting experienced by prisoners was itself poor, and that they are ill-prepared to parent their own children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0264550513478318">Eddy and Reid, 2003</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0264550513478318">Loper and Tuerk (2006</xref>: 2011) report that programmes addressing prisoner parenting needs are rarely systematically evaluated. They often target specific parent populations (i.e. mothers to young children) and vary considerably in financial and institutional support, content, length and depth and facilitator expertise. Furthermore, although in many cases incarcerated mothers report improvements such as reduced stress, improved communication with the child’s carer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0264550513478318">Loper and Tuerk, 2011</xref>) and improved knowledge of child development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0264550513478318">Sandifer, 2008</xref>), it is a clear limitation that most have few opportunities to put what they have learnt into practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0264550513478318">Loper and Tuerk, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0264550513478318">2011</xref>). This limits the benefits of parenting programmes as well as our understanding of their impact. This is also noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0264550513478318">Perry et al. (2011</xref>) in their recent evaluation of a parenting programme in New South Wales women’s prisons. Whilst some benefits were described such as an increase in knowledge of child development and child appropriate discipline and communication strategies, the authors recommended cautious interpretation of the findings, given that the outcomes were based on mothers’ self reports, not observation of mother–child interactions, and there was a poor response rate at post-release follow up.</p>

<title>Where to from here?</title>
<p>This review indicates that programmes that aim to support the mother–child relationship during a prison sentence have the capacity to foster and support relationships during imprisonment; with key influential programme features being the acknowledgement and support of the prisoner’s mothering role and the basic maintenance of the mother–child connection. However, the extent to which any benefits from these programmes are transferred into women’s lives post-release remains unclear. Whilst prison programmes are developed to meet an important need, they are rarely systematically evaluated, either over the short term, in prison, or in the long term, after release. Given the body of knowledge about the challenges of transition from prison and community re-entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264550513478318">Arditti and Few, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0264550513478318">Flynn and Lawlor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0264550513478318">McIvor et al., 2009</xref>), this longer term view of programme effectiveness must also gain a fuller understanding of the factors that may actively militate against the impact of prison programmes into the post-release period. This will provide key information about both the targeting and timing of interventions. It is imperative that a solid evidence base is developed, to ensure responsiveness to these women and their dependent children, who remain one of the most marginalized and hidden social groups. </p>
