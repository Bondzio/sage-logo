<p>This article responds to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811406893">Gray’s (2010)</xref> and Gray and Coates’ (2010) responses to <italic>A Reflection on Indigenization Discourse in Social Work</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872811406893">Huang and Zhang, 2008</xref>) and extends the discussion of indigenization in social work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872811406893">Huang and Zhang (2008)</xref> reviewed the literature on indigenization in social sciences and social work and indicated four problems about the indigenization in social work. They illustrated that the proponents of indigenization blindly adhered to indigenous culture and questioned Western values and principles. They also argued that it is an empty statement to say that social problems and people’s needs should be addressed in local contexts and that Western social work cannot work well in other societies. Furthermore, they pointed out that the proponents of indigenization not only overemphasized the differences between Western culture and indigenous culture, but also overemphasized the commonalities within Western culture and indigenous culture. Finally, they suggested that the argument of professional imperialism in social work needs further examination.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811406893">Gray (2010)</xref> responded to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872811406893">Huang and Zhang’s (2008)</xref> arguments and suggested that Huang and Zhang overlooked many issues in indigenization. She indicated that indigenization in social work was not normative but brought out different voices and ways of knowing within particular socio-historical and cultural locations, thus establishing ‘a local basis for localized social work practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872811406893">Gray and Coates, 2008</xref>: 19, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811406893">Gray, 2010</xref>: 124). She also pointed out that literature on indigenization is largely critical of social work practice that pays little attention to local culture in indigenous societies. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811406893">Gray and Coates (2010)</xref> argued that indigenization can be seen as a movement to ‘pursue culturally and locally relevant research’ (p. 613) and to develop ‘indigenized and culturally appropriate social work knowledges’ (p. 613). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020872811406893">Rankopo and Osei-Hwedie (2011)</xref> also consented that cultural and social environments are important for social work practice and education.</p>
<p>This article first responds to the arguments for indigenization by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811406893">Gray (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811406893">Gray and Coates (2010)</xref>. We indicate that it is an inherent professional requirement for social workers to use different ways to develop an understanding of specific locations and to do locally relevant practice and research. From the Chinese perspective, we then address some underlying points of indigenization in social work. Given the importance of the concept of culture in indigenization discourse, we also have a discussion about it.</p>
<sec id="section1-0020872811406893">
<title>Indigenization as an inherent requirement of the social work profession</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811406893">Gray (2010)</xref> argued that indigenization brought out different voices and ways of knowing within particular socio-historical and cultural locations and established a local basis for localized social work practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811406893">Gray and Coates (2010)</xref> also regarded indigenization as a way to develop indigenous social work knowledge, which is based on culturally and locally relevant and problem-oriented research. They perceived that indigenization and internationalization are complementary and proposed that indigenization is a naturally occurring process in social work knowledge development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020872811406893">Rankopo and Osei-Hwedie (2011)</xref> emphasized the similar view that indigenization was important for the development of a locally relevant social work knowledge and practice. We agreed with such a view that social workers need to be sensitive to local culture and other characteristics and should thereon base social work practice, education and research. To achieve this goal, our social workers should listen to different voices and use different ways of knowing to develop a better understanding of the culture and other characteristics of different locations. However, such a view is an inherent and basic requirement of the social work profession.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872811406893">Huang and Zhang (2008)</xref> indicated that understanding and addressing problems and needs within locality-specific social, historical, cultural and political contexts is an inherent assumption of social work practice, education and research. Besides this argument, a scrutiny of ethics in social work declared by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872811406893">International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) and International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW) (2004)</xref>, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020872811406893">National Association of Social Workers (NASW) (2008)</xref>, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872811406893">Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW) (2010)</xref> etc. suggested that it is a professional requirement for social workers to constantly improve their practice competence. For example, IFSW and IASSW (2000) state that ‘[s]ocial workers are expected to develop and maintain the required skills and competence to do their job’. AASW (2010) also states that ‘[s]ocial workers will act to maintain and expand their levels of current knowledge, theory and skill in order to provide quality service and accountable and transparent practice’ (p. 21). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020872811406893">NASW (2008)</xref> states that ‘[s]ocial workers continually strive to increase their professional knowledge and skills and to apply them in practice’. The above statements and the previous argument by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872811406893">Huang and Zhang (2008)</xref> imply that to be competent social workers, there is an inherent requirement for them to be keen to different voices and use different ways to develop an understanding of particular socio-historical and cultural locations for practice and research.</p>
<p>Local culture or context is everywhere. Every person also has a specific culture or context. Even if people are from a similar background, culture and context, they have been shaped by particular life experiences and other factors that come together to make them who they are. For professionals such as doctors, lawyers and social workers, it is an inherent and basic professional requirement to adjust themselves to different social and cultural contexts and attempt to develop and apply different knowledge and skills to work with different clients. This also requires them to hear other voices and use various ways to develop knowledge for practice and research. Otherwise, their professional practice will not be acknowledged by their clients and, eventually, they will lose their identity as professionals. In this sense, professionals need to be culturally or contextually sensitive in every encounter with a client and need to change or adjust the approach with every client. In other words, one aspect of being a professional is to conceptualize cultural or contextual sensitivity as being present in every practice encounter.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that a few social workers may not pay adequate attention to local culture and other contexts in their practice and research. It is possible that such a phenomenon is more obvious in non-Western societies. The critical comments to such practice and research are undoubtedly important for social work practitioners and researchers to improve practice and research. However, such a phenomenon is not specific or unique to indigenous societies. It is universal and is actually related to the professional development of social workers in all societies. In other words, social workers in Western and other societies all need to continually strive to develop a better understanding of their working locations and clients in order to increase their professional knowledge and skills for the improvement of their practice or research. This is a basic professional requirement.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the above discussion of indigenization was mainly concerned about the development of locality-specific social work practice and research. In this respect, we have indicated that indigenization is an inherent and basic requirement or assumption for social workers and other professionals. However, as a postmodern view, indigenization involves such issues as the perceptions of Western and indigenous cultures, the perceptions of universal values or standards and the perceptions of modernization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811406893">Gray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872811406893">Gray and Fook, 2004</xref>). In the following section, we addressed the points of the proponents of indigenization in social work in these issues from the Chinese perspective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0020872811406893">
<title>Some points of indigenization in social work</title>
<p>The proponents of indigenization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811406893">Gray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811406893">Gray and Coates, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872811406893">Midgley, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872811406893">2008</xref>) argued that social work dominated by Western cultures cannot work well in other societies. They also questioned universal values or standards and modernization discourse. These are likely to bring harm to social work development.</p>
<sec id="section3-0020872811406893">
<title>The perception of Western and indigenous cultures</title>
<p>The indigenization discourse is based on the dichotomization of Western culture and indigenous culture. Their perception of Western and indigenous cultures has at least the following two problems.</p>
<p>First, the proponents of indigenization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811406893">Gray and Coates, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872811406893">Midgley, 1981</xref>) are mainly concerned about the mainstream culture in both Western and indigenous societies. For example, when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872811406893">Midgley (1981)</xref> questioned individualism, humanitarianism, liberalism, the work ethic and capitalism unrestricted by government intervention as valued by the Western founders of social work, he tended to overlook other non-mainstream cultures such as collectivism, social democracy and Marxism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872811406893">Eckstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872811406893">George and Wilding, 1994</xref>) in Western societies. In indigenous societies such as mainland China, the proponents of indigenization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020872811406893">Tsang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020872811406893">Wang, 2001</xref>) were mainly concerned about mainstream culture such as collectivism and Confucianism. They tended to neglect the values of individualism, humanitarianism, liberalism and capitalism unrestricted by government intervention. Some of these values and beliefs, such as individualism, were highly valued by many modern thinkers and academia in China, such as Hu Shih and Lu Xun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872811406893">Angle and Svensson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872811406893">Bishop, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872811406893">Lee, 1985</xref>), while some academia in China (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872811406893">Liu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872811406893">Qin and Su, 1996</xref>) valued liberalism and capitalism unrestricted by government intervention. However, their values and beliefs remain non-mainstream in China. In short, the proponents of indigenization tend to support the mainstream social thoughts, beliefs and values in indigenous societies, while these thoughts, beliefs and values are likely to be non-mainstream in Western countries. On the other hand, the proponents of indigenization tend to oppose or neglect those non-mainstream social thoughts, beliefs and values in indigenous societies, while many of the same are likely to be mainstream in Western societies. Although the proponents of indigenization in social work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811406893">Gray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811406893">Gray and Coates, 2010</xref>) claimed to take into account the diversity of culture, their arguments actually serve to oppress non-mainstream thinkers and people’s pursuit of individualism, humanitarianism, liberalism and capitalism unrestricted by government intervention in indigenous societies such as mainland China. It should also be noted that Western societies are not born with such values as individualism, humanitarianism and liberalism. These values have evolved to be mainstream, partly because of the propagating of these concepts by thinkers and insistent promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872811406893">Russell, 1945</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020872811406893">Skirbekk and Gilje, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the proponents of indigenization in social work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811406893">Gray and Coates, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872811406893">Midgley, 1981</xref>) neglected the different social and historical development stages, or political systems, between Western societies and indigenous society. For example, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872811406893">Marshall’s (1950)</xref> theory of citizenship, in Western societies such as Britain, civil rights, political rights and social rights formed parts of a gradual sequential development in legal and political life. The development of civil rights in the 18th century, including liberty of the person, the right to own property and to conclude valid contracts, freedom of speech, thought and faith and the right to justice, set the foundation for individual freedom. After the attainment of civil rights, the next move was towards universal suffrage and political participation in the 19th century. The attainment of civil and political rights then set the path towards the third stage of social rights in the 20th century – the welfare state in which all citizens are able to enjoy the protections of the society. In short, Western societies such as Britain and the USA had already attained civil and political rights. However, in many developing countries such as mainland China, there is presently a lack of the right to own property, freedom of speech, universal suffrage and other rights. For example, the implementation of the <italic>hukou</italic> (household registration) system in mainland China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872811406893">Hu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020872811406893">Wang, 2005</xref>) restricts population migration, especially migration from rural areas to urban areas, and institutionalizes inequality and discrimination against rural people. Given the above-mentioned differences between Western societies and mainland China, people in Western societies have already had the freedom to choose their beliefs, values and behaviors, while in mainland China, people still need to attempt to obtain the freedom of beliefs, values and behaviors. The proponents of indigenization in social work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811406893">Gray and Coates, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872811406893">Midgley, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020872811406893">Tsang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020872811406893">Wang, 2001</xref>) neglected the above differences between Western and indigenous societies and claimed to respect indigenous culture. This tends to imply that tyranny or the lack of freedom of beliefs, values and behaviors is indigenous culture and helps to sustain or legitimize social and political structure that brings oppression to indigenous people.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020872811406893">
<title>The perception of universal values or standards</title>
<p>The proponents of indigenization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872811406893">Midgley, 2008</xref>) have questioned universal values or standards. This perception also deserves examination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872811406893">Bok (2002)</xref> argued that a minimalist set of values can exist across cultures, such as the values of mutual support and loyalty to fellow members of the group, avoidance of violence, betrayal and deceit practiced on members of the group, and a form of justice that is fair in the application of group’s rules to all members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872811406893">Annan (2003)</xref> also pointed out that either local communities or the global community needs to be bound together by common values upon which its members know what to expect of each other. He also indicated that some shared principles are necessary for people to manage their differences without resorting to violence. He further claimed that human rights and universal values are almost synonymous. Regarding the common values in both Chinese and Western Cultures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872811406893">Yu (2006)</xref> made the following statement:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If history is any guide, then there seems to be a great deal of overlapping consensus in basic values between Chinese culture and Western culture. After all, recognition of common humanity and human dignity is what the Chinese Tao has been about (p. 4).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A brief search of ethical codes of social work associations (e.g. AASW, 2010; China Association of Social Workers (CASW), 2005, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872811406893">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872811406893">IFSW and IASSW, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020872811406893">NASW, 2008</xref>) can also easily reveal that many common values such as respect for clients, respect for diversity, social justice and client self-determination are human rights expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other United Nations’ international documents.</p>
<p>Although the proponents of indigenization were rarely concerned about the indigenization of social work values, their attempts to dismiss universal values and standards were fraught with danger. Their attempts may not only leave social workers ill-equipped to confront structural oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872811406893">Ife, 2000</xref>), but also prevent vulnerable people from realizing basic human rights in some societies. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872811406893">Habermas (1981)</xref> suggested that universalism is fundamental to any rational criticism, and that to abandon universalism is to abandon the intentions of the Enlightenment discourse. In addition, it is a paradox that when the proponents of indigenization in social work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872811406893">Gray and Fook, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872811406893">Midgley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020872811406893">Wang, 2001</xref>) argue that there is not universal value or standard, the view that there is not universal value or standard itself thus becomes a universal value or standard.</p>

<sec id="section5-0020872811406893">
<title>The perceptions of modernization</title>
<p>The proponents of indigenization in social work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811406893">Gray and Coates, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872811406893">Midgley, 1981</xref>) questioned modernization discourse but did not have a clear vision about the kind of society that our social workers should attempt to achieve. They claimed to respect indigenous culture, which tends to imply that existing culture or traditions should be preserved and social workers cannot and should not attempt change. To take mainland China as an example, the proponents of indigenization in social work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020872811406893">Tsang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020872811406893">Wang, 2001</xref>) did not provide a direction for social workers to make changes. They valued traditional Chinese culture such as Confucianism, and existing social and political policies such as socialist market economy and the population and family planning policy. It seems that they perceived the existing social, political and cultural arrangements as predestination and perceived adhering to these arrangements as the priority of social work practice.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872811406893">Epstein (1992)</xref> argued that if the top priority in the third world is the pursuit of a material sufficiency, modernization is very desirable or the only possible strategy. Therefore, he indicated that social work’s role in the third world is not to follow the direction of postmodernism, but to support modernization through providing services to marginal populations and contributing to the development of a humane civic culture. With respect to mainland China, it was estimated that between 1981 and 2004, the percentage of the population consuming less than a dollar per day fell from 65 percent to 10 percent, and the absolute number of poor fell from 652 million to 135 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020872811406893">World Bank, 2009</xref>). If measured by the new international poverty standard of $1.25 per person per day (using 2005 Purchasing Power Parity for China), 27 percent of the population in China was in poverty in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020872811406893">World Bank, 2009</xref>). The World Bank also indicated that economic reforms that China adopted when it transitioned from a planned to a market-oriented economy have been central to China’s poverty reduction performance. It is clear that modernization was and remains a desirable way for China to pursue material sufficiency. Besides the pursuit of material sufficiency, modernization contributes to people’s autonomy and freedom and helps to establish and sustain democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872811406893">Inglehart and Welzel, 2005</xref>). If poverty reduction and the promotion of people’s autonomy and freedom as well as democracy are consistent with social workers’ commitment, then social workers should support and promote modernization instead of following the direction of postmodernism or indigenization.</p>
<p>In summary, the proponents of indigenization in social work are mainly concerned about the mainstream culture in both Western and indigenous societies. At the same time, they have neglected the different social and historical development stages or political systems between Western societies and indigenous societies. These are likely to obscure the political atrocities in some indigenous societies and hinder indigenous people from pursuing liberation and freedom. The proponents of indigenization also questioned universal values and modernization discourse. These are likely to hinder vulnerable people from realizing human rights and cause social work in indigenous societies to lose direction.</p>

<title>Problems with the emphasis on culture</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811406893">Gray and Coates (2010)</xref> stated that ‘[i]ndigenous social work is thus deliberately ethnocentric, as it seeks to highlight the unique culture and consequent plight of particular minority cultures and, in so doing, insists upon culturally sensitive and culturally specific knowledge and practices’ (p. 616). Gray and Coates recognized that the concept of culture is theoretically misleading and that terms like Western and indigenous culture are questionable. At the same time, based on the arguments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872811406893">Kjellgren (2003)</xref>, Gray and Coates recognized that in the field of anthropology, indigenization has not enhanced cross-cultural understanding but served as a tool for making the ‘other’ and the ‘native’. Besides the problems with the core concept of culture pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811406893">Gray and Coates (2010)</xref>, there are other problems about the emphasis of culture in indigenization.</p>
<p>First, as a crucial term in anthropology, the concept of culture has been under attack in the past decades by anthropologists. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872811406893">Goodenough (1976)</xref> argued that in complex societies, many microcultures and even macrocultures are inevitably subject to social and political manipulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872811406893">Hanson (1989)</xref> claimed that it was increasingly recognized that traditional culture is an invention constructed for contemporary purposes rather than a stable heritage from the past. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020872811406893">Wax (1993)</xref> also indicated that no culture can be deemed insular, given that the development of communication, commerce, and political and military relationships increasingly facilitates the joining of world nations into a global village. He warned that the Boas–Benedict model of plural, separate, distinct and historically homogeneous cultures was scientifically misleading. Besides anthropologists, other scholars, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872811406893">Garnham (2001)</xref> indicated that culture as an analytical term has become nearly valueless, because its definition has become vague and almost synonymous with human life. As an illustration, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872811406893">Fan (2000)</xref> reviewed a host of the definitions of culture and summarized that ‘culture can be described as the collection of values, beliefs, behaviours, customs, and attitudes that distinguish a society’ (p. 3). According to Fan’s summary of culture, it is hard to differentiate between culture and human life.</p>
<p>Second, the ethnocentric or culture-centered approach is likely to give people connection to a single group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020872811406893">Sen (2006)</xref> highlighted that while culture is important, it is not crucial to the identity of an individual, a group or even a country, because the influence of culture is modulated by many other factors such as race, class, gender and politics. Sen further indicated that when people focus on one strand of identity, such as culture, they are likely to run into trouble (i.e. leaving themselves vulnerable to manipulation by the proponents of ethnic chauvinism who have left a trail of bloodshed from Nazi Germany to Northern Ireland, Nigeria, Rwanda, India, Pakistan and far beyond). In addition, Sen articulated that the ethnocentric or culture-centered approach of identity, a singular-affiliation type of reduction, gives human beings a one-dimensional identity. This leads to a miniaturization of humanity, with everyone locked up in tight little boxes from which they emerge only to attack one another. In short, according to Sen’s arguments, it is an illusory and destructive tendency to categorize humanity in terms of a single identity, such as culture.</p>
<p>The above critiques further imply that the division of Western culture and indigenous culture and the emphasis of culture in indigenization discourse in social work should be seriously examined. Ignorance of or indifference to these critiques is likely to misdirect some social workers’ energies.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article responds to the arguments for indigenization in social work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811406893">Gray (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811406893">Gray and Coates (2010)</xref>. We indicate that it is an inherent professional requirement for social workers to be keen to different social and cultural environments and develop locality-specific research and practice. We also extend the discussion of indigenization in social work. It is pointed out that the proponents of indigenization focused largely on the mainstream culture in both Western and indigenous societies. They neglected the differences regarding the freedom to choose values, beliefs and behaviors in Western societies and the lack of freedom to do it in indigenous societies such as mainland China. Their questions or doubts about universal values or standards and modernization may hinder vulnerable people from realizing human rights and cause social work in indigenous societies to lose direction. In addition, the problems with the emphasis on culture in indigenization are addressed. Suggestions are provided to take caution about the division of Western and indigenous cultures and the emphasis of culture in indigenization discourse in social work.</p>
