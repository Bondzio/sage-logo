<abstract>
<p>The use of fingernail glue in cosmetics is widespread, but the serious effects of spillage directly onto skin causing a burn have not been previously reported. We describe a 2-year-old male suffering full-thickness burns to the dorsum of his left foot 9 days after direct contact with cyanoacrylate-containing nail glue. Conservative management failed and formal surgical excision with skin grafting was needed. First aid advice from product safety and medical literature is ambiguous, as despite timely intervention with recommended measures, a serious burn injury resulted. Review of the literature revealed two other cases of indirect nail glue burns, both requiring surgery, with clothing acting as an interface between glue and skin, distinguishing it from our case. We propose possible mechanisms of injury and present this case to increase awareness of the consequences of contact with a seemingly trivial cosmetic chemical, recommend its better labelling and hope to educate medical professionals about this unusual, but serious mechanism of burn injury. This would obviate additional psychological stress on child and parents due to unnecessary referral to social services for investigation of a possible non-accidental injury.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1460408612467606" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fingernail glue use for applying artificial fingernails is widespread in women’s cosmetics in line with modern views on beauty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612467606">Baran, 2002</xref>). It can cause localised irritation on direct contact with skin, but there are no reported instances of a burn. We present the first case of a chemical burn from direct contact with commercially available cyanoacrylate fingernail glue, its management and a review of the literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1460408612467606" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 2-year-old male, who was previously fit and well, with no past medical history or allergies and up to date immunisations, sustained a chemical burn from the accidental spillage of a bottle of cyanoacrylate fingernail glue onto the dorsal aspect of his left foot. First aid was given immediately by the patient’s mother with an acetone-based nail polish remover. However, her further concerns about possible harmful effects of the accidental spillage led to his presentation at their local emergency department (ED) within 4 h of injury. The burn was initially thought to be superficial and managed conservatively by the ED physicians. At review, 6 days later, it appeared deeper, possibly infected and was referred to our regional paediatric burns service. Although an unusual mechanism of injury, normal child–parent interaction and a consistent history obviated the need for formal referral to paediatric or social services for a possible non-accidental injury.</p>
<p>On examination, there was a 2 × 2 cm<sup>2</sup> full-thickness wound on the dorsum of the left foot, moderate yellow exudate and no clinical signs of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408612467606">Figure 1</xref>). It was obvious at this point that surgical excision would be required. A wound swab was taken and the burn dressed with Acticoat® (Smith &amp; Nephew Medical Limited, Hull, UK). About 3 days later, the burn was tangentially excised and resurfaced with a split-thickness skin graft harvested from the left thigh with no immediate post-operative complications. The patient was discharged the same day and at first graft check 4 days later, more than 50% take was observed, but the rest of the graft was found to be malodorous, sloughy and wet. It was further cleaned and debrided in clinic, Bactroban Ointment® (Mupirocin 2%, GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, UK) was applied followed by a Mepilex Ag® dressing (Mölnlycke Healthcare, Gothenburg, Sweden). An initial wound swab showed heavy growth of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. After further changes of dressing, 14 days post-procedure, the majority of the graft site was well healed except for a small portion at its distal tip. The donor site had healed well and the wound was dressed as before. By day 36, all scars were fully healed and after assessment by an occupational therapist, a soft silicone dressing (Mepiform®, Mölnlycke Healthcare, Gothenburg, Sweden) was applied to the site of the burn wound as the scar now had a slightly elevated edge and there were concerns about risk of progression to hypertrophic scarring.

<sec id="sec3-1460408612467606" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main ingredient of nail glue is ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612467606">Clarke, 2011)</xref>, whereas tissue glues use butyl 2-cyanoacrylate, although the differences imparted by the different alkyl groups are unclear. Ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate use should be avoided in presence of basic compounds as it promotes polymerisation, rapid bonding with skin and localised irritation. Cyanoacrylates are unstable, particularly if moisture is present, causing an exothermic reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408612467606">Moossavi and Scher, 2001</xref>), although a fairly large volume would be required to cause a burn. Methyl- and ethyl-cyanoacrylate have demonstrated histotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408612467606">Toriumi et al., 1990</xref>) and contact of butyl-2-cyanoacrylate with well vascularised soft tissue can have an acute inflammatory effect and foreign body-type reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1460408612467606">Toriumi et al., 1991</xref>). Furthermore, manufacturers of this FDA-approved adhesive acknowledge application to wet wounds will accelerate polymerisation and produce excess heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408612467606">Histoacryl® Topical Skin Adhesive</xref>, TissueSeal, LLC).</p>
<p>The medical literature contains few relevant articles. A 28-year-old female patient presented with a <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-infected burn on her left inner thigh, 5 weeks after spillage of nail glue onto her denim jeans; the burn required excision and grafting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408612467606">Tang et al., 2006</xref>). The authors blamed sweat in the jeans as a source of moisture, together with residual washing detergent as a weak base, catalysing an exothermic reaction, causing the burn. In our patient, there was direct contact of glue with skin without any interface, so this mechanism does not seem applicable.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612467606">Clarke (2011)</xref> describes indirect contact (inferred from the described history) with cyanoacrylate-containing glue in a 2-year-old male, causing a 10 × 3 cm<sup>2</sup> full-thickness burn on the postero-medial area of the child’s right lower leg. The child wore cotton pyjamas at time of injury, but there is no description of first aid. This burn also required formal surgical intervention by tangential excision, resurfacing with a split-thickness skin graft and pressure garment therapy.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612467606">Linden et al. (1998)</xref> present three cases of injury caused by another common ingredient of nail glue, methacrylic acid or (poly) methylmethacrylate. Two patients ingested small volumes causing erythema and ulceration in their oropharynx. Both needed intubation and ventilation for respiratory failure and methaemoglobinaemia. Minor external perioral burns were treated with silver sulphadiazine and aloe, healing without scarring. Their third patient spilled 5–7 mL of 98.5% methacrylic acid present in a nail primer liquid onto his face, chest, right arm and flank. First aid involved rinsing with water, with patchy erythema seen on the affected areas 20 min later. Further rinsing with tepid water in a shower caused blistering of the chest, which were presumably partial thickness burns. The injuries were managed conservatively with silver sulphadiazine and aloe. The authors concluded that warning labels and product safety literature were inadequate in all three cases.</p>
<p>The incidence of burns due to chemicals and cleaners is a small proportion (7.5%) of all consumer product-related injuries reported in a large study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612467606">D’Souza et al., 2009</xref>), but allergic contact dermatitis can occur from the components of nail glue and nail polish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408612467606">Moossavi and Scher, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>There are a more than 70 types of nail glue product available commercially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408612467606">GoodGuide, 2012</xref>). The product safety sheets for widely available nail glues give broadly differing advice. In case of skin contact, instant nail glue (Star Nail International, Valencia, CA, USA) and INM OTD Fast Set Nail Glue (International Nail Manufacturers, Anaheim, CA, USA) recommend soaking the area in warm, soapy water and then rubbing or peeling the glue off the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408612467606">International Nail Manufacturers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612467606">Star Nail International, 2006</xref>) whereas others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612467606">Adhesive Systems, Inc., 2012</xref>) advise applying acetone-based nail polish remover to the affected area. Removal of excess cyanoacrylate-containing tissue adhesives used to close clean surgical incisions can also involve application of petroleum jelly to that area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408612467606">Maw et al., 1997</xref>). Our case illustrates that despite timely first aid in accordance with product recommendations, a deep burn is still possible.</p>
<p>The type and order of first aid measures for this situation needs urgent clarification and may be counter-intuitive, as it may emphasise the need to avoid soaking the wound in water as is common in other burns as applying water may increase heat release and chances of injury. In addition, there should be stronger warnings in the product safety literature and these dangers made more obvious on the bottle of glue itself, similar to warning symbols on bottles of household detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612467606">Linden et al., 1998</xref>). Although a larger case series would prove a stronger causal link, by sharing our experiences, we also hope any additional psychological distress to a child and their parents as a result of an unnecessary referral to social services may be avoided.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1460408612467606" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We report the case of a 2-year-old boy who required surgical excision of a full-thickness burn following accidental exposure of his skin to ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate containing nail glue. First aid recommendations for this range of beauty products are inconsistent and may even contribute to the worsening of injury. The potential consequences of a seemingly innocuous burn may include raising the possibility of non-accidental injury. This case will raise awareness of this uncommon injury and hopefully stimulate a reappraisal of safety advice from cosmetic product manufacturers.</p>
