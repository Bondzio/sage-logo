<abstract>
<p>Although the role of leadership has been emphasized in facilitating learning in the workplace, there is limited systematic research directly linked to leadership and learning. This study investigated the characteristics of leadership behaviors that facilitate workplace learning, using data from a survey of 228 nursing managers in 22 hospitals. Results of structural equation modeling indicate that encouraging reflective practice plays a central role in enhancing workplace learning, and reflective practice was facilitated by clarifying the mission of the unit and promoting role modeling. The findings suggest that reflective practice combined with goal setting and social learning promotes workplace learning. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The literature of workplace learning has expanded in volume and across diverse fields covering organization and management, sociology of work, labor, adult education, and human resource development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350507612440413">Fenwick, 2008</xref>). Considering the emergent notion of learning as the process of becoming a competent participant in a social and organizational process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507612440413">Brown and Duguid, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350507612440413">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350507612440413">Wenger, 1998</xref>), new opportunities for research and discussion in organizational learning have been provided by the rapid shift in focus toward workplace activities and work practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507612440413">Easterby-Smith et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In facilitating learning in an organization, the role of leadership has previously been emphasized. Creating the type of conditions that facilitate and sustain a favorable level of collective learning is one of the greatest challenges for leadership at all levels in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1350507612440413">Yukl, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its importance, there has been limited systematic research directly linking leadership and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507612440413">Berson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507612440413">Vera and Crossan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350507612440413">Waldman et al., 2009</xref>). In past research, the leadership-learning relationship has been investigated in terms of transactional-transformational leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350507612440413">Waldman et al., 2009</xref>) and critical management and reflexivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507612440413">Cunliffe, 2009</xref>). As there is no established scale on leadership of learning at the work unit level, it is necessary to conduct exploratory studies that examine managers who have good reputations for promoting learning in the workplace. The results should be compared with previous theoretical models of leadership to develop theory on leadership of learning.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this study was to clarify the characteristics of leadership behavior that facilitate workplace learning in medical organizations using data from a survey of nursing managers. This study focuses on learning at the work-unit level because the effect of leadership on learning seems to be stronger at the work-unit level than at the organizational level. In this article, leadership of learning is defined as leadership behaviors that facilitate learning in the workplace.</p>
<p>This study differs from previous work in the following three ways. First, leadership of learning was investigated in an exploratory way. Specifically, items on leadership behaviors were collected by interviewing managers who have good reputations for promoting workplace learning, and these were analyzed using data from a questionnaire using a scale-development method. Second, the present research examined the sequential relationship among leadership dimensions rather than analyzing them in parallel. By studying the sequential relationship among dimensions, it may be possible to find a mechanism for leadership of learning in the workplace. Third, this study focused on leadership behaviors that facilitate not only transformation or improvement of organizational routines, which is emphasized in research on transformational leadership, but also individual development in the workplace.</p>
<p>Nursing departments were selected as research sites because (1) nurses are required to continuously learn to adapt to changing environments, (2) nursing managers play important roles in promoting teamwork to provide high quality nursing services, and (3) nursing managers have clear responsibilities for specific hospital wards as professionals. These features allowed us to explore the leadership of learning in professional medical organizations.</p>
<p>The article is organized as follows. First, the literature on workplace learning, leadership of learning, and reflective practices is reviewed. Next, a research question is proposed based on the literature review. Then, the research method involving the survey of nursing managers is presented. Finally, results are presented and discussed from theoretical and practical viewpoints.</p>

<title>Theoretical background</title>
<sec id="section3-1350507612440413">
<title>Workplace learning</title>
<p>Definitions of learning have often been lacking because learning represents phenomena ranging from individual information acquisition to cultural transformation or even political emancipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350507612440413">Fenwick, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The scholars studying workplace learning have emphasized the work environment as an important learning site and have assumed that the learning potential of a specific work environment can be recognized, guided, and better exploited by analyzing existing activities, processes, and characteristics that currently shape the work environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350507612440413">Lans et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have assumed that workplace learning consists of three elements: individuals, groups, and learning outcome.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507612440413">Garavan et al. (2002)</xref>, workplace learning refers to a set of processes that occur within specific organizational contexts and involve the acquisition and assimilation of integrated clusters of knowledge, skills, values, and feelings that result in fundamental changes in the foci and behaviors of individuals and teams (p. 61). This definition involves components of organizational process, knowledge acquisition, and behavioral changes of individuals and teams.</p>
<p>Workplace learning can be viewed as group-level learning or a sub-process of organizational learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350507612440413">Edmondson (2002)</xref> argued that group-level analyses of organizational learning are important to connect individual-level factors such as cognition and behavior to organizational-level outcomes. Reviewing the research on workplace learning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350507612440413">Fenwick (2008)</xref> found that the literature includes both individual learning (e.g. individual knowledge acquisition and individual human development) and collective learning (e.g. sense making/reflective dialogue and communities-of-practice).</p>
<p>With regard to collective learning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1350507612440413">Zellmer-Bruhn and Gibson (2006)</xref> defined team learning as the extent to which a team created new processes and practices. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507612440413">Clarke (2005)</xref> distinguished between workplace learning environment and workplace learning outcome, where the former refers to the practices and behaviors that facilitate the latter. These studies suggest that group-level learning involves not only the creation of new processes and practices but also improvements in group performance.</p>
<p>Based on the studies described above, the present research defines workplace learning in terms of three aspects: individual learning (skill development of individual members), group level learning (process improvement), and learning outcome (quality of work unit performance).</p>

<sec id="section4-1350507612440413">
<title>Leadership and learning</title>
<p>Although little research has examined the linkage between leadership and organizational learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507612440413">Berson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350507612440413">Waldman et al., 2009</xref>), two empirical studies were published in the special issue of the <italic>Leadership Quarterly</italic> in 2009. These articles are based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507612440413">Bassâ (1985)</xref> framework of transformational/transactional leadership. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507612440413">Vera and Crossan (2004)</xref>, the concept of transformational and transactional leadership builds on prior research on relations-oriented versus task-oriented leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350507612440413">Fiedler, 1967</xref>), path-goal theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350507612440413">House and Mitchell, 1974</xref>), and charismatic or visionary leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350507612440413">House and Shamir, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350507612440413">Westley and Mintzberg, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507612440413">Avolio et al. (1999)</xref> showed that transformational leadership consists of four dimensions. Specifically, the transformational leader (1) behaves in admirable ways that cause followers to identify with the him/her by displaying conviction, taking stands, and appealing to followers on an emotional level (<italic>charisma, or idealized influence</italic>); (2) challenges followers with high standards, communicates optimism about future goal attainment, and provides meaning to the task at hand (<italic>inspirational motivation</italic>); (3) stimulates and encourages creativity in her/his followers by challenging assumptions, taking risks, and soliciting followersâ ideas (<italic>intellectual stimulation</italic>); and (4) attends to each followerâs needs, acts as a mentor or coach to the follower, and listens to the followerâs concerns and needs (<italic>individualized consideration</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507612440413">Avolio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507612440413">Judge and Piccolo, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, transactional leadership has three dimensions. Specifically, the transactional leader (1) clarifies expectations and establishes the rewards for meeting these expectations (<italic>contingent reward</italic>); (2) monitors followersâ behavior, anticipates problems, and takes corrective actions before the behavior creates serious difficulties (<italic>management by exception - active</italic>); and (3) waits until the behavior has created problems before taking action (<italic>management by exception â passive</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507612440413">Avolio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507612440413">Judge and Piccolo, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, transformational leadership is more likely to emerge in times of distress and change, whereas transactional leadership is more likely to be observed in a well-ordered society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507612440413">Bass, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the two empirical studies in the <italic>Leadership Quarterly</italic> in 2009, one examined leadership at the organizational level, and the other at the team level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350507612440413">Jansen et al. (2009)</xref> examined executive directors of Fortune Global 500 firms and found that transformational leadership had a positive effect on exploratory innovation (pursuing new knowledge and developing products and services for emerging customers and markets) but had no significant effect on exploitative innovation (building on existing knowledge resources and extending existing products and services for current markets), whereas transactional leadership had a positive effect on exploitative innovation but a negative effect on exploratory innovation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507612440413">Nemanich and Vera (2009)</xref> investigated teams in a large multinational firm undergoing integration after acquisition and found that transformational leadership has a positive impact both on a learning culture characterized by psychological safety, openness to diverse opinions, and participation in decision making and on the ability to explore new capabilities while exploiting existing ones in teams. They argued that transformational leadership encourages employees to engage in creative processes as well as overcome the resistance to adopting new institutionalized routines in turbulent environments such as during an acquisition.</p>
<p>The leadership-learning relationship at the team level has also been studied by Edmondson and colleagues without using the transformational/transactional leadership framework. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350507612440413">Edmondson (2003)</xref> examined interdisciplinary operating room teams learning to use a new technology for cardiac surgery and found that the most effective leaders helped teams learn by articulating a motivating rationale for change and for speaking up, and by creating psychological safety through acknowledging their own fallibility.</p>
<p>Based on a qualitative field study of 16 hospitals implementing an innovative technology for cardiac surgery, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507612440413">Edmondson et al. (2001)</xref> reported that successful implementers promoted shared meaning and process improvement through reflective practice, which includes reviewing data, discussing past cases, planning next cases, and suggesting technical process changes through formal meetings, informal conversations, and shared reviews of relevant data, asking: âWhat are we learning? What can we do better? What should we change?â</p>
<p>The studies suggested that leadership of learning at the team level involves (1) articulating the meaning of goals, (2) creating psychological safety, and (3) facilitating reflective practice. These characteristics seem to relate more to transformational than to transactional leadership. However, leadership of learning at the group level should have unique features that differ from those of transformational leadership for two reasons. First, not all workplaces are in the midst of distress and change. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507612440413">Bass (1985)</xref> indicated, transformational leadership is more appropriate in a turbulent environment. Second, workplace learning involves not only transformation or improvement of organizational routines but also individual development of members. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct additional empirical research without using the framework of transformational/transactional leadership.</p>

<title>Reflective practice</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507612440413">Edmondson et al. (2001)</xref> reported, the role of reflective practice has been emphasized in the research of professional organizations. Because this study focuses on leadership of learning in medical organizations, the following is a brief literature review of reflective practice.</p>
<p>The concept of reflective practice was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350507612440413">SchÃ¶n (1983)</xref>. This concept was applied initially in the field of nursing and teacher education and is increasingly being applied across the professions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350507612440413">Moon, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350507612440413">Raelin (2002)</xref> defined reflective practice as the practice of periodically stepping back to consider the meaning of what recently transpired to others and to oneself in our immediate environment. However, reflective practice includes not only ex-post-facto reflection, in which one leans back and thinks about the day or the situation at hand but also in-the-moment reflection, i.e. reflection within the immediacy of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507612440413">Yanow, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350507612440413">SchÃ¶n (1983)</xref> called the latter type reflection-in-action, which âconsists in on-the-spot surfacing, criticizing, restructuring, and testing of intuitive understandings of experienced phenomena; often it takes the form of a reflective conversation with the situationâ (pp. 241â242). The reflective practitioner explores other ways of seeing and adopts an attitude of inquiry rather than determining answers based solely on positional authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1350507612440413">Yanow and Tsoukas, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Reflection is concerned with the process or means by which individuals make sense and reconstruct the meaning of what has been planned, observed, or achieved in practice. Therefore, it is essential to learning to convert tacit experience into explicit knowledge, leading to an understanding of experiences that may have been overlooked in practice, allowing us to critique our taken-for-granted assumptions, and encouraging us to be receptive to alternative ways of reasoning and behaving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507612440413">Cunliffe, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350507612440413">DeFillippi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350507612440413">Gray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350507612440413">Ramsey 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507612440413">Xing and Sims, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1350507612440413">Yip and Raelin, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on previous literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350507612440413">Kember et al. (2000)</xref> classified reflection into four hierarchical levels: habitual action (activity that is performed automatically or with little conscious thought), understanding (reaching an understanding of a concept without reflecting upon its significance in personal or practical situations), reflection (internally examining and exploring an issue of concern, triggered by an experience), and intensive reflection (a higher level of reflective thinking through which we can transform our meaning framework).</p>
<p>Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350507612440413">Kember et al.âs (2000)</xref> framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350507612440413">Peltier et al. (2005)</xref> conducted a survey of MBA students and found that reflection and intensive reflection were positively correlated, whereas habitual action and understanding were negatively correlated with program outcomes.</p>
<p>Although studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350507612440413">SchÃ¶n (1983)</xref> and others have mainly addressed the utility of reflection by individual practitioners, recent research has drawn attention to collective reflection within organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350507612440413">Jordan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350507612440413">Raelin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507612440413">Reynolds and Vince, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350507612440413">Vince, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350507612440413">Hoyrup and Elkjaer (2006)</xref> concluded that to conceptualize the complex process of learning at work, the concept of reflection should be recognized at different levels, namely at the individual, group, and organizational level.</p>
<p>Leaders play important roles in the promotion of collective reflection in the workplace. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507612440413">Cunliffe (2009)</xref> examined leadership in terms of the philosophical themes of relationalism, ethics, and reflexivity. She proposed the idea of a âphilosopher leaderâ, who encourages organizational members to think more critically and reflexively about themselves, their actions, and the situations they find themselves in. This is one leadership style that facilitates workplace learning.</p>
<p>Although the role of reflective practice has been stressed in previous works, little research has been conducted on what might make one practitioner more inclined than another not to stop at certainty but to be open to engaging in reflective practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507612440413">Yanow, 2009</xref>). This study is concerned with the leadership behaviors that promote reflective practice in the workplace.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Past research has suggested that workplace learning involves individual learning, group-level learning, and learning outcome. Although some empirical studies have investigated the link between leadership and learning at the organizational and team levels, little research has examined the leadership-learning relationship in the workplace. Previous work has indicated that reflective practice plays an important role in facilitating learning, yet few quantitative studies have examined this. The present study investigated the inter-relationships between leadership behaviors and workplace learning using survey data from nursing managers.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this study was to clarify the characteristics of leadership behavior that facilitate workplace learning in medical organizations. As the research presented is exploratory in nature, the research model is developed and tested during the analysis. The following research question is proposed.</p>

<sec id="section8-1350507612440413">
<title>Preliminary research</title>
<p>To collect data on leadership behaviors that facilitate workplace learning, 13 mid-level nursing managers with good reputations as leaders who facilitated learning in the workplace were interviewed in seven hospitals (six acute care hospitals and one chronic care hospital). Senior nursing managers of the participating hospitals were asked to select competent middle-level nursing managers in terms of promoting staff development and improving working processes and the quality of nursing care in their wards. The interviews lasted 65 minutes on average. All interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed.</p>
<p>Before the interviews, interviewees as well as some of their subordinates and superiors were asked to respond to open-ended questionnaires on the leadership behaviors of nursing managers. Based on the results of the surveys, the nursing managers were asked in the interviews to describe what they do to develop young and core nursing staff and to improve nursing processes and quality of nursing care in the workplace.</p>
<p>From the interview and survey data, 199 aspects of leadership behavior were extracted, and a questionnaire was prepared.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1350507612440413">
<title>Sample and procedures</title>
<p>The general managers of hospitals were recruited to participate in this study via conference and seminar attendance. Nursing managers at nursing conferences and seminars were asked to participate in the research in exchange for feedback that diagnosed the strengths and weaknesses of each hospital. The general managers of 22 hospitals applied to take part in the research. The hospitals were located across Japan and included five public hospitals, nine private hospitals, and eight Red Cross hospitals. The average size of hospital was 474.8 beds (SD = 218.3). Of the sample, 21 were acute care hospitals, and one was a chronic care hospital.</p>
<p>Data were collected by distributing self-administered questionnaires to nursing managers in charge of specific wards and to their superiors (general nursing mangers or deputy general nursing managers). Nursing managers were asked to respond to the questions in reference to their own leadership behaviors, whereas their superiors were asked to evaluate the present conditions of the wards run by the nursing managers (staff development, process improvement, and the quality of nursing care). Participants received a cover letter explaining the studyâs purpose and methods, and the process to participate in the study. The letter also explained that the return of completed questionnaires by participants indicated consent to participate. Participants were requested to sign their name in the questionnaires. The signature was required because it was necessary to match data from nursing managers with data from their superiors in the analysis. Of the 256 questionnaires distributed, 255 were returned. A total of 228 questionnaires were considered usable after removing missing answers (final response rate was 89.0%). One of the reasons for the high response rate may be that most senior nursing managers explained the purpose of the survey to, and made an agreement with staff nurses to get their participation in the survey. The average nurse experience in the sample was 25.26 years (SD = 6.69), and 94.9% were women.</p>

Respondents (general managers or deputy general managers) were asked about their perceptions of workplace learning in the nursing mangersâ units using a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). The Cronbachâs alpha was 0.75. The scores for each item were used as observable variables for workplace learning.</p>

<title>Leadership of learning</title>
<p>The scale of leadership of learning was developed based on items that were identified in the preliminary research. The procedures, partly based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350507612440413">Churchillâs (1979)</xref> scale-development paradigm were as follows. First, a correlation analysis was conducted between each of the 199 leadership of learning items and the workplace-learning score (averaged score of the three items). Second, items addressing leadership of learning that were significantly correlated with workplace learning were selected (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Third, factor analyses (principal factors method with oblique rotation) were conducted with the 55 remaining leadership of learning items. Items were eliminated when loadings fell below 0.40 on all factors and if the Cronbachâs alpha of a dimension increased when the item was deleted. This procedure was repeated until the Cronbachâs alphas of all factors were above 0.70.</p>
<p>Based on this procedure, leadership-learning items were grouped into five dimensions: âencouraging reflective practiceâ, âsupporting team activitiesâ, âpromoting role modelingâ, âclarifying the mission of the unitâ, and âclarifying individual goalsâ (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1350507612440413">Appendix 1</xref>). The Cronbachâs alphas for these dimensions were 0.83, 0.87, 0.82, 0.77, and 0.78, respectively. The scores for each item were used as observable variables for each dimension of leadership of learning.</p>

<p>To evaluate the convergent validity of the model constructs, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with six latent constructs of learning (workplace learning, encouraging reflective practice, supporting team activities, promoting role modeling, clarifying the mission of the unit, and clarifying individual goals) and a total of 24 measures was conducted. The results show that all items significantly loaded on the respective constructs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and the goodness-of-fit statistics for the model were as follows: Ï<sup>2</sup> = 400.60, degrees of freedom (<italic>df</italic>) = 237, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.92, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05, and root mean square residual (RMR) = 0.03.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Few prior studies have been systematically conducted to examine the direct relationship between leadership and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507612440413">Berson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507612440413">Vera and Crossan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350507612440413">Waldman et al., 2009</xref>). A major contribution of this study was to clarify the interrelated characteristics of leadership behaviors that facilitate workplace learning.</p>
<sec id="section17-1350507612440413">
<title>Theoretical implications</title>
<p>The findings of this study extend previous research on leadership of learning in three important ways. First, the results demonstrate the importance of facilitating reflective practice in leading workplace learning, which has not been recognized in past research on transformational or transactional leadership. Encouraging reflective practice may be a central characteristic in leadership of learning. It should be noted that the other four leadership dimensions affect workplace learning through encouragement of reflective practice. The scale used in this study includes items on âasking what the issues areâ, âproviding opportunities to think about their jobâ, and âmaking staff think the reasons and meanings of their conducts that they normally process without paying much attentionâ, which are equivalent to the concept of reflective practice proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350507612440413">SchÃ¶n (1983)</xref>. This leadership style has similar characteristics to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507612440413">Cunliffeâs (2009)</xref> philosopher leader, which considers leadership a process of thinking more critically and reflexively about ourselves, our actions, and the situations we find ourselves in.</p>
<p>The findings also correspond to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507612440413">Edmondson et al.âs (2001)</xref> report that successful implementers of innovative cardiac surgery teams promoted shared meaning and process improvement through reflective practice. With reflective practice, we can convert tacit experience into explicit knowledge, understand experiences that may have been overlooked in practice, critique our taken-for-granted assumptions, and encounter alternative ways of reasoning and behaving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507612440413">Cunliffe, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350507612440413">DeFillippi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350507612440413">Gray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350507612440413">Ramsey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507612440413">Xing and Sims, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1350507612440413">Yip and Raelin, 2011</xref>). For example, the scale of âencouraging reflective practiceâ involves leadership behaviors such as encouraging people to think about the reasons behind and meanings of their behaviors. Reflective practice uses questions such as, âWhy does this have to be done this way?â to encourage nurses to think about patient interactions. These behaviors may be effective for articulating implied experiences and critiquing assumptions.</p>
<p>The present research showed that reflective practice, which is resolution through deeper understanding rather than problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350507612440413">Pavlovich et al., 2009</xref>), plays a central role in activating workplace learning.</p>
<p>Second, this study revealed that reflective practice is closely associated with goal setting and role modeling. The results indicated that nursing managers promote reflective practice of staff nurses by clarifying the mission of the ward and promoting role modeling. This suggests that goal setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350507612440413">Latham and Locke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350507612440413">Locke and Latham, 2002</xref>) and social learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350507612440413">Bandura, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507612440413">1986</xref>) are antecedents of reflective practice. It can be interpreted that group-level goals and role models may provide standards by which staff nurses appreciate and consider the meaning of their practices in the workplace. Staff nurses can reflect on the meanings of their behaviors if they understand what their work unitâs goals are and how members should act. The results of this study indicate that leaders should play roles as âmanagers of meaningâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507612440413">Smircich and Morgan, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, there are some similar characteristics between leadership of learning and transformational leadership. Specifically, âpromoting role modelingâ and âclarifying the mission of the unitâ identified in this study approximately correspond to two dimensions of transformational leadership: âidealized influenceâ, or behaving in admirable ways that cause followers to identify with the leader and âinspirational motivationâ, or challenging followers with high standards, communicating optimism about future goal attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507612440413">Avolio et al., 1999</xref>; Bass, 1990; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507612440413">Judge and Piccolo, 2004</xref>; Kark et al., 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350507612440413">Piccolo and Colquitt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350507612440413">Shin and Zhou, 2003</xref>). However, leadership of learning has unique characteristics in that behaviors related to goal setting and role modeling are combined as tools for enhancing followersâ reflective practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1350507612440413">
<title>Managerial implications</title>
<p>The present research has managerial implications for enhancing workplace learning. First, to help staff members use reflective practices, managers should develop their own questioning skills, such as asking about what issues members are having and how these problems can be resolved. Managers should also encourage members to think about the reasons for, and meanings behind, their behavior. Managers with good questioning skills can promote reflective practices in the workplace.</p>
<p>Second, managers who hope to facilitate reflective practices in the workplace need to set clear missions and goals while creating role models; these can be standards or guidelines that allow staff to consider the meanings of their conduct. It is often difficult for staff members to reflect on their behavior without appropriate goals and models. It should be noted that setting a clear mission for the work unit and promoting role models have no direct impact on workplace learning. Linking goals, role models, and reflection are key for promoting workplace learning.</p>
<p>Third, managers should be aware that asking the staff questions is likely to produce a wide variety of explicit and implicit reactions, such as anxiety, defensiveness, expectation, surprise, and relief; questioning skills are often linked to power relationships in organizations. Even though managers may intend to be collaborative, hierarchical relationships still exist, and so staff may be unwilling to offer ideas that contradict the manager or question his/her authority and expertise. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350507612440413">Vince (2011</xref>: 342) states, employees often want to avoid conflict and risky suggestions, which âencourages predictability and prescription, which limits the (public) emergence of new knowledge and the transformational potential of learningâ. To promote appropriate reflective practices, managers must be sensitive to such power relationships and pay attention to the tensions and emotional reactions that can occur in reflective practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350507612440413">Vince, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1350507612440413">
<title>Limitations and future research</title>
<p>These findings should be considered in the light of their limitations. First, the data of this study were limited to nursing managers. It is possible that encouraging reflective practice plays a central role in leadership of learning because the sample of this study is managers in medical organizations. The questions raised in this study should be examined in various industries and cultures.</p>
<p>Second, as the concepts of leadership of learning and workplace learning and the scale for measuring them were developed for this study, more work is needed to validate the scale. Especially, the items on leadership of learning were extracted from the survey of nursing managers. By conducting the survey in different contexts, we could develop more reliable and valid scales that could be applied to broader fields.</p>
<p>Third, the reason that there is no established scale for leadership of learning may be due to the limitation of quantitative research methods. Although investigating sequential relationships between leadership dimensions is one advantage of this study, the interactive and inter-subjective features of the leadership process could not be evaluated. To explore the interactive mechanism of leadership in learning, qualitative research should be conducted in the future.</p>
<p>Fourth, this study did not examine leadership behaviors related to power relationships and conflicts of interest in the workplace. Previous research has suggested that organizing critical reflection involves the analysis of power and control in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350507612440413">Jordan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350507612440413">Reynolds, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350507612440413">Vince, 2002</xref>). Thus, it is necessary to investigate leadership in learning in terms of power relationships in the workplace.</p>
<p>Finally, this study was exploratory, and the relationship between leadership of learning and other types of leadership remains unclear. As there is some resemblance between leadership of learning and transformational leadership, it is necessary for future research to compare leadership of learning scales with other existing scales such as those for transformational leadership and transactional leadership.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article explored the characteristics of leadership of learning, using a survey of nursing managers. The theoretical contribution of this study is the examination of sequential relationships between leadership dimensions, rather than parallel analyses. Encouraging reflective practice plays a central role in facilitating workplace learning, and unit missions and role modeling in combination can be used to promote reflective practice in the workplace. Continued research on power relationships using qualitative methods should be conducted to advance our understanding of leadership of learning.</p>
