<p>Conventional wisdom tells us that the United States has been engaged in an all out culture war since the 1960s. Allegedly, these culture wars are responsible for the polarizing debates and the radical realignment of values along conservative and liberal lines that characterize politics today. Conventional wisdom is apparently wrong. In <italic>Culture Wars and Enduring American Dilemmas</italic>, Irene Taviss Thomson argues that there is neither a singular cultural divide nor any line of argument that consistently unites liberals or conservatives. She bases her claim on an analysis of 436 articles from four political magazines (<italic>National Review</italic>, <italic>Time</italic>, <italic>The New Republic</italic>, and <italic>The Nation</italic>) published between 1980 and 2000. In the pages of these liberal, conservative, and centrist magazines, Thomson finds the disagreements that have been exaggerated into a culture war. But, she also finds significant agreement among partisan cultural warriors on the value of religion, the use of moral frameworks, a belief in individualism, respect for pluralism, ambivalence toward elites, and a high regard for moderation.</p>
<p>Thomson sets out in earnest to poke holes in the culture wars thesis in her first chapter, “Culture Wars and Warring about Culture.” She begins with a discussion of the infamous originator of the idea of a “culture war,” James Davison Hunter, a sociologist who first described a split between orthodox conservatives and progressive liberals on moral issues. Patrick Buchanan popularized the idea at the 1992 Republican Convention. From there, the idea that Americans are deeply divided not by class, religion, race, ethnicity, politics, or gender but by their values and moral orientation grew. As Thomson points out, however, the idea of a culture war is not supported by the realities of public opinion: Rather than taking extreme positions, most Americans tend toward the center when it comes to cultural issues such as abortion, multiculturalism, and so on. Even more compelling is evidence showing that when polarization over an issue does occur, individuals within liberal or conservative camps do not share a coherent worldview. Finally, public opinion data show that cultural issues are not the most salient determinants of voting behavior nor do voters see any particular party as the sole representative of any ideological standpoint. Why would Hunter conclude that such divisions were real and measurable? Thomson suggests that his reliance on official literature from culture war organizations was problematic and believes she overcomes this methodological issue by using large-circulation political magazines, public opinion data, and selected works by writers associated with the culture wars. For those unfamiliar with the history of the culture wars thesis, Thomson’s introduction is excellent. In it, she also covers the larger academic debate over the nature of culture itself and of American culture specifically (drawing on the work of Clifford Gertz, Ann Swidler, and others).</p>
<p>Each subsequent chapter in <italic>Culture Wars</italic> covers a set of major “cultural dilemmas” over which the public appears to be deeply divided. Chapter 2 “Respect for Religion but Uncertain about Its Role,” traces public conversations about the role of religion and religious belief in the United States. Abortion, gay rights, and legislative morality are the subject of the third chapter, “Moral but Not Moralistic.” In Chapter 4, Thomson is on familiar ground, discussing the uniquely American emphasis on individualism, in which she touches primarily upon critiques of multiculturalism from both sides of the culture wars. “Pluralism within One Culture,” Chapter 5, begins with a discussion of historical perspectives on pluralism in order to argue that contemporary debate over multiculturalism is simply a continuation of old concerns about immigration, cultural homogeneity, difference, identity, community, and American culture. As a way of describing the new face of “pluralism,” Thomson addresses multicultural education, newer notions about tolerance, and the canon wars in university curriculum. The sixth chapter covers what Thomson refers to as “a staple of American political discourse” (p. 145): antielitism. Here the reader is drawn into topics such as media bias, distinctions between popular and high culture, funding for the arts, and the feminist and gay rights movements. Moderation is the next subject, covered in a tiny eight-page chapter that keeps it simple: Everyone sees moderation as a good thing, regardless of their position in the culture war. The final chapter, “Culture, Class, and American Exceptionalism,” feels more like a conclusion than her concluding remarks. In it, she provides an extensive discussion of the nature of divisions within contemporary American society, suggests that value conflicts in American politics differ from the political situation in Europe, and dismisses arguments that Sarah Palin’s recent rise to fame indicates a renewal of the culture war.</p>
<p>One might criticize Thomson for overreaching in each of these chapters. She covers a whole host of subjects that do not always seem related to the chapter’s main culture war theme. However, I am left with the sense that a clear and comprehensive picture of the nuances within the culture war requires a depth in coverage. The lack of continuity, absence of a clear divide between warring factions, and the vast differences of opinion among liberal and conservative culture warriors are palpable with the introduction of each new topic and detailed attention to the scope of each debate. For the most part, Thomson deftly maneuvers between historical perspective, public opinion data, and theoretical perspectives as she discusses the findings of her research.</p>
<p>As someone who studies news discourse and culture, I could see myself using <italic>Culture Wars</italic> in a number of courses, including substantive courses on media, politics, culture, religion, or social movements. In particular, this book would be a great addition to any course that covers framing processes, discourse theory, or qualitative content analysis. Unfortunately, Thomson does not specifically discuss framing theory as a methodology or as a discursive process. Her methodological appendix simply provides a breakdown of articles by magazine and topic. However, the book is clearly an analysis of public discourse about culture wars issues and provides an interesting vantage point from which to discuss important methodological questions, such as: sampling, source selection, biases in newspaper data, formulating a research question and selecting appropriate data, and so on. One could also easily assign portions of the book in courses that use a social constructionist perspective. The introduction or any of the substantive chapters provide a great illustration of the social construction of social problems, media claims making processes, and the phenomena of moral panics. Students in lower-level undergraduate courses might find the text a bit dense and the overarching argument difficult to follow, so <italic>Culture Wars</italic> is likely more appropriate for upper-level undergraduate or graduate classes.</p>
<p>Thomson’s <italic>Culture Wars</italic> provides an important contribution to our understanding of American culture and politics. This discursive analysis of political rhetoric will leave you wondering what all the “culture warring” has really been about. Though we have accepted the idea that the sixties counterculture created a rift between conservatives and liberals, it appears that is more myth than fact. After peeling back the facade of “war,” all we are left with are nuance, disagreement, and a multitude of internal divisions. By illuminating the convergences across the culture war divide, Thomson makes it very difficult to see who is orthodox and who is progressive, who is liberal or conservative. In the end, we are left with “a distinctly American cast, since all participants subscribe to the enduring cultural ideas that frame the specific issues under dispute” (p. 217).</p>
