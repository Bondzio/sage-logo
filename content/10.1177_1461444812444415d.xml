<p>The dynamic debate between digital optimists touting the democratic, revolutionary potential of the web and digital pessimists claiming the web affords little democratic potential must now come to terms with a growing body of empirical evidence. <italic>Digitally Enabled Social Change</italic> provides a window into the world of digital democracy in motion through a candid analysis of the costs and benefits of organizing online. Jennifer Earl and Katrina Kimport tune into the myriad ways in which activists and social movement organizations (SMOs) use the web. By collecting and analyzing voluminous data on the uses and outcomes of web-based activism, the authors weigh in on the contentious debate.</p>
<p>The book consists of four parts, beginning with an introduction to online activism. Chapter 2 distinguishes between ‘supersize’ and ‘theory 2.0’ effects and splits the literature into two camps. Supersize scholars argue that the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for protest purposes ‘primarily increases the size, speed, and reach,’ but has little effect ‘on the processes underlying activism’ (p. 24). In contrast, theory 2.0 scholars find that ICT use ‘may change the actual processes of organizing and/or participating in activism, resulting in model changes to existing theories of activism’ (p. 24). Identifying this rift in the literature sets the stage for the authors’ assessment of supersize vs. theory 2.0 conclusions throughout the book. In short, Earl and Kimport ‘observe a mix of supersize and theory 2.0 findings’ (p. 63) suggesting that they are not mutually exclusive and are likely attached to the differing types of protest scholars study.</p>
<p>Part two of the book analyzes how low, leveraged costs of online activism impact participation (chapter 4), and how these low, leveraged costs impact organizers (chapter 5). Part three analyzes the declining importance of copresence in participation (chapter 6) and organizing (chapter 7). These empirical chapters lay important groundwork and offer shocking assertions about the potential of web-based activism.</p>
<p>The most salient discussion of the study’s implications comes in chapter 8, where Earl and Kimport suggest that a new ‘digital repertoire of contention’ (p. 180) is emerging, changing the rules of activism and how it should be studied. Most strikingly, they argue that ‘we will have to think of ourselves as scholars of protest rather than as scholars of social movements’ (p. 186). As activism increasingly takes on new forms, enabled by a growing body of new media technologies, the existence of coherent movements may no longer be a necessary condition for significant social change to occur.</p>
<p>Following their discussion and conclusion in part four, Earl and Kimport present a Methodological Appendix which covers the nuts and bolts of the study. Given the complexity of the population they aimed to sample, Earl and Kimport innovatively used Google search to find ‘<italic>reachable</italic> Web sites hosting or linking to petitions, boycotts, and letter-writing and email campaigns’ (p. 209), arriving at a reasonable population of activist sites online. By slicing the data many ways, the authors focus on different trends and types of sites for various chapters. While this may contribute to some confusion about the book’s focus, Earl and Kimport’s methodological choices appear highly defensible throughout and may provide ‘proof of concept’ for other scholars seeking to do similar research.</p>
<p>The ‘problems’ of copresence and ‘free riders’ – often mythologized by digital pessimists – are discussed in a sobering and empirical manner that offers a practical assessment of e-mobilization, amounting to a welcome acknowledgment of the complex overlap between face-to-face (F2F) and computer-mediated-communication (CMC) interaction. Earl and Kimport’s constant focus on web-based ‘affordances’ and the extent to which they are ‘leveraged’ is a welcome addition to the vocabulary for the study of new media and society. As they remind us, ‘it is people’s usage of technology – not technology itself – that can change social processes’ (p. 14). This approach avoids technological determinism and instead offers a practical acknowledgment of both structure and agency. Furthermore, they overcome the all-too common reductionist tendency to discount online interactions as <italic>less than</italic> real.</p>
<p>Despite all the strengths of the book, one criticism is that it is difficult to discern what the subject of the book’s (or even the chapters’) analysis actually is. Is it activism, protest, mobilization, or movements that the authors are studying? As they note (on p. 188), the muddiness of the distinction is part of the problem. Nonetheless, the authors often fail to adequately frame the discussion. While clearly stated at the outset, the distinctions – between e-mobilizations, e-movements, and e-tactics – appear less and less clear as the book unfolds. Frequently oscillating between discussions of different forms of web-based organizing, no matter how reflective this is of contemporary realities, raises concern about the need for a more organized analysis and often leaves the reader guessing at the subject of a section’s discussion.</p>
<p>Although it does not account for more recent developments in social media contexts, Earl and Kimport’s extensively empirical work is an important contribution to a rapidly shifting field. Their findings offer a definitive look at the state of e-activism during a time when web affordances were on the rise. But rather than being dated, many of the book’s broader implications are now being further explored and validated in more recent research on activism via social media (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444812444415">Lindgren and Lundström, 2011</xref>). Advanced students and scholars alike will find great use for <italic>Digitally Enabled Social Change</italic>, whether it serves as a weighty introduction to activism in the internet age, or a fresh new take on the study of old but changing processes. The strength of this work and its powerful implications suggest that it will likely garner attention for years to come.</p>
