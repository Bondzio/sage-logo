<abstract>
<p>Infection with a variety of bacterial pathogens results in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) mobilization. The mechanism and kinetics of HSPC mobilization during infection are largely unknown. Previously, we found altered HSPC activity in bone marrow, spleen and blood during infection with <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>, the agent of granulocytic anaplasmosis. We hypothesized that altered CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling, a central pathway for HSPC homing to, and retention within, the bone marrow, plays a role in infection-induced alterations in HSPC number and trafficking. Mice were infected with <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic>. Lineage-cKit+ HSPCs were enumerated and proliferation determined. CXCL12 and CXCR4 mRNA were quantified along with CXCL12 protein, and CXCR4 surface, intracellular and total protein expression in HSPCs was determined. Increased bone marrow proliferation of HSPCs began at 2 d post-infection followed by HSPC mobilization and splenic homing. Proliferation of resident HSPCs contributed to increased splenic HSPC numbers. Bone marrow CXCL12 mRNA and protein levels were decreased at 4–8 d post-infection concurrent with HSPC mobilization. CXCR4 protein parameters were decreased in bone marrow HSPCs throughout 2–6 d post-infection. Reduction of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling simultaneously occurs with HSPC mobilization from bone marrow. Findings suggest that deranged CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling plays a causal role in HSPC mobilization during acute <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection.</p>

<p>The CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis controls the homing and mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and mature leukocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425911413794">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911413794">3</xref></sup> Previous work on this signaling pathway has primarily focused on its role in transplantation and stem cell biology, as HSPC mobilization can be initiated clinically using a selective antagonist to this ligand/receptor interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425911413794">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425911413794">5</xref></sup> More recently, a role has emerged for CXCL12 signaling in neutrophil trafficking to and from bone marrow, both in homeostasis and during inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425911413794">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425911413794">8</xref></sup> Chemokine signaling in leukocyte trafficking regulates the availability of immune effector cells at sites of inflammation and infection.</p>
<p>Alterations in CXCL12 signaling during bacterial infection may also be critical for controlling the trafficking of HSPCs and influencing infection outcome. Regulation of hematopoiesis via altered HSPC kinetics can increase production of multiple hemic cell lineages to replace and/or augment cell populations consumed in responding to infection. Any serious derangement of hematopoiesis during bacterial infection may reduce the availability of immune effector cells and influence disease pathology. To date, there is no mechanistic, kinetic evaluation of how a bacterial infection regulates CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in vivo.</p>
<p><italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic> is a Gram-negative, LPS-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium that resides primarily within circulating granulocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425911413794">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911413794">10</xref></sup> <italic> Anaplasma phagocytophylum</italic> is the etiologic agent of granulocytic anaplasmosis, the second most common human tick-borne disease in the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425911413794">11</xref></sup> Infection with <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> typically results in multiple cytopenias (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and anemia) in natural disease and in animal models of infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425911413794">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425911413794">17</xref></sup> Cytopenias and bone marrow dysfunction contribute to serious clinical sequelae of infection, including fatalities as a result of immunosuppression and secondary infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425911413794">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911413794">18</xref></sup> Pathogen effects on host granulocytes have been well-studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425911413794">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425911413794">20</xref></sup> Experimentally, <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection results in altered neutrophil trafficking, increased neutrophil surface integrin expression and decreased neutrophil apoptosis with resultant effects on pathogen clearance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911413794">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425911413794">21</xref></sup> The impact of infection on other hemic cell lineages and hematopoiesis are poorly understood. <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophylum</italic> infection provides a useful model for investigating hematopoietic alterations arising in infections with diverse non-LPS and obligate intracellular pathogens.</p>
<p>Bone marrow CXCL12 mRNA expression is downregulated during acute <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911413794">22</xref></sup> This downregulation occurs in concert with altered HSPC colony-forming activity in the bone marrow, spleen and peripheral blood along with shifts in lineage-committed cells. HSPCs express CXCR4, the primary CXCL12 receptor. HSPCs respond to directional cues created by a CXCL12 concentration gradient by mobilizing when bone marrow CXCL12 levels decrease and homing toward an increasing chemokine gradient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425911413794">23</xref></sup> Downregulated CXCL12 signaling may therefore actuate some of the hemic cell alterations in <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection.</p>
<p>The objectives of this study were to quantify HSPC proliferation, mobilization and trafficking to spleen and blood during acute <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection and to fully characterize the regulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling during infection. We hypothesized that acute infection would result in HSPC proliferation, disruption of bone marrow CXCL12/CXCR4 interactions and mobilization of HSPCs from bone marrow to the periphery. We found that <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection resulted in rapidly increased bone marrow HSPC proliferative activity followed by mobilization of HSPCs into peripheral blood. Proliferative activity also increased in splenic HSPCs, which contributed slightly to total mobilized HSPCs in blood. Our data implicate kinetic regulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling as the mechanism of HSPC mobilization. Simultaneous downregulation of bone marrow CXCL12 mRNA transcription and protein production occurred along with reduction in both surface and intracellular bone marrow CXCR4 expression. Infection with this non-LPS pathogen altered CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling and increased HSPC proliferation and mobilization during the innate immune response to infection.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1753425911413794"><title>Mice and in vivo experimental infection</title>
<p>Mouse experiments were performed exactly as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425911413794">21</xref></sup> Female, 5- to 7-wk-old, C3H/HeN (C3H) and C3H/HeN SCID (C3H-SCID) mice werepurchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and Taconic (Hudson, NY, USA). For some experiments, C3H mice were splenectomized by Taconic according to their protocol and specifications. Experimental C3H mice were inoculated via i.p. injection with 200 µl of pooled whole blood from infected C3H-SCID mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425911413794">24</xref></sup> <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophylum</italic> strain NCH-1 was utilized for all infections. In some experiments, mice were injected i.p. 2 h before euthanasia with 100 μl of 10 mg/ml BrdU solution (APC BrdU Flow Kit, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Mice were maintained according to approved institutional animal use and care protocols. Mice were euthanized with CO<sub>2</sub> on days 0 (control), 2, 4, 6 and 8 post-infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1753425911413794"><title>Tissue collection and processing</title>
<p>Blood, spleen and bone marrow were collected at necropsy. Blood was collected into EDTA by cardiocentesis. Whole blood was used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) to detect <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> <italic>p44</italic> DNA, complete blood cell counts (CBCs), differential leukocyte counts and flow cytometry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911413794">16</xref></sup> CBCs were performed on an automated analyzer (Beckman Coulter AcT Hematology Analyzer; Beckman Coulter, Holbrook, NY, USA) within 4 h of blood collection. For flow cytometry, red blood cells were lysed using ammonium chloride (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and samples washed twice in PBS before labeling. Remaining whole blood was centrifuged at 1500 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and plasma was banked for ELISA analysis. The spleen was removed and weighed. A section of spleen was placed in 10% formalin for immunohistochemistry. A single cell suspension was made from the remaining spleen for flow cytometic analysis, RT-PCR, cell sorting and/or culture for determination of secreted CXCL12. In brief, the spleen was gently crushed through a 70 µm nylon sterile strainer (BD Biosciences) and resuspended in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco’s Media (IMDM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) + 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Splenic cells were also banked at −80 <sup>o</sup>C for RT-PCR evaluation. The sternum was removed and placed in 10% formalin for immunohistochemistry. Bone marrow was sterilely harvested from femurs and tibias. In brief, intact bones with musculature removed were disinfected in 70% ethanol for 2 min and washed with sterile PBS. Bone marrow was flushed from tibias and femurs with IMDM + 2% FBS + 5 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA and a single cell suspension was made. One aliquot of bone marrow was counted (Beckman/Coulter AcT Hematology Analyzer) and the remaining bone marrow was processed for flow cytometric analysis, cell sorting and/or culture for secreted CXCL12 measurement. Bone marrow cells were also banked at −80 <sup>o</sup>C for RT-PCR evaluation.</p>

<p>Single cell suspensions of bone marrow, spleen and whole blood nucleated cells were brought to 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in staining buffer (PBS + 3% FBS). Cells were labeled with antibodies against CD117/c-kit (clone 2B8), CD45 (clone 30-F11) and a cocktail of lineage markers comprised of antibodies against Gr-1/Ly6C/G (clone RB6-8C5), TER119/Ly7/6 (clone TER119), CD3 (clone 17A2), and B220 (clone RA3-6B2). All Abs were obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA, USA) except B220 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). FITC- and phycoerythrin-conjugated isotype Abs were used to prepare negative controls. Cells were incubated with Ab at room temperature for 20 min, washed and resuspended in staining buffer. For BrdU analysis, cells were labeled as above with the addition of anti-BrdU Ab (APC BrdU Flow Kit, BD Biosciences). Cells were then fixed and permeabilized according to kit directions before resuspension in staining buffer<bold>.</bold> Negative controls were generated using cells from mice not administered BrdU, utilizing the same labeling protocol as above. For CXCR4 analysis, samples were labeled as above with the addition of an Ab against CXCR4 (clone 247506, R&amp;D Systems). Some cell aliquots were analyzed to detect surface expression of CXCR4; other aliquots were re-labeled with CXCR4 Ab after fixation and permeabilization to detect intracellular/total CXCR4 expression. Samples were analyzed the same day on a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson FACScan; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA); 30,000 events were acquired per sample. Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo flow cytometry software (Treestar Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). For cell sorting, single-cell suspensions harvested from bone marrow or spleen were labeled according to the above protocol. Cells were sorted based on negative staining for lineage markers (TER119, CD3, B220 and Gr-1 above) and positive staining for c-kit using a Mo Flo cell sorter (Beckman Coulter).</p>

<p>Formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin then 4 μm sections were cut and mounted on glass slides. Slides were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated by serial incubations with decreasing concentrations of ethanol. For antigen retrieval, slides were placed in tris buffered saline (TBS) + 0.05% Tween 20 at pH 9.0 and heated in a steamer. The sections were first blocked with PeroxAbolish (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, USA) followed by Background Sniper (Biocare Medical) then incubated with the primary Ab (mouse anti-human/mouse CXCL12 mAb (clone 79018; R&amp;D Systems) for 45 min. MACH2 mouse HRP Polymer (Biocare Medical) was applied (30 min incubation) followed by Betazoid DAB Chromagen (8 min incubation; Biocare Medical) with a final counter stain with hematoxylin. For bone marrow evaluation, all positive cells were counted in 3 entire sternebrae in sagittal section. For splenic evaluation, positive cells were enumerated in 5–50X fields of white pulp and 5–50X fields of red pulp; results were evaluated both separately (white pulp vs red pulp) and together.</p>

<p>To define HSPC kinetics during acute infection, populations of lineage (lin)-negative, cKit-positive cells were identified using flow cytometry in bone marrow, spleen and peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425911413794">Figure 1</xref>). Lin-negative cells were gated out using a cocktail of lineage markers; CD45 positivity was additionally used for gating in peripheral blood.

<p>To verify that HSPC numbers increased as a result of proliferation, synthetic activity was evaluated with BrdU in gated HSPC populations. Significantly increased synthetic activity in bone marrow HSPCs was found at days 2–8 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911413794">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911413794">C</xref>) and in splenic HSPCs at days 6–8 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911413794">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911413794">D</xref>). Bone marrow HSPC proliferation preceded the increase in bone marrow HSPC number, suggesting kinetic alignment of these processes. However, splenic HSPC proliferation began later than bone marrow HSPC proliferation and increased splenic HSPC number preceded splenic HSPC proliferation. These data suggest that the initial increase in splenic HSPC numbers may have been owing to an initial wave of HSPC mobilization from the bone marrow and subsequent homing to the spleen, rather than independent splenic HSPC proliferation.

<p>Peripheral blood HSPC numbers increased significantly at day 6 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425911413794">Figure 1E</xref>).

<p>Downregulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling occurs in a murine model of infection with <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic>, an obligate intracellular, LPS-negative and peptidoglycan layer-negative pathogen. CXCL12 is a CXC chemokine found in bone marrow stromal cells including CXCL12-abundant reticular cells, immature osteoblasts and endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753425911413794">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753425911413794">31</xref></sup> CXCR4 is expressed on HSPCs, as well as other hemic cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753425911413794">32</xref></sup> CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling can be modulated by inflammatory mediators. Cytokines such as TNF-α and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may suppress CXCL12 expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753425911413794">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753425911413794">34</xref></sup> Degradation of CXCL12 protein by granulocyte-derived proteases also downregulates signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911413794">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1753425911413794">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1753425911413794">37</xref></sup> Potential mediators of decreased bone marrow CXCL12 in our infection model include TNF-α and G-CSF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911413794">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911413794">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753425911413794">31</xref></sup> The TNF-α concentration is increased in bone marrow supernatants during infection; G-CSF alterations in <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection have not been evaluated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911413794">22</xref></sup> Neutrophil proteases may also play a role in diminishing bone marrow CXCL12 protein levels.</p>
<p>Regulation of CXCR4 primarily occurs at the level of protein expression, as the half-life of CXCR4 mRNA is limited; however, transcriptional control does occur. Factors implicated in downregulation of CXCR4 transcription include IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-1β.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1753425911413794">38</xref></sup> The brief half-life of CXCR4 mRNA may partly explain the mild and inconsistent changes in CXCR4 via RT-PCR in sorted HSPCs noted in this study. Alternately, regulation may not occur via transcriptional control. Post-translational regulation of CXCR4 in hemic cells includes increased internalization after IFN-γ or TNF-α stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1753425911413794">39</xref></sup> Taken together, our data suggest that bone marrow or systemic cytokine alterations may serve as upstream mediators of diminished CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling during acute <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection. Plasma CXCL12 levels, representing total body levels, were diminished in the later stages of acute infection, reflecting a decline in CXCL12 bone marrow production. HSPCs mobilize in response to a CXCL12 chemokine gradient, so bone marrow CXCL12 reduction likely shifts the gradient toward the periphery, resulting in HSPC mobilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425911413794">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Kinetic changes in CXCL12/CXCR4 in our in vivo infection model fit as a plausible mechanism of hemic cell mobilization. The role of inflammatory cytokines in the recruitment of hemic cells to a focus of infection has been well-studied. However, pathogen-induced perturbations of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in the bone marrow are essentially uncharacterized in vivo during bacterial infections. Viral perturbations of this pathway are better described, in part because CXCR4 is a co-receptor for HIV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1753425911413794">40</xref></sup> Our work, as well as work with our collaborators on a related monocyte-tropic pathogen (<italic>Ehrlichia muris</italic>), demonstrates that infection with an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen can have a similar viral-like impact on hematopoiesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911413794">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1753425911413794">41</xref></sup> <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophylum</italic> and viral pathogens both have an intracellular life cycle and a trend towards disturbing hematopoiesis, resulting in bone marrow dysfunction and cytopenias, rather than stimulating effective hematopoiesis. Although acute <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection clearly results in HSPC proliferation and mobilization, other effects on hematopoiesis, including the induction of myelosuppressive chemokines, decreased bone marrow CFU activity, and a clinical presentation of bi- or pancytopenia, are more indicative of bone marrow dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1753425911413794">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Acute infection with <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> triggers alterations in proliferation and trafficking of HSPCs. Specifically, acute infection triggers increased bone marrow HSPC synthetic activity that is first detected at day 2 post-infection and peaks at days 6–8. This burst of proliferative activity correlates with increased numbers of HSPCs in bone marrow, as well as in spleen and peripheral blood. Our previous work found substantial increases in splenic CFU activity during acute <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection, corresponding with increased splenic HSPC numbers noted in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911413794">22</xref></sup> Both mobilization from bone marrow and proliferation within the spleen appear to play a role in expansion of splenic HSPC populations. Interestingly, CFU activity was decreased in bone marrow throughout infection in contrast to increased bone marrow HSPC numbers. Several potential factors may contribute to this disparity. Colony-forming potential does not necessarily correlate with in vivo proliferation, as demonstrated via IFN-γ effects on bone marrow; colony formation was suppressed in the face of expansion of lineage-negative, cKit-positive, Sca-1-positive populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1753425911413794">43</xref></sup> Additionally, the earlier findings occurred during infection via tick-borne injection versus intraperitoneal inoculation, raising the possibility of differing immune responses affecting hematopoiesis, as tick saliva is immunomodulatory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1753425911413794">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>The relationship between downregulated CXCL12 signaling, HSPC proliferation, HSPC mobilization and the development of cytopenias during <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection is unclear. Cytopenias are detected as early as 2–3 d post-infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425911413794">17</xref></sup> HSPC-related changes in the bone marrow are therefore not a likely immediate cause of acute cytopenias, but altered trafficking of mature blood cells due to downregulated CXCL12 signaling remains a potential cause. Our earlier studies found substantially increased numbers of mature neutrophils in the spleen during acute <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection; increased splenic leukocyte homing and sequestration as a result of shifts in CXCL12 gradients may, therefore, play a role in the development of leukopenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911413794">22</xref></sup> Work with a related pathogen, <italic>E. muris</italic>, has demonstrated that the functional alterations in bone marrow are accompanied by a decrease in classically defined megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitors and common myeloid progenitors, with an increase in functionally and phenotypically IFN-γ ‘activated’ (Sca-1 positive) cells that correlate with decreased bone marrow CFUs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1753425911413794">45</xref></sup> Cytopenias may also be caused by delayed hematopoietic suppression during <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection. Infection with similar tick-borne agents, particularly <italic>Ehrlichia canis</italic>, can result in chronic severe myelosuppression leading to sustained pancytopenia, and prolonged disruption of the stem/progenitor cell compartment is a plausible mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1753425911413794">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1753425911413794">47</xref></sup> Other infections with both LPS-positive and LPS-negative pathogens disrupt HSPC proliferation and mobilization kinetics, but generally the net effect is to augment innate immune cell production during infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1753425911413794">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1753425911413794">51</xref></sup> A causal link between the hematopoietic disturbances reported here and development of cytopenias during infection with <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> and similar pathogens remains to be shown.</p>

However, how these pathogens specifically impact hematopoietic signaling has not been established. In this article, we specifically implicate regulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling as one mechanism by which this LPS-negative pathogen impacts hematopoiesis and hemic cell mobilization. Upstream effectors of signaling disruption remain to be elucidated. Further investigation of the mechanisms involved in these and other infection-induced hematopoietic disturbances may lead to improved therapeutic responses in the clinical setting.</p>
