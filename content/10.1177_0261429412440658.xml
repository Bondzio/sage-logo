<p>The preface, written by David Sousa, reads:<disp-quote>
<p>If you are beginning to explore brain research and its applications to pedagogy...[then] this book is designed to introduce you to samples of the works of eight respected authors writing in plain language about the applications of neuroscience in different teaching and learning settings. (p. vii)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>David Sousa is true to his word – Part 1 focuses on the developing brain and includes chapters on brain structures, movement, and the mysteries of the adolescent brain. Part 2 looks at the brain in school and includes chapters on how the brain learns to read and calculate, differences between the male and female brain, and understanding some of the social and academic needs of students with learning difficulties. Part 3 contains chapters providing tested strategies for keeping learners engaged, focused and energized.</p>
<p>The first chapter, by David Sousa, provides an accessible overview of the latest developments in ‘brain-based learning’. He highlights the importance of teachers being aware of recent neuroscientific research in order to reflect on, and consequently to strengthen, their classroom practice. He writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Teachers are brain-changers, and knowing more about how the brain learns can only make them more successful at their job. (p. viii)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Robert Sylvester stresses the importance of supporting the efficient development of young children’s movement so that physiological and cognitive brain networks are coordinated and maximized. Sheryl G. Feinstein focuses on the development of the brain during adolescence and offers suggestions for maximizing attention and developing metacognition. Abigail Norfleet James, in her chapter, tackles the controversial topic of whether there is any difference between the female and male brain.</p>
<p>In writing about the development of numeracy and literacy, David Sousa and Pamela Nevills provide usable and practical guidelines with regard to developing learners’ skills efficiently, and Eric Jensen provides insight into the brain-based systems of youngsters with learning difficulties.</p>
<p>The chapters written by Michael A. Scaddan, Marcia L. Tate and Eric Jensen focus on classroom strategies that reduce stress, develop memory and make use of visual and musical media, and hence maintain high energy for successful learning. </p>
<p>This is a very useful text for busy teachers and parents because the writers have sifted out the relevant neuroscientific research and coupled this with genuine understanding of, and expertise in, classroom practice. I heartedly recommend it as a text that provides information on brain-based pedagogy ‘in a nutshell’.</p>
