<body>
<p>Surgical management of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) may reduce symptoms by modifying sites of upper airway collapse and obstruction. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), the surgical procedure most frequently performed for OSAHS, reduces the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) by approximately half in 50% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813479932">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813479932">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is not entirely clear why the outcome of UPPP is so frequently disappointing. Possibilities include ongoing collapse and obstruction of nonpalatal airway segments, failure at the primary palatal site, or both. Multiple technical variations have been proposed to improve the success rate of UPPP; few have been widely applied or objectively compared.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813479932">3</xref></sup> Z-palatoplasty (ZPP) was introduced to address the limitations of traditional UPPP techniques. This technique enlarges the velopharynx and retropalatal segment by using a double Z-plasty to orient the scar contracture tension line into an anterolateral vector and to widen the anteroposterior and lateral oropharyngeal air spaces at the level of the palate. Initial clinical results in a small group of patients were promising: the clinical success rate was 68% in patients with severe OSAHS because of both upper and lower pharyngeal airway narrowing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813479932">4</xref></sup> Z-palatoplasty for OSAHS patients without tonsils is more successful than classic UPPP, with an acceptable rate of complications. However, the feasibility and effectiveness of ZPP in patients with tonsils are not known. The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of ZPP in patients with size 1 or 2 tonsils.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>All participants gave written, informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Tianjin Union Medicine Centre.</p>
<p>Between May 2008 and May 2010, 36 patients were recruited from among 254 consecutive patients who were evaluated for treatment of snoring and sleep apnea at the Sleep Center of the Tianjin Union Medicine Centre, according to the following criteria: (1) no previous surgical treatment for OSAHS; (2) significant symptoms of snoring, daytime somnolence, or both; (3) respiratory disturbance index &gt;30, as determined by polysomnography (PSG); (4) body mass index (BMI) &lt;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; (5) tonsil size 1 or 2; (6) long-term continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) refusal; and (7) the appearance of obstruction at the level of the soft palate contributing to OSAHS (assessed in all patients with fiber-optic hypolaryngoscopy and the Müller maneuver). The exclusion criteria were chronic pulmonary disease and poor general health. The patients included 31 men and 5 women with the following mean values: age, 44 years (range, 25-64 years); BMI, 29.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 22.3-34.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); AHI, 65.1 events per hour (range, 31.6-92.4 events per hour); and nadir oxygen saturation (LSaO<sub>2</sub>), 71.3% (range, 52.7%-86.4%).</p>
<p>Preoperative evaluation included clinical history, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) evaluation, physical examination, fiber-optic digital pharyngolaryngoscopy, and nocturnal PSG.</p>
<p>The patients underwent surgery under general anesthesia; all patients were reevaluated 1 year later. The procedure was considered successful if the postoperative PSG showed an AHI of &lt;15 events per hour and a &gt;50% decrease from value before the surgery and if the patient reported significant clinical improvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599813479932">
<title>Sleep Evaluation</title>
<p>All-night PSG studies included an electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, nasal and oral airflow measurement, thoracic and abdominal movement determination, and continuous measurement of oxyhemoglobin saturation by using a pulse oximeter. Sleep stages were scored by using Alice 4 according to the criteria defined by Rechtschaffen and Kales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813479932">5</xref></sup> Obstructive apnea was defined as the absence of airflow with respiratory effort for at least 10 seconds. Hypopnea was defined as a &gt;50% reduction in airflow accompanied by an oxygen desaturation of &gt;4%, or arousal from sleep. The percentage of time with oxyhemoglobin saturation below 90% (CT90%) and LSaO<sub>2</sub> were also calculated. Apnea-hypopnea index was defined as the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour. Microarousal index (MI) was determined according to the criteria of the American Sleep Disorders Association.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813479932">6</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599813479932">
<title>Subjective Evaluation</title>
<p>A comprehensive clinical history that encompassed the patients’ sleep habits and occurrence of sleep disturbance was evaluated. Excessive daytime sleepiness or hypersomnia was determined with the ESS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813479932">7</xref></sup> A score greater than 10 was considered indicative of hypersomnia. The extent of snoring was recorded by the sleeping partner on a standard 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) where 0 represented no snoring noise and 10 represented extreme noise causing the partner to consider leaving the room.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599813479932">
<title>Physical Examination</title>
<p>Patients underwent a preoperative physical examination that included a full assessment of the upper airway with nasopharyngolaryngoscopy, the Müller maneuver, and a standard examination. In all patients, the extent of retropalatal contraction brought on by the Müller maneuver exceeded 90%. Finkelstein and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813479932">8</xref></sup> previously described the anatomy of the velopharynx as being either flat or deep; the patients were divided into 2 groups based on this classification. In addition, the patients were grouped according to modified Mallampati position (MMP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813479932">9</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0194599813479932">
<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>After undergoing nasal CPAP for 5 to 7 days, all patients further underwent ZPP and coblation channeling of the tongue (CCT). Z-palatoplasty was performed according to the technique described by Friedman et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813479932">4</xref></sup> and CCT was performed using the Reflex55# (Arthro Care Corporation, Sunnyvale, California) according to the technique described by Zhang and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813479932">10</xref></sup> The first lesion was made 1 cm in front of the foramen cecum of the tongue. The 2 subsequent lesions were made anterior to the first lesion along the midline and 1 cm apart. Two additional lesions were made parallel to the back of the tongue and 1 cm apart on both sides near the base of the tongue. Each lesion was 15 seconds in duration and not more than 1.5 cm deep. The tonsils were preserved in all patients. Postoperative care was provided in the surgical intensive care unit for the first 24 hours after surgery. All patients received postoperative antibiotics and steroids but not CPAP.</p>

<sec id="section13-0194599813479932">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.0 (SAS, Inc, Cary, North Carolina). Continuous data are reported as means with standard deviations (SD). Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. Paired Student <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare preoperative and postoperative mean values. Unpaired Student <italic>t</italic> test and Fisher exact probability test were used to evaluate differences between responders and nonresponders.

<title>Symptom Severity</title>
<p>Thirty-six patients were followed up at 1 year. Subjective improvement was achieved in all patients. The mean (SD) postoperative BMI was 28.9 (2.8) kg/m<sup>2</sup> and was not significantly different from preoperative BMI. Patients’ and their partners’ subjective assessments of disease severity were recorded preoperatively and at the 1-year postoperative follow-up. The ESS score improved from a mean (SD) of 12.2 (5.8) to 5.5 (3.6), and snoring level improved from 7.3 (2.3) to 3.0 (2.1); the postoperative values for both parameters were significantly lower than the respective preoperative values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813479932"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). The mean (SD) baseline PSG parameters showed high AHI (59.8 [20.5]) and MI (40.8 [19.5]), with severe oxygen desaturation (CT90%, 32.3% [19.9%]; LSaO<sub>2</sub>, 70.5% [12.4%]). Postoperative sleep studies showed a significant reduction in AHI, MI, and CT90% and a significant improvement in LSaO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813479932"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Nearly 60% of the patients met the definition of successful surgical treatment for OSAHS—namely, a postoperative AHI of &lt;15 and a ≥50% reduction from the baseline AHI. Nonresponders were advised to continue treatment with CPAP.</p>

<title>Factors Predicting Positive Outcome</title>
<p>There were significant differences in CT90%, LSaO<sub>2</sub>, and MI between responders and nonresponders, whereas no significant differences were observed with regard to AHI and BMI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813479932"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). Subjects with MMP I or II were significantly more likely to have a positive outcome than those with MMP III or IV (90.9% vs 44.0%, respectively). Tonsil size did not predict outcome: surgical success rates were 60.0% and 57.7% for tonsil sizes 1 and 2, respectively; this was not a statistically significant difference. The anatomical structure of the velopharynx also appeared not to influence outcome, as there was no significant difference in success rate between subjects with the deep structure (56.5%) and those with the flat structure (61.5%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599813479932"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>).</p>

Friedman compared 25 patients who underwent ZPP and tongue-base reduction by using radiofrequency ablation with a matched group of patients who had previously undergone classic UPPP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813479932">4</xref></sup> The rate of objective clinical improvement was significantly better for the group who underwent ZPP (68% vs 28%), with no apparent increase in morbidity or complications. Recently, Friedman and colleagues studied the effectiveness of ZPP in patients with persistent OSAHS who had previously undergone UPPP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813479932">11</xref></sup> Thirty-one patients completed the study, all of whom underwent revision ZPP, radiofrequency tongue-base reduction. At follow-up, no patient showed clinically significant postoperative VPI after 14 weeks, and no major perioperative complications occurred. Subjective improvement was achieved in all patients, and objective cure was achieved in 21 (67.7%). The Z-palatopharyngoplasty (ZPPP) technique was conceived and modified from the Z-palatoplasty procedure and pharyngoplasty, and it appears to be effective for the management of severe OSAHS in patients with tonsils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813479932">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813479932">12</xref></sup> Yi and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813479932">12</xref></sup> reported a success rate of 64.7% and identified mandibular plane angle and Friedman stage as the most influential predictors of positive outcome. Lin and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813479932">13</xref></sup> studied the safety and efficacy of ZPPP combined with radiofrequency to the base of the tongue for treatment of patients with moderate/severe OSAHS, and they found that the success rate was 60.5% (26/43 patients), with no apparent long-term VPI. Surgical success in all of these studies was defined as a postoperative AHI &lt;20 and a 50% decrease from the preoperative value.</p>
<p>We studied 36 patients with size 1 or 2 tonsils who underwent ZPP and CCT by radiofrequency ablation. The tonsils were preserved in all patients. Our surgical success rate was similar to that reported for ZPPP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813479932">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813479932">12</xref></sup>; however, preserving the tonsils reduces the size of the wound and the operating time. For patients with tonsil size 1 or 2, tonsillectomy does not substantially widen the lateral dimensions of the pharynx. On the contrary, further narrowing of the pharyngeal isthmus could result from scarring caused by resection of the posterior tonsillar pillars, which may further affect long-term efficacy. Generally, patients with a higher tongue are more likely to develop an obstruction in the hypopharynx. The surgical success rate was significantly better in subjects with MMP I or II (90.9%) than in those with MMP III or IV (44.0%). This observation indicates that tongue position was an important factor affecting surgical efficacy. The differing anatomical structure of the velopharynx, as described by Finkelstein and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813479932">8</xref></sup> is based on the relative contribution of the pharyngeal walls to the closing of the velopharyngeal valve or isthmus during airway collapse. A deep velopharynx is closed by the movement of the velum and medial movement of the lateral pharyngeal walls forming a circular or sagittal closing pattern. A flat velopharynx is closed by the anteroposterior movement of the velum forming a coronal closure pattern with or without marked medial movement of the lateral pharyngeal walls. In our study, there was no significant difference between the groups of subjects classified on the basis of this anatomical distinction, leading us to conclude that ZPP can partially reduce medial movement of the lateral pharyngeal walls.</p>
<p>There was a positive relationship between reduction in AHI and reduction in ESS score: those who had greater improvement in AHI also had greater improvement in ESS score. Although some patients were not completely cured, they did show some improvement in AHI, MI, and oxygen saturation. Because this was not a placebo-controlled trial, we cannot rule out the possibility of the surgical placebo effect.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that ZPP combined with CCT has the potential to improve disease-specific quality of life and sleep apnea symptoms in patients with OSAHS and size 1 or 2 tonsils and that it has results similar to those reported for ZPP and tongue radiofrequency in patients who have previously undergone tonsillectomy. Further studies with larger samples are needed to confirm these findings.</p>
