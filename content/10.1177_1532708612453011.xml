<abstract>
<p>This article examines the Norwegian and Danish versions of the reality television series <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>. The reality show emulates what postmodern consumer society wants us to believe in: a kind of “second transgression” for the human being, in which she is both free and without anxiety. The guests (predominantly male in line with prevailing gender norms) at <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> may qualify as shameless—after spells of physical and psychological revelations in front of the camera with no visible regrets—still, the price is perhaps the loss rather than the gain of freedom. The medialized shameless self demands the subordination to narrow bodily and emotional standards during filming, which postpones most of the guests’ shame and regrets until after the cameras are turned off. This particular Fall may have unwanted personal consequences that lead to a spiral ascent crueler than Adam and Eve ever underwent.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A number of theorists, ranging from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612453011">Søren Kierkegaard (1981)</xref> to contemporary sociologists, social psychologists, and philosophers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532708612453011">Thomas Scheff (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612453011">Jack Katz (1996)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612453011">Judith Butler (2005)</xref>, have argued that the emotion of shame is a fundamental ingredient in the constitution of selfhood. Today, however, we often witness televised displays of shamelessness in a variety of reality television programs that attracts wide audiences. In this article, we ask what we can learn about selfhood and shame in postmodernity from an interpretation of one particular reality show, called <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> is an American reality television program that was first aired on the Fox broadcast television network in 2003. The show belongs to the subgenre of “gamedocs” that succeeded an earlier wave of “docusoaps” from the mid-1990s, signaling a shift in television from <italic>documentation</italic> to <italic>transformation</italic> of reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612453011">Couldry, 2009</xref>). In <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>, the gaze of the camera centers on a group of single women and men who live in a luxurious resort to see who can stay there for the longest period of time. Couples must pair off and share a room, and when an individual is left alone, he or she must check out. New guests arrive regularly, and losing contestants are occasionally allowed to check back in. The last couple left receives the prize money—US$250 000 in the American original—which they have to decide whether to share with their partner or not, running the risk of being betrayed.</p>
<sec id="section2-1532708612453011">
<title>Production Details</title>
<p><italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> was created by Mentorn, a UK independent production company, which has produced a franchised reality format that can be marketed and adapted to local audiences around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612453011">Andrejevic, 2004</xref>). Danish, Dutch, and Swedish versions trailed in 2005, an Israeli adaptation under the name <italic>The Bay of Love</italic> was launched in 2008, Norway followed in 2009, Hungary and Russia in 2011, whereas the Czech Republic and Slovakia became the most recent countries to produce a domestic version of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> in 2012. The original American version of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> consisted of 32 episodes, which ran twice a week on Fox in the summer of 2003. The show gained strong summer ratings, but attempts at making it a year-round never-ending show (<italic>Forever Eden</italic>) failed and it was canceled after only seven episodes. <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> was finally relaunched in America in 2008 on MyNetworkTV and the Fox Reality Channel.</p>
<p>The Danish show has grown to become one of Denmark’s most popular series. An eighth consecutive season of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> Denmark premiered in 2012, and although the 2010 final was the most watched final yet, ratings from later seasons suggest a drop in interest from an average of 325.000 in 2010 (a high number for Denmark with just 5.5 million people). In Norway, <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> became the most talked about reality show in 2009, and was then commended for rejuvenating the reality genre. The show gathered an average of a quarter million viewers. The final episode of season three aired on the June 2, 2011, and gathered 332,000 viewers, or 19.3% of the Norwegian viewer market. Both the Danish and the Norwegian shows are particularly popular among young female viewers in the age group between 15 and 30. <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> is produced and distributed by TV3, the biggest commercial channel in the TV network Viasat owned by the Swedish media concern Modern Times Group.</p>

<title>The Postmodern Ideal of Paradise?</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612453011">Biressi and Nunn (2005)</xref> maintain that reality TV is an important platform for representations of individual aspirations and competitive individualism within the mediated social and public realm. The increasingly destabilized and permeable borders between the media and the social realm means that the cultural landscape is radically altered into a framework “within which we all have to abide” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612453011">Biressi &amp; Nunn, 2005</xref>, p. 155). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532708612453011">Bratich (2007</xref>, p. 6) upholds that reality television is not about <italic>representing</italic> reality, but actually about <italic>inducing changes</italic> via a televisual format. Following from this line of argument, <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> reads as a concentrated, idealized version of postmodernity, as a paradisiacal place where everything is possible (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612453011">Featherstone, 1991</xref>). On the surface, the guests are exposed to a warm, <italic>Club Tropicana</italic>-esque atmosphere in a highly luxurious resort where “the drinks are free” and “strangers take you by the hand”—to quote the 1980s Wham post-disco hit. The contenders receive a free holiday, and, more importantly, achieve national fame for their self-disclosure, by accepting the “democratic” invite of reality TV that holds the potential of turning normal people into celebrities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612453011">Andrejevic, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though the atmosphere may be nice and warm in <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>, the humane climate most definitely is not. The whole setup of the television show consists of creating intense human drama under the stifling sun, echoing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532708612453011">Thomas Hobbes’ (2008)</xref> stark view of man’s natural state of singular individuals in constant conflict in the absence of a Sovereign. The plot is created for the purpose of continuously singling someone out, which means that it is a game of survival, alliances, and rivalry, where no one can really be trusted, and the level of conflict is high. Also, the rules are constantly twisted, or liquid in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612453011">Bauman’s (2007)</xref> sense of the term, to keep up the interest among viewers, so even if one succeeds in creating a trusting, stable alliance, the producers who continuously monitor the plot will often make sure that it will not last.</p>
<p>Since <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>, unlike most other reality shows, does not involve a contest of skills or talents (see below), the guests’ primary assets are themselves, their own bodies, and selves. This quickly creates a market-like environment in which sexual appeal becomes a tradable commodity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532708612453011">Waggoner (2004)</xref> has previously documented how female sexuality comes to be a valuable survival tool in the reality show <italic>Survivor</italic>, as those female contestants who are least similar to the ideal female body are eliminated early in the game. Both female and male contenders appear to have learnt this lesson in <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>. One of the Danish contestants described her breasts as her “biggest assets,” while another guest in the Danish version was promised sexual services from an exposed male contestant, which led to a debate in the press whether <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> actually promoted prostitution.</p>
<p>Like fictional works of art, reality shows such as <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> both mimic the dominating ideas of the present, and try to offer a therapeutic catharsis to the antagonisms of our allegedly liquid and guiltless, but (perhaps) shameful backdrop of postmodern culture. On the reading of the show that we shall present below, its allure is especially appealing to young people and consists of inviting them “back to paradise” to achieve not only guiltlessness, but ultimately shamelessness. We return to the role of the audience watching in the last part of this article. Before that we present a reading of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> as a cultural phenomenon that may offer us insight into the current conditions of selfhood, shame, and the relations between them. We begin by outlining a perspective on the self as being born in shame, alluding—like <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> itself does—to the biblical myth of Genesis and the Fall. Shame is not the only precondition of selfhood, for, as the sociological tradition from George Herbert Mead through symbolic interactionism and to such figures as Anthony Giddens has argued, we become reflective selves by taking the attitude of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612453011">Adams, 2003</xref>). Following such figures as Judith Butler, however, we shall argue that the emotion of shame is a necessary (albeit not a sufficient) component in the self-constituting process.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612453011">Couldry (2009)</xref> has recently analyzed gamedocs from the perspective of theories of myths and rituals and has argued that ritual action (such as the “ceremony” in <italic>Big Brother</italic>) plays a very significant role in constituting the fictional worlds of reality TV. In <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>, however, there is a conspicuous lack of media rituals in comparison, as rules and rituals constantly change. As such, we conjecture that much of the appeal of the show derives rather from the “deep myth” of the Fall and the images of self that are entailed by this myth. We therefore go on to analyze in some detail different aspects of the show that are informative about selfhood and shame. In particular, we look at new performative developments in shamelessness, which are often maintained as a key trait in modern Western society (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532708612453011">Broucek, 1991</xref>). We do not believe that the emotionology uncovered in our analysis is universal since our examples derive from the imagined hemisphere we call the West.</p>
<p>Methodologically, we engage in a hermeneutic reading of the show based on the myth of the Fall, and although we draw on the Norwegian, Danish, and (to a lesser extent) American versions of the show, this is not mainly a comparative study, but a generic interpretation of the underlying imagery of shame and the self that we find in the show. We are sceptical about social science claims and ambitions of “value neutrality,” and our own analysis of the show is unabashedly normative and critical in the sense that we find that certain aspects of human life are twisted and perhaps even perverted in the show. The point, however, should not be to blame the contestants, but to analyze their drama as a reflection of the emotionology of postmodern Western consumer capitalism.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework: Return to Eden—Shame and the self</title>
<p>The biblical analogies in <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> are numerous. The contestants are invited to a luxury resort far away, with a tempered climate that allows them to walk around wearing a minimum of clothes. The script of the show encourages them to “do nothing” apart from sunbathing, drinking, and partying, which of course gives the impression of the contestants being in some sort of hedonistic paradise. The archetypical man–woman alliance, and the fact that only one man and one woman can remain in the end, resembles the myth of the origin of man (from the Book of Genesis). Dramaturgically, however, <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> actually tells a story that inverts the biblical narrative of the banishment from Eden—for, in the medialized paradise, contestants are gradually drawn into Eden until only one Adam and one Eve are left.</p>
<p>The biblical myth of the Fall from Eden has been a source of inspiration for analyses of morality, emotions, and the self at least since Kierkegaard’s <italic>The Concept of Anxiety</italic> from 1844. Kierkegaard interprets the myth as informing us of the existential anxiety that humans feel in response to nothingness. It is this anxiety that pulls humanity from innocence and into reflective, and thus potentially guilty and shameful, consciousness. Unlike fear, which has a concrete object, anxiety in the existential sense is directed at the possibility of freedom, which is nothing until it has been realized as a possibility. As creatures of body, mind, and spirit, we are, Kierkegaard says, able to conceive of nothingness, of possibility in the sense of the not-yet-realized, which is at once a condition of freedom and at the same time the ground of anxiety. The sense of nothingness and anxiety are crystallized in the prohibition in Paradise as the myth is articulated in the Bible: How could Adam understand the prohibition of eating the fruit, when he had not yet acquired an understanding of good and evil? Without this understanding, the very idea of acting against God’s command makes no sense and thus creates anxiety—but also evokes the possibility of freedom and noninnocence in Adam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612453011">Kierkegaard, 1981</xref>). To use Althusser’s famous expression, God interpellates Adam as a reflective, guilty, and shameful subject by articulating a prohibition, before Adam is able to understand the prohibition.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612453011">Jack Katz’s (1996</xref>, p. 557) sociological reading of Genesis, the story appears not just as a cosmological myth (about the creation of the world as such) but as “an experiment in theoretical imagination that produces a highly compressed social psychology” (p. 557). Genesis is a social psychology about how the human self was born in guilt and shame, and it works as a social psychology “to the extent that it is an economic description of the challenges that people face in their relations with others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612453011">Katz, 1996</xref>, pp. 559-560). We learn from the myth that the self is born as a reflective and conversational process, involving an “I” and a “Me,” to speak with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532708612453011">Mead (1934)</xref>, when the person sees herself through the eyes of the other, which is a shameful incident. It is shameful because the first glimpse of self-reflection (thus of the self as such) appears the moment when Adam and Eve realize that they have done something wrong by violating God’s command. They then see that they are naked and they must cover their bodies, assisted by God who gives them clothes.</p>
<p>Symbolically, Adam and Eve reach upward, to the branches of the tree, lured by the earthly snake, to eat and acquire wisdom, and consequently come to understand the ideas of good and evil, right and wrong, and thus the concepts of guilt and shame. If we ask how Adam and Eve could have been guilty <italic>avant la lettre</italic>, when their sense of good and evil only emerged with the eating itself, the answer seems to be that they could not. They become guilty only in retrospect, when they shamefully come to understand that their deed was wrong, and with this recognition emerges the self as a reflective process. The forbidden fruit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612453011">Katz (1996</xref>, p. 549) concludes, is “the very process of self-conscious reflection,” and <italic>shame</italic> thereby becomes the fundamental emotion that gives birth to the self, to the person’s relationship to a community and to other moral emotions.</p>
<p>In light of psychological theory, the myth does seem to be valid as a condensed description of the emergence of the human self. It articulates the important idea that the self is born in shame. In shame, the self is revealed to the eyes of others. A paradigm of shame can be when someone is looking through a keyhole and discovers that she is being observed by others. The self is here painfully objectified, revealed, in the eyes of other subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532708612453011">Karlsson &amp; Sjöberg, 2009</xref>), and the person is unable to control the presentation of herself in relation to the community, which is a powerful mechanism of social control. Paradoxically, in this painful <italic>revelation</italic> of the self, it (the self) is simultaneously <italic>created</italic> as a reflective product, since one looks at oneself through the eyes of others.</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612453011">Judith Butler (2005)</xref> has provided us with a thorough account of the constitution of the reflective self along these lines. Building on Althusser’s analysis of interpellation, Butler finds that we are interpellated (i.e., constituted as subjects) as accountable beings through accusations or allegations. She argues that it is the accusation of guilt that produces the possibility of being a subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612453011">Butler, 2005</xref>, p. 85). This can be understood in relatively straightforward developmental terms, as when a parent addresses a child and installs its self in a chain of events (“Why did you drop the glass and spilled the milk!?”). Here the child is interpellated as a responsible self, asked to give an account, and this account will normally be in narrative form and establish whether the self was the cause of the suffering or not. The self thus comes into existence when the individual is asked (or forced) to give an account of herself in relation to some shared set of norms (that may have been violated). Being a self presupposes a set of norms that can be broken and a range of moral emotions such as guilt and shame that inform us of these normative aspects of reality.</p>
<p>In this sense, the self is born in relation to morality, that is, in relation to learning to navigate within a set of norms: “The very being of the self is dependent, not just on the existence of the other in its singularity [‖], but also on the social dimension of normativity that governs the scene of recognition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612453011">Butler, 2005</xref>, p. 23). Butler puts her finger on an interesting developmental dynamism that we also saw in the myth of the Fall: We must expect more of people’s emerging selves than they can perform in order for them to become able to perform as we expect. God had to expect that Adam and Eve could understand the prohibition before they in fact could, in order for them to come to understand it. The one who is asked to give an account is not yet an account giving subject. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612453011">Butler (2005</xref>, p. 109) says, this also means that there is “no possibility of a pure and unmediated relation of myself to my will.” A person’s relation to herself is always mediated, which means that we are necessarily “dispossessed” as subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612453011">Butler, 2005</xref>, p. 132), necessarily dependent on the frames of interpretations that we are offered, for example by reality shows such as <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>.</p>
<p>If these considerations are valid, we may conclude on the one hand that selves are born in shame, and on the other hand that it is to a large extent the fear of guilt, and perhaps in particular shame, that keeps a community together (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532708612453011">Scheff, 1997</xref>). Through shame the community emerges not merely as an abstraction—an “imagined community” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612453011">Anderson, 2006</xref>)—but as a concretely felt reality with basic norms that resonate in most of us when they are broken. Numerous questions can be raised: Does the cultural (or “subcultural,” in the case of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>) lack of shame, then, lead to the lack of selfhood? Is this something we find in a postmodern culture of shamelessness? Was Kierkegaard right that without prohibitions, there can be no freedom? Could <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> be a social psychological test case in this regard?</p>
</sec>

<title>Analysis of the Show</title>
<p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612453011">Katz (1996)</xref>, who interprets the text of Genesis as a set of universal claims about human nature, we shall seek to understand <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> as a set of verifiable claims about selfhood and shame in our times.</p>
<sec id="section6-1532708612453011">
<title>No Competition-No Rules?</title>
<p>A curious aspect of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> is that unlike similar surveillance-based reality shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612453011">Andrejevic, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612453011">Couldry, 2009</xref>), the contestants do not really compete in anything tangible. Comparable reality shows in tropical surroundings such as the Swedish <italic>Expedition Robinson</italic> (SVT; TV3; TV4 1997-) and the American <italic>Survivor</italic> (CBS 2000-) involve hard physical trials and competitions in a range of survival skills, and even the more alluring <italic>Temptation Island</italic> (Fox 2001-2003) dealt with stressful trials of fidelity. Perhaps the closest comparison to <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> is the immensely successful <italic>Big Brother</italic> installment. The contestants here also did not do much apart from hanging about, but it was still a popularity contest where viewers ultimately decided the winner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612453011">Couldry, 2009</xref>). In <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>, there is a dramaturgical pattern each week that builds up to the Thursday ceremony, when someone is singled out. The selection ceremony, however, is not like the “island counsel” in <italic>Expedition Robinson</italic>, where the entire group votes, and a democratic verdict is reached. Decisions of who are allowed to stay and who must leave are down to one single contestant in <italic>Paradise Hotel.</italic></p>
<p>Furthermore, in <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>, the criteria for success are vague, perhaps because the contestants live in a simulacrum of Eden, which, according to the myth, is prior to right and wrong, and even in its production format the rules and the ultimate goal are, apart from the very last week, left in the background. Any viewer who has followed the show will have noticed this; the finale is an anticlimax, as if the makers have not given it much thought beforehand. During the innumerable weeks when the show is aired, the guests and viewers rarely get a reminder about how long it will last. The American original was for instance suddenly extended due to its popularity with viewers. <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> is much less based on a linear master narrative than on numerous micro happenings that occur between the individuals involved, much like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532708612453011">Lyotard’s (1984)</xref> depiction of the postmodern era as characterized by incredulity toward metanarratives. <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> is, we argue, less like a competition as such, and more like a late modern platform for the exposure of shamelessness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1532708612453011">
<title>There Is No Time and Place</title>
<p>Concerning location, we are not told where the luxurious hotel that is the background for the action is located. Like Eden itself, the televised paradise is outside time and space. This loss of feeling of place was clearly underlined when one of the Norwegian contestants failed to successfully mark which part of the world she was in on a map. Unlike reality shows like <italic>The Bachelor</italic> (ABC 2002-), which occasionally is recorded in an exotic, foreign country, <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> has no visible sponsored collaboration with the local authorities that makes the viewer see the regional tourist attractions, integrated in the show. Pairs in <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> are sometimes awarded excursions, but where they actually sojourn could be anywhere in the world, within a certain distance to the equator.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532708612453011">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> dramaturgy resembles tropical fictional shows such as the modern classic <italic>Fantasy Island</italic> (ABC 1978-1984) or the seemingly never-ending <italic>Lost</italic> (ABC 2004-2010), where the viewer is left in the dark about geography, as both shows create an almost eerie feeling of bewilderment. The much awaited ending and solution to the big mystery in <italic>Lost</italic> also underlines the idea that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532708612453011">Kant’s (2007)</xref> transcendental categories such as time and place for the late modern subject are “lost.” An early demonstration of this transcendental confusion was perhaps provided in the American original of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> when Toni, in an impassioned plea directed at Dave, made the remark: “This is temporary. Life is permanent.” <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> is also shot with special strong color filters, which produce a nonrealistic and dream-like visual effect, resembling the three-strip Technicolor technology used in movies such as <italic>The Wizard of Oz</italic>, esthetically emphasizing the reality show’s visual enchantment and strong trait of unreality.</p>

<title><italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> Did Not Take Place</title>
<p>From a commercial point of view, the makers’ idea of creating a backdrop that simulates a postmodern consumer theory about “non-places” (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612453011">Auge, 2009</xref>), where everything is at hand and nothing is lacking, is clever. It is well known that the contestants in <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> are encouraged to get inebriated, since the odds for them to perform actions they otherwise would not do in front of the camera obviously increase. However, the whole setup, and the philosophy of no-place, helps to create a more fundamental, yet subtle loss of attachment, bonds, and ideally prohibitions, that is not as open to criticism as giving young people unlimited amounts of free alcohol and then record their misconduct. Contemporary reality shows like <italic>Paradise Hotel’s</italic> mimicry of the apparent liquid, alcohol-like, postmodernity is ironic; in the sense that they fulfill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612453011">Baudrillard’s (1981)</xref> (in-) famous and often misinterpreted thesis about hyperreality. Fiction has not really become more real than the real—“the real” still very much exists, but commercial media spectacles such as <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> persistently try to make us believe that all that is solid melts into air, and through this constant mimicry gradually creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. When the contestants return home, they often brutally become aware of “the real,” through death threats on Facebook, and sometimes even physical attacks, and, in a more long-term perspective, exclusions from future job opportunities due to a bad reputation. In accordance with present gender norms, female reality contestants are more vulnerable to this revenge of “the real” than their male rivals (see Discussion).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1532708612453011">
<title>Revenge of the Nerds</title>
<p>The American original of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> consisted of a group of committed contestants with their eyes firmly fixed on the money prize throughout the weeks in the holiday resort. Thus, the importance of “playing the game,” forming alliances and manipulating other guests, quickly became a focus of action, perhaps helped by the selection criteria, which fitted into the American college stereotypes pattern of the jocks, the nerds, and the cheerleaders. In the finale, the typical nerd—the head smart Dave—had outlasted his muscular rivals, following the traditional script of the competitive antagonism between the two groups from numerous American TV shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532708612453011">Quail, 2011</xref>), but Dave was ultimately betrayed by his spouse, the shy beauty queen Charla, who broke their pact and took the whole prize money of US$250 000.</p>
<p>Despite the constant conspicuous rivalry both dictated by the rules of the game, and the adversary conventions of the social world outside of paradise in the American original show, a wholly different and much more casual attitude towards the goal of winning could be sensed in the Norwegian second series of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>. The ultimately most successful couples, Carl and Tine and Even and Thea, shared a casual happy-go-lucky attitude toward their stay in <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>, their focus seemed to be on their own well-being here and now, without giving much thought to winning and the strategic positioning necessary to secure this goal. Several of the other contestants openly told the viewers at home, and other guests, that they would do anything in their power to win, and like their American predecessors stressed the importance of “playing the game.” The most outspoken representative of this philosophy was Victoria, who rapidly became a hate object among viewers, which underlies the conservative gender roles where women are allowed less room for displaying strategic behavior than men.</p>
<p>The differing attitudes toward what <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> “really was about” occasionally created tensions between the groups, and several members of the show felt that the male victor Carl was an unworthy winner, since he refused to argue why he should win, and took an indifferent attitude toward duels, owing to his casual and careless philosophy (according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612453011">Couldry’s, 2009</xref> analysis, this has also taken place in <italic>Big Brother</italic>, but here it was the exception rather than the rule). Hence, unlike many other reality shows, the object of winning, and playing it tactically, getting allies, and so forth was not an apparent intent for the most successful group of the guests at <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>. The “true winners” of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> were the contestants who were most indifferent to the overall goals and plans (like winning) and most comfortable just “being themselves” in a relaxing, charming, and sometimes nude manner, without much thought for consequences: what the outcome would be <italic>in</italic> the show, and eventually what would happen on the outside when filming was over.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1532708612453011">
<title>A Showcase of Shamelessness</title>
<p>That being said, there still exist certain norms concerning the types of behavior that are wanted. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612453011">Butler (2005)</xref> would say, we could not imagine social life or selfhood without such norms, however liquefied they might have become in <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>. The visitors in <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> all seem to be highly self-conscious that the show is about the breaking down of taboos and self-disclosure either by physical or mental exposures. On the very first night of the Danish sixth season, a competition spontaneously broke out between the girls, after only hours of knowing each other, when several of them stripped off their tops and compared their breasts. The consistent revelations throughout the series, either by stripping clothes or confiding secrets, are so frequent in <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> that alcohol alone does not fully explain this recurring behavior of self-disclosure.</p>
<p>Similarly, new contenders who are permitted a stay in the hotel are extra vulnerable to social exclusion, and therefore are under particularly strong pressure to swiftly demonstrate that they belong and are down with the show’s (contradictory) powerful norms about shamelessness. The new female guest, the law school student Jeanette, in the second Norwegian series, almost instantly asked other guests (men and women), exceedingly intimate questions about masturbation habits and sexual preferences. Most definitely inappropriate in any other social setting, yet, in <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>, Jeanette only followed the norm and just did what was expected of her to demonstrate that she concurred to the unspoken rules of the show. To borrow a biblical phrase, we can say that to the pure, everything is pure, and such questions can be seen as innocent and childlike in the paradisiacal state beyond (or before) good and evil, but, on another interpretation, they are clearly meant as transgressing common morality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1532708612453011">
<title>Truth or Dare</title>
<p>Regularly the guests of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> are engaged in different social games (Twists!), scripted by the producers to hold the attention of the viewer. For instance, the contestants are instructed to play a version of the children’s game “Truth or dare.” In the Norwegian second series, the male and female guests were separated and were instructed to prepare questions to ask the other group. Not surprisingly, the content almost instantly took an intimate turn and was sometimes stretched to absurd levels of rudeness. The male contestants were asked about their penis sizes, a moderate question in comparison to the boys’ definitive question to the girls: “If you had to suffer a double penetration in the same body opening, would you prefer it to be vaginal or anal?”</p>
<p>Later on, the contestants spontaneously played similar games to “Truth or dare.” One version consisted of telling everybody, including the quarter of a million viewers, something that had never been revealed before. For instance, Stian recounted an embarrassing episode from his puberty when his mother accidentally caught him in the middle of masturbation. The show resembles the Freudian ethical ideal of bringing everything out in the open, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532708612453011">Foucault (1990)</xref> pinpoints in his <italic>History of Sexuality</italic>. The show illustrates what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612453011">Denzin (1995)</xref> calls a postmodern “pornography of the visible” that assists in making everything visible, serving to realize “the dream of a transparent society,” a dream much criticized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532708612453011">Foucault (1990</xref>, p. 190). In general, <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> is a useful reminder of Foucault’s critique of the limited potential of liberation that is left in the sexual revolution. The show could be said to represent a reality genre and medialized equivalent to hard core pornography, which, after decades of close-ups, is running out of ideas on how “to bring it to the next level.” Shows such as <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> attempt to take us beyond the pornography of the visible, for pornography no longer makes much sense when everything can be seen. Pornography—both in its physical and emotional forms—lives because of taboos, just as shamelessness lives because of shame. Because of the importance of shame for selfhood, we believe, however, that shamelessness can only be temporary.</p>

<sec id="section12-1532708612453011">
<title>Full Frontal</title>
<p>In his analysis of the social psychology of the myth of the Fall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612453011">Katz (1996)</xref> draws a contrast between body shame and spiritual shame. The latter is what happens whenever an intellectual gap is revealed (Katz lists the misuse of a phrase or the revelation of profound gaps in one’s implied superior education). This kind of shame is irrelevant or even turned upside down in <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>—in the Norwegian second series, the misuse of common phrases was the rule rather than the exception, and only one out of a dozen competitors knew the correct answer to the question: Which political party American president Barack Obama belongs to? Nonetheless, although the contestants may lack bookish wisdom, they still come across as quite smart about their self-presentations and behaviors on TV, suggesting that within their particular cohort, another type of intelligence or reflexivity is required.</p>
<p>Body shame, however, is an apprehensive sense of segregation at being revealed as unbearably naked in the face of an apparently omniscient community, and is what is depicted in the original Fall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612453011">Katz, 1996</xref>). A frequent complaint among the male guests in the second season of the Norwegian <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> was that of sexual frustration. They were constantly exposed to lightly dressed, attractive women, and given no option (yet) to sexually engage with them. One of the male contestants, again Stian, sexually aroused by physically flirting in the pool, masturbated in the private bathroom. Accidentally, he was caught in the bathroom right in the middle of the act. Still, Stian did not stop from embarrassment and covered his genitals like Adam and Eve, but carried on with the self-stimulation laughing in front of his comrades, testifying to the shamelessness prior to eating the fruit of wisdom. This episode became a much talked-about event among the guests at <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>. Nevertheless, Stian’s popularity appeared to only increase amid the others for his misbehavior. Hence, Stian both verbally and behaviorally acted out his inner demons: his superego (maybe his mother) that told him that masturbation was something private and shameful. Of course, as Foucault, and later authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612453011">Michel Houellebecq (1998)</xref> have objected, sexual deliverances such as these episodes have turned the idea of emancipation into a joke that is not funny anymore.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1532708612453011">
<title>No Shame, No Game</title>
<p>It appears that this expectancy to display shamefulness in public also follows the <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> competitors after “paradise.” The winner of Norway’s first season of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>, former financial advisor Petter Pilgaard, has after the show ended become a television celebrity, and a frequent guest in numerous entertainment shows. One of these was produced by Norway’s best-selling tabloid newspaper <italic>VG</italic>—and was an Internet-only reality succession called <italic>SMS Roulette</italic> (2010), again a modern twist of the “Truth or dare” children’s game. The show gathered a dozen Norwegian celebrities with the assignment to send inappropriate text messages to random people in their phone book. The winner was the last man standing—the contestant who was most courageous or careless about whether his grandmother or best friend’s wife received obscene messages like “Jerking off” or hurtful posts like “I am currently going through my phone book deleting people I do not which to stay in contact with anymore. You are one of them.” The winner after nine rounds of embarrassments was, not surprisingly, Pilgaard, demonstrating his superior skills of “not giving a damn.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>Paradise Hotel’s</italic> ideal of superiority—feeling no personal shame no matter what—is most likely an attractive category for today’s generation of adolescents and young adults, who often experience explicit or implicit social expectations to self-actualize and govern themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532708612453011">Rose, 1999</xref>). Yet, the present cultural ideal of the sovereign shameless self is possibly not as independent and free from traditional bonds as they might appear, and medialized spectacles such as <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> would want us to believe. Different rules apply for male and female behaviors, for example—the former have more freedom to display themselves as they wish, and access to the medial stage after the cameras are turned off are restricted, and only at the prize of taking on a shameless, but charming persona.</p>
<sec id="section15-1532708612453011">
<title>Gender Trouble</title>
<p>Previous studies of gender categories in British reality television conclude that they tend to reroute traditional structures rather than offering a route out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532708612453011">Woods &amp; Skeggs, 2004</xref>). Similarly, the Scandinavian versions of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> are clearly imbalanced when it comes to the rules that apply to men and women, respectively. Previously mentioned Pilgaard—winner of Norway’s first version of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> succeeded in becoming a television celebrity, and is a fine example of the Paris Hilton-esque late modern fame where people are famous for being famous (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532708612453011">Redmond &amp; Holmes, 2007</xref>). What people do not remember is that Pilgaard actually won the contest together with his partner Benedicte Valen. Unlike Pilgaard, who became the second most queried person in the statistics for the public searches in the 2009 tax online outlines, after Norway’s (then) richest man Kjell Inge Røkke, but ahead of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, Valen is completely forgotten. Pilgaard was mentioned 209 times in the Norwegian printed press in 2009 and 2010 (not counting his many TV and radio appearances) —while Valen was mentioned just 13 times.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532708612453011">2</xref></sup> This could be interpreted as a reminder that <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> is not about winning prize money, since it does not require any particular skills, but the demonstration of a certain way of being. And women are, in accordance with gender-biased norms, to a large extent excluded from this type of “winning behaviour.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532708612453011">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Fame Monster</title>
<p>In the biblical story of Adam and Eve, we learn that they are banished from the Garden of Eden before they get to eat of the Tree of Life, which gives immortality. The equivalent mechanism in the postmodern story of Paradise is that the contestants are thrown out of Paradise’s media stage before they reach modern immortality, namely lasting fame. In fact, only a few people succeed in becoming “true winners,” such as Pilgaard and achieve late modern celebrity status. The celebrity scene is limited, allowing only a certain amount of people on it at a time, therefore most <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> contestants are not permitted a permanent stay there. Perhaps, it is here in the failure to make fame enduring in the weeks, months, and years after the TV-cameras have been turned off that we can rediscover the allegedly disappearing feeling of shame: The shame of being an unsuccessful reality-star, which even the winners of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> are not secluded from, because of its anticompeting ethos. Finalist Thea, now impregnated from her stay in paradise, is asked whether she stills receives offers related to <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic>: “-No, it’s not as if you demonstrate a talent in there which you can build upon. That is unless you want to join a drinking contest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612453011">Danielsen, 2010</xref>). This shame, however, begins only after the banishment from Paradise (Hotel).</p>
<p>As we have argued, Adam and Eve gained self-reflexivity when they ate from the forbidden fruit—man was from this point forever transformed from a creature to a creator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612453011">Katz, 1996</xref>). The existing shameless currents in Western consumer culture that <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> attempts to emulate try to make us believe that man is undergoing a second transgression: we are on our way to becoming creators, without the price the human being has paid for it until now, by living with shame. If some of the generations of young and beautiful guests at <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> convincingly demonstrate that they really are <italic>shameless</italic>—with no fear of standing naked in front of the modern God’s gaze, that is the camera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532708612453011">Ainley, 1998</xref>), does this mean that they must have lost freedom and their selves on the way in a literal Kirkegaardian sense? Particularly, as shame has been interpreted as a human emotion that is prerequisite for freedom (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612453011">Katz, 1996</xref>). Their freedom as reality celebrities is, we have argued, rather limited and consists of playing along with the show’s commercial interests in nudity, drama, and confessions, and afterward, if they are lucky and permitted a permanent stay in the media version of immortality, they must continue to play this role as the casual, shameless self. In the postmodern consumer culture, no one is allowed to say what freedom should consist of, but it seems uncontroversial to state that the room to transfigure oneself, after the creation of oneself as a successful <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> reality, is limited.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A reality show such as <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> is first and foremost a mirror of current desires in a contemporary market-driven society that commodifies bodies, appearances, and selves. Like most facades, however, it is not always a beautiful sight when one starts to look behind the glamorous and shining surface. We have referred to the Book of Genesis that tells the story of Adam and Eve, who originally were naked, but not ashamed. Shame came with self-consciousness after the snake had tricked them into eating from the Tree of Wisdom. Then Adam and Eve realized they were naked and they both felt shame. If one should see <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> as a pointer for where the late modern culture is heading, this will no longer be the case for future generations. They will most certainly be naked—maybe even in front of a TV camera—but they will feel no shame. The shame starts rather when the postmodern God’s gaze—the camera—is turned off. Either by gradually self-afflicted self-awareness or more dramatically in the form of other directed vindictive threats, bullying or exclusion from further career opportunities, because of their youthful sins.</p>
<p>In Eden, God was the omniscient observer, but in our world, the public, we, the viewers, are omniscient, witnessing every detail of the lives of the late modern Adams and Eves. Like the original biblical myth of Eden, immortality is never reached—fame will not last: The shameless self usually exists for just a short period of time. <italic>Fame because of shame</italic> in our medial version of paradise might actually live on, in places such as YouTube and in the public’s memory, as a rude and constant reminder of “the second transgression” in front of the numerous public eyes with its omniscient recording technologies that never forget. Shamelessness is temporary, but shame is permanent, partly because this emotion is a precondition of selfhood. This seems to be the lasting moral lesson of <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> after all.</p>

<p>The second season of the Norwegian <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> drifted slightly off from this “no-place” philosophy, by equipping the servants with moustaches and straw hats, and letting the contestants visit a local tequila brewery; hence drawing on stereotype signifiers commonly associated with “Mexico” in Scandinavia. The localized productions of a reality show such as <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> are of course not something fixed, but an evolving concept.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-1532708612453011">

<p>The unjust media reception after <italic>Paradise</italic> may also stem from the fact that Pilgaard was a original contender, while Valen was allowed in later, thus making him a more “worthy” winner, and allowing him to gain several weeks more of exposure to the public and media while the show ran.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-1532708612453011">
<label>3.</label>
<p>The media reception of the 2010 Norwegian <italic>Paradise Hotel</italic> winners—Carl Eliassen and Tine Valle—did not follow the same pattern; in fact, Tine was mentioned 29 times in the printed press and Carl 27 times. In 2011, the pattern was back to “normal” as Carl had been mentioned 22 times and Tine 12 times. But, since the numbers of unique hits are fairly modest for both of them, much closer to the forgotten Valen than the celebrity Pilgaard, neither has perhaps reached the level of fame necessary for being subjected to the media logic and stereotypical thinking, making them literally irrelevant.</p></fn>
