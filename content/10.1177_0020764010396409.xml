<abstract>
<p><bold>Background and Aim</bold>: Mental vulnerability (i.e. a tendency to experience psychosomatic symptoms, mental symptoms or interpersonal problems) is associated with various diseases. This study investigated whether mental vulnerability is associated with hospitalization for depression.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: A prospective study was conducted of six cohorts from the population of Copenhagen County, Denmark, with baseline information on mental vulnerability, lifestyle, social factors and comorbidity collected in 1976, 1982–84, 1991 and 1997–98 (<italic>N</italic> = 11,862). By register-linkage information on hospital contacts for affective disorders were obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register. The association between mental vulnerability and depression was examined using Kaplan-Meier plots allowing for death as competing risk and Cox proportional-hazard models adjusting for possible confounders.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: The cohort of 11,862 persons yielded a mean follow-up time of 12.3 years with 170 persons hospitalized with depression. The adjusted hazard ratio for hospitalization for depression associated with mental vulnerability was 1.23 (95% CI, 1.16–1.31) per step on the most used 12-item scale.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Mental vulnerability may be a risk factor for depression. Early identification and treatment of depression are essential for preventing chronic depression, reduced social functioning and disability. Psychiatric interviews should be used to evaluate whether the criteria for depression are fulfilled, but it may furthermore be relevant to identify persons who may be at risk of developing depression in the long term. The possibility of using, for example, the mental vulnerability scale for such purpose should be further investigated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>At any point in time approximately 3% of the Danish population is affected by depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764010396409">Olsen et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, depression is a relatively common mental disorder and it is associated with high levels of morbidity and excess mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764010396409">Sullivan et al., 2000</xref>). It is therefore important to identify risk factors that could be used for early identification and prevention.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive study of risk factors for depression, three major pathways for the development of depression were identified: adversity (stressful life events such as sexual abuse in childhood and bereavement), externalization (e.g. conduct disorder and substance misuse) and internalization (e.g. personality traits and early-onset anxiety disorder) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764010396409">Kendler et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764010396409">2006a</xref>). With respect to personality traits, the dimension of neuroticism has been shown to play a particularly important role in the development of depression. Neuroticism is associated with emotional arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764010396409">Cloninger, 2000</xref>), and individuals who are high on neuroticism tend to be more worried, anxious and emotionally unstable than persons with low levels of neuroticism and they tend to be more vulnerable and at increased risk for becoming depressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764010396409">Christensen and Kessing, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764010396409">Kendler et al., 2006b</xref>).</p>
<p>In Denmark, a more specific measure of mental vulnerability was constructed in the 1960s to measure three dimensions of mental vulnerability: psychosomatic symptoms, mental symptoms and interpersonal problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020764010396409">Sabroe et al., 1968</xref>). The inventory is similar to other scales developed internationally in that period including the Twenty-Two Item Screening Score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010396409">Langner, 1962</xref>) and shortened versions of the Cornell Medical Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764010396409">Levav et al., 1977</xref>). The original inventory comprised 27 items, but a subset of 12 items were demonstrated to fit a Rasch model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764010396409">Andersen and Sørensen, 1979</xref>) and scores on these items have subsequently been used in studies of mental vulnerability and health. Thus, a Danish study reported that mentally vulnerable people have a less healthy lifestyle and use the health services more than non-vulnerable persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764010396409">Kühl and Martini, 1981</xref>). Mental vulnerability has furthermore been associated with a number of physical symptoms and diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764010396409">Kay et al., 1995</xref>), upper dyspepsia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764010396409">Kay and Jørgensen, 1995</xref>), peptic ulcer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764010396409">Rosenstock, 1996</xref>), ischaemic heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764010396409">Eplov et al., 2006</xref>) and early mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764010396409">Eplov et al., 2005</xref>), but not with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764010396409">Schapiro et al., 2002</xref>). This prospective cohort study investigates the association between mental vulnerability (assessed by the Danish Mental Vulnerability Scale) and risk of hospitalization for depression, taking into account potential confounders that are associated with depression and mental vulnerability. The hypothesis was that higher level of mental vulnerability would be associated with higher likelihood of hospitalization with a diagnosis of depression.</p>

<title>Study sample</title>
<p>The study was based on data for six cohorts studied in southwestern Copenhagen County, Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764010396409">Hollnagel, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764010396409">Jørgensen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764010396409">Laurberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764010396409">Linneberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020764010396409">Thomsen et al., 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764010396409">Table 1</xref>). All cohorts were randomly sampled from the population, based on criteria specific for each cohort. Of a total of 20,116 persons who were invited to participate, 12,772 (63%) agreed to do so. Information on mental vulnerability, gender, age, cohabitation status, education, comorbidity, exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption was obtained from self-administered and interview-administered questionnaires. Body mass index was calculated from data on height and weight (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) obtained at a general health examination at enrolment. These factors were a priori chosen for inclusion as confounders or mediators in the analyses based on the literature (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764010396409">Eplov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764010396409">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764010396409">Lipton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764010396409">Pascoe et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Mental vulnerability</title>
<p>Mental vulnerability was assessed using the Mental Vulnerability Scale, which was constructed by the Military Psychological Services in Denmark in the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020764010396409">Sabroe et al., 1968</xref>). The original version comprised 27 yes/no items, but in the 1970s the Danish National Institute of Social Research used only 22 of the 27 items in a study of a random sample of 10,753 Danes; 12 of the 22 questions were found to fit a Rasch model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764010396409">Rasch, 1960</xref>) and thus to constitute a uni-dimensional scale. This 12-item scale has since been validated as a reliable measure of a stable individual characteristic in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764010396409">Eplov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764010396409">Kühl and Martini, 1981</xref>), including a test-retest study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764010396409">Andersen and Sørensen, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764010396409">Eplov et al. (2010)</xref> investigated the psychometric properties of the 22-item scale, the 12-item scale and three new scales, constructed to measure the original three dimensions of mental vulnerability: psychosomatic symptoms (five items), mental symptoms (six items) and interpersonal problems (five items) (Appendix). The authors concluded that both the 12- and the 22-item scales can be used as an overall measure of mental vulnerability, while the three new scales may prove useful in analyses of the predictive power of different aspects of mental vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764010396409">Eplov et al., 2010</xref>). The three new scales showed moderate intercorrelation (range 0.33–0.54), and they were used in the present study together with the 12-item scale, which has been used in most previous studies of mental vulnerability and health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020764010396409">
<title>Hospitalizations for depression</title>
<p>Information on hospital contacts for depression was obtained from the nationwide Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, which contains information on all admissions to Danish psychiatric inpatient facilities, both psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric departments in general hospitals, and, since 1995, information from outpatient contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764010396409">Munk-Jørgensen and Mortensen, 1997</xref>). The register admission record includes the hospital department, the date of admission, the date of discharge, one primary psychiatric diagnosis and up to three auxiliary diagnoses. All diagnoses were classified according to the ICD-8 between 1969 and 1993 and according to the ICD-10 since 1994. Hospital contacts for affective disorders as the main diagnosis were identified, divided into bipolar illness (ICD-8 codes 296.19, 296.39 and ICD-10 codes F30, F31) and unipolar depression (ICD-8 codes 296.09, 296.29, 296.99, 298.09, 300.49 and 300.19 and ICD-10 codes F32 and F33). Persons registered with both bipolar illness and unipolar depression on the same date were classified as having bipolar illness in the analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 13).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0020764010396409">
<title>Exclusions and follow-up</title>
<p>Of the 12,772 persons in the sample, 37 were excluded because they were members of several cohorts, one who had emigrated before baseline, one who had information missing at the baseline date, 179 who were hospitalized for depression before the baseline, 395 who gave incomplete responses for one or more items on the Mental Vulnerability Scale (1.7% hospitalized with depression after baseline) and 297 who had data on covariates missing at baseline (1% hospitalized with depression after baseline). This left 11,862 persons for the analysis. Individual follow-up began on the baseline date and ended on the date of in- or outpatient hospitalization for depression (<italic>n</italic> = 170, 1.3%), date of death (<italic>n</italic> = 1356, 10.6%), emigration (<italic>n</italic> = 98, 0.8%), disappearance (<italic>n</italic> = 3, 0.02%) or end of follow-up on 15 November 2003 (<italic>n</italic> = 10,235, 80.1%), whichever came first.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0020764010396409">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The association between mental vulnerability and hospitalization for depression was examined with Kaplan-Meier plots, classifying persons scoring &lt; 3 as low, 3–4 as medium and &gt; 4 as high mental vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764010396409">Eplov et al., 2005</xref>), while allowing for death as a competing risk. The Cox proportional hazard model, with age as the underlying time scale, was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between mental vulnerability and risk for hospitalization for depression. Tests showed that it was appropriate to include the mental vulnerability scales as continuous variables. Analyses were stratified by gender in the Cox model to take into account the possibility that intensity is different in men and women. To account for potential mediating or confounding factors, the analyses were adjusted for cohabitation (living with a partner, living alone), education (7–9, 10, 11–12 or ≥ 13 years), comorbidity (yes/no answer to the question: ‘Has a medical doctor ever told you that you have hypertension, heart disease, a stroke, bronchitis or diabetes?’), physical activity (sitting most of the time, walk, exercise, exercise at competition level), smoking (never, former, current 1–14g/day, current 15–24g/day, current ≥ 25g/day), body mass index (continuous) and alcohol consumption (continuous). Separate analyses were conducted including and excluding bipolar illness. In order to examine whether scores on the mental vulnerability scales partly reflected early symptoms of undiagnosed depression, separate estimates were computed for the first year, second year and two or more years of follow-up. Because of the intercorrelations among the mental vulnerability scales, the three new scales were analysed both with and without mutual adjustment. The statistical analyses were performed in SAS 9.1 (SAS institute, Inc., Cary, NC).</p>

<p>The Kaplan-Meier plot showed a clear association between degree of mental vulnerability and hospitalization for depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020764010396409">Figure 1</xref>). In the Cox proportional hazards model, adjustment for covariates reduced the hazard ratios slightly.

Significant associations were found between each of the three mental vulnerability dimensions and hospitalization for depression, with adjusted HRs of 1.34 (95% CI, 1.18–1.53) per step on the psychosomatic symptoms scale, 1.34 (95% CI, 1.18–1.52) for the interpersonal problems scale and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.30–1.60) for the mental symptoms scale (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0020764010396409">Table 4</xref>). Similar HRs were observed after exclusion of bipolar illness (data not shown). When the three scales were mutually adjusted, the association remained significant only for the mental symptoms dimension and hospitalization for depression (adjusted HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.17–1.57). Again, the results were similar after the exclusion of bipolar illness from the analyses (data not shown).</p>

<p>Stronger associations between the interpersonal problems dimension and the mental symptoms dimension and risk for hospitalization for depression were observed in the first year after baseline. The HRs for the second year after baseline were still increased but less so, and, after ≥ 2 years, the HRs were similar to those in the overall analyses. For the psychosomatic problems dimension, no differences in risk estimates were observed by time since baseline (data not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this prospective population-based study of the association between mental vulnerability and hospitalization for depression showed that persons with high scores on mental vulnerability scales are at a significantly increased risk for hospitalization for depression, even after adjustment for mediating or confounding factors including comorbidity, education, cohabitation, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption. All three dimensions (psychosomatic symptoms, interpersonal problems and mental symptoms) were individually associated with a risk for hospitalization for depression, but only the mental symptoms dimension remained significant when the three dimensions were mutually adjusted. Moderate correlations among the scales indicate the presence of co-linearity and possible overlap among the psychological constructs, making it difficult to identify the relative contributions of each dimension.</p>
<p>Some personality traits may make people vulnerable to depressive episodes and have been proposed as causal factors in the development of affective disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764010396409">Christensen and Kessing, 2006</xref>), such as self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764010396409">Brown et al., 1990</xref>) and hopelessness/helplessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764010396409">Alloy et al., 1990</xref>) and neuroticism. A number of studies of the relationship between neuroticism and depression support this vulnerability hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764010396409">Christensen and Kessing, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764010396409">Dunkley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764010396409">Kendler et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764010396409">Steunenberg et al., 2006</xref>). A recent comprehensive review found that the epidemiological evidence published so far, including seven longitudinal studies of high-risk populations and nine longitudinal population-based studies, supported the vulnerability hypothesis and concluded that neuroticism might be a pre-morbid risk factor for depression, although the causal relationship between personality traits and bipolar affective disorders remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764010396409">Christensen and Kessing, 2006</xref>). Thus, the results on mental vulnerability are in line with existing results on neuroticism. Still, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764010396409">Eplov et al. (2010)</xref> observed that both scores on a standard symptom questionnaire (Symptom Check List SCL-90-R) and on personality scales (NEO Personality Inventory Revised NEO-PI-R) contributed independently to the explained variance in mental vulnerability scores, indicating that the scores reflect both a state and a trait component, in particular, neuroticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764010396409">Eplov et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, scores on mental vulnerability should not be considered a pure measure of a personality trait. While aspects of mental vulnerability overlap with neuroticism, the observed bivariate correlations between the different mental vulnerability scores and NEO-PI-R neuroticism were in the range 0.39–0.59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764010396409">Eplov et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This study has several advantages, including the population-based prospective design, comprehensive information on factors associated with depression and mental vulnerability, complete follow-up of registered hospitalizations for depression and vital status, a highly specific outcome measure and the use of validated scales. Presumably, the advantage of using a prospective design is that mental vulnerability is assessed before the hospitalization for depression. Since mental vulnerability scores partly reflect mental states, the association between mental vulnerability and depression may reflect early symptoms of depression not warranting hospitalization. This possibility was investigated in supplementary analyses showing higher HRs in the first years after baseline for the interpersonal problems and mental symptoms scales. However, the risk estimates were similar to the overall estimates after two years of follow-up, suggesting that the association between mental vulnerability and depression are not due to early symptoms of an undiagnosed depression or less severe symptoms not warranting hospitalization. The finding of a stronger association between mental vulnerability and hospitalization for depression in the first years after exposure measurement could reflect the state component of mental vulnerability, whereas the remaining increased effect observed after two or more years possibly indicates the trait component of mental vulnerability.</p>
<p>Some previous studies used self-reported measures of depression, which may have resulted in overestimation of the risk, as personality traits such as neuroticism are associated with increased reporting of physical symptoms and health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764010396409">Goodwin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764010396409">Turk Charles et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764010396409">Watson and Pennebaker, 1989</xref>), which may be categorized as depression. This potential bias was limited by using registry-based information on hospitalization for depression. Also, the cases were restricted to severe depression by studying persons who were hospitalized for this condition. Thus, the outcome measure is highly specific (it is very likely that patients receiving a hospital diagnosis of depression are depressed) but not very sensitive (most depressed people are managed in general practice or remain undiagnosed). Treatment of psychiatric disease has changed over the years, and hospitalization for depression now requires more and more severe expression of the condition (thereby increasing specificity). However, outpatient contacts for depression since 1995 have been included, which has probably mitigated this change in specificity. It is not known whether the degree of mental vulnerability influences the likelihood of hospitalization, with the potential to introduce bias. Hospitalizations with depression may reflect not only the severity of the depression but also treatment-seeking behaviour and interpersonal problems of the depressed individual. Thus, these factors may to some degree be intermediary factors on the pathway between mental vulnerability and hospitalization for depression. To the extent this is the case, the present study’s findings reflect associations between mental vulnerability and risk of hospitalization with a depression diagnosis rather than associations with depression per se.</p>
<sec id="section10-0020764010396409">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One potential limitation of this study is the fact that physical disease may influence both mental vulnerability scores and the risk of depression. However, the association between the psychosomatic scale and hospitalization for depression was not particularly strong, and control for physical comorbidity led to only small changes in the HR, indicating that there was no overlap.</p>
<p>A comparison of the study sample with the total Danish population showed that the sample was comparable, although fewer persons in the sampling area were employed in agriculture, horticulture and fishery, and fewer were self-employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764010396409">Jørgensen, 1990</xref>). The response rate (63%) was relatively high for population-based surveys. Often, non-responding is associated with low socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020764010396409">Tjønneland et al., 2007</xref>), and the relationship between mental vulnerability and depression might be different among individuals with many and those with few resources. As there was no information on the non-responders, this issue could not be examined; however, the variation in demographic and lifestyle factors within the study population allowed valid analyses of associations, although the external validity might be affected.</p>
<p>An earlier study showed that the effect of neuroticism on the risk for depression was stronger for persons who had experienced stressful life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764010396409">Kendler, 2004</xref>). The present study could not take into account factors such as stressful life events, other than comorbidity, and further studies are needed to explore the interaction between stress and personality (including mental vulnerability) with respect to the risk for hospitalization for depression.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This large, prospective, population-based study suggests that mental vulnerability is a risk factor for hospitalization for depression. Early identification and treatment of depression are essential for preventing chronic depression, reduced social functioning and disability. Diagnoses of clinical depression should of course be based on psychiatric interviews, but for preventive purposes it may be important to identify vulnerable individuals who may have early symptoms or an increased long-term risk of developing depression. Since the mental vulnerability inventory is short and easy to answer and the scores reflect both state and trait components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764010396409">Eplov et al., 2010</xref>), the possibility of using the mental vulnerability scales as a screening instrument to identify persons having an elevated risk of developing depression should be further investigated.</p>
