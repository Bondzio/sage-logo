<abstract>
<p>This article deals with the durability of 2D woven mat carbon/polyester, glass/isopolyester, and gel-coated glass/isopolyester reinforced composites under hygrothermic conditions with regard to marine applications. The test coupons were exposed to 60°C and 70°C at 95% RH for a maximum duration of 100 h. The samples were periodically withdrawn and weighed for moisture absorption and tested for the degradation in the mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength, flexural strength, interlaminar shear strength, and Young’s modulus and flexural modulus. Carbon/isopolyester-based specimens showed greater stability with respect to degradation in the mechanical properties than the glass/isopolyester/gel coat- and glass/isopolyester-based specimens. Glass/isopolyester exhibited the maximum moisture absorption, whereas the minimum moisture absorption was found in glass/isopolyester/gel coat. Diffusion coefficient (<italic>D</italic>) was found to be the highest for glass/isopolyester and the lowest for glass/isopolyester/gel coat, based on the Fick’s law of diffusion. Diffusion coefficient increases with the increase in temperature for all the specimens. Microstructure study of fractured specimens was carried out using scanning electron microscope to compare matrix/fiber debonding and matrix-degradation of fiber-reinforced polymer composites.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311427776" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, fiber-reinforced composites were frequently used as engineering materials in structural parts of marine field such as ships, harbor facilities and floating structures, fishing trawlers, mine-hunting ships, canoes, and domes of submarines because of their favorable properties such as good corrosive resistance, high modulus and strength-to-weight ratio, good chemical stability, fatigue resistance, and easiness to make complex integrated structural parts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311427776">1</xref></sup> Generally, polymer-based materials are not water soluble but they are capable of absorbing various amounts of water, depending on their chemical nature and formulation, as well as on the humidity and temperature of the environment to which they are exposed. Water aging may strongly affect the matrix behavior, by producing changes in its chemical and physical nature, by itself or in conjunction with other chemical or physical agents such as heat and ultraviolet light.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311427776">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311427776">3</xref></sup> In humid temperature the water absorption rate increases with increase in temperature. In hot humid exposure, moisture diffuses through the fiber, matrix and fiber–matrix interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311427776">4</xref></sup> The study of the interface between fiber–matrix regions was also important in determining the composite properties. The effects of moisture diffusion in polymers were Fickian and non-Fickian in nature. The type of non-Fickian diffusion shows that the viscoelastic nature of the polymer results in cracks. Carbon is more superior than glass with respect to moisture sorption. Iso polyester resins exhibit higher thermal and chemical stabilities in the case of moisture and therefore are the best option for use in marine applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311427776">4</xref></sup> Moisture absorption leads to the reduction in the mechanical properties of the composite materials by degrading the fiber–matrix interfacial bond. The rate at which the moisture diffusion occurs in a composites depends on factors such as volume fraction of fiber, fiber orientation with respect to the direction of diffusion, type of fiber and matrix, voids, viscosity of matrix, humidity, and temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311427776">5</xref></sup> Under wet conditions, the glass/matrix interface is the determining factor of the reinforcement mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311427776">6</xref></sup> The polymer matrix and the fiber/matrix interface can be degraded by a hydrolysis reaction of unsaturated groups within the resin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311427776">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311427776">9</xref></sup> Debonding may occur at fiber/matrix interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311427776">10</xref></sup> A concern with using carbon and glass fiber composites in marine structures is the limited understanding and small database of information of their long-term durability in hygrothermal environment. Furthermore, hygrothermal aging in the absence of external loads can lead to spontaneous formation of matrix microcracks in specimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311427776">11</xref></sup> Temperature effect during humid aging on the interfaces of glass and carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy composites at higher temperature during hygrothermal aging not only increases the moisture uptake rate but it may also modify the local stress threshold required for delamination nucleation. Experiments were conducted on the effect of temperature on moisture absorption characteristics of carbon fiber/epoxy composites at 60°C temperature and 95% RH and also at 70°C temperature and 95% RH environments. Since the glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>) of isopolyester–glass composites is 116°C, it is decided that a maximum temperature range of 40% of <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> would be taken.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311427776">12</xref></sup> Therefore, this study is conducted to report the results of the study on the effects of hygrothermal aging on water sorption and mechanical characteristics of glass/polyester, glass/polyester/gel coat, and carbon/polyester composite by exposing them to temperatures 60°C and 70°C and relative humidity 95% RH for a maximum duration of 100 h.</p>

Three combinations of fiber–resin polymer-reinforced composites used in this study are glass fiber/isopolyester, glass fiber/isopolyester/gel coat, and carbon fiber/isopolyester. The specimens were fabricated using wet hand lay-up process of 2D woven mat fibers (0/90) and the number of fiber layers was derived based on the fiber/resin proportion 65/35 wt% in all the cases. Isopolyester resin, cobalt accelerator, and methyl ethyl ketone peroxide catalyst were procured from Bhilosa Tex N-Twist Pvt Limited, Mumbai, India. The specimens were naturally cured at room temperature for 2 weeks, before exposing them to hygrothermic conditions.

<p>Experimental studies on the degradation of mechanical properties of ultimate tensile strength (UTS), flexural strength (FS), interlaminar shear strength (ILSS), Young’s modulus (E) and flexural modulus (FM) of the composites were carried out under hygrothemic conditions as per ASTM standards. The specimens were exposed to hygrothermic conditions at temperatures 60°C and 70°C at 95% RH for a period of 100 h. The specimens were periodically withdrawn, weighed for moisture absorption, and tested for mechanical property degradation; the failure mode of the FRPs was examined by the fractography using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).</p>

<p>The composite specimens of glass fiber/isopolyester, carbon/isopolyester, and glass fiber/isopolyester/gel coat had dimensions 50 × 6 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>, 80 × 8 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>, and 216 × 19 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup> as per ASTM D 2344, ASTM D 760 and ASTM D 638 for inter-laminar shear, flexural and tensile strengths, respectively. These specimens were kept in the instrumented Environmental Chamber (M/s CM Environ systems, Bangalore) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311427776">Figure 1</xref> at 95% RH at 60°C and 70°C for a maximum duration of 100 h.

<sec id="sec11-0021998311427776"><title>Microstructural studies</title>
<p>SEM was employed to characterize the tensile-fractured specimens before and after hygrothermic exposure. The type of damage that produces the degradation of a composite material has been typically classified as matrix damage (microcracks, coalescence of voids), fiber damage (breakage or buckling), or interface damage (debonding).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311427776">16</xref></sup> Matrix mechanisms have been predominant in composites exposed to environmental conditions. Often, matrix cracking clears the way for other degradation mechanisms, which will eventually cause the composite to fail. Finally, the fiber–matrix interface failure has been difficult to detect and measure, quantitatively. Methods to characterize interfacial damage have been proposed by Jayamaran et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311427776">17</xref></sup> The effect of the hygrothermic exposure on the interface region and the changes in the mechanical property were also studied through SEM.</p>

<p>The scanning electron micrograph provides good evidence of the binding between the resin and the fiber before and after the hygrothermic exposure. During manufacturing of a composite, voids are introduced in the composites. This causes the theoretical density of the composite to be higher than the actual density. Also, the void content of a composite is detrimental to its mechanical properties. These include lower moisture resistance, shear stiffness and strength, compressive strength, transverse tensile strengths, and fatigue resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311427776">19</xref></sup> The microcracks and voids formed during the composite preparation can be traced using micrographs. The micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311427776">Figure 8</xref>(a)–(c)) show that matrix/fiber bonding sustained after 100 h of exposure at 60°C in all three types of specimens and it was also observed that failure mode of fiber breakage is dominant in carbon/isopolyester compared to other specimens. At 70°C, micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311427776">Figure 8</xref>(d)–(f)) of fractured specimens showed that fiber breakage as well as fiber pull-out and a higher degree of matrix degradation occur in glass/isopolyester specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311427776">Figure 8</xref>).

<p>Hygrothermic behaviours of carbon/isopolyester, glass/isopolyester/gel coat, and glass/isopolyester composites were studied by exposing them to 60°C and 70°C and 95% RH in an environmental chamber for a maximum duration of 100 h. Diffusion coefficients were evaluated for all the test conditions. Moisture uptake in all test conditions showed that glass/isopolyester/gel coat specimens absorbed the least amount of moisture. Increase in temperature caused higher level of diffusion and hence the onset of saturation showed advancement in the number of hours of exposure to saturation. Consistently, all the specimens showed increase in the moisture uptake with respect to increase in temperature. The better performance of isopolyester was attributed to the gel coat which minimizes the voids and decreases water permeation.</p>
<p>Mechanical properties such as tensile strength, FS, ILSS, Young’s modulus and FM of carbon/isopolyester composites were well above those of the glass/isopolyester and glass/isopolyester/gel coat composites at all test conditions. Hence, it can be concluded that in terms of mechanical properties, carbon/isopolyester composites are superior even though they absorbed more moisture than glass/isopolyester/gel coat composites. Micrographs of fractured specimens of composites confirmed that matrix/fiber bonding sustained after 100 h of exposure at 60°C and 70°C.</p>
