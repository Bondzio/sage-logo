<abstract>
<p>Continuing Laurel Richardson’s call to use writing as my method and specifically utilizing poetic inquiry, “For Trayvon Martin” represents my interpretation of this tragedy filtered through a lens shaped by an epistemology of color, the history of racism, and local and national news reports both in print and on-line, as well as informal conversations with a wide variety of family, friends, and colleagues. The work’s theoretical frame incorporates critical pedagogy, critical race theory, and imagination-intellect theory. This piece investigates the impact of racial profiling and a Stand your Ground law supposedly designed to protect Florida citizens who are instead falling victim to it.</p>

<p><bold>Rope Burn</bold></p>
<p>There’s an invisible rope lying</p>
<p>beside each body like a macabre memory</p>
<p>it appears after bullets fly pierce</p>
<p>innocent Black men</p>
<p>killing the same blood</p>
<p>that’s been spilling for centuries.</p>
<p>It’s part of a crime scene po-lice</p>
<p>have investigated before they get to each new</p>
<p>x-marks-the-spot.</p>
<p>Local news denies this new way of lynching</p>
<p>illegal as segregation</p>
<p>while the murderers go free—</p>
<p>their right to bear arms intact.</p>
<p><bold>Tea Leaves</bold></p>
<p>No one noticed the broken bottle</p>
<p>of tea kicked over by the cop</p>
<p>who took the caution tape down</p>
<p>after Trayvon’s body was moved</p>
<p>and every skittle scattered when he was shot</p>
<p>picked up and placed in an individual</p>
<p>evidence bag.</p>
<p><bold>Truth is</bold></p>
<p>lies</p>
<p>bullshit buckshot</p>
<p>facts that matter forgotten</p>
<p>like fear in a teen’s eyes</p>
<p>wider, widened. A dropped</p>
<p>cell phone, Skittles</p>
<p>like bullets in a 17 year-old</p>
<p>chest.</p>
<p><bold>In the News</bold></p>
<p>Using the remote</p>
<p>each channel rearranges</p>
<p>a story like puzzle pieces.</p>
<p>Two puzzles shaken and dropped</p>
<p>on America’s conscience</p>
<p>divided into halves</p>
<p>each side as certain as the other</p>
<p>that justice will out</p>
<p>no matter what they say</p>
<p>when no one’s holding</p>
<p>a camera.</p>
<p><bold>Bond Issue</bold></p>
<p>Zimmerman cried broke</p>
<p>in court a 150,000 dollar</p>
<p>bond what a real judge thought</p>
<p>was fair. Prosecutors asked</p>
<p>for a million. Unprepared</p>
<p>for an apology that never happens</p>
<p>like this, they’re left holding</p>
<p>an empty bag as George walks out</p>
<p>with wooden teeth and the 200,000 dollars</p>
<p>in his Paypal account.</p>
