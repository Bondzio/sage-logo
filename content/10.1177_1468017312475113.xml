<p>Before I begin extolling the accessibility of this book by recommending it unreservedly to social work supervisors and mangers, social work practitioners, social work students, practice teachers, assessors and trainers, and post-qualifying social work students – a brief comment about the title. This is because ‘Mastering’ is a gendered term the use of which some may initially find disconcerting. However, the Series Editor clearly explains its use by stating that ‘we have thought carefully about its use in a social work context and have searched for alternatives but there are no others that convey its intended meaning here – a process of developing exceptional skill’ (p.8).</p>
<p>So what is it that makes me so enthusiastic about this particular book? Well to begin with the dedication to the late Dr Tony Morrison certainly caught my eye probably because ever since it was first published in 1993 ‘Staff Supervision in Social Care’ has never been far from my desk drawer. Although what really commended it to me from the start were two key messages at the beginning of the first chapter; which were that ‘at the heart of supervision is a relationship with the supervisee’ and ‘in social work supervision there is a case for reducing emphasis on management processes and increasing emphasis on reflection, critical thinking and emotional support’ (p.13). Messages that I have sought to adhere to and promote throughout my career. Messages, however, that don’t appear to sit comfortably with a recent study that reviewed social work supervision in England and Sweden, in which the researchers noted that ‘although each country addressed all three functions of supervision’ [managerial, educative and supportive], ‘each gave separate emphasis [and] in England the managerial function received more attention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017312475113">Davys and Beddow, 2010</xref>: p.27).</p>
<p>Nevertheless ‘relationship-based social work has a distinguished pedigree and goes back a long way in the profession’s history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017312475113">Howe, 2008</xref>: p.187), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017312475113">Biestek’s Principles (1957)</xref> related to individualization, the purposeful expression of feelings, controlled emotional involvement, acceptance, the non-judgmental attitude, client self-determination and confidentially have endured despite changes in terminology and the way language is used. Indeed ‘emotionally intelligent social workers’ still help to ‘contain service users and their feelings in a relationship that feels safe, safe enough for them to explore’ while ‘workers who do not have these skills, or … that come across as anxious, defensive or hostile, alienate service users’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017312475113">Howe, 2008</xref>:182).</p>
<p>Each chapter of ‘Mastering Social Work Supervision’ starts with a set of key messages and ends with a list of further reading and resources, and most include case studies and points to consider. In practice terms I found the points to consider particularly thought provoking and insightful. For example, in the chapter on ‘Supervising Social Work Assessments’ readers are asked to consider ‘when was the last time you observed one of your supervisees practise? What did this tell you about her skills in: showing empathy, demonstrating respect, communicating clearly, openly and honestly, challenging when necessary?’ and ‘if you haven’t observed practice recently – how can you plan to do so?’ (p.113).</p>
<p>‘Mastering Social Work Supervision’ also contains a comprehensive range of figures and tables, some of which may be familiar to readers depending on their previous experience and responsibilities. However, because the figures and tables are presented with refreshing clarity in an up-to-date context I would recommend it as a guide and practical handbook for both new and experienced supervisors alike. For example, I have worked in practice education for about seventeen years but still found Figure 3.4 The Ball of Stress (p.85), Table 3.2 Stress Mapping (p.87), the Sample Supervision Agreement in Chapter 2, and Table 2.2 The Four Functions of Supervision (p.62) particularly helpful in relation to some of the work I am currently undertaking.</p>
<p>Incidentally ‘Mastering Social Work Supervision’ now sits on top of a pile of books in my desk drawer where it will continue to remind me that ‘working with emotions in supervision is not an added extra: it is fundamental to facilitating good outcomes for service users, social workers and supervisors alike’ (p.90).</p>
