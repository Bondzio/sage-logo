<sec id="sec1-0022009412461777c"><title>Erik N. Jensen, <italic>Body by Weimar: Athletes, Gender, and German Modernity</italic>, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2010; 184 pp.; £32.50/US$50.00 hbk; ISBN 9780195395648</title>
<p>What can we learn from the history of sports about German attitudes toward gender, production and politics during the turbulent years of the Weimar Republic? Very much indeed, is Erik Jensen’s answer. In this innovative, eloquently written, and generally convincing book, Jensen sets out to show that Weimar-era discourses about sports shed new light on a range of major problems, from Germans’ responses to the lost war and Versailles Treaty to conflicts over the demise of established patriarchal gender roles and the pre-war cultural pre-eminence of the educated bourgeoisie (<italic>Bildungsbürgertum</italic>). A confluence of factors made Weimar Germany a crucial moment in the history of the body as a site of struggles over the meanings of modernity: While many health and fitness movements of the 1920s (nudism, hiking, gymnastics) opposed the atomization and mechanization of modern life by promoting a holistic, ‘natural’ approach to bodily exercise, professional athletes and those striving to imitate them ‘eagerly embraced modernity in all of its rationalized, individualistic, commercial, competitive, time-oriented, and achievement-focused excess’ (6). Popular fascination with professional athletes elevated sports idols to the status of a new type of national role model, and athletes’ own self-promotion contributed to profound shifts in social values. As Jensen argues, ‘discourse surrounding these athletes not only shaped German thinking about sports and the human body but also German attitudes toward social change as a whole during the Weimar Republic’ (130).</p>
<p>To illustrate these claims, the book dedicates a chapter each to three individual, competitive sports: tennis, boxing, and track and field. All of these sports had entered Germany relatively recently, and all of them benefited from the search for a new physical body in the aftermath of the First World War, when societies across Europe sought to regenerate their populations. In Germany, the experience of military defeat made the creation of vigorous bodies appear particularly urgent. For Weimar, Jensen suggests, the promotion of competitive sports had the additional benefit of offering ‘ostensible proof of the new republic’s claims to emphasize talent and hard work over gender, ethnicity, and birthright’ (5). The fall of censorship laws and extension of political rights facilitated the flourishing of competitive sports (for instance, boxing had been illegal in many parts of Germany before 1918). The three sports differed significantly in their political and class affinities. Tennis, the subject of Chapter One, was a British import that never fully shed its cosmopolitan elitism. Only the well-to-do could afford this sport, and many tennis players were of noble origin. To the chagrin of nationalists, German players rarely competed at home, frequently chose foreign partners for doubles and used an Anglicized vocabulary. Its social elitism notwithstanding, tennis did create important openings for experimentation with inherited gender roles. The sport’s association with an easy, sensual lifestyle helped promote what Jensen calls a ‘soft’ masculinity contrasting sharply with wartime ideals of a militarized manliness. Women’s tennis turned out to be more innovative and socially inclusive than men’s; among other things, the short skirts and tight outfits worn by female players helped ‘push women’s fashion in general toward shorter hemlines and greater functionality’ (35).</p>
<p>Chapter Two focuses on boxing, the most ‘proletarian’ of the three sports. After the alienation of mechanized warfare, boxing promised a more ‘authentic’ experience of man-to-man combat, where individual muscle power still counted. Somewhat paradoxically, in a society shaken by political violence, boxing may have offered contemporaries a reprieve insofar as it allowed them to be spectators rather than victims. The sport’s allure also stemmed from the fact that it was highly commercialized, featuring some of the most prominent ‘self-made men’ among Weimar-era athletes. Max Schmeling’s rise to professional and financial success perhaps owed as much to his keen marketing skills (he even broke his own nose to look more authentic) as it did to his pugilistic abilities. With the emergence of more serious women boxers, the sport helped transform conventional female gender roles. If boxing captures the tension between the search for physical authenticity and the objectification of the athletic body, the example of track and field conveys an even stronger sense of the contradictions of Weimar-era competitive sports. Track and field athletes provided contemporaries with crucial role models for negotiating the tremendous social, economic and political changes of the 1920s. Their relentless striving for ever greater efficiency, based on a training regimen using recent technology such as stop-action photography, mirrored broader processes of rationalization in industry. Track and field became the prime site for the production of the ‘Taylorized athlete’ (100); simultaneously, it endorsed an aggressive individualism. This was also the sport where female athletes achieved the greatest prominence. Jensen highlights the limits to the new opportunities created by track and field: thus, journalists and sports officials stressed that athletic activity improved women’s capability for motherhood, in the process creating an enduring ideal of ‘maternal athleticism’ (132) still influential in the Third Reich and beyond. Similarly, discourse about track and field received a strong infusion of nationalist rhetoric as supporters strove to prove the sport’s vital contributions to forging a stronger national collective.</p>
<p>The study is based on a range of primary sources including, most importantly, the publications of the national associations of tennis, boxing, and track and field, as well as general-interest sports magazines and the sports pages of major dailies. It also engages diverse sources from popular culture such as advertisements, film, satirical journals, penny fiction and the graphic arts. Archival sources are relatively scarce. Jensen’s exceptional skill at weaving different genres of sources into his narrative and his beautiful writing make the book a joy to read. By carefully integrating shifts in male and female gender roles during Weimar, the research breaks important new ground. After reading this book, even novices to sports history will be convinced of the field’s strong potential to shed light on key questions in twentieth-century German history. Some questions may deserve greater attention. Thus, while Jensen mentions that boxing was particularly popular among left-wing intellectuals and artists like Berthold Brecht, George Grosz and Erwin Piscator, we learn little about the specific ways in which boxing resonated with 1920s socialist and communist critiques of capitalism. The claim that Nazism represented a ‘meritocracy’ (139) needs further elaboration; it is far from self-evidently true. Yet these are minor criticisms that should not distract from the book’s many impressive achievements.</p>
