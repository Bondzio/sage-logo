<p>Holden Caulfield: <italic>I felt so lonesome, all of a sudden. I almost wished I was dead</italic>.</p>
<attrib>—J.D. Salinger, <italic>The Catcher in the Rye</italic>, 1951</attrib>
</disp-quote>
<p>It took a bit of hunting, but I was eventually able to locate the item I was seeking on my bedroom bookshelf. Its stark cover bears only the title and the name of its author, reflecting his desire that no artist’s rendering should discourage readers from forming their own mental image of the characters. The pages are brown and crumbly now and threatening to fall out. Nevertheless, my 1964 Bantam paperback copy of <italic>The Catcher in the Rye</italic> proved surprisingly durable as I read it over for the fifth or sixth time.</p>
<p><italic>The Catcher in the Rye</italic>, the only published novel by JD Salinger, caused quite a sensation when it appeared in 1951. When I was in high school, <italic>many</italic> years later, it was still pretty much required reading for the adolescent American male. Although I have since left adolescence far behind (my wife might disagree on this point), it has a comfortable familiarity by now that makes each rereading that much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>In case you’re not familiar with it, <italic>Catcher</italic> is the first-person account of the rapid downward spiral of 16-year-old Holden Caulfield in the days following expulsion from his fourth boarding school. Holden is a highly intelligent but dysfunctional youth, mired in the aftermath of an emotional breakdown triggered by the death of his brother Allie 3 years previously. Since the story is related in a monologue by the protagonist himself, the entire novel becomes a detailed character portrait.</p>
<p>The young man revealed to us is both appealing and pitiable, a Gordian knot of self-contradiction. He is creative, idealistic, sensitive, and compassionate; his pronouncements on human society are insightful, cynical, irreverent, and almost always entertaining. Throughout the narrative, however, Holden is fighting a losing battle against depression and mental disintegration. Although <italic>The Catcher in the Rye</italic> is often said to illustrate adolescent angst, Holden’s psychological state is about 40 city blocks beyond what could reasonably be classified as angst. He repeatedly describes himself as lonely, sad, blue, or depressed, yet he inevitably finds something repulsive about anyone who tries to befriend him. Holden’s behavior veers convulsively from depression to incipient psychosis, displaying rapid mood swings, unpredictable emotional lability, suicidal ideation, and even frank hallucinations.</p>
<p>Depression is an unusual topic for <italic>The American Journal of Sports Medicine</italic>. In this issue, however, it becomes relevant as Kerr and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512462362">9</xref></sup> from the University of North Carolina report the latest results in their ongoing study of the possible links between a history of concussion during a professional American football career and later neurological impairment.</p>
<p>This long-term undertaking began with a baseline General Health Survey (GHS) distributed to retired members of the National Football League (NFL) Players’ Association in 2001. At the time, the 2552 respondents were asked a series of questions about their physical and mental health, including having received a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, coronary artery disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease, depression, or schizophrenia. They were also asked to recall the number of concussions that they experienced during their years as professional football players.</p>
<p>Utilizing the data from this survey, the authors subsequently examined the possible association between a concussion history and the appearance of cognitive impairment and depression later in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512462362">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512462362">7</xref></sup> In the first study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512462362">6</xref></sup> 758 of the original subjects who were over 50 years old completed a second questionnaire designed to detect symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Since MCI might compromise a subject’s ability to respond accurately, the questionnaire was also sent to the spouse or another close relative of each subject. Among those surveyed, the investigators found that 22 had been diagnosed by a physician as having MCI, and 77 were judged by their family member to have some memory impairment. Sixty-one percent of players reported at least 1 concussion during their careers; players who reported 3 or more concussions were 5 times as likely to have received a diagnosis of MCI and 3 times as likely to be judged to have memory problems compared with players who never recalled a concussion. In addition, 33 players reported a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although there was no association between AD and the number of concussions, the onset of AD seemed to be early in comparison with the general American male population.</p>
<p>In 2007, the group published a similar analysis of 2434 respondents to the 2001 GHS with regard to depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512462362">7</xref></sup> Among those respondents, 269 (11.1%) reported having been diagnosed with clinical depression at some time. There appeared to be a linear relationship between the number of remembered concussions and reporting a diagnosis of depression; respondents with a history of 3 or more concussions were about 3 times more likely to report depression than those who never recalled a concussion. This analysis controlled for a number of comorbidities that might be related to depression, including age, years since retirement, length of career, MCI, and many major physical health problems.</p>
<p>In the current article “Nine-Year Risk of Depression Diagnosis Increases With Increasing Self-Reported Concussions in Retired Professional Football Players,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512462362">9</xref></sup> the authors report the results of a follow-up GHS questionnaire they sent in 2010 to 2102 of the surviving members of the same group of retirees. The specific purpose of this investigation was to see whether the number of reported concussions bore any relationship to the likelihood of being diagnosed with clinical depression during the 9 years between the 2 surveys. Although 1316 (62.6%) of eligible subjects responded, 138 were excluded because they had already reported depression on the 2001 survey. Once other respondents who had incomplete data were removed from consideration, 1044 were left for analysis, of whom 106 (10.2%) reported a diagnosis of clinical depression during the intervening 9 years. The prevalence of being diagnosed with depression during that period increased as the number of reported concussions increased, ranging from 3% in the group who reported no concussions to 26.8% in those who recalled 10 or more such episodes. The authors also considered the possible interaction of over 25 covariates with their results and subsequently adjusted for the confounding effects of 2 of them, the number of years since retirement and an athlete’s general physical health as reflected in the Short Form 36 they had completed in 2001. This adjustment moderated the relationships noted in the raw data, but the risk ratio for depression between those who reported concussion during their career and those who never recalled having a concussion still varied between 2.3 and 5.8, depending upon the number of episodes reported.</p>
<p>An investigation of this type has some inherent limitations that are acknowledged by the authors. The study design prevents establishing a cause and effect relationship. The diagnosis of depression was based upon report of the subjects rather than their physicians, whose criteria for making such a diagnosis are not known. Only concussions that occurred during professional play were considered, and their occurrence was documented solely by the players’ recollections. These recollections did vary somewhat over time, as was reported in a separate study that compared the responses in the 2001 and 2010 surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512462362">8</xref></sup> Subconcussive impacts are difficult to identify and were not considered. No true control population was available for comparison; by contrast, a 2009 University of Michigan report on retired NFL players noted a rate of current depression similar to that in the general US male population, although retirees under the age of 50 were more likely to endorse depressive symptoms than their general counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512462362">20</xref></sup> Factors other than concussion, some of which were documented in the study, can increase the risk of depression. These limitations need to be kept in mind when considering the conclusions of Kerr et al, but the apparent association between concussion and later neuropsychiatric impairment should not be summarily discounted.</p>
<p>Other researchers have explored the possible pathological basis for the appearance of neuropsychiatric symptoms in retired athletes who sustained concussions during their professional careers. A particularly interesting study used a panel of neuropsychological tests to compare a group of 60-year-old retired university hockey and Canadian football players who last sustained a sports-related concussion over 30 years previously with a similar group who had never sustained a concussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512462362">4</xref></sup> While the tests were being performed, the investigators monitored the subjects with electroencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). They found that the previously concussed retirees (1) displayed cognitive and motor system changes that closely resembled those found in asymptomatic athletes 3 years postconcussion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512462362">3</xref></sup>; (2) showed significant reductions on neuropsychological and electrophysiological measures of memory and frontal lobe function known to be sensitive to MCI and early onset AD; and (3) demonstrated motor execution slowness that correlated with the TMS data.</p>
<p>In their discussion, these authors addressed the question of why neuropsychological test performance abnormalities that usually resolve within 10 days following concussion might resurface more than 30 years later. They noted that higher-performing older adults use compensatory mechanisms to offset the normal deleterious effects of aging. Based upon this, they hypothesized that subclinical deficits might persist after concussion that are easily masked by the greater compensatory reserve of younger individuals but are again exposed as those athletes age and their ability to compensate erodes. On the basis of their electrophysiological findings, the authors went on to speculate about the anatomic changes that might be responsible for the persistent deficits.</p>
<p>Pathological findings in the brains of retired football players and other athletes who have come to autopsy following premature death from suicide or other causes have focused attention on the specific changes that might be associated with the most severe cases of neurological deficit and disordered behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512462362">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512462362">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512462362">16</xref></sup> Because many of these cases have involved former professional athletes who had a history of head injury, a relationship to prior head trauma has been hypothesized but not proven nor universally accepted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512462362">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512462362">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512462362">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512462362">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512462362">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512462362">19</xref></sup> Some cases have been reported in retired athletes with an uncertain history of concussion, raising the possibility that they are related to subconcussive impacts or other causes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512462362">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512462362">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512462362">16</xref></sup> These findings have so far been described in a relatively small number of individual cases, and their prevalence is unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512462362">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>This constellation of neuropathological findings has been classified by the investigators under the rubric of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512462362">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512462362">14</xref></sup> These authors observe that the brain findings, including an abnormal accumulation of tau protein and neurofibrillary tangles, bear some resemblance to but also distinct differences from the changes seen in AD. A recent review by some of these researchers notes that there are currently no universally accepted neuropathologic criteria for diagnosing CTE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512462362">5</xref></sup> Authors critical of applying the term CTE to the changes seen in both the brains of former boxers and retired football players point out pathological differences between the two.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512462362">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512462362">2</xref></sup> Although it is not possible to diagnose CTE based upon clinical findings, which may have many underlying causes, premorbid behavior associated with it includes disordered cognition, memory loss and executive dysfunction, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, and depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512462362">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>If mental distress and cognitive decline are disturbing subjects in a fictional character like Holden Caulfield, they are that much more distressing in real life. Not surprisingly, concerns about possible latent sequelae of sports-related head trauma have received considerable attention in the lay press.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512462362">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512462362">18</xref></sup> As team physicians, we need to stay abreast of this literature but judiciously avoid sensationalizing it. Clearly, much additional research, preferably prospective, is needed to elucidate these issues. Since the prevalence and causative factors of these manifestations are not definitely known at this time, it is not evident whether anything can be done to moderate their appearance. For now, the most reasonable advice for team physicians is to follow the guidelines of requiring complete recovery before permitting a return to participation following a sports-related concussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512462362">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512462362">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512462362">17</xref></sup></p>
