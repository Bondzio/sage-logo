<abstract>
<p>This article focuses on an interesting type of challenge that can fight against effective leadership in large-scale change efforts. The type of challenge the author refers to is a paradox—alternatives that don’t follow from each other, where both alternatives appear necessary, but where choosing one acts to negate the other. In this article, the author argues that paradoxical circumstances are both common and have predictable effects that act to stall or stop change efforts. He provides two examples of paradoxes from his consulting in a culture change effort and shows how the leader was supported to bridge the gap between paradoxical paths. The author concludes by making several suggestions that will help leaders identify and deal with paradoxical circumstances successfully.</p>

<body>
<p>In any complex change effort, interesting challenges can arise that create pressures that fight against leading. One such challenge is a <italic>paradox</italic>—alternatives that don’t follow from each other; where choosing one alternative acts to negate the other.</p>
<p>In a recent change consulting engagement, I started to notice these paradoxical circumstances. Each was different in terms of content, but all were alike in that they brought pressures on leaders that tended to stall or stop them from leading. What makes them interesting is that although the path forward isn’t always clear, these challenges always capture leaders’ attention, given that both alternatives may seem important to embrace, and they often affect their leadership.</p>
<p>I will describe two examples of these paradoxes based on an engagement at a company that was attempting to change its corporate culture. The business case for change had been made, and senior leaders across the organization accepted that the proposed changes were necessary, given the new business challenges the company faced. Leaders said they were “on board,” and several began leading in earnest to bring about this change. As the months went by, the change effort started to slow down, much like other change efforts that this leadership team had attempted to tackle. That’s when a team of internal and external consultants stepped up their support for these leaders.</p>
<sec id="section1-1056492612454456">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The company in question was at a point where it had to change or, potentially, risk going out of business. It was a high-tech government contractor that was in a battle for a major government contract. The loser of this competition would likely have to ramp down its business, let go of a large proportion of its technical and skilled workforce due to a lack of revenues, and, therefore, lessen its ability to compete in other high-tech product competitions. Leaders knew they could compete well based on technical product design—They had one of the best technical and engineering workforces in the industry. What they didn’t know was whether they could convince government contract judges that they had a workforce that would meet its commitments—on cost, quality, and schedule.</p>
<p>This turned into a difficult decision for senior leaders. On one hand, the company needed to focus on creating a sustainable culture that was aligned with honoring commitments and meeting goals. On the other hand, the anticipated costs associated with this culture change effort were staggering, and none of this leadership team had previously been associated with a successful culture change effort. Leaders struggled with whether they should make this investment in culture change or whether the money would be better used to support the development of its technical solution. The leadership team struggled with this question for months before deciding that, despite the inherent uncertainties involved, they needed to establish a new culture that would support winning the contract and, once won, help them deliver on the cost/quality/schedule requirements in that contract.</p>
<p>I was one of three external consultants on a team that supported a group of 12 VPs and the company president. Our team met every Wednesday morning to address the support issues that we faced—to debrief the previous week and to plan how we would support leaders’ ability to move forward. This particular week, we held an off-site to reflect on our overall efforts to date and figure out what we were learning that helps to promote these change efforts. We brainstormed and discussed ideas, and as the second flip chart page was nearing completion, it started to crystallize for me—Leading change involved not just many separate issues, but issues that were in seeming opposition to each other. I was starting to understand that change in large organizations is about living with inherent paradox!</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1056492612454456">
<title>My First Clue</title>
<p><italic>Paradox</italic> is an interesting term, not for its meaning but for its implications. By paradox I mean choice alternatives that are in opposition to each other; to choose one negates the other. When faced with making a decision that contains “the horns of a dilemma,” leaders, therefore, must seemingly choose which path to take . . . and which to avoid.</p>
<p>Some choices have visible and clear-cut outcomes associated with each alternative, and, not surprisingly, these decisions are not too difficult to make. Leaders seem to do some sort of mental calculus that speaks to the biggest gain or loss, probabilities of each, and then move forward with one of the alternatives.</p>
<p>Other circumstances, like the choice of whether to invest in this culture change effort, can be more difficult to evaluate (e.g., it’s difficult to tell the specific consequences of not choosing a particular alternative or knowing when, over time, their expected impact will be felt).</p>
<p>Anytime the path forward is not clear, a tough choice needs to be made. Sometimes, leaders need to choose between two goods, sometimes between minimizing two potential losses. Both alternatives may be seen equally important; indeed, both may be seen as necessary. In these instances, leaders will again look for a path that maximizes gain or minimizes loss . . . or for a path that fits existing patterns of thought and action and, thus, that makes them feel more comfortable.</p>
<p>When the outcomes are not clear, or their comfort level is breached, these types of paradoxical circumstances have predictable effects. When unclear, they stall decision making as leaders deal with the uncertainty. Both paths may be important or necessary, and yet it’s hard to see how to have the benefits of both. In these instances, a third alternative often shows up—to do nothing now. When that alternative wins out, progress slows down dramatically, or stops completely. When any of these alternatives go beyond leaders’ comfort zones, leaders often gravitate to the alternative that <italic>feels</italic> less risky, even when they recognize the value of the more risky alternative.</p>
<p>Indeed, that was my observation during that off-site meeting—in the face of paradoxical circumstances, leaders tended to stall, postpone, study, or just avoid making decisions at all . . . or take the less risky, more comfortable alternative that they know won’t address the issue at hand. Such tactics do not, of course, remove the paradox. They simply delay or, in the extreme case, paralyze those responsible for making decisions, and have the effect of stalling or, in the extreme, stopping the change effort.</p>
<p>When I looked closely, it started to become clear that paradoxical choice points occurred continually, and continually, leaders faced decisions that acted to slow down their efforts or that reflected older, more comfortable patterns of behavior.</p>
<p>Metaphorically, these paradoxes create a rhythm of sorts. Music that has a definable rhythm has a repeated pattern of sounds with differing tempos, strengths, lengths, and loudness. Rhythm, thus, adds interest to the music and, at the same time, makes the music harder to play. Listening for that rhythm is a key to uncovering a paradoxical force that needs to be understood and addressed.</p>

<title>Example 1: Focusing on the Present and the Future</title>
<p>The first example involved one of the VPs in charge of a major program at this company. She had her hands full dealing with the day-to-day challenges that always occur in complex manufacturing processes. At some point, we started to hear, and then to observe, that nothing was really happening around the culture change effort in her part of the organization. I went to talk to her.</p>
<p>She said she knew that she needed to lead this initiative in her area. She confessed to having not done much to support this change and seemed confused about what she needed to be doing, although the leadership team had discussed what was expected of senior leaders. When I offered to help, she said she had no time. When I told her that her personal involvement was critical, she agreed. She told me that she was aware of the importance of this change effort, honestly wanted to support it, and recognized that the change would stall without her visible involvement. Therefore, I offered again to help, and again, she pointed to her calendar, mumbled about how busy she was, and finally said she could squeeze in a half-hour next week.</p>
<p>This executive was clear that leading change was her responsibility and a successful change would not happen without her visible leadership. She was also clear that producing results against her annual production objectives were as important and also her responsibility. She saw this as having to choose between focusing on the present <italic>or</italic> focusing on the future. She ended up choosing not to make the time in her schedule to lead this change in her area, saying that she had a “day job that demanded her complete attention!”</p>
<p>To others, this looked suspiciously like resistance to change. Other VPs told us that she clearly was not “on board.” When we started to see the pattern repeat itself (slow, limited, or no visible acts of leadership), we came to believe that some of what passes for resistance (choosing not to support the change initiative) may be no more than a natural reaction to making tough choices on paradoxical issues. How do we handle an already burdensome schedule and still find time to lead? When we ask busy executives to do just that, the melody changes for them and the piece becomes more difficult to play!</p>
<p>This was the first of four meetings with this VP. Her heart was in the right place, but she struggled in trying to resolve how she could possibly handle both horns of her dilemma. In our third meeting, I asked her to start to think about how she could produce <italic>both</italic> results—both/and thinking—and asked her to identify the people she needed to engage for that to happen. This was not an easy conversation for a leader who had a “hands-on style” and, although she complimented her direct reports on their talent and experience, she had a hard time fully delegating assignments in ways that freed up her time.</p>
<p>In the end, this VP started to think about her job differently, more like an orchestra leader than a hands-on manager. She began to see that both goals (producing today’s results and leading to create tomorrow’s culture) were not in conflict if she were to change how she saw her role. She was encouraged and supported to embrace both horns of her dilemma. As a result, the company benefited from her leadership without losing productivity from her program, her people appreciated having a more engaging role, and she grew as a leader.</p>
<p>Did the music become harder to play for her? Absolutely, but in the end, it was a richer, more interesting melody. The paradox that stopped her leadership was replaced by a new understanding of how to connect the horns of her dilemma.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1056492612454456">
<title>Example 2: Wanting to Do What Is Comfortable and Needing to Do What Is Necessary</title>
<p>There are several different kinds of comfort zones. Some reflect skill sets, others reflect habits, and yet others reflect mental models. It doesn’t matter what kind of comfort is being described, comfort zones reflect our past—what we’ve already learned or experienced or concluded as the way things need to be done. They are comfortable not just because we’re familiar with them but also because these skills and habits and mental models have served us well. They supported our prior success and are expected to continue to support us going forward, unless and until the world requires us to move past what we already know and know how to do, past how we’ve always thought about things. Thus, although comfort zones reflect what has served us well, they also may get in the way of our leadership, when leading means we have to move beyond that comfort zone.</p>
<p>I saw this occur during this change effort when leaders were asked to <italic>teach</italic> a new dialogue skill set that was considered crucial to the culture change effort. Intellectually, no one had a problem with this new skill set. Leaders actually seemed eager to take the training program that would help them develop these skills. Their enthusiasm grew after having the class, and they wanted their direct reports to have the same experience. That’s when everything changed—when the paradox of comfort ran into the reality of newness.</p>
<p>These leaders were asked <italic>to teach</italic> this dialogue program to their direct reports. Their discomfort was palpable. Some squirmed in their seats, whereas some immediately shook their heads indicating that they did not want to do this. Others spoke up. More accurately, they objected vociferously.</p>
<p>They pointed out that they had big jobs that required their full attention. They disclaimed any understanding of how to teach and said that training needed to be done by professional trainers. In addition, one VP voiced what everyone experienced—He said that he would be too uncomfortable trying to teach anything to his direct reports.</p>
<p>Much like the first example, these leaders were well aware of why it was important to step up and lead. They were clear that a leader-as-teacher model made sense. They were equally clear that they didn’t want to do this—They didn’t know how, didn’t have the time, or were far out of their comfort zone to lead in this way.</p>
<p>The consulting team responded by addressing their lack of comfort in a number of ways. We offered to give them some pointers on how to teach. We invited them to pair up with a fellow VP so that they would have only half the material to teach in any 2-hr training block, and they would have someone to prepare with. We had a professional trainer do the 1-hr kick-off session to make sure the training got off to a good start. This person also provided tips for teaching this material, observed the VPs’ first sessions, and gave them feedback to make them more effective. We held a 1-hr preparation meeting to make sure they understood the material they were about to teach. Finally, one of the consulting team members sat in on each session to make sure that these VPs had a safety net in the room in the event they got stuck.</p>
<p>This did not change their outcry at first. However, as we met with them and listened to their objections and met them with support, some became willing to “try it.” Then, as we helped deepen their understanding of the material and supported them in how to teach it, things started to change. These VPs found out it wasn’t “so bad” and a few even said they liked doing this type of training. Others told us that their instruction was a powerful new way to connect to their direct reports. The VP who originally objected the loudest to this new role started to brag about how good he was, and how not only did he see changes in others but also in himself as well. This VP was an opinion leader in this company and his support turned out to be critical when others were approached to embrace the leader-as-teacher role—when others were approached to go beyond their comfort zone.</p>
<p>When people are thrown on the horns of this kind of dilemma, they often choose the familiar over the new and the comfortable over the uncomfortable. They don’t want the music to change! Helping leaders develop understandings, skills, and confidence when they are being asked to move beyond the familiar and comfortable seems like a prudent step to take. When that happens, the melody shifts but doesn’t become so difficult to play as leaders begin the process of becoming more capable and comfortable in their new roles.</p>
<p>New territory is just that—new! By definition, this means the past may not serve the present and that old ways of thinking and doing may have to give way to new ways that will be experienced as discomforting. These VPs were kind enough to tell of their discomfort. Many times, leaders may not share their discomfort and just move slowly so as not to embarrass themselves—taking baby-steps and at the same time looking carefully about them to see how others are proceeding.</p>
<p>We need to be observant when leaders move slowly. We need to listen carefully when they express their reservations. It may be resistance in the way we commonly think of this phenomenon (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492612454456">Mauer, 2010</xref>), but then again, it may just be that leaders are on the horns of a paradoxical dilemma. When we observe and listen carefully, we may see a paradox that reflects choosing between the old and comfortable and the new and uncomfortable—one that we need to address by supporting new learning and application.</p>

<title>So, What’s a Leader to do?</title>
<p>These examples underscore common, inherent paradoxes in change efforts. These chords make “the music interesting, but more difficult to play.” Said less metaphorically, they add confusion, obstacles, fog, and dangers to the path that change leaders need to take. Why would someone not slow down when the path becomes more dangerous? Why wouldn’t they want to stay with activities they understand and produce outcomes they’ve become good at producing? Why wouldn’t they see a paradox as a reason to throw up their hands and wonder if this change effort was the right thing to do in the first place?</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that we can design a change process that will eliminate these types of paradoxes. I am suggesting that to move forward without understanding that they will occur is the problem. There may be something around the next bend that brings a new paradox to life . . . and there is always a next bend!</p>
<p>When we’re aware that change efforts can create the horns of a dilemma, we are more capable of leading through paradoxical circumstances. When we start to develop this understanding, we also can help others face the same dilemmas in ways that minimize the human problems they produce. If we ignore these issues, we are on a path to <italic>anticipatable surprises</italic>. That is, we act surprised when we don’t get what we want and need, or worse, when we get what we don’t want or need! The paradox never goes away, and eventually, we’ll pay the price for not living into both horns of the dilemma.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1056492612454456">
<title>Suggestions</title>
<p>I have several suggestions that help address the problem that I raise in this article. Some reflect the work done on the consulting engagement I’ve described. Others reflect my thinking, untested, on what seems appropriate in the face of paradox. With that caveat, let me make the following suggestions:</p>
<list id="list1-1056492612454456" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Be ready for paradoxical circumstances</italic>. They will show up. Leaders may not be fully aware of the specific paradoxical problem they will face, but they should be on the lookout for them. Some paradoxical situations will be obvious. Others may be better understood by the <italic>reactions</italic> that leaders experience—confusion, feeling pressures to respond to urgencies that put long-term outcomes at risk, feeling pressure not to do too many things at the same time, feeling discomfort about taking on new challenges, and so on. Personal reactions like this should be interpreted as triggers to think not how to choose between alternatives, but how to manage the paradox in ways that make both horns of the dilemma possible.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Resist jumping to an either/or solution!</italic> Being patient in the face of paradox is a virtue in that it helps leaders avoid knee-jerk tendencies to make quick decisions just to move on. When we’re not choosing consciously about how to handle a paradoxical circumstance, we’re responding to the pressures, ambiguity, and confusion that paradox creates, and have not fully embraced that there might be an intentional choice to be made. Given that an “either/or” mind-set appears to be the default for most people who face paradoxical circumstances, leaders would appear to also default to relinquishing this ability to choose. To see the opportunity on the horns of a dilemma, then, requires that leaders create the time and space to be intentional—to recognize the pull of an either/or mind-set and to ask new questions, such as “What is needed in order to have both/and?” Leaders who never ask that question can never have the value that answering it can produce. They, therefore, miss the opportunity for new thinking, synergies, and new solutions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Ask for help in spotting these paradoxical circumstances</italic>. We often are so busy living our lives that we don’t have the time or take the time to reflect, to see the proverbial “forest for the trees.” Leaders may need help in seeing paradoxical circumstances for what they are. If this is true, then leaders should discuss this phenomenon with their teams and start to identify how paradoxes have stalled or stopped leadership initiatives in the past. Awareness must precede action. Being conscious about this phenomenon makes them not only easier to see but also easier to address early on, before their impact grows.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Look for help when addressing a paradoxical circumstance</italic>. We can’t see our mind-set; we just operate from it. We, therefore, will struggle to see that there could be a solution that bridges the horns of a dilemma. I would suspect that the way to have the positive value from both horns of the dilemma is seldom realized by the person experiencing the paradox without support. Others will almost always be needed. For example, it may be, like in the first example, that relying more on others is a path that creates the time and mindshare needed to accomplish “both/and.” It may be, like in the second example, that having support from others in developing capabilities and confidence is needed to build the comfort required to step into a new leadership role.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Engage all stakeholders in looking for solutions</italic>. Look for ways to involve people who reflect the key stakeholders to a paradoxical circumstance. This could range from trusted advisors who make it safe enough to talk about tough issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492612454456">Patterson, Grenny, McMillan, &amp; Switzler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492612454456">Schein, 2009</xref>), to small cross-functional meetings where diverse viewpoints are intentionally included, to large gatherings of all relevant stakeholders (as exemplified by processes like Future Search—see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056492612454456">Weisbord &amp; Janoff, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492612454456">2010</xref>). These multistakeholder meetings help bring people who see the world differently (and who might represent each horn of the dilemma) into dialogue to look for a new way of understanding the issue, and then, based on this insight, a new way of addressing it to bridge the two horns of the dilemma. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056492612454456">Roberts (2000)</xref> identified this as a useful approach for addressing wicked problems, those that reflect paradoxical circumstances.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Build resources to address the common paradoxical circumstances</italic>. These resources would include educating persons in leadership positions about this issue and developing processes, tools (e.g., facilitated discussions), and metrics (e.g., process checks, surveys) to support overcoming the unseen forces that paradox creates.</p></list-item>

<title>Additional Thoughts</title>
<p>Paradox is not a new topic. Many areas in management (e.g., see work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056492612454456">Cameron, 1982</xref>, on organizational effectiveness, and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492612454456">Johnson, 1996</xref>, on managing polarities) have picked up on the importance of this phenomenon. It also shows up in other areas—for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492612454456">Kahane (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492612454456">2010</xref>) wrote about the paradox between striving for progress and maintaining wholeness in addressing many of the world’s pressing social problems. In doing so, he speaks to the importance of mind-set, moving from a perspective of either/or to one that embraces both/and. He points out that one cannot find new and sustainable solutions to intractable, paradoxical problems by pretending that they have unitary (i.e., one horn) solutions. As importantly, Kahane, among others, speak to the importance of bridging the horns of a dilemma as the only path to a sustainable solution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492612454456">Bouchikhi (1998)</xref> has pointed out that although people continue to discuss paradoxes by bridging the horns of a dilemma, few explore them in the kind of depth that addresses mind-sets. He goes on to say that there is a need to examine the thinking process surrounding paradox to understand how people move from either/or to both/and thinking.</p>
<p>That is my key insight. When faced with a paradox, many of the leaders I observed became stuck on needing to choose one alternative over another, despite the fact that they knew that choosing between them was not the right option. There was no recognition that they could approach the dilemma in any other way—as both/and thinking opportunities—until it was raised for them. Even then, they struggled to accept the possibility of both/and thinking and the alternatives that followed from reframing their dilemma in this way.</p>
<p>In the first case, for example, the VP was clear that she had to choose between the pressures to meet her current, pressing goals and leading toward future goals that may never be realized. Both were necessary and yet, to her, the choice was simple, but more importantly, the meta-problem was even simpler: choose one! In the second case, the VPs, as a group, rejected the discomfort of learning how to teach new material for the comfort of having someone else do it for them. Again, their protests and demands made it clear that they operated from an either/or mind-set. Only when they gained comfort with the support that was offered to help them to gain comfort with teaching did they start to change their thinking. They did not see this as a possibility themselves.</p>
<p>We can see the same in a number of domains—for example, in the economic, environmental, governmental, and political arenas. In these domains, the problems faced are often referred to as “wicked problems” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492612454456">Rittel &amp; Webber, 1973</xref>), in part because a solution to these dilemmas require a change in mind-set regarding how the particular problem is defined and framed. Stakeholders with radically different points of view see the problem differently and cannot, therefore, see a solution that serves the greater, multistakeholder, community.</p>
<p>In the same way, leading through paradox requires a reframing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492612454456">Hampden-Turner (1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056492612454456">1990)</xref>, for one, points out that the horns of a dilemma can be unified by transcending the paradox—by seeing a unifying principle. That would reflect being able to see the problem differently, to think differently about it.</p>
<p>This article goes beyond description of the need to change mind-sets and gives examples of supporting leaders who did so. In this way, I was able to describe how leaders who were caught up in paradoxical circumstances were able to act on them by changing their mind-sets. In these examples, however, these leaders could not do this on their own—It took outsiders to help them see the possibility of bridging the horns of their dilemmas.</p>
<p>My recommendation for involving others is based on the premise that we cannot see our mind-set; we simply act based on it. Support in making our mind-set visible, then, may be the most crucial part of helping leaders address paradox. I served that role for the leaders in the two case examples I reported. Anyone can do this, if they were to spot and call out the operation of a paradox, and then begin the process of dialogue to understand it and how to respond in ways that reflect a both/and mind-set. Once we are able to see that we don’t have to be stuck in an old, either/or mind-set, I think people would be able to contribute to seeing new solutions to the problems they face. In this way, like the VP in the first example, leaders grow from not just solving their immediate problem, but from developing an understanding that tough, paradoxical problems can be addressed in new and productive ways.</p>

<p>Despite their obvious value, books on leading change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056492612454456">Bridges, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056492612454456">Kotter, 1996</xref>) that offer models for change provide sanitized versions that often reflect what can happen in simplified, smooth terms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056492612454456">Quinn (1996)</xref> made this point in his book <italic>Deep Change</italic>. He reported a conversation in which the president of a company was describing their successful change efforts to a third party. The president’s story was simple, straightforward, and smooth, and it implied a logic that made it appear that each decision was the logical follow-on from all previous decisions. When he had finished, Quinn commented that his recollection was very different, and then described a chaotic path filled with indecision and guesswork.</p>
<p>Quinn’s description matches mine—Leading change is anything but simple or straightforward, and, to some degree, this is due to the paradoxes that are inherently associated with change. The rhythm, whether scored or improvised, is based on living these paradoxical choices rather than choosing among them. I believe that this rhythm shows up in all change efforts and leaders who anticipate them are better able to live the challenges they create and, therefore, lead more successfully.</p>
