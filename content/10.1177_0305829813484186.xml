<abstract>
<p>This article reconsiders the concept of autonomy of migration in the context of technologically ever-more sophisticated border regimes by focusing on the case of biometric rebordering. As its name suggests, the concept of autonomy of migration’s core thesis proposes that migratory movements yield moments of autonomy in regards to any attempt to control and regulate them. Yet, the concept of autonomy of migration has been repeatedly accused of being based on and contributing to a romanticisation of migration. After outlining two advantages the concept of autonomy of migration offers for the analysis of biometric border regimes, I demonstrate that processes of biometric rebordering increase the warranty of the two allegations, which feed this major critique. Drawing on examples relating to the Visa Information System, I show that processes of biometric rebordering alter the practical terms and material conditions for moments of autonomy of migration to such an extent that it becomes necessary to rethink not only some of the concept of autonomy of migration’s central features, but the notion of autonomy itself. In the final section, I therefore point out some directions to develop the concept of autonomy of migration as an approach, which is better equipped to investigate today’s struggles of migration without being prone to the critique of implicating a romanticisation of migration.</p>

<p>… <italic>there is an autonomy of emigration adverse to the politics of states and this accounts for emigration as well as immigration.</italic> … Though myriads of experts and officials in the administrative bodies of state institutions and international organisations are preoccupied with emigration, they have no clue about this independence or autonomy of migration flows. … One can counteract emigration with repressive means, ‘advance’ the return of immigrants, but one can not open or block the flows from one’s point of view and programming.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0305829813484186">1</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Since Yann Moulier Boutang postulated the hypothesis of an autonomy of migration, scholars from around the world have tried – often independently from one another – to develop it into a ‘heuristic model’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0305829813484186">2</xref></sup> to investigate and intervene in the struggles of migration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0305829813484186">3</xref></sup> This article understands itself as a contribution to this ongoing undertaking. It argues that the material terms and practical conditions for the emergence of possible moments of autonomy of migration have changed significantly due to the increased technologisation of border regimes. Yet, the existing literature on the concept of autonomy of migration (CAM) has so far not sufficiently acknowledged the impact of the technologisation of border controls on the possibilities of migrants to appropriate what contemporary border and migration regimes seek to deny them, namely: mobility and rights. What has hindered the advocates of the CAM so far to take the technologisation of border controls and its effects on migrants’ room for manoeuvre seriously is the misreading of the interrelated securitisation of migration as a mere means for the economic exploitation of migrant labour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0305829813484186">4</xref></sup> This is why the CAM’s core hypothesis has been largely articulated as an unqualified generalisation to date: moments of autonomy seem to emerge and operate within any border and migration regime irrespective of its legal, practical and technological composition.</p>
<p>In this article I therefore reconsider the CAM in face of the ongoing technologisation of border controls by focusing on the challenges posed by biometric rebordering. My analysis is driven by the following question: in which directions has the CAM to be refined to better account for the impact of the technologisation of border controls on the emergence of possible moments of autonomy of migration?</p>
<p>To answer this question, I first outline six core features of the CAM. This enables me to bring out two conceptual advantages the CAM yields for the investigation and critique of biometric border regimes. In the second and third sections, I reconsider the two allegations that fuel the major critique, according to which the CAM is based on, but also contributes to, a romanticisation of migration. It becomes more urgent to address these criticisms, as their warranty increases in the context of biometric rebordering. In the final section I therefore point out some directions for re thinking the CAM in order to develop it as an approach that is better equipped to investigate and intervene in today’s struggles of migration within and against technologically ever-more sophisticated border regimes and which is no longer prone to the critique of contributing to a romanticisation of migration.</p>
<p>What makes this undertaking necessary is the ‘technological imperative’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0305829813484186">5</xref></sup> driving processes of rebordering in Europe and around the globe. In the context of Europe, the gradual build-up of Sistema Integrado de Vigilancia Exterior (SIVE), the surveillance system along Spanish coasts, since 1999 offers an illuminating example. It comprises a network of mobile infrared cameras and high-resolution radars, granting patrol boats of the <italic>Guardia Civil</italic> a response time of up to three hours for intercepting boats with undocumented migrants before their expected arrival on Spanish shores.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0305829813484186">6</xref></sup> So far the CAM’s proponents have argued that neither the implementation of ever-more restrictive migration policies nor the introduction of technologically ever-more sophisticated border controls could inhibit migration, but only downgrade the conditions, under which it occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0305829813484186">7</xref></sup> Indeed, one can trace how the gradual build-up of SIVE implicated a geographical shift to longer and more dangerous migration routes to areas where it had not yet been installed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0305829813484186">8</xref></sup> But what happens if an avoidance of technologically highly sophisticated border controls is no longer possible, because they have become generalised? This is by no means a hypothetical question. In the European External Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) project, the European Union (EU) seeks to integrate existing national systems like SIVE into a ‘system of the systems’ covering its entire maritime border. It also seeks to bring existing surveillance and interception mechanisms to perfection through improved sensors, satellites and unmanned vehicles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0305829813484186">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, EUROSUR is just one expression of the endorsement of technology as a cornerstone of ongoing processes of rebordering in Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0305829813484186">10</xref></sup> It is complemented by proposals for an entry–exit system using biometric technologies to record the arrival and departure dates of travellers who are not EU citizens, or a ‘registered traveller programme’ permitting participants to enter through automated gates under the condition that they submit themselves to a screening procedure prior to their departure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0305829813484186">11</xref></sup> While these examples are still projects in the making, the EU has already built up an impressive architecture of biometric databases, including the ‘EURODAC’ system for asylum seekers and unauthorised border crossers, the Visa Information System (VIS) for all third- country nationals applying for a Schengen visa and, finally, the Schengen Information System (SIS) that registers, among others, migrants who are deported after being apprehended inside the Schengen area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0305829813484186">12</xref></sup> In this article I illustrate my general claims concerning the impact of the technologisation of border controls on the practical terms and material conditions for the possible emergence of moments of autonomy of migration through examples relating to the VIS.</p>

<title>Politicising the Technologisation of Border Regimes With the CAM: Beyond the Control Bias</title>
<p>It is important to note that the CAM has always been conceived by its proponents as a political intervention in both migration policy discourse and the politics of the antiracist movement. This brings me to the first of the CAM’s six central features that I will outline in this section. Firstly, and in contrast to some of the most influential migration theories, the CAM stresses the subjective and social dimensions of migration in order to critique any conception of migration as a dependent variable of ‘objective’ factors like poverty or wage differentials, as suggested by neoclassical migration theories, or the destruction of subsistence economies through the expansion of capitalism in the global South, as suggested by the world-system theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0305829813484186">13</xref></sup> Any reduction of migration to structural underlying causes ignores the subjective desires and projects migrants pursue with their migrations, thereby eliminating the political moments migratory movements comprise. The CAM’s advocates attribute the autonomy of migration, by contrast, to the uncontrollable plenitude of thousands of independent decisions, which are taken by migrants for a wide variety of different reasons on a daily basis. It is this subjective dimension of migration that Sandro Mezzadra seeks to underscore with the notion of escape.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0305829813484186">14</xref></sup> It produces a <italic>surplus of sociability</italic>, which exceeds the capacities of any border regime to regulate migratory movements entirely.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0305829813484186">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, migration is conceived, secondly, as a ‘dynamic force’ with the potential to instigate social transformation processes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0305829813484186">16</xref></sup> In brief, the subjective movement of living labour constitutes a driving force in the evolution of capital accumulation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0305829813484186">17</xref></sup> The institution of wage labour as a crucial moment in the history of capitalism was, for instance, prompted by the <italic>escape</italic> of slaves from the plantation economies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0305829813484186">18</xref></sup> Likewise, contemporary migrations are structurally in <italic>excess</italic> of the equilibriums of (national) labour markets and codified forms of citizenship that practices of rebordering try to maintain, thereby forcing these (and other) institutions into a process of permanent reorganisation and adaptation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0305829813484186">19</xref></sup> This conception of migration as a constituent force leads the CAM’s advocates to read ‘migration in itself as an articulation of political and social struggles’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0305829813484186">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>From this understanding of migration follows, thirdly, that the CAM’s advocates refute any victimisation of migrants. For any victimising discourse erases migrants’ capacity to subvert border controls, which in turn enables observers to ignore the fact that ‘migrants have a will of their own, one that lies outside of the hands of those who wish to [help or] control them’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0305829813484186">21</xref></sup> Accordingly, the representation of migrants as needy victims enables paternalistic proxy policies as pursued by humanitarian organisations like the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but also by some groups of the antiracist movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0305829813484186">22</xref></sup> Or, even worse, it is exploited by advocates of migration control as a justification for the build-up and perfection of border controls. The costly EUROSUR project cited in the introduction offers an illuminating example for this justification strategy: ‘The tragic death toll resulting from this kind of illegal immigration [in boats across the Mediterranean] is unacceptable and must therefore be significantly reduced. The capacity to detect small boats in the open sea must be enhanced, contributing to greater chances of search and rescue and thereby saving more lives at sea.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0305829813484186">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>But the reading of migration as a constituent force also entails important consequences for the conception and analysis of borders. For the CAM’s proponents suggest, fourthly, that migratory movements temporarily precede the attempts to control, regulate and valorise them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0305829813484186">24</xref></sup> Fifthly, from this follows that the analytical starting point of the CAM relies on a reversal of the state-centred perspective which is shared by the majority of migration studies, as Stephen Castles has rightly criticised.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0305829813484186">25</xref></sup> It is precisely this reversal of the state and control perspective in which the CAM’s theoretical legacy of autonomist Marxism comes to the fore. In contrast to the assumption of orthodox Marxism, whereupon the course of history is determined by economic laws inherent to the capitalist mode of production, autonomist Marxists regard the social and political struggles of the working class as the ‘motor of history’ and therefore make them the central reference point for any empirical investigation and theoretical consideration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0305829813484186">26</xref></sup> In this vein, Moulier Boutang calls upon migration scholars to assume the mobile perspective of the movement of migration in order to ask how migrants try to overcome and subvert border controls.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0305829813484186">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consequently and finally, the advocates of the CAM criticise any representation of borders as impenetrable walls, as suggested by the influential metaphor of <italic>Fortress Europe</italic>, which dominated the slogans and campaigns of the antiracist movement in Europe throughout the 1990s. In brief, they criticise the latter for not capturing migrants’ capacity to render borders porous and, hence, the moments of autonomy of migration. Moreover, they maintain that the image of the fortress would not account for the productivity of border controls. Instead of conceiving border controls as repressive means aiming at the exclusion of migrants, the CAM’s proponents suggest that today’s border regimes follow a rationale of ‘differential inclusion.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0305829813484186">28</xref></sup> Border controls create the conditions for migrants’ economic exploitation through their gradual, but systematic disenfranchisement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0305829813484186">29</xref></sup> Therefore, the CAM’s advocates understand ‘illegality’ not as a legal (non-)status, but as an actively produced, albeit contested, condition that aims at disciplining migrants to a docile, flexible and exploitable workforce by rendering them ‘deportable’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0305829813484186">30</xref></sup> They emphasise, however, that it is migrants in the first place who render borders porous. Accordingly, it is migrants’ practices that recode the devices of border control into mechanisms that still enable mobility and labour, but only under the precarious conditions of ‘illegality’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0305829813484186">31</xref></sup> Consequently, the CAM’s proponents conceptualise borders not as the impenetrable walls of an imagined fortress, but as dynamic sites of contestation and negotiation, where migrants’ practices and tactics <italic>encounter</italic> the strategies and devices of control, entering a ‘relationship of reciprocal determination’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0305829813484186">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>To my mind, it is precisely the strategic-analytical prioritisation of migrants’ practices and the related conception of borders as sites of contestation and conflict that constitute two important advantages the CAM contributes to the analysis of biometric borders. These conceptual and analytical advantages entail, in turn, crucial political implications. It should be noted that they concern the investigation of technologically ever-more sophisticated border regimes in general beyond the case of biometric borders discussed here.</p>
<p>Firstly, the CAM is well equipped to counter the <italic>control bias</italic> that characterises the existing literature on biometric border controls. The bulk of this literature focuses its analysis on the practices, technologies, installations, devices, statements and agencies that characterise the appearance and make-up of biometric borders in specific contexts, sites or programmes in order to reveal their key features, underlying rationalities and effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0305829813484186">33</xref></sup> Those who are abjectified by being rendered as ‘risky’ by biometric border controls, conversely, only appear as passive targets of practices of surveillance, control and exclusion. Consequently, their practices and tactics that are geared towards the subversion of biometric border controls remain unexplored. As a result of this neglect, the existing literature overvalues the efficiency of biometric and other border control technologies. Such control-biased analyses then tend to represent biometric borders as ‘omnipotent control apparatuses’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0305829813484186">34</xref></sup> which are actually capable of facilitating the mobility of ‘trusted travellers’ by efficiently restricting the mobility of those classified as ‘risky’. Biometric borders appear as the promised ultimate technological fix capable of reconciling the two allegedly conflicting ‘governmental desires [of] security and mobility’ that constitute the ‘problem of the border’ in the age of globalisation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0305829813484186">35</xref></sup> In the end, control-biased analyses of biometric borders involuntarily confirm and even fuel the claims that justify and drive the implementation of biometric technologies in the first place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0305829813484186">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>By making the practices of abjectified migrants the starting and focal point of any investigation of borders the CAM allows for avoiding such control-biased analyses. Today’s biometric borders no longer appear as mere technological installations perfectly regulating human mobility. They rather emerge as what Vicki Squire calls ‘borderzones’ – as dispersed sites of intensified political struggles over the selective denial and appropriation of mobility and rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0305829813484186">37</xref></sup> The technological details of biometric border controls are no longer catalogued in a meticulous description of supposedly omnipotent control apparatuses. They rather emerge as the terrain of, as well as stakes within, migrants’ struggles over the direct appropriation of mobility and rights. These silent and clandestine, but inherently political struggles manifest themselves in those multiple sites and situations in which the practices and tactics of abjectified migrants <italic>encounter</italic> the techniques and devices of control. It is through the empirical investigation of these encounters by means of a multi-sited ethnography that scholars can bring out these multiple struggles, thereby avoiding a static and control-biased analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0305829813484186">38</xref></sup> As a result, today’s biometric borders would no longer appear as sites of perfect mobility control, ultimately constituting a ‘cyber-fortress’ in the making.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0305829813484186">39</xref></sup> They would rather emerge as the battleground of dynamic political struggles over the selective denial and direct appropriation of mobility and rights.</p>
<p>It is this conception of biometric borders as sites of political struggles, through which the CAM permits researchers, secondly, to counter the de-politicisation of border controls implicated by their technologisation. Philppe Bonditti has rightly argued that ‘[t]he excessive resorting to technology effectively hides the political character of problems that technology is intended to solve’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0305829813484186">40</xref></sup> More precisely, it is the underlying representation of border controls as a mere technical problem that can be ‘solved’ through the implementation of innovative control technologies which brings about the de politicisation of the practices they involve, the effects they produce as well as of the context in which they take place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0305829813484186">41</xref></sup> Many authors follow Didier Bigo’s observation, whereupon technologies like biometrics and related techniques like ‘risk profiling’ are performative as they permit security professionals to monopolise the authority to define what or who constitutes a ‘risk’ as well as to decide how and by what means to neutralise them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0305829813484186">42</xref></sup> These highly political questions are reduced to mere technical problems, which can be ‘solved’ by certain ‘experts’, who are endued with a secret ‘insider knowledge’ due to their access to information and surveillance technologies. These technologies in turn accord the ‘insider knowledge’ claimed by security professionals an aura of objectivity and scientific certainty, making it difficult, if not impossible, for others to contest their accounts, decisions and practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0305829813484186">43</xref></sup> The successful representation of border controls as purely technical, apolitical issues only certain experts can have a say on due to their proclaimed ‘professional expertise’, in turn, invests the technologisation of border controls with a self-perpetuating dynamic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0305829813484186">44</xref></sup> The failure of technologies to deliver the promised perfect security translates into a call for the implementation of more and better technologies by security professionals.</p>
<p>In this context, the CAM allows critical scholars to precipitate a re-politicisation of border controls by depicting them as the terrain of <italic>political</italic> struggles, which can not be solved through the implementation of technologies because they concern the access of abjectified migrants to mobility and rights. These struggles and contestations are initiated by migrants’ attempts to appropriate what border controls seek to deprive them of – mobility and rights. Consequently, migrants’ practices of direct appropriation and the struggles they instigate are inherently political in themselves. For it is these practices of abjectified migrants that render today’s biometric borders, as well as the legally codified forms of citizenship and the socio-economic status quo they try to maintain, as objects of contestation and dissent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0305829813484186">45</xref></sup> Attempts to counter the de politicisation of border controls afford, therefore, that scholars follow the CAM’s suggestion to conceive migrants not as passive objects of control, but as crucial actors in the make-up of the multiple sites and situations at today’s biometric borders. It is, then, an investigation of migrants’ practices of direct contestation and appropriation that has to be the starting and focal point of an analysis of biometric borders that aims at their re-politicisation.</p>

<title>The CAM Revisited I: Autonomy or Romanticisation of Migration?</title>
<p>The CAM is, however, not without problems itself. As I have noted in the introduction, the CAM, and most importantly, its generalised attribution of moments of autonomy to any migratory movement, is repeatedly criticised for being based on, as well as contributing to, a romanticisation of migration. This major critique is fuelled by two interrelated allegations. Considering each of these two allegations in this section and the next, I demonstrate that their warranty increases in the context of biometric rebordering.</p>
<p>Firstly, the CAM is accused of not sufficiently considering the diversity of conditions under which migration occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0305829813484186">46</xref></sup> According to critics, this diversity of conditions arises from both migrants’ unequal access to resources and the varying degrees of discrimination they experience due to the prevalence of sexist and racist discourses throughout the migration process. Martina Benz and Helen Schwenken attribute this neglect to the notion of autonomy itself, which would reduce the diverse social conditions surrounding migration to a juxtaposition of state versus migrants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0305829813484186">47</xref></sup> The CAM would frame migrants as a single autonomous collective subject, while ignoring their different subject positions and the specific constraints and privileges these subject positions entail. Following the <italic>concept of triple oppression</italic>, they insist that the combined, but individually varying, effects of racism, sexism and capitalism have to be considered in order to assess how far particular migrations yield emancipatory results or rather contribute to the re-articulation of relations of domination and exploitation.</p>
<p>Members of <italic>Transit Migration</italic> have in turn refuted this criticism as a misinterpretation of the CAM, which would emphasise the autonomy of migratory movements, but not of individual subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0305829813484186">48</xref></sup> They argue that Benz and Schwenken’s critique reflects a ‘naïve empiricism of the subject’, which confuses the difference between a situated analysis of the border regime from the perspective of migration with a purely empirical investigation of migrants’ subjectivities. They maintain, by contrast, that such a situated analysis can only be attained by using border-transgressing biographies and the practices of migration as empirical samples, not by studying the ‘empirical’ practices of migrants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0305829813484186">49</xref></sup> Through the distinction between the ‘practices of migration’ and the ‘practices of migrants’, the members of <italic>Transit Migration</italic> intend to emphasise that the moments of autonomy of migration can only be observed in the historical course of a multiplicity of migratory movements, not by referring to the success or failure of individual migration projects.</p>
<p>Yet, this emphasis on ‘practices of migration’ is prone to subsuming the varying lived experiences of concrete subjects under the subjectless and equalising abstraction of migration. Along these lines, Nandita Sharma has convincingly criticised the CAM for subsuming the ‘hundreds of millions of people who migrate’ under the totalising and therefore empty subject position of ‘the migrants’. She regards this move as ‘a form of symbolic violence’, which enables the CAM’s proponents to ignore ‘migrants’ classed, racialized, gendered, sexualized, territorialized bodies’ and ‘the meanings they themselves give to their experiences’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0305829813484186">50</xref></sup> What is needed in light of this critique is, then, an acknowledgement of the crucial insight of feminist migration research, whereupon mobility is always embodied <italic>and</italic> relational, and the lived experiences of migrants are therefore quite diverse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0305829813484186">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>This diversity arises, in fact, from both migrants’ unequal access to economic, social and cultural resources and their differential treatment by border regimes according to their respective subject positions in terms of class, ‘race’, gender and other socio-political relations. Critical scholars have shown, for instance, that informal, albeit institutionalised, rules and ‘suspect typologies’ for migration controls ‘lead inevitably to unequal probabilities [for migrants] of being apprehended by the police’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0305829813484186">52</xref></sup> Others have demonstrated that ‘the application of immigration law is both sexist and racist’ despite the public insistence on formal equality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0305829813484186">53</xref></sup> To my mind, this informal, but nevertheless institutionalised, unequal treatment of migrants is well captured by the CAM’s concept of differential inclusion. It stresses that it is the very function of border regimes to create differences between migrants through their differential treatment and gradual disenfranchisement. But the existing CAM literature has not sufficiently considered so far, how this active fabrication of differences is dependent on <italic>and</italic> (re)productive of racist and sexist practices and economic inequalities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0305829813484186">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>I would like to argue for a situated re reading of the notion of autonomy that accounts for both the <italic>diversity</italic> of migrants’ experiences and their varying possibilities to realise their migration projects due to their unequal access to resources in order to highlight the resulting multiplicity of their practices. Instead of leading to ‘naïve empiricism of the subject’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0305829813484186">55</xref></sup> such an approach would, firstly, allow for developing the concept of differential inclusion further. Secondly, it would underline that experience is always embodied and that ‘it is [therefore] nonsense to speak of a singular migrant subjectivity …[because] there are … a myriad of ways to be migrants, which are shaped by lines of class, gender and “race”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0305829813484186">56</xref></sup> Yann Moulier Boutang points towards a situated reading of the notion of autonomy when he argues that:<disp-quote>
<p>Colonial as well as postcolonial situation, caste, ‘race’, gender, [and] ethnicity need to be considered conjointly. The significance of these categories has been acknowledged by now, and each of them has generated a new knowledge: <italic>Postcolonial</italic> and <italic>subaltern studies, minority studies</italic>, feminisms all have enriched the notion of autonomy with their respective perspective and invested it with an appropriate complexity. Autonomy is the opposite of heteronomy: not to be dependent, free of effects of domination. Only a <italic>situated knowledge</italic> (Donna Haraway) can be effectively independent, and correspondingly, one has to protect oneself from the effect of domination, that lurks beneath ‘objective’ thinking.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0305829813484186">57</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moulier Boutang’s acknowledgement of the complexity of the notion of autonomy recognises the diversity of its conditions and the varying degrees of its possible realisation. Yet, none of the CAM’s advocates has so far pursued the implicit call to develop a more nuanced reading of autonomy, which is no longer prone to subsume and erase migrants’ varying experiences under a subjectless abstraction like migration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0305829813484186">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>But the need to re think the CAM in a way which underscores the situatedness and the resulting diversity of migrants’ embodied experiences becomes even more acute in the context of the technologisation of border controls. Critical scholarship on biometric rebordering points out that the differential treatment of migrants according to their positionality in socio-political power relations of class, ‘race’, gender, age and sexual orientation is both intensified <italic>and</italic> increasingly concealed through the biometrification of border controls.</p>
<p>On the one hand, biometric technologies implicate a differentiation of how the border is experienced. This is far from surprising if one considers that biometric technologies imply a shift from ‘border control to body control’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0305829813484186">59</xref></sup> Since biometrics seek to verify the claimed identity of an individual by comparing a representation of one of their biometric features against a digitalised template that has been stored in a database or on an access card like a passport, they allow for a more differentiated and individualised approach towards border controls.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0305829813484186">60</xref></sup> Biometrics permit the replacement of systematic checks for the targeted control of travellers classified as ‘risky’ at the physical border in order to accelerate the mobility of ‘trusted’ travellers. The latter submit themselves to pre-departure checks, thereby trading privacy for speed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0305829813484186">61</xref></sup> The enrolment in a trusted traveller scheme like <italic>NEXUS</italic> in Northern America,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0305829813484186">62</xref></sup> ‘<italic>Project Iris</italic>’ in the UK<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0305829813484186">63</xref></sup> or the <italic>SmartGate</italic> system in Australia<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0305829813484186">64</xref></sup> allows ‘trusted travellers’ to have an experience of ‘borders-lite’, comprising fast lanes, business lounges and self-policing at automated border check posts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0305829813484186">65</xref></sup> Travellers who do not want or simply can not participate in these programmes, either because they can not afford them or because ‘they come from the wrong background’, are, by contrast, automatically deemed ‘risky’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0305829813484186">66</xref></sup> They have to queue repeatedly, either for interrogations at consular posts whilst applying for a visa or for intensified inspections in airports upon arrival. By sorting individuals into fast-moving, low-risk ‘kinetic elites’ and slow-moving, high-risk ‘kinetic underclasses’, biometric borders actively produce mobile subjectivities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0305829813484186">67</xref></sup> The differentiation of how the biometric border is experienced by particular individuals is, however, determined by their respective subject position in terms of class, country of origin, skin colour, gender, age and sexual orientation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0305829813484186">68</xref></sup> Trusted traveller schemes highlight, moreover, that the alleged privilege to jump the queue, as well as the symbolic capital that comes with it, only comes about in relation to the unprivileged in the queue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0305829813484186">69</xref></sup> What the usage of biometric technologies in voluntary trusted traveller schemes and databases only mandatory for those considered ‘high-risk’ brings to the fore, then, is that mobility is, in fact, always embodied <italic>and</italic> relational.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is precisely this connection between the differential treatment of mobile individuals and their respective positionality in terms of class, race and gender that is concealed by biometric border controls technologies. The latter supposedly do not suffer from the prejudices shared by human beings as they verify a person’s claimed identity on the basis of features of their biological body independently of any factors that might be regarded as discriminatory (such as class, ‘race’, gender or sexuality).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0305829813484186">70</xref></sup> Irma van der Ploeg has succinctly argued, by contrast, that biometrics transform the biological body into a machine-readable ‘text’. She emphasises that ‘the meaning and significance’ of this machine-readable text is contingent upon ‘the context’ in which it is produced, and the relations, which are established with other ‘texts’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0305829813484186">71</xref></sup> It is through both the social context in which biometrics are deployed and the comparisons for which the machine- readable texts they produce are used that all forms of discrimination in terms of class, ‘race’ and gender come into play.</p>
<p>In the context of border controls, biometric technologies are not only used for the maintenance of the political and socio-economic status quo by regulating the access to and exclusion from mobility, rights and geographical spaces. In addition, they also create new inequalities. The trusted traveller programmes mentioned above illustrate that biometric technologies contribute to the creation of a privileged ‘kinetic elite’. Membership to this exclusive club is only open to those who can afford it and are classified as ‘low risk’. The VIS exemplifies, by contrast, that the enrolment into biometric databases becomes mandatory for all those who are regarded as a security or ‘migration risk’. In order to be able to capture and critique these discriminatory effects of biometric borders, it becomes necessary to develop the CAM as an approach that conceives mobility as both embodied <italic>and</italic> relational – for feminist migration scholars have shown that unrestricted access to mobility for some is connected to the restriction of the access to mobility for others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0305829813484186">72</xref></sup> But the CAM needs to better account for the diversity of migrants’ subject positions and the resulting diversity of their migration experiences and border-crossing practices. This is necessary in order to retain the capacity to critique how technologically ‘consolidated identities for some produce marginalised locations for others’ within material-semiotic contexts in which sexist and racist discourse and practices are virulent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0305829813484186">73</xref></sup> What becomes therefore even more urgent in the context of biometric rebordering is the development of a reading of autonomy that allows for a <italic>situated</italic> analysis of migrants’ <italic>embodied</italic> and consequently <italic>diverse</italic> encounters with and experiences of today’s biometric borders.</p>

<title>The CAM Revisited II: Autonomy of Migration In spite of Its Securitisation?</title>
<p>In addition, the CAM has been accused of an unfounded stylisation of migrants as self-reliant heroes of clandestine border crossing. In brief, critics maintain the CAM’s proponents would systematically gloss over the repressive and sometimes murderous effects of ever-more restrictive border controls, which often resulted in the effective exclusion of migrants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0305829813484186">74</xref></sup> In this section I argue that it becomes necessary to consider this criticism because it becomes more warranted in the context of the securitisation of migration and interrelated processes of biometric rebordering. Biometric databases alter the encounters and power relations between migrants and border control authorities to such an extent that it becomes necessary to re think some of the CAM’s core assumptions, including the notion of autonomy itself.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it is the insufficient consideration of the securitisation of migration and its bearing on the rationale and design of contemporary border regimes, which justifies the allegation, whereupon the CAM plays down, or even ignores, the repressive and exclusionary effects of border controls. Prominent advocates of the CAM like Sandro Mezzadra have so far paid only lip-service to the fact that migration has been increasingly framed and treated as a security issue since the 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0305829813484186">75</xref></sup> While Mezzadra acknowledges that securitising practices are ‘leading to a further restriction of their [irregular migrants’] spaces and freedom of mobility’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0305829813484186">76</xref></sup> he and other advocates of the CAM insist, nevertheless, that ‘the modus operandi of the migration regime … revolves around the question of labour’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0305829813484186">77</xref></sup> Following Mezzadra, today’s border regimes resemble ‘a complex dispositif, which is based both on the valorisation and containment of labour mobility’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0305829813484186">78</xref></sup> In this account, the securitisation of migration emerges as nothing but a strategy for the ultimate <italic>economic</italic> endeavour to discipline migrants to a docile and exploitable workforce.</p>
<p>I would argue, by contrast, that the reading of the securitisation of migration as a ‘modality for the global “irregularisation” of migrant labour’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0305829813484186">79</xref></sup> constitutes an oversimplifying economic reductionism. This economic reductionism misinterprets one of the effects of securitising practices – the facilitation of the exploitation of migrant labour through their illegalisation – as the overall rationale of the securitisation of migration. But the securitisation of migration cannot be subsumed under supposedly higher-ranking economic ends because it involves the invocation of a <italic>politics of fear</italic> that reduces possible migration policy options to strategies of distancing and neutralising the ‘risks’ that are associated with human mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0305829813484186">80</xref></sup> Through the politics of fear, migrants are constructed as a <italic>risk</italic> for potential harm, which has to be kept at a spatial and social distance through a plethora of illiberal security practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0305829813484186">81</xref></sup> Consequently, the securitisation of migration has, in fact, strong implications for the design, composition and underlying rationale of today’s border regimes.</p>
<p>This does not, however, imply that I propose to simply replace the prioritisation of the question of labour in the understanding and analysis of contemporary border regimes with the securitisation of migration. Nor do I suggest that the paradigm of exclusion, which has been so vividly criticised by the CAM’s advocates, has become the dominant rationale of today’s border regimes due to the securitisation of migration. Numerous critical security studies scholars have repeatedly shown that the security framing of migration does not implicate a repression of human mobility through a fortification of borders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0305829813484186">82</xref></sup> Following Foucault, they have argued that security is not opposed to freedom of movement, but rather emerges as its ‘correlative’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0305829813484186">83</xref></sup> They emphasise that the speed and comfort of unrestricted mobility for the normalised majority of travellers hinges on the intensified control and possible <italic>banishment</italic> of those classified as ‘risky’. This particular mode of exclusion however, does not work through the interdiction or prevention of mobility, but rather produces a mobile satellite population, which is kept at a social and spatial distance, but simultaneously on the move and in circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0305829813484186">84</xref></sup> Put differently, banishment does not aim at the repression, but at the institutionalisation of mobility as it deflects and reflects the movements of those deemed ‘undesirable’. This more nuanced reading of differential inclusion offered by critical security studies is better equipped to account for the restrictive effects of technologically ever-more sophisticated border controls. The adoption of it by the CAM presupposes, however, acknowledging that security works not only as a force of differentiation, but also as ‘a force of abjection excluding risky migrants from trusted travellers’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0305829813484186">85</xref></sup> It is, then, important to consider the securitisation of migration in the analysis and conceptualisation of border regimes because it is the complex interplay between the obsession for maximum security brought about by the politics of fear and the economic imperative to facilitate the circulation of commodities and living labour that fuels the ongoing technologisation of border controls.</p>
<p>Instead of prioritising one of these allegedly conflicting governmental desires over the other, I therefore propose to conceptualise contemporary border regimes with Foucault’s notion of the security dispositif. For the latter captures nicely that freedom is not a value in opposition to or in tension with security concerns. Rather, freedom constitutes a technique of government as it has been reframed as freedom of movement. As such, it provides the raison d’être of the security dispositif.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0305829813484186">86</xref></sup> Following Foucault, Bigo argues that the reduction of freedom to the promise of global mobility without being stopped ultimately allows for ‘policing in the name of freedom’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0305829813484186">87</xref></sup> resulting in ever-more pervasive dataveillance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0305829813484186">88</xref></sup> In Foucault’s words, ‘freedom [of movement] is nothing but the correlative development of apparatuses of security’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0305829813484186">89</xref></sup> The security dispositif is not concerned with the protection of the territory of sovereign spaces, but with governing a population in a way that optimises its life potentials <italic>and</italic> its economic productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0305829813484186">90</xref></sup> Its ‘problem … is no longer that of fixing and demarcating the territory, but of allowing circulations to take place, of controlling them, of sifting the good and the bad, ensuring that things are always in movement … but in such a way that the inherent dangers of this circulation are cancelled out’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0305829813484186">91</xref></sup> Foucault indicates that the surveillance of the population becomes a substitute for the protection previously offered by the now dismantled city walls in order to identify individuals within the now freely circulating flows who might impinge on the economic productivity of the population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0305829813484186">92</xref></sup> He specifies that the security dispositif is concerned with anticipating, identifying and minimising potentially harmful elements within the circulating flows through the statistical calculation of possible future behaviours and events. Foucault’s stance that the security dispositif ‘works on the future’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0305829813484186">93</xref></sup> is in conflict with the CAM’s premise that migrations temporarily precede the attempts to control and regulate them. Yet, it is precisely the adoption of this endeavour to render uncertain futures knowable and actionable that explains the appeal to contemporary border regimes of information, identification and surveillance technologies, thereby bringing the third element of the triptych security– freedom of movement–technology into play.</p>
<p>I would therefore like to suggest that it is precisely the misreading of the securitisation of migration as a mere modality for the disenfranchisement and economic exploitation of migrants that has hindered some of the most prominent advocates of the CAM so far from taking the technologisation of border controls and its restrictive effects seriously. This is, however, important, because biometric databases and related border control technologies (like the planned entry–exit system or the EUROSUR project) alter the power relations and the encounters between migrants and border control authorities to such an extent that the general assertion of moments of autonomy of migration within any border regime regardless of its legal, practical and technological composition becomes, in fact, a highly dubious claim.</p>
<p>I illustrate my argument with two examples relating to the VIS, because its impact on the possibilities of abjectified migrants to appropriate Schengen visas and subsequently stay in Europe is of particular relevance for the CAM’s core thesis. Contrary to the misleading scandalisation of boat migration in the media and by policymakers, most illegalised migrants in Europe do not cross the EU’s borders unauthorised, but enter via airports with a valid Schengen visa only to become illegal after it has expired.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0305829813484186">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first example relates to the objective of the VIS to prevent the so-called practice of ‘visa shopping’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0305829813484186">95</xref></sup> This pejorative term refers to the strategy where visa applicants lodge consecutive applications at consulates of several EU member states after an initial application has already been turned down. While consulates of Schengen member states have begun to stamp the passports of rejected visa applicants, the latter could previously still lodge further applications at consulates of other member states by obtaining a new passport.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0305829813484186">96</xref></sup> Yet, the VIS efficiently forecloses this possibility for rejected applicants, because consular staff can now check in the biometric database, which also stores the fingerprint templates of rejected applicants for a period of five years, ‘if this fingerprint has already applied for a visa’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0305829813484186">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second example refers to the objective of the VIS ‘to assist in the identification of any person who may not, or may no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to, stay or residence on the territory of the Member States’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0305829813484186">98</xref></sup> On a practical level, and in less euphemistic terms, the VIS shall facilitate the provision of travel documents for undocumented migrants, who try to hide their identity after being detected by the police, in order to accelerate their deportation. As Dennis Broeders has rightly argued, the VIS will thereby function as a ‘system of re-identification’ for so-called ‘visa-overstayers’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0305829813484186">99</xref></sup> For the purpose of identification a newly generated template of a fingerprint is compared to the up to 70 million templates stored in the VIS. The apprehended person is then re-identified on the basis of the alphanumerical data that are linked to the matching template.</p>
<p>Both examples highlight that biometric databases like the VIS try to establish what Philippe Bonditti has called <italic>traceability</italic>, that is, ‘the capacity of security agencies to recreate geographical, social and digital trajectories of individuals, goods, capital and data’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0305829813484186">100</xref></sup> Using the VIS, past trajectories of visa applicants, holders and overstayers can be reconstructed through the collection and storage of the traces they left behind when they initially applied for a visa. Traceability then works through the creation of ‘data doubles’. David Lyon defines a data double as an ‘electronic profile compiled out of fragments of personal data of individuals’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0305829813484186">101</xref></sup> This ‘digital alter ego’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0305829813484186">102</xref></sup> is then attached by means of biometrics to the body of the person it refers to in order to establish his or her <italic>traceability</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0305829813484186">103</xref></sup> In this context, it has been argued that the proliferation of biometric border control technologies is driven by the conception of the ‘human body… as an indisputable anchor to which data can be safely secured’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0305829813484186">104</xref></sup> More precisely, biometric technologies transform human bodies into pure information deprived of all corporeality in order to create data doubles, which refer back to the individual concerned. The purpose of these data doubles is not to represent the individuals they refer to in an accurate manner, but to enable border control authorities to re-identify and make judgements about them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0305829813484186">105</xref></sup> Ultimately, biometric databases like the VIS turn migrants’ bodies into a means of mobility control, thereby generating a new form of irregularity: the irregularity of the ‘data double’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0305829813484186">106</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is precisely this new form of irregularity that brings to the fore that biometric databases like the VIS intensify the restrictive and exclusionary effects of border controls as they forestall previously successful mobility strategies. It is through the generation of data doubles and the related establishment of traceability of people’s migration histories that biometric databases like the VIS make it possible to <italic>synchronise</italic> controls and resulting sanctions. Information on visa applicants, which has been previously scattered over the countless folders of the 3500 consular posts the EU’s member states maintain worldwide, not only becomes available, it is also accessible within seconds. Since the start of operation of the VIS, it takes consular staff just a few seconds to check if an applicant has already been refused a visa and to reject his or her application.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0305829813484186">107</xref></sup> Through the storage of biometric characteristics, it is no longer possible for apprehended migrants to forestall a deportation by destroying their passports and concealing their identity. Rather, visa overstayers are now haunted by their data doubles: if their fingerprints are stored in the VIS, it takes authorities just a few hours to establish their identity and country of origin in order to deport them as soon as possible. Hence, biometric technologies not only imply a qualitative shift in the efficiency and scope of border controls. More importantly, biometric databases significantly alter the encounters and power relations between migrants and border control authorities. In the case of undocumented migrants being detected, border control authorities no longer depend on the cooperation of migrants to re-identify them, because their data doubles replace their narratives as a source of truth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0305829813484186">108</xref></sup> Thereby, biometric databases considerably diminish migrants’ room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p>To be clear: I am not arguing that biometric rebordering completely deprives migration of its moments of autonomy. Nor do I claim that the appropriation of mobility and rights has become impossible for abjectified migrants within biometric border regimes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0305829813484186">109</xref></sup> My point is rather that the introduction of biometric technologies for border control purposes significantly alters the practical terms and material conditions for the appropriation of mobility. The reason is that biometric technologies render migrants’ bodies as a means of control by transforming them into data doubles. Escaping these ‘digital alter egos’, which determine if a person is granted a visa or not, and which enable the reconstruction of a person’s migration history in order to facilitate his or her deportation, is no longer simply a matter of burning one’s passport. The fact that asylum seekers have resorted to deliberately cutting or burning their fingerprints in order to prevent an enrolment in EURODAC indicates that it will afford nothing less than to alter or destroy the minutiae of one’s fingerprints.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0305829813484186">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>What the example of biometric rebordering illustrates is that the warranty of critique, whereupon the CAM does not sufficiently acknowledge the restrictive effects of border controls, increases in context of their technologisation. Biometric rebordering alters the power relations and encounters between migrants and border control authorities to such an extent that the general assertion of moments of autonomy of migration within any border regime regardless of its legal, material and technological composition becomes, in fact, a highly problematic claim. Ultimately, biometric rebordering stipulates a question, namely: what does the assertion of autonomy of migration refer to in the context of border regimes that transform migrants’ bodies through the usage of biometrics into a means of mobility control? In light of this question I conclude that an acknowledgement of the restrictive effects implicated in the technologisation of border controls makes it necessary to rethink not only some of the CAM’s central features, but the notion of autonomy itself.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Rethinking the Autonomy of Migration – Rethinking Autonomy</title>
<p>In this article I have attributed the neglect of the technologisation of border controls and its effects on migrants’ room for manoeuvre by the existing CAM literature to a misreading of the securitisation of migration as a mere means for the disenfranchisement and economic exploitation of migrant labour. In order to overcome this economic reductionism, I have proposed to draw on Foucault’s notion of the security dispositif to conceptualise today’s border regimes. As Foucault perceives the security dispositif primarily as a dispositif of circulation, it brings out that security concerns and the promotion of freedom of movement are not in tension, but operate in tandem. It is the interplay between the two that drives the adoption of a pro-active risk management approach that in turn explains the ‘technological imperative’ characterising contemporary processes of rebordering.</p>
<p>But the conception of contemporary border regimes as security dispositifs affords to reconsider at least two of the CAM’s propositions. Firstly, abjection and banishment have to be conceived as integral moments of governing human mobility through differential inclusion. Adopting the notion of banishment does not, however, imply a return to the paradigm of exclusion. In contrast to exclusion, banishment does not aim at the repression of mobility, but at its institutionalisation. The abject are kept in constant rotation by being subjected to the paradoxical freedom of the ban ‘to go anywhere except where one wants to go’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0305829813484186">111</xref></sup> This is important to note because it was the paradigm of exclusion that the CAM’s proponents sought to critique and replace with the notion of differential inclusion in the first place.</p>
<p>Secondly, the CAM needs a new justification for the analytical-strategical prioritisation of migrants’ practices. It is important to retain this feature of the CAM because it efficiently allows for avoiding a control-biased analysis of technologically ever-more sophisticated borders regimes. But the CAM’s proposition, whereupon migration temporarily precedes the attempts to control and regulate it, becomes untenable in the face of the security dispositif’s risk management approach, which strives to render unknown future behaviours knowable in order to make them actionable and governable. What this pro-active risk management approach brings to the fore is that the CAM’s assumption of a temporal precedence of migration is underpinned by a reductive reading of power relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0305829813484186">112</xref></sup> It therefore becomes requisite to rethink the concept of autonomy in such a way that it offers an alternative, more convincing justification for analytical-strategical prioritisation of migrants’ practices.</p>
<p>This brings me to the final, albeit most crucial, modification of the CAM: the challenge to rethink the meaning of autonomy in relation to migration. To engage with this challenge is necessary in order to develop the CAM as an approach that is no longer prone to the accusation of being based on, as well as contributing to, a romanticisation of migration. It becomes urgent to engage with this challenge because the warranty of the two allegations, which fuel this major critique, increases in the context of biometric rebordering. The analysis of the impact of biometric technologies on migrants’ possibilities to appropriate mobility and rights allows me to indicate two starting points for the task to rethink autonomy as a concept.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is important to develop a situated reading of autonomy which captures that mobility is always embodied and relational in order to bring out the diversity of migrants’ lived experiences and practices. This is a prerequisite for restoring the CAM’s capacity to critique the discriminatory effects of biometric borders. The latter implies a simultaneous intensification and concealment of the differentiation of how the border is experienced, depending on people’s subject position in terms of class, ‘race’, gender, country of origin, age and other factors. Donna Haraway’s concept of <italic>situated knowledge</italic> offers a promising starting point for such a re reading of autonomy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0305829813484186">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>Secondly, a rethinking of autonomy needs to answer the question of what the assertion of an autonomy of migration refers to in the face of biometric border regimes that transform migrants’ bodies into a means of mobility control. What the example of biometric rebordering brings to the fore is that governmental technologies for the regulation and control of human mobility have become so pervasive and intrusive that a rethinking of autonomy has to go beyond its Greek etymology of ‘self-legislation’. Nor is it credible any more to simply equate autonomy with some form of independency, as in the original formulation of the CAM’s core hypothesis in the pioneering work of Yann Moulier Boutang, as cited at the beginning of the article. Autonomy can no longer be thought of as an attribute or a quality inherent to migration. Just as the forms and practices of migration are shaped by, and can therefore not be separated from, the conditions under which they occur, the emergence of moments of autonomy can not be thought independently of the ever-more pervasive and intrusive governmental technologies that seek to control and regulate migration. Autonomy has to be rethought as a relational concept. Ranabir Samaddar’s proposal to read autonomy as ‘the “Other” of governmentality’ might offer a promising starting point for this task.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0305829813484186">114</xref></sup></p>
<p>While it is beyond the scope of this article to rethink the <italic>autonomy</italic> of migration, it should be underscored that this is an endeavour that is both worthwhile and pertinent. Not only because the CAM’s reading of borders as sites of intensive political struggle over the selective denial and direct appropriation of mobility is well equipped to counter the growing de politicisation of border controls. Nor only because the CAM’s conception of borders as conflictive encounters avoids a control-biased analysis that confirms the claims that drive the technologisation of border controls. But also, and most importantly, because the insight of the renowned migration scholar Stephen Castles, whereupon potential migrants ‘do not decide to stay put just because the receiving state says they are not welcome’, is still valid in the context of technologically ever-more sophisticated border regimes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0305829813484186">115</xref></sup> In other words, the question of how moments of autonomy of migration emerge and persist becomes even more pertinent in the face of attempts to diminish migrants’ room for manoeuvre by turning their bodies into a means of mobility control.</p>

<p>While it is hardly disputed that migration has been securitised in the course of the Europeanisation of migration policy, it is still contested how securitisation should be conceptualised. Benjamin Muller, ‘Risking It All at the Biometric Border: Mobility, Limits, and the Persistence of Securitisation’, <italic>Geopolitics</italic> 16, no. 1 (2011). Thierry Balzacq has introduced a useful distinction between ‘philosophical’ and ‘sociological’ approaches. The philosophical variant refers to the definition of securitisation as a performative speech act by political elites, as put forward in the pioneering work of the Copenhagen School. Thierry Balzacq, <italic>Securitization Theory: How Security Problems Emerge and Dissolve</italic> (London: Routlege, 2010). Following the sociological reading, this article understands securitisation as a technology of government in the Foucaultian sense. Didier Bigo, ‘Security and Immigration: Toward a Critique of the Governmentality of Unease’, <italic>Alternatives: Global, Local, Political</italic> 27, no. 1 (Special Issue, February 2002); Jef Huysmans, <italic>The Politics of Insecurity: Fear, Migration and Asylum in the EU</italic> (London: Routledge, 2006). As such, securitising processes involve multiple actors and dispersed security practices, which are increasingly mediated by identification, information and surveillance technologies. ‘What’s In An Act?

<p>EURODAC stores the fingerprints of apprehended border crossers and asylum seekers in order to facilitate the implementation of the Dublin II regulation, which stipulates that asylum seekers have to lodge their application in the member state through which they have entered the EU. Yet, EURODAC is also increasingly used for the re-identification of irregular migrants, thereby resembling a prime example of ‘function creep’, that is, the usage of databases for purposes beyond initially stated objectives. The VIS will soon be the largest biometric database in the world as it stores the fingerprints and facial images of the up to 20 million people who annually apply for a Schengen visa, for a period of five years. Dennis Broeders, ‘The New Digital Borders of Europe: EU Databases and the Surveillance of Irregular Migrants’, <italic>International Sociology</italic> 22, no. 1 (2007). The SIS is the oldest EU database for migration control purposes. The second-generation SIS will also store the fingerprints of deported migrants and other ‘undesirable’ persons. Its start of operation has been repeatedly postponed and was rescheduled to begin in April 2013.

For a critique of this supposedly humanitarian justification see Jeandesboz, ‘Beyond the Tartar Step. But the justification for the build-up or intensification of border controls through a victimisation of certain groups of migrants is also present in the anti-trafficking discourse of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and certain non-governmental organisations, see Rutvica Andrijasevic, ‘Beautiful Dead Bodies: Gender, Migration and Representation in Anti-trafficking Campaigns’, <italic>Feminist Review</italic> 86, no. 1 (2007); Rutvica Andrijašević, <italic>Migration, Agency and Citizenship in Sex Trafficking</italic> (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2010).

<p>Benjamin Muller has, for instance, criticised the representation of biometric technologies as a side effect-free solution to balance the alleged tension between security and freedom of movement. The usage of biometric technologies in conjunction with the related risk management approach implicates, however, that unrestricted mobility is only available to those who make themselves completely transparent to border control authorities, as security is equated with visibility. Muller, <italic>Security, Risk</italic>, 95. Along similar lines, Didier Bigo argues that the technologisation of border controls ultimately translates freedom of movement into ever-more pervasive dataveillance. Didier Bigo, ‘Freedom and Speed in Enlarged Borderzones’, in <italic>The Contested Politics of Mobility: Borderzones and Irregularity</italic>, ed. Vicki Squire (Oxon and New York: Routledge, 2011). Moreover, numerous scholars in critical security studies have criticised that the discriminatory effects of border controls become concealed, but nevertheless persist and even intensify, in the context of biometric rebordering. I discuss this point in detail in the next section.</p>

<p>Template refers to digital representations of particular biometric characteristics, which are generated by means of algorithms. These templates can be stored, exchanged, searched and matched by computers, which fulfil these tasks much faster and more efficiently than human beings, thereby allowing for the move from human to automated border controls. The crucial innovation lies, then, not so much in the usage of biometric characteristics for the verification of a person’s claimed identity, but in the move from analogous information (photography of people’s faces in passports or a simple ink fingerprint) to digital information.

In the end, trusted traveller programmes intensify the controls not only for those categorised as ‘high risk’, but also for the ‘trusted travellers’ themselves as a biometric passport and ‘background checks of varying range of intrusiveness’ are preconditions for the participation in such a scheme.

Salter (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2008), 136–7.

<p>To prove the opposite is the research interest guiding my dissertation project, which carries the working title: ‘The Visa Information System: Biometric Re-Bordering and the Appropriation of Mobility’. While it is beyond the scope of this article to provide a detailed account of respective practices, it may suffice to indicate some of them. Firstly, abjectified migrants might opt for ‘avoiding the “identity routes” of visa and asylum applications when travelling to Europe’; Dennis Broeders and Godfried Engbergsen, ‘The Fight Against Illegal Migration: Identification Policies and Immigrant’s Counterstrategies’, <italic>American Behavioral Scientist</italic> 50, no. 12 (2007): 1605. Secondly, the introduction of biometrics does not solve the issue of feeder documents like birth certificates, passports, job contracts and so on upon which the decision to issue biometric documents, like a Schengen visa, is based. Muller, <italic>Security, Risk</italic>, 19. Thirdly, biometric technologies are introduced in a regime in which corruption is a structural and widespread phenomenon; Alexis Spire, <italic>Accueillir ou reconduire: Enquête sur les guichets de l’immigration</italic> (Paris: Raisons d’Agir Éditions, 2009). I explore these and other practices of appropriation of Schengen visas in greater detail in my thesis.</p>
