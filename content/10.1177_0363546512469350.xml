<title>Call for Volunteers</title>
<p>Every year, AOSSM accepts new volunteers to serve on its standing committees. These volunteer committees form the lifeblood of AOSSM and provide guidance for Society programs and projects. Those who join committees not only heighten their experience as an AOSSM member, but also form ties of fellowship with their colleagues that can last throughout their career. Because different committees work so closely with each other to help accomplish the Society’s mission, participating in a committee is an excellent way to see how AOSSM develops its meetings, courses, publications, and other resources.</p>
<p>Although requirements and duties vary by committee, volunteers must be able to attend regular committee meetings, which are typically scheduled in conjunction with Specialty Day each spring and the AOSSM Annual Meeting each summer. With the range of Society programs and corresponding committees, there are many opportunities to share your unique perspective.</p>
<p>If you are interested in serving on an AOSSM committee, please visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sportsmed.org">www.sportsmed.org</ext-link>, fill out the volunteer form by February 1, 2013, and fax (847-292-4905) or e-mail the form to Camille Petrick at <email>Camille@aossm.org</email>.</p>

<title>Research Mentoring Program Now Available</title>
<p>AOSSM recently initiated a research mentoring program that brings together individuals who have shown scientific promise at an early stage of their careers with senior clinician-scientists who have highly successful research programs. The primary goal of this program is to help younger members obtain grant funding from a large national organization such as the NIH. The program is designed for those who do not have a natural mentor at their own institution and who do not have an ongoing mentoring relationship. The official mentorship relationship will have a term of 2 years. It is hoped, however, that the individuals find the experience sufficiently enriching that they will continue longer term contact, support, or collaboration.</p>
<p>Applications will be reviewed by the Research Committee, and up to 5 pairs will be selected for participation in the program. Please submit all application materials and any questions to Bart Mann, AOSSM Director of Research, at <email>bart@aossm.org</email>. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis. This program is made possible through a generous grant from ConMed Linvatec.</p>
