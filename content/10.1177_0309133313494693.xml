<p>Stream restoration is an undeniably contentious issue. Animated and heated debates have unfolded over the past 20 years regarding what techniques are most appropriate for restoration efforts. This debate has often pitted academic fluvial geomorphologists against restoration practitioners and resource agencies that have embraced Dave Rosgen’s Natural Channel Design (NCD). Rebecca Lave’s <italic>Fields and Streams</italic> details the contours of the so-called Rosgen Wars in an effort to explain why NCD, despite the protests of many researchers, has been widely adopted in the stream restoration field. Broadly, Lave argues that Rosgen’s success exemplifies the more widespread trends in the environmental sciences whereby the legitimacy of knowledge claims are increasingly adjudicated by the private sector, rather than by academic researchers. While the sciences have always been politicized, the Rosgen Wars are emblematic of a shift from the Cold War Era research priorities, during which the US Government sanctioned knowledge production that aligned with its national security interests. Today, however, this model no longer holds as markets have been accorded the power to decide what counts as valid knowledge, or in this case valid restoration. Accordingly, Lave demonstrates that ideas produced by research scientists have been increasingly devalued unless they have direct implications for the market – this is evident in the Rosgen Wars, which have seen the voices of academic fluvial geomorphologists pushed toward the margins in debates over stream restoration. In many cases, their knowledge and expertise is very simply unmarketable because it does not offer straightforward prescriptions regarding restoration practice.</p>
<p>Lave produces a story physical scientists and critical human geographers alike will find accessible and important, though maybe for divergent reasons. I suspect physical scientists will likely have less of an interest in the theoretical work the book contains, particularly its engagement with and reworking of Bourdieu’s concepts (e.g. fields, habitus) to explain why the stream restoration field has assumed its current structure, than in its detailed analysis of how the Rosgen Wars have played out among restoration practitioners and research scientists. Nevertheless, Lave’s presentation of complex theoretical ideas is crisp and precise; readers unfamiliar with the lexicon of critical human geographers will benefit from a considered reading of these sections because they have significant importance for the arguments Lave crafts. More importantly, by mapping the ways in which the stream restoration field is reproduced and the mechanisms through which knowledge claims are validated or rejected, environmental scientists will see implications for their own work, and how it may shape their research priorities going forward. Prior to considering the most salient points and questions Lave’s work raises, it is worth surveying the book’s structure. Briefly, Chapter 1 introduces the main contours of Lave’s argument and theoretical reference points – one of Lave’s principal aims is to bring science and technology studies and political ecology into dialogue with one another to understand why the Rosgen Wars have unfolded in a noticeably contentious manner. Chapters 2 and 3 step into questions surrounding stream restoration, with Chapter 2 offering a primer on how rivers work and the major players in the stream restoration industry. Chapter 3 presents a succinct history of stream restoration in the USA, and discusses Dave Rosgen’s rise to prominence and the dynamically changing power structure of the stream restoration field. Many fluvial geomorphologists will find Chapter 4 of significant interest. Here, Lave evaluates the claims and counterclaims advanced by Rosgen supporters and those more critical of his methods (see below for a more detailed discussion). With Chapter 5, Lave draws from extensive participant observation and survey data to understand why Rosgen has effectively molded the habitus (embodied practices instilled through education that strongly influence behavior within particular settings) of stream restoration. Chapter 6 returns to the political economy of stream restoration to situate and explain Rosgen’s success within a broader political-economic context. Lave concludes by asking if the Rosgen Wars case study can help us refine Bourdieu’s theoretical concepts, leading to a tighter integration between political ecology and science and technology, and how neoliberal governance will affect future knowledge production in the sciences.</p>
<p>While Lave’s entire narrative illuminates the complete historical trajectory of the Rosgen Wars, in lieu of offering a mechanistic, chapter-by-chapter appraisal, I want to visit some of the issues she brings into relief that will be of most interest to fluvial geomorphologists and physical scientists (this is not to suggest the theoretical work Lave does is unimportant). Chapter 5 fits neatly into this category. It surveys the claims and counterclaims that have been advanced by advocates and detractors of NCD to either discredit or support NCD principles. Lave rightfully notes that many of the arguments leveled against NCD have remained in circulation, essentially unchanged, since the mid-1990s. Here, Lave meticulously examines the criticisms leveled by academic researchers to discredit NCD. A common refrain of oppositional arguments is that NCD infers form from process, and more generally prioritizes form during design. As Lave demonstrates, NCD relies on extensive modeling of hydraulics and sediment transport. Whether or not critics find these modeling techniques valid is another question, but they cannot argue, credibly, that NCD is form obsessed. A second critique researchers tender against NCD is that it relies too greatly on bankfull discharge; as Lave shows, while this claim is partially correct, Rosgen does not employ a definition of bankfull discharge that is tied to the physical form of channels. These issues have been prevalent in discussions regarding NCD, and so Lave’s treatment of these topics is both worthwhile and instructive. Lave also addresses counterclaims put forward by Rosgen’s supporters. In both sections Lave’s myth-busting is even-handed and disinterested. However, what is most troubling, as Lave notes, is that both NCD supporters and detractors have yet to conduct detailed, empirical studies to support their claims. Arguably, the reason why patterns of argumentation among all parties involved have not shifted since the mid-1990s is precisely because no one is willing to provide more than anecdotal evidence to corroborate their arguments (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309133313494693">Nagle, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As a result, these debates are tied into larger questions about how scientific knowledge is legitimized and codified. Keeping this in mind, we should step back and recognize that if markets are exerting more and more power over the politics and practices of knowledge production, the <italic>objective</italic> success or failure is beside the point. The success of restoration projects is measured from specific vantage points. What constitutes a failure in the eyes of a geomorphologist may be a resounding success in the eyes of the market. As such, given the shifting dynamics of knowledge production, if academic researchers want to make a successful case against NCD, their appeals cannot be murated within the confines of specialist journals. They will have to marshal evidence that demonstrates not only why NCD is not optimal, but why it is unsatisfactory from a neoliberal-market standpoint to use this approach for restoration. Until both sides collect more data on the <italic>performance</italic> of projects, it is likely that the debate over NCD will remain at an impasse; and, if the past is an accurate indication, this impasse will favor the continued expansion of NCD.</p>
<p>Maybe the most crucial point Lave brings out is that NCD does not actually serve as a cookbook approach to stream restoration. Rosgen opponents lament NCD on these very grounds – it fails, they contend, because it attempts to apply invariant techniques to stream restoration projects across diverse geomorphic and hydrological settings. While it is true that Rosgen’s approach is foundational, and shapes many practitioners’ approaches to stream and river restoration, what he offers is not ironclad, it is not a deterministic formula. Lave cites numerous examples of practitioners speaking about the varying ways in which they apply NCD principles. The takeaway message is that experienced practitioners who employ NCD nevertheless modify design principles to fit specific geomorphic circumstances. While practitioners lacking extensive backgrounds in engineering and geomorphology may in fact hew to a more ‘cookie cutter’ application of NCD principles, there is no evidence to indicate this is the norm. Here is where opponents of NCD go awry in making their arguments – paradoxically so. Those most vocal about the inimical nature of NCD often cite the complexity inherent to the biogeomorphic forms and processes present in stream and river ecosystems as to why it is inappropriate for restoration (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309133313494693">Juracek and Fitzpatrick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309133313494693">Simon et al., 2007</xref>). Despite being attuned to this particular form of complexity, they fail to recognize that NCD is typically applied in nuanced – complex – ways to accomplish restoration objectives. It is difficult to speculate why this blind spot exists, but surely these biases have been reinforced through the stagnant argumentation over NCD that has persisted over the past 20 years. While both sides are culpable, what is interesting to note is that strident Rosgen opponents have <italic>naturalized</italic> a view of NCD that prevents them from seeing that NCD can be applied in complicated ways; namely, that practitioners often deviate from prescriptive recommendations that are put forward in Rosgen’s book and courses. As Lave illustrates, it is probable that Rosgen and his system will retain a great deal of influence in the coming years, but also that practitioners will continue to refine their techniques – which means the naturalized view of NCD that has gripped opponents’ imaginations will increasingly fade from the scene. NCD will, in a sense, become denaturalized through the continued evolution of restoration practice.</p>
<p>While some may not readily embrace the theoretical apparatus Lave builds into her book, all scientists will profit from reflecting on her narrative and what it means not only for stream restoration, but also for the production of scientific knowledge and the more expansive impacts neoliberalism will have on Earth surface systems. Readers who are versed in Lave’s previous work on the Rosgen Wars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309133313494693">Lave, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309133313494693">2012b</xref>) will find much that is familiar in this volume, as well as new insights about how to integrate the physical sciences and critical social theory to craft more incisive and inclusive explanations for both why particular biophysical phenomena emerge on the landscape and how they are analyzed by different epistemic communities. Although Lave convincingly demonstrates that the Rosgen Wars are emblematic of a broader shift in the political economy of the environmental sciences, she does not delve too deeply into what the long-term effects of neoliberalism might be on them. Lave ends on a slightly agnostic and uncertain note:<disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps privatization and commercialization [of science] will open up the formerly heavily bounded scientific field to outsiders with different ideas and political agendas, in which case the neoliberal forces integral to Rosgen’s rise could turn out to have a notable silver lining. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309133313494693">Lave, 2012a</xref>: 126)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The subjunctive feel to this statement is palpable, which perhaps explains why Lave’s work is mostly historical – there is little evidence to indicate a deepening of neoliberal policies will markedly improve the practice of science and give researchers greater freedom to pursue lines of inquiry that are not tethered to vested economic interests. Historical narratives are valuable, but a deeper discussion of how the environmental sciences could be restructured by the persistence of neoliberalism would have strengthened the book. Of course, there are limits to our powers of speculation, but a more sustained discussion of what the Rosgen precedent says about the future of knowledge creation and education in the sciences would be interesting given that a neoliberal model has increasingly come to shape university governance and what is deemed proper and worthwhile research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309133313494693">Dowling, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>But I want to emphasize that Lave’s book remains essential reading for the big-picture questions it raises, both directly and indirectly. Although neoliberalism is constituted through a set of practices, it is also very much a discourse, and <italic>Fields and Streams</italic> ably charts how this discourse is materialized on the landscape (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309133313494693">Schein, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309133313494693">2009</xref>). While there has been a great deal of work on how political economy influences the shape of the physical landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309133313494693">Castree, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309133313494693">2008b</xref>), Lave’s book reminds us that one of the ultimate measures of neoliberalism’s utility will be the consequences it has on the landscape. While neoliberalism is not the <italic>singular</italic> driving force behind Rosgen’s success, there is no doubt it has played a central role. More narrowly within the context of stream restoration, we need to question what legacy this particular manifestation of neoliberalism may leave on the landscape, and what memories it will imprint on fluvial landscapes that will affect their evolution for years to come (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309133313494693">Brierley, 2010</xref>). While these questions do not elicit certain answers, they demand reflection. Markets, in the abstract, will always remain indifferent to questions like these because of their overwhelming emphasis on short-term returns – unless we can demonstrate that markets’ ultimate fates are intimately tied up with the answers to these questions.</p>
