<p><italic>A very personal diary recording the final days of Bush House, home to the fabled BBC World Service for more than 70 years</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>W<sc>ednesday</sc> J<sc>anuary</sc> 4, 2012. Bush House. A note in Log Advisory &amp; Talkback: “The Editor has tasked a group of us to co-ordinate the publication of a short book about our working lives and times. It is intended to be a souvenir of Room 440 SE Wing, the BBC World Service Newsroom, written by those who've crewed it through many a long shift …”</p>
<p>T<sc>uesday</sc> J<sc>anuary</sc> 10. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. New rules have been issued by BBC News about future editorial priorities. World Service Radio News is not one of them. Henceforth, when coverage is required from a news correspondent, he or she will be assigned as follows: “Priority 1. The correspondent/reporter should file a few sentences of text for use by the website, Twitter, the News Channel and BBC World News channel straps … Priority 2. BBC Newsgathering should direct the work of any corr/reporter in the field, but if they are to be two-wayed, they should first go to either the News Channel on a domestic story or BBC World News on an international story …”</p>
<p>Television and Twitter take precedence over radio. BBC News, which is funded by the licence fee, takes priority over World Service News, funded by the Foreign Office until 2014. That is why, on Christmas Day, during a wave of Boko Haram attacks in Nigeria, when World Service had the only BBC correspondent covering the story – our Africa editor, Martin Plaut – we came last in the queue for news and updates even though Martin was sitting next to me. We really have been put in our place.</p>
<p>W<sc>ednesday</sc> J<sc>anuary</sc> 25. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. The demand for BBC World Service staff to pay for our own farewell bash when we leave Bush House has triggered an unusually vicious stream of indignation in Log Talkback: “I think the fact that we are being asked to pay to attend the official farewell to our much-loved building (mice notwithstanding) says everything we knew, but hoped might not be true, about the future …”</p>
<p>F<sc>riday</sc> J<sc>anuary</sc> 27. Breaking news in the Newsroom. BBC Director General Mark Thompson is leaving. Hurrah. Contributors to Log Talkback have more important things to worry about. A chair has gone missing from the Long Form production desk: “Has anybody seen it? A picture is attached (although the missing one is blue rather than black). If you have it, please can you return it asap. Many thanks …”</p>
<p>S<sc>aturday</sc> F<sc>ebruary</sc> 18. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. The first thing I see outside the lift on Ground Floor, S.E. Wing, is a poster urging us to buy tickets for the Bush House farewell bash – “only five days left!” The furore about who's being invited and how much they should pay has now made it to the broadsheets. A former managing director of World Service, John Tusa, has weighed in publicly and demanded a re-think from BBC Chairman Chris Patten. Tusa is reportedly refusing to go to the party unless former staff are also invited.</p>

<title>Will staff be asked to bring their own booze?</title>
<p>T<sc>uesday</sc> F<sc>ebruary</sc> 21. Bush House, Centre Block. As I come out of the Arcade café with my cappuccino I almost collide with Peter Horrocks, director of “BBC Global Division”. I ask him if it is true that, to save money on the farewell bash, staff will be required to bring their own booze and sausages on sticks. How I hate myself. I spend the rest of the day chasing contributions for the newsroom book. No one has come up with a title that isn't rude to the bosses so I take an executive decision. It will be called <italic>The Newsroom Book</italic>.</p>
<p>W<sc>ednesday</sc> F<sc>ebruary</sc> 29. Newsroom. This year's BBC pay settlement is a 1 per cent increase. Previous below-inflation settlements and a three-year freeze on pay and bonuses (imposed on staff but not all bosses) have meant a 12 per cent drop in the spending power of our salaries since Mark Thompson (annual salary £834,000) took over.</p>
<p>In the real world, the news doesn't stop all day. The Syrian Army launches a ground assault at Homs after weeks of artillery bombardment against rebel fighters; North Korea announces a nuclear weapons moratorium; Egypt announces the date of its first presidential election since the overthrow of Mubarak; Davy Jones, lead singer of The Monkees, dies of a heart attack; the European Central Bank says it is going to print more than half-a-trillion-dollars-worth of Euros to prop up the EU's banks; Julius Malema is expelled from the governing ANC in South Africa; James Murdoch resigns from his dad's News International newspapers; General Motors and Peugeot announce a partial merger of their European car-making operations; the Apple corporation becomes the most valuable private business in the world, worth the equivalent of Saudi Arabia's Gross National Product; and the general election in Senegal goes to a run-off. By the time the shift is over my brain has turned to mush.</p>
<p>S<sc>unday</sc> M<sc>arch</sc> 11. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. With Bush House emptying by the day, Peter Horrocks has forwarded an e-mail to help us think more positively about the move to W1: “This afternoon at 13.45 GMT the BBC Burmese Service became the first output to be transmitted from New BH. It was followed two hours later by BBC Sinhala. Both programmes broadcast with a hitch, bringing a tear to my eye … we can now approach the transition to our new home based on the strong foundations of today's success …”</p>
<p>Later a correction arrives: “… broadcast with <italic>not</italic> a hitch … I had a problem with my eye …”</p>
<p>W<sc>ednesday</sc> M<sc>arch</sc> 14. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. The management are petrified that our work-to-rule over the new Newsroom rota is going to mash up their plans for a hitch-free exodus to W1. A letter confirms that we in the Newsroom will be the last of the last to leave Bush House on Tuesday, July 10: “… Team storage will be collected at 9am … The crates with your personal belongings will be collected at 3pm … It is a truly impressive building … really exciting opportunity … Let's please be ready …”</p>
<p>W<sc>ednesday</sc> M<sc>arch</sc> 21. B<sc>ush</sc> H<sc>ouse</sc>. A free book is given out in the canteen tonight: <italic>More Light Less Heat; who holds power in the global conversation</italic>? It comes with a foreword by Peter Horrocks. The lemon sponge left over from lunch is rock hard; the woman behind the counter lets me have it for free. On my return to the Newsroom, coming out of the lift, I find two lost women whispering on the landing.</p>
<p>“Hello. Are you looking for someone?”</p>
<p>“No. I'm just saying goodbye to Bush House after 21 years …”</p>
<p>“Well, you've found the Newsroom. Twenty-one years, eh? What took you so long?”</p>
<p>T<sc>hursday</sc> M<sc>arch</sc> 29. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. Log Advisory. “If you already have a DSE assessed and issued chair and would like to take it to New Broadcasting House, you can. It can be labelled up and put on the vans …”</p>
<p>T<sc>uesday</sc> A<sc>pril</sc> 17. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. Here's the kind of journalism we can expect when we are happily installed in our new home: “… We're standing in a pretty ordinary Tokyo street … ordinary that is, except for the gigantic structure at the end of this street. It's the Tokyo Skytree, 634 metres of steel lattice-work painted white and reaching up into the sky … We're going to go up and take a look at the view from the top …”</p>
<p>This is a television script. It does not work on radio.</p>
<p>“… We're going to go up and take a look …”</p>
<p>No. Please. You cannot take me up for a look because I am sitting here listening to the radio and I don't do that with my eyes. People with ears can tell when they're listening to telly without pictures, but the bosses of BBC News are busily pretending otherwise because they don't want to pay for news for World Service Radio out of the licence fee.</p>
<p>T<sc>hursday</sc> A<sc>pril</sc> 19. The Distillers pub, Smithfield Market. The Newsroom fields a team for a BBC quiz night to raise money for charity. Rivals from other parts of BBC News are cheating, Googling furtively on iPhones. All in a good cause, I suppose, but cheating is cheating. Nice people don't do it.</p>
<p>S<sc>unday</sc> A<sc>pril</sc> 29. <italic>The Newsroom Book</italic> has been printed. It looks amateur, but respectably so.</p>

<sec id="sec2-095647480813492469">
<title>Eighty years of history is being dumped</title>
<p>T<sc>uesday</sc> M<sc>ay</sc> 1. Newsroom. I spent most of the day off-rota, distributing The <italic>Newsroom Book</italic>. The first thing people do when they get their copy is look to see if their photo is on the cover and complain if it isn't.</p>
<p>W<sc>ednesday</sc> M<sc>ay</sc> 2. Newsroom. More book distribution. More complaints about photos and names. Sod them. They can edit their own book next time.</p>
<p>T<sc>uesday</sc> M<sc>ay</sc> 8. B<sc>ush</sc> H<sc>ouse</sc>. The building is swarming with surveyors setting up theodolites and measuring the old girl's insides for whatever grandiose re-vamp is to follow as soon as the last of us has been shipped into exile. Eighty years of radio history is being torn down and dumped in the skips.</p>
<p>F<sc>riday</sc> M<sc>ay</sc> 11. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. It would appear that some of the very few World Service staff still working Bush House are taking away souvenirs without permission. We have been sent an e-mail warning us to keep our hands to ourselves: “There are strict policies around the disposal of assets funded by the FCO … Removing any BBC property from a BBC building will be considered theft and will be reported to the BBC Investigations Unit …” If only the Chief Operating Officer of the BBC World Service was as keen on protecting its radio news.</p>
<p>F<sc>riday</sc> M<sc>ay</sc> 18. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. The shift ends with two redundancy farewells. Management lay on the worst goodbye trolley I have ever seen: raw veg and dips; four cans of Coke; eight bottles of wine; no crisps.</p>
<p>Saturday May 26. Newsroom. There's a belated interest in “legacy issues” ahead of the imminent move to W1: “The glass BBC partition above S.E. Wing entrance door is being removed … in order to preserve it in the BBC heritage collection …” The carcase of Bush House is now plastered with laser-beam targets pinned up by the surveyors. The canteen is permanently empty. We who are left flit like ghosts through the deserted halls of our former world-importance.</p>
<p>F<sc>riday</sc> J<sc>une</sc> 1. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. No meetings, no vexing e-mails, no bosses to be seen anywhere all day. It is the Queen's Diamond Jubilee this weekend, four days of pomp and pageantry. The BBC's leaders are “working from home”.</p>
<p>S<sc>unday</sc> J<sc>une</sc> 3. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. The jubilee pageant of boats on the Thames is a wash-out. The BBC serve up the worst telly commentary ever on a live event. The rain lashes down. The poor old Queen endures stoically while BBC News goes into paroxysms of fake enthusiasm. At the point when it all gets too awful to watch any longer, a plane crashes in Lagos killing everyone on board and an unquantifiable number on the ground – which gives us an excuse to lead the bulletin with something else.</p>
<p>F<sc>riday</sc> J<sc>une</sc> 8. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. Log Talkback: “Thou shalt not steal. Could the person who stole my soy sauce from the fridge please tell me why they did it. I know BBC pay isn't good, but surely you can't be that desperate.”</p>
<p>S<sc>aturday</sc> J<sc>une</sc> 9. As I head back to Bush House from buying biscuits this afternoon a bloke behind me notices my blue BBC lanyard and comes alongside to give me some customer feedback.</p>
<p>“Why has the BBC been putting out so much crap about the Jubilee, eh? It's absolute rubbish.”</p>
<p>“I know,” I say, “it was awful wasn't it?”</p>
<p>The de-commissioning of Bush House is now in hyper-drive. The walls are being stripped. The posters are vanishing from corridors and stairwells. The canteen is serving pie, beans and chips as its main offering every lunch time as well as every night. The corridors echo emptily. In the Arcade café I am the only customer. Mark Thompson has sent us all an e-mail explaining how brilliantly the BBC handled the Jubilee: “… Scale … Ambition … Outstanding journalism … Very proud.”</p>
<p>M<sc>onday</sc> J<sc>une</sc> 11. Newsroom. One of our managers sends us an e-mail with a photograph to show where the World Service newsroom will be when it's decanted into the basement of W1. It was a moment of dreadful realisation. For the past eight decades the World Service has had its own Newsroom in a fortress called Bush House. From next month and for ever after, we are going to be a desk in someone else's Newsroom, where telly reigns supreme. And by the way, there's no canteen, only a café with three microwave ovens for the whole building.</p>
<p>T<sc>uesday</sc> J<sc>une</sc> 12. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. The table by the door to Studio S47, which is reserved by tradition for discarded newspapers, has been turned into an outlet for “unwanted items”. Today it is full of crap from the stationery cupboard: surplus lever-arch binders; devices for extracting staples from documents; left-over badges of Alan Johnston from the year when he was held hostage in Gaza; et cetera. A bottle of Argentinian red wine is there when I go into S47, gone by the time I come out.</p>

<title>We are in a dark corridor next to the kitchen</title>
<p>W<sc>ednesday</sc> J<sc>une</sc> 20. New Broadcasting House, W1. We are given a half-hour familiarisation tour. Everything is going to be totally, completely and utterly different – the desks, the chairs, the phones, the computers, every bit of hardware and software. We will write differently, record differently, broadcast differently. Somehow, none of our bosses has ever thought it necessary to spell this out to us in plain English. The production desk for our main news programme, <italic>World Briefing</italic>, has been shoved into a dark corridor next to the new newsroom's kitchen.</p>
<p>T<sc>uesday</sc> J<sc>une</sc> 26. B<sc>ush</sc> H<sc>ouse</sc>. When I go down to the Arcade for a cappuccino, the Italian café is shut. I peer inside. No Italians are visible. The counter is bare. There will be no more warm, coffee-fragranced moments in which to take refuge: “One sugar, my darlin', isn't it? How are you today?”</p>
<p>Back to the lobby of Centre Block, and the one remaining coffee cart. “Hello!”</p>
<p>The coffee cart bloke is hiding behind his newspaper. He looks up as my echo rebounds round the marble stairwell.</p>
<p>“Hello! ‘ello! ‘lo!”</p>
<p>On my way back to the Newsroom I get out early at the Third Floor, S.E. Wing, for a last look at what used to be World Service Current Affairs. The lights are off. The desks, chairs, computers and telephones look old fashioned and redundant. No more Current Affairs will be broadcast from Bush House. Everyone has gone except the Newsroom.</p>
<p>W<sc>ednesday</sc> J<sc>une</sc> 27. B<sc>ush</sc> H<sc>ouse</sc>. While I wait for the security man to open the courtyard gate, I see two fat, male arses protruding from one of the recycling skips installed in the car park for the de-commissioning. Two techies are engaged in plunder. The highlight of the shift is the capture of the Newsroom mouse, in a paper cup. It offers no resistance. It has a tumour on the side of its head. When it is liberated in the car park it doesn't want to move and sits there trembling.</p>
<p>T<sc>hursday</sc> J<sc>une</sc> 28. N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. Update from the unwanted items table – <italic>From Our Own Correspondent</italic> has been chucking out its unread books. <italic>The World of Robert Fisk, Volume 1, 1989–1998. From Beirut to Bosnia; Democracy Kills,</italic> by Humphrey Hawksley. Ever since Fergal Keane and John Simpson blazed the book trail, every BBC correspondent has felt the need to squeeze one out. The traffic Tannoy announces that Jim Muir is filing from Beirut: “There's been a spectacular bomb attack in the centre of Damascus, where explosives set fire to many vehicles in the car park of the capital's main courthouse. Three people were injured in what was an unusual attack in the heart of the city …”</p>
<p>W<sc>ednesday</sc> J<sc>uly</sc> 4, 2012. Newsroom. Mass apoplexy. It has become known this morning that Mark Thompson has written a despatch to be broadcast in the last World Service news bulletin to be transmitted from Bush House next week. “… The BBC first moved into Bush House in 1941. It was wartime and the BBC's European services had become too big for their temporary headquarters in a converted skating rink in Maida Vale in West London. In the decades that followed – as the Second World War gave way to the Cold War and then to today's complex world – Bush House became a unique icon of authority and trustworthiness in news to millions of listeners around the globe … This is Mark Thompson, BBC News, Bush House. [keep pay off]”.</p>
<p>I have never seen Mark Thompson in Bush House although I know he's been here. I have seen Margaret Thatcher in Bush House and Cherie Blair and Tom Stoppard, but only one Director General, John Birt, and him only once, getting out of his limo in the car park. The next Director General will never have to come at all. His name was announced today – George Entwistle, a former editor of the BBC2 current affairs programme, <italic>Newsnight</italic>. The BBC Chairman, Chris Patten, sent an e-mail explaining what a good choice he had made: “… George was the right person … passionate … committed …” BBC News immediately snapped the news and ran a graphic with his name spelt wrong: Entwhistle. “… one of the very best,” said Mark Thompson. “… George has the BBC's values running through his veins … real conviction and courage …”</p>
<p>T<sc>hursday</sc> J<sc>uly</sc> 5. L<sc>ast day in the</sc> N<sc>ewsroom</sc>. There are four of us at the 0900 hours editorial meeting. Everyone else from World Service takes part via a video link. They chatter away merrily about their news plans while we sit glumly listening to the air-conditioning in Room 845 Centre Block for the last time. Afterwards, in the lobby, I roll my bulletin scripts into a trumpet and sound retreat. Out in the courtyard, men in white overalls wearing filter masks are disposing of asbestos.</p>
<p>My last duty is to announce my departure on the Tannoy: “Hello, Newsroom … Goodbye, I'm leaving the building. See you on the other side.”</p>
