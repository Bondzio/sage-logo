<p>Although evidence supports the relationship between family influences and adolescent sexual behavior, there is limited understanding about how sexual initiation is related to perceived maternal expectancies derived from prolonged, constant mother–adolescent interactions. Our previous studies have shown that sexual initiation among Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) adolescents is predicted by how these adolescents interact with and perceive their mothers’ sexual expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659612452669">Kao, Guthrie, &amp; Loveland-Cherry, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659612452669">Kao, Loveland-Cherry, &amp; Guthrie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043659612452669">Kao, Loveland-Cherry, Guthrie, &amp; Caldwell, 2010</xref>). In this study, we used an a priori model to further explore cross-cultural differences in the relationships among mother–adolescent interactions, perceived expectancies, and adolescent sexual initiation over time between AAPI and individuals from other racial/ethnic groups.</p>
<p>A family’s cultural beliefs and socialization influence how adolescents interact with their mothers or perceive their mothers’ expectations of health-related behaviors. This consideration is significant for adolescents in the increasingly diverse United States, as a family’s cultural values—which may have a collective or individualistic perspective—vary among different cultural groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659612452669">Guilamo-Ramos et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043659612452669">Kim &amp; Ward, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043659612452669">Miller, Forehand, &amp; Kotchick, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043659612452669">Miller, Kotchick, Dorsey, Forehand, &amp; Ham, 1998</xref>). In this study, adolescents’ self-identified racial/ethnic background was used as a proxy to represent their families’ cultural socialization. By comparing AAPI adolescents—who operate in a family context that emphasizes collectivism—to their peers in other racial/ethnic groups (African American [AA], Hispanic American [HA], and Caucasian American [CA]), we were able to explicate the different aspects of maternal influences on adolescents with different family cultural socialization.</p>
<p>Bronfenbrenner’s Social Ecological Model, which allows factors to be examined over time from multiple levels of the environment, including the macro (i.e., family cultural socialization), interpersonal (i.e., mother–adolescent perceptions of interactions with each other), and intrapersonal (i.e., adolescents’ sexual initiation, perceived maternal expectations), informed the conceptual model for this study. Additionally, we used the expectancy violation–realignment model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659612452669">Collins &amp; Luebker, 1994</xref>) to conceptualize the construct of adolescents’ perceived maternal expectancy. This model suggests that through interactions, parents and adolescents constantly realign their expectations, attitudes, and behaviors in concert with each other. Perceived expectancies result from an adolescent’s interactions with his or her parents up to that time. In this study, we further compared the role of adolescents’ perceived maternal expectancy on delaying adolescents’ sexual debut across selected racial and ethnic groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043659612452669">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Background and Significance</title>
<p>Although a plethora of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659612452669">DiClemente et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659612452669">Feldman &amp; Rosenthal, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659612452669">Guilamo-Ramos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659612452669">Hutchinson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659612452669">Hutchinson, Jemmott, Jemmott, Braverman, &amp; Fong, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043659612452669">Kim &amp; Ward, 2007</xref>) have examined adolescent sexual behaviors, the effects of maternal influences on the development of these behaviors remains unclear. Over the past few decades, and within the context of rising rates of adolescent sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pregnancy, and HIV/AIDS, research has focused on intrapersonal factors related to safer sex, such as an adolescent’s sense of self-efficacy regarding contraceptive use and intentions to engage in risky behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659612452669">Brown &amp; Waite, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659612452669">Faryna &amp; Morales, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043659612452669">Sieverding, Adler, Witt, &amp; Ellen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1043659612452669">So, Wong, &amp; DeLeon, 2005</xref>). The intrapersonal factors identified in these studies overlook cultural differences and the effect of family values on adolescent sexual behaviors that are not derived from a mainstream Western cultural perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659612452669">Brewer &amp; Chen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659612452669">Fishbein, Middlestadt, &amp; Hitchocock, 1991</xref>). Despite efforts to address these threats to adolescents’ health, AA and HA adolescents are disproportionately affected by STIs, teen pregnancy, and HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659612452669">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2008</xref>), whereas AAPI populations, although stereotypically viewed as a trouble-free, “model minority,” have seen some of the greatest rate of increases in diagnoses of STIs and HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659612452669">CDC, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659612452669">Foo, 2002</xref>). There is a noted knowledge and understanding gap related to AA, HA, and AAPI interpersonal factors such as family influences on adolescents’ general behavior and on sexual initiation that is linked to STIs, HIV/AIDS, and teen pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659612452669">CDC, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659612452669">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659612452669">Grunbaum, Lowery, Kann, &amp; Pateman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043659612452669">O’Donnell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043659612452669">Stueve &amp; O’Donnell, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although family influences on adolescent behavior development are widely recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659612452669">Aronowitz, Rennells, &amp; Todd, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659612452669">Dahinten, Jennifer, &amp; Willms, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043659612452669">Kirby, Miller, Feldman, &amp; Rosenthal, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043659612452669">Lederman, Chan, &amp; Roberts-Gray, 2004</xref>), little is known about this process, particularly how it develops within the context of familial socialization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659612452669">Gecas and Steff (1990)</xref> found that parental influences on adolescent behaviors are generally greater than those of their peers, particularly in relation to educational goals and future plans, whereas peers exert stronger influence on adolescents’ appearance and recreational behaviors. Characteristics of adolescents’ interactions with their parents (i.e., parental warmth, involvement, connectedness, and perceived attitudes) have been shown to be protective against adolescents’ affiliations with deviant peers, risk-taking behaviors, and early pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043659612452669">Scaramella, Conger, Simons, &amp; Whitbeck, 1998</xref>). Thus, factors related to the influence of parents on adolescent socialization should be considered, as potential differences in how adolescents perceive (or attend to) their parents’ messages about sex may exist for different racial and ethnic groups. Adolescents raised in families that value collective culture, for example, may be more likely to consider their families’ feelings, attitudes, and expectations when making decisions about when and how to engage sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043659612452669">Kao, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659612452669">Kao et al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, an adolescent’s decision about when to engage in sexual activities may be related to socialization at home or within the family’s cultural context. This exploration is a vital step for developing culturally responsive intervention programs for ethnically diverse adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659612452669">Armour &amp; Haynie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043659612452669">Sieverding et al., 2005</xref>). Failure to consider cross-cultural differences has the potential to limit the effectiveness of family intervention programs targeting diverse families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659612452669">Aronowitz &amp; Munzert, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the past, most family studies have focused on the effects of parent–child sexual communication (i.e., frequency, depth, extent, and content of discussion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659612452669">DiClemente et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659612452669">Guilamo-Ramos et al., 2006</xref>) rather than on perceived parental expectancy. Interventions to prevent adolescents’ risky sexual activities that involve parents focus predominantly on encouraging parents to talk about the risks associated with sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659612452669">Feldman &amp; Rosenthal, 2002</xref>). These interventions have demonstrated only short-term (&lt;6 months) effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659612452669">Bralock &amp; Koniak-Griffin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043659612452669">Koniak-Griffin &amp; Stein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043659612452669">Lesser, Koniak-Griffin, Gonzalez-Figueroa, Huang, &amp; Cumberland, 2007</xref>). Our conceptual model, however, identified that perceived maternal sexual expectancies decreases adolescents’ risky behaviors among our study population. Family interventions that incorporate perceived parental sexual expectancies (e.g., via an expectancies-focused family intervention) may therefore be more effective and have longer lasting effects than do current family interventions.</p>
<p>Parental cultural influence has been associated with adolescent behavioral development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659612452669">Aronowitz &amp; Munzert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043659612452669">Lawrence et al., 1998</xref>) and identity formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043659612452669">Schachter &amp; Ventura, 2008</xref>). Although there is limited knowledge available that clearly differentiates maternal influences on adolescents’ sexual behavior across racial and ethnic groups, several patterns have been linked with adolescents’ sexual behaviors. Maternal support (warmth, perceived connectedness) and control (regulation, monitoring) have been associated with protective sexual behaviors such as contraception use or less frequent sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043659612452669">McElhaney, Porter, Thompson, &amp; Allen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1043659612452669">Upchurch, Aneshensel, Sucoff, &amp; Levy-Storms, 1999</xref>). Others have identified less positive (or mixed) findings on the relationship between parental sexual discussion and adolescents’ sexual debut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043659612452669">Rodgers, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043659612452669">Taris &amp; Semin, 1997</xref>). These mixed findings are often are attributed to unclear parent–child sexual communication or inadequate research structures such as cross-sectional design, lack of a theoretical framework, and insufficient measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659612452669">Jaccard, Dittus, &amp; Gordon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043659612452669">Jaccard, Dodge, &amp; Dittus, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>To more clearly understand and use the effects of parental influences, it is imperative to assess parent–child interactions such as adolescents’ perceived parental sexual expectancy (i.e., values and attitudes perceived from their parents about sexual activities). In our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659612452669">Kao et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659612452669">Kao, Loveland-Cherry, &amp; Guthrie, 2010</xref>) of AAPI adolescents and their mothers, the adolescents’ decisions about engaging in sexual activities were closely related to their perceived parental attitude about sex. In fact, if they felt that being sexually active would upset their parents or violate their parents’ trust and impede their relationship, the adolescents reported that they were more likely to delay intimate dating or initiating vaginal intercourse.</p>
<p>Different patterns of perceived parental expectancy are likely to be related to cultural socialization (or family values) at home. Parents from diverse cultures may model their own behaviors in many different ways to convey their expectations to their adolescents (e.g., through role modeling, sexual discussion, close monitoring, or supporting relationships). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043659612452669">Miller et al. (1999)</xref> studied 907 African American and Hispanic families in three communities in Alabama, New York, and Puerto Rico. The mother–adolescent relationship, maternal monitoring, and maternal sexual attitudes emerged as significant predictors of adolescent sexual behavior, whereas the families’ structural variables failed to predict adolescent sexual behaviors. Significantly, maternal attitudes (expectations) were more strongly related to adolescent sexual activities among the Hispanic adolescents in Puerto Rico. This finding suggests that other family factors, such as different cultural values, beliefs, and expectations, may have different influences on the sexual behaviors of adolescents from different cultural groups. Understanding the variations in how adolescents perceive their mothers’ sexual expectations and the relationship of these perceptions to adolescents’ sexual initiation across cultural groups could contribute to the development of efficacious, expectancy-focused family interventional programs tailored to promote positive sexual behavior development in diverse youth.</p>
<p>In summary, prior research supports the notion that adolescents’ perceptions of their mothers’ expectancies may be closely related to their sexual debut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659612452669">Kao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659612452669">Kao, Loveland-Cherry, &amp; Guthrie, 2010</xref>). Understanding which specific components of maternal influences exert an influence on adolescent sexual initiation, and whether these influences are similar across various racial and ethnic groups, can provide information on how to strengthen family functioning.</p>
<p>Using AAPI as our reference group, we built on knowledge gained in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659612452669">Kao, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659612452669">Kao, Loveland-Cherry, &amp; Guthrie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043659612452669">Kao, Loveland-Cherry, Guthrie, &amp; Caldwell, 2010</xref>), in which perceived maternal sexual expectancy was found to be significantly protective against AAPI adolescents’ early sexual initiation over two time points. This study expands on these findings by assessing whether such expectancy has a similar protective effect among AA, HA, and CA adolescents. This information is useful when tailoring a family intervention program to the specific cultural values of adolescents. Ultimately, this study sought to answer the following question: “Are there any differences in how AAPI adolescents and their peers from other racial/ethnic groups (AA, HA, and CA) perceive their mothers’ sexual expectations, and how these expectancies influence adolescents’ sexual initiation over two time points?”</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study was a secondary analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043659612452669">Udry, 1998</xref>) across two waves of data. We used an a priori model to compare differences of the effects of perceived maternal expectancy for delaying adolescents’ sexual debut. Approval for exemption from institutional review board review (HUM00011883) was obtained from the University of Michigan Health Science Institutional Review Board. The restricted-use Add Health data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043659612452669">Udry, 1998</xref>) was used to obtain the sample for the structural equation modeling via EQS 6.1 for Windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659612452669">Bentler, 2006</xref>). Structural equation modeling (SEM) with multiple-group invariance analyses was implemented to examine cross-cultural differences in maternal influences by measuring invariance across groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043659612452669">Liang, 2001</xref>). Use of SEM enables us to delineate “causal” relationships using a combination of statistical data and qualitative causal assumptions.</p>
<p>We derived several latent factors representing family function effects on adolescents’ sexual behaviors from our preliminary qualitative and quantitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659612452669">Kao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659612452669">Kao Loveland-Cherry, &amp; Guthrie, 2010</xref>). We hypothesized that sexual initiation would be influenced by how the adolescents interacted with their mothers and how they perceived their mothers’ expectations about sexual behaviors. Because socialization differs by cultural group, we also wanted to determine if perceptions of maternal sexual expectations vary among racial/ethnic groups.</p>
<sec id="section3-1043659612452669">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>We selected a sample of 7,638 adolescents (52.4% females and 47.6% males) who were between 15 and 17 years of age at Wave 1. This sample included 433 AAPI, 1,367 AA, 1,241 HA, and 4,597 CA adolescents. Our preliminary power analysis indicated a sample size of 127 would have power of 80% with medium effect size and with 12 predictors if using multiple regression analysis. To determine adequate sample size for the SEM analysis, we performed a rule of thumb parametric estimation to determine adequate sample size. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659612452669">Bentler and Chou’s suggestion (1988)</xref> that a minimum of 5 to 10 cases per parameter is necessary for the model testing, a sample size of 360 subjects was suggested to run the base AAPI model (36 parameters). As our smallest sample size was 433, we concluded that we had a sufficient number of subjects in all groups across the two waves of data to provide adequate power for the longitudinal analyses. We also had adequate degrees of freedom in each measurement and structural model.</p>
<p>Subjects criteria included the following: (a) age at the Wave 1 interview was 15 to 17 years, (b) they completed both the Wave 1 and Wave 2 in-home interviews, (c) the mother/mother figure participated in the Wave 1 in-home interview, (d) the age reported for sexual initiation was plausible (e.g., did not report sexual initiation at a future date), and (e) the reported date of sexual initiation was age 11 years or older. These criteria were employed to eliminate confounding factors such as nonconsensual sex. As the Wave 2 interview did not include those who had graduated from high school, our data set excluded those older than 17 years at Wave 1.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043659612452669">Table 1</xref> displays sample characteristics. Family income and parent education level were higher for AAPI and CA families compared with the AA and HA families. In particular, HA parents had significantly lower educational attainment. However, the descriptive statistics of the sample were congruent with the distribution of the general U.S. population at the time of data collection. Since family income and parent education were not significantly related to parent–adolescent interactions and perceived maternal expectancies in the regression model, parents’ education and family income were not used as covariates in this modeling. Data specific to fathers were not collected in the original Add Health data set; therefore, paternal data points were not included in our modeling.</p>

<p>Adolescents’ age of sexual initiation was calculated and presented as one endogenous variable comprising several items, such as if the adolescent was sexually active. The month and year of first sexual intercourse was used along with birth date to construct the V7 and V8 variables (1-7 scale for Wave 1 and 1-8 scale for Wave 2) to indicate the age at sexual initiation (1 = not sexually active, 2 = at 18 years, etc.).</p>
<p>Two latent factors—adolescents’ perceived maternal sexual expectation (APMSE) at Wave 1 (F5) and Wave 2 (F6)—were used as endogenous factors. APMSE is operationalized by adolescents’ perceived maternal attitudes and emotional reaction about adolescent’s sexual activity. Mother–adolescent interactions (F1-F4) were assessed via mothers’ perceptions about engaging in sexual discussion, their perceived closeness to, connectedness with, and degree of trust with their adolescents, as well as adolescents’ perceptions about their general communication and their relationships with their mothers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043659612452669">Table 2</xref> lists items used for latent factors. Items selected for these comparison modeling were based on the items used in our a priori model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659612452669">Kao, Loveland-Cherry, &amp; Guthrie, 2010</xref>). The mean and standard deviation of selected items were comparable across the four groups.</p>

<p>To assess differences in factor loadings for each latent factor we used confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate a measurement model separately for each group. Most of the factor loadings were similar and were higher than the recommended .40 level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659612452669">Essien, Ross, Ezedinachi, &amp; Meremikwu, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659612452669">Fenwick, Schellinck, &amp; Kendall, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043659612452669">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2006</xref>), with the exception of levels for the AA and CA groups with regard to two items that asked if the adolescents communicated with their mothers about attending parties and their personal problems. To maintain consistency with the a priori model, we keep these two items in the comparison models for these two groups. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043659612452669">Table 3</xref> provides a brief description of items used to measure concepts.</p>

<p>We assessed and compared measurement items and reliabilities (Cronbach’s alpha) of the between groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043659612452669">Table 2</xref>). The F2 and F3 latent factors, only three and four items, respectively, had lower reliabilities. This might be related to the time constraints built of the questionnaire or the possibility that these latent factors (maternal perceived connectedness and adolescents’ perceived general communication) were more formative than reflective in nature.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043659612452669">Schmitt (1996)</xref>, alpha is not a measure of unidimensionality. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043659612452669">Schmitt (1996)</xref> has noted, “Even relative low (e.g., .50) levels of criterion reliability do not serious attenuate validity coefficients” (p. 350). With good fit indices noted in the measurement models across all groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043659612452669">Table 3</xref>), we were assured that the measures used in this study were psychometrically sound. Since SEM, the analytic approach used, is able to account for imperfect measurement, a conservative measure (to allow less errors in the modeling) was taken to calculate error terms for these two factors. Specifically, the variance obtained from each racial group and a conservative reliability (α) were used to calculate random error variance (i.e., unreliability of the scale) using the following formula, error = variance × (1 − α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659612452669">Bollen, 1989</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>Prior to modeling, we used several approaches to examine missing cases and data distribution. We conducted a separate frequency and descriptive analysis for each group to examine the pattern of missing data; approximately 10% of the cases in each group had missing data. The built-in algorithm (Pair) was chosen over Maximal Likelihood or Listwise deletion because of its compatibility with the robust statistics (ML, Robust), which were preferred because the data for the CA and HA groups departed from multivariate normality after assessing multivariate Kurtosis using Mardia normalized estimates.</p>
<p>Adolescents’ age, parents’ education, and family income did not emerge as significant covariates in the a priori model with the AAPI population. This might be related to the fact that mother’s education level was treated as an ordinal variable (broader categories might lack sufficient variance) and that many subjects declined to report their household income (with 14% of missing values, <italic>N</italic> = 1,070). Since the purpose of this study was to assess if a similar effect of perceived maternal expectancies can be observed among non-AAPI groups, it was essential to be consistent with the conceptual framework used in the priori model. Thus, these three variables were not included as covariates in this study.</p>
<p>To evaluate how well the theoretical model being tested actually fit with the data, we assessed goodness of fit. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043659612452669">Raykov and Marcoulide’s (1999)</xref> recommendation that it is desirable to use the parsimony principle in structural equation modeling, composite indicators were used in the structural equation modeling to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043659612452669">Liang, Lawrence, Bennett, &amp; Whitelaw, 1990</xref>). Next, three structural models were assessed to evaluate the explained variances between groups.</p>
<p>To compare the models across racial/ethnic groups, we hypothesized that for the most part, maternal influences on adolescents’ sexual initiation were similar between cultural groups. Hence, we started with the most constrained model (the nested model), which assumed equality between the AAPI and other racial/ethnic groups. Additionally, the LaGrange Multiplier test was used to assess whether equality of constraints was not viable or appropriate and whether improvement in fit would be obtained if one of the constraints was released. The constraints on the covariance among the exogenous factors and paths of directional influence were released one at a time to assess the most plausible comparison model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043659612452669">Table 4</xref>). With the fit indices of these comparison models above the suggested .90 and the misfit index (root mean-square error of approximation) below the suggested .06 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043659612452669">Raykov, Tomer, &amp; Nesserlroade, 1991</xref>), it was concluded that the three comparison models were plausible.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>More similarities than differences emerged between the AAPI adolescents and those of the other racial and ethnic groups. Across all three comparison models (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043659612452669">Figure 1</xref>), five similarities were significant across all the groups: (a) maternal sexual discussion was related to adolescents’ early sexual initiation at Wave 2, (b) mothers’ perception of connectedness was significantly and positively related to APMSE at Wave 1, (c) APMSE at Wave 2 was protective against adolescents’ earlier sexual debut at Wave 2, (d) mothers’ perception of connectedness was related to adolescents’ later sexual initiation at Wave 1, and, most important, (e) APMSE was significantly associated with adolescents’ later sexual initiation for both waves.</p>
<p>Despite these similarities, we noted two important differences between the AAPI adolescents and the adolescents in the other racial and ethnic groups. First, although the correlations between the exogenous latent factors were significant for the AA, HA, and CA adolescent groups, some correlations were not significant for the AAPI group. Specifically, in all three models, AAPI mothers’ sexual discussion was not correlated with either mothers’ perceived adolescent connectedness or with adolescents’ perceived maternal connectedness. The correlation between adolescents’ perceived general communication and perceived connectedness was also not significant for the AAPI group. These results indicate that AAPI mother–adolescent sexual discussion (or general communication) was not based on perceived connectedness. Second, although there was a significant protective total effect of APMSE on delayed sexual initiation for all groups, the magnitude and predictive value of APMSE at Wave 1 for later sexual initiation at Wave 2 was significantly stronger for the AAPI group.</p>
<p>In addition to these two general variations, independent differences in the AAPI–AA and AAPI–HA comparison models were noted. Compared with the AA group, the AAPI group was found to have significantly stronger associations for the following relationships: (a) between adolescents’ perceived general communication and connectedness (β = .407, .237), (b) between APMSE and sexual initiation within waves (W1: −.34, −.27; W2: −.17, −.14), and (c) between sexual initiation at Wave 1 and Wave 2 (.70, .58, AAPI and AA, respectively). Compared with HA adolescents, AAPI adolescents’ perceived general communication was significantly associated with earlier sexual initiation. This was not the case for HA adolescents.</p>
<p>In the AAPI–CA comparison model, APMSE at Wave 1 was a significant mediator of the relationship between a mother’s perceived adolescent connectedness and adolescent sexual initiation at Wave 2. Although we found no direct effects between a mother’s perceived connectedness and adolescent sexual initiation at Wave 2, mothers’ perceived connectedness was indirectly protective against adolescents’ early sexual initiation at Wave 2 through the mediation effects of APMSE at Wave 1 (Sobel statistic: −3.49, <italic>p</italic> = .00) for both the AAPI and CA groups. Although we recognize that the difference in factor loadings is an indication that differences are present among groups, the variances explained (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) by the three comparison models were comparable at a moderate level. Approximately 60% of the variances in APMSE and 55% in adolescent sexual initiation at Wave 2 were explained by the models (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1043659612452669">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings suggest unique and significant effects of maternal influences on delaying adolescents’ sexual initiation for adolescents of all racial/ethnic groups. In particular, mothers’ perceptions of connectedness played an important role in shaping their adolescents’ perceived maternal sexual expectancy and indirectly influencing adolescents’ sexual debut over time. Conversely, mothers’ perceptions of sexual discussion were associated with a lower level of APMSE and earlier sexual debut. This negative finding might be related to unclear sexual expectancy or lack of trust between mothers and adolescents. This negative association suggests that current recommendations that merely urge parents to speak with their adolescents about the consequences of having sex may not be as effective as previously believed. This study indicates that a fundamental factor for preventing risky adolescent behavior is for mothers and their adolescents to develop trust-filled, connected relationships. The perceived maternal expectations that derive from such relationships may be more effective for delaying adolescents’ sexual debut.</p>
<p>As opposed to tests of an earlier model with AAPI adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659612452669">Kao, Loveland-Cherry, &amp; Guthrie, 2010</xref>), the comparison models between AAPI and AA as well as AAPI and CA adolescents indicated that adolescents’ perceptions of connectedness were significant and protective factor for delaying adolescents’ sexual debut over time. This difference in findings for AAPI adolescents may be related to the “borrowed” power from the comparison groups (i.e., those with larger samples) in this study. It is interesting to note, however, that unlike the comparison models with AA and CA, in the AAPI–HA comparison model, adolescents’ perceptions of connectedness with their mothers was related to a lower level of APMSE at Wave 1. This distinction may be because of an emphasis on the collective within AAPI and HA populations—adolescents raised in a more collective perspective might discount the importance of their own feelings of connectedness with their mothers; perceptions of connectedness would then emerge as a less significant predictor of APMSE as compared with mothers’ perception of connectedness. However, in this model, although mother’s perceived connectedness had a direct and protective effect on sexual initiation at Wave 2 for the AAPI group, it was not significant for the HA group.</p>
<p>These differences seem to suggest that using generalized cultural values (i.e., defining an ethnic group as an individualistic or collective culture) to categorize or interpret cultural groups’ health behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659612452669">Brewer &amp; Chen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043659612452669">Oyserman, Coon, &amp; Kemmelmeier, 2002</xref>) may not be appropriate, whereas other factors related to family cultural socialization (e.g., the transmission of family values and expectations) may be important. It is possible that the unique cultural influences transferred from one generation to another generation may be deduced by examining how expectations in younger generations are shaped by interactions with their parents in the context of their cultural background. In the AAPI–CA model, for example, the significant mediation effects of APMSE at Wave 1 suggest an effect of mothers’ perceived connectedness on delaying their adolescents’ sexual initiation.</p>
<p>Congruent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043659612452669">Miller et al.’s (1998)</xref> findings with AA adolescents, AA adolescents’ perceived general communication was significantly and positively related to adolescents’ perceived expectancy at Wave 2 and indirectly related to later sexual initiation at Wave 2. This exclusive finding signifies the uniqueness of one’s cultural and familial strength. Adolescents with different cultural backgrounds may have different ways of developing, perceiving, or interpreting their parents’ expectations from day-to-day general communication. It is possible that AA adolescents may respond better to general communication with their mothers and do not mistake general communication (i.e., talking about school work and other non-sex-related daily activities) as a permissive parental attitude toward sex. As such, promoting general communication between AA mothers and adolescents may be more effective compared with general communication in other racial and ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Although there were no significant differences between the AAPI and other racial/ethnic groups, the effects of adolescents’ perceived connectedness varied across three comparison models. In the comparison models with AA and CA adolescents, adolescents’ perceived maternal connectedness emerged as a protective factor for sexual initiation at both waves; however, this was not the case in the comparison model with HA adolescents. This variation may be the result of different cultural aspects of how adolescents perceive connectedness with their mothers. It also is possible that adolescents from recently emigrated families (e.g., HAs and AAPIs) emphasize collective cultural perspectives, perhaps as part of their adaptation mechanism in the host country, and are consequently less likely to stress the importance of individualized connectedness with their mothers. Therefore, it would be important to consider acculturation influences with newly immigrant populations. In fact, our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043659612452669">Kao, Loveland-Cherry, Guthrie, &amp; Caldwell, 2010</xref>) found significant acculturation influences (as measured by the length of residency and language spoken at home) on AAPI adolescents’ interactions with their mothers and their sexual initiation.</p>
<p>Although these three plausible models revealed several important cultural variations in maternal influences, there are several limitations to this secondary data analysis. Since the data were not originally collected (or designed) for this research study, it is possible that the measures of the latent constructs were not as reliable as expected (e.g., the low alphas for F2 and F3). Although the items used in the Add Health questionnaire were selected from several validated instruments, it would be important for future study to further examine the contents of each latent construct, particularly for validity in qualitative studies. Second, APMSE is a promising but fairly new construct and should be further explored to verify its configuration and influences on sexual behaviors. Future studies will need to develop a psychometrically sound instrument to fully measure adolescents’ perceived parental expectancy (including those of fathers) and its relationship with adolescents’ sexual attitudes and behaviors. Third, although the sample size of each group was large enough to have sufficient power to generate acceptable results, the great differences in sample sizes between the reference and comparison groups may have generated results more likely to lean toward the larger comparison group. Direct comparison among all three models in this study would be misleading and should be viewed with caution. Fourth, to maintain consistency, family socioeconomic status was not included in the comparison modeling because of its lack of significance with the AAPI population in the a priori model. Some of the unexplained variations might be related to socioeconomic differences across cultural groups. Finally, how adolescents perceive their mothers’ sexual expectations may vary by gender. Gender comparisons among different racial/ethnic groups are needed to delineate the construct of perceived expectancy before it can be translated into practice.</p>
<p>In summary, the findings of this study support the importance of family connectedness between mother and child. Nursing practices that promote adolescents’ sexual health should not be limited to encouraging mother–adolescent sexual discussion; rather, nurses should aim to increase positive maternal influences by promoting mother–adolescent connectedness and adolescents’ perceived maternal sexual expectancy. When parents do talk with their adolescents about sex, they should focus on conveying clear and objective expectations about when and under what circumstances the adolescents might engage in sexual activities. Family interventions that aim to delay adolescents’ sexual debut should focus on helping parents positively, clearly, and objectively deliver their sexual expectations to their children.</p>
<p>Ultimately, although some differences were observed among the studied racial and ethnic groups, the importance of maternal influences on adolescents’ sexual initiation was consistent across groups. Nursing interventions to promote maternal involvement should be tailored to reflect cross-cultural differences and focus on the family’s unique cultural beliefs, values, strengths, and connectedness.</p>
