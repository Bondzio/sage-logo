<abstract>
<p>This study examined the relationship between public relations and social marketing in a nonprofit health organization. A case study was conducted, in which internal and external organizational documents, archival records, and artifacts were analyzed and four in-depth interviews were completed. Evidence showed that public relations and social marketing were integrated into the organization’s communication function. Findings provided evidence for a tactical paradigm of public relations, which emphasizes publicity and promotion, as well as a situational approach to messaging and communication functions. The organization engaged the new two-way model of symmetry through cultivating relationships and two-way dialogue. These findings suggest the importance of social marketing approaches to behavior change and relationship cultivation strategies. This case study highlights the success of social marketing initiatives, and the opportunity for social marketing and public relations to evolve together in a new media context.</p>

<body>
<p>In March 2010, the Federal Interagency Workgroup recommended the inclusion of social marketing objectives in <italic>Healthy People 2020 </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1524500412450489">Lefebvre, 2009</xref>), cementing the role of social marketing in the nation’s health. Since the 1979 Surgeon General’s report, <italic>Healthy People</italic>, these national health objectives guide the development of State and community health promotion and disease prevention programs. This landmark recommendation reified the importance of social marketing in improving health and eliminating health disparities. As social marketing flourishes on the national stage, the relationship between social marketing and public relations gains increased attention by scholars who seek to understand how these functions are understood in organizations.</p>
<p>Within health organizations, differences between social marketing techniques and public relations strategies may be difficult to elucidate. A number of health organizations demonstrate a public relations function while simultaneously applying social marketing techniques to achieve behavioral outcomes. A gap exists in the literature describing whether and how social marketing strategies interact with public relations. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1524500412450489">Morgan and Hunt (1994)</xref>, relationship marketing is the establishment, development, and maintenance of successful relational exchanges in commercial marketing. Scholars suggest that relationship marketing is the new dominant worldview of marketing, which privileges the cocreation of value through relationship building and a customer-centric approach to organizational operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1524500412450489">Vargo &amp; Lusch, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524500412450489">Hastings (2003)</xref> argued that relationship marketing is an important development in commercial marketing that has been overlooked by social marketers. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1524500412450489">Wood (2008)</xref>, social marketing theory and practice must be reconsidered as a result of important developments in commercial marketing, such as relationship marketing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412450489">Desai (2009)</xref> described the importance of applying relationship marketing to the field of social marketing through the use of customer relationship management and employing web 2.0 tools, such as blogs, wikis, and social networks. Social marketers perceive relationship marketing as the building, maintaining, and sustaining of trusted relationships with target audiences, which offers substantial value to social marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524500412450489">Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1524500412450489">Schwartz, 2007</xref>). Despite the value of relationship marketing, the field of social marketing faces significant obstacles in applying these principles to health campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412450489">Desai, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524500412450489">Hastings, 2003</xref>), including ethical considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1524500412450489">Wood, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Grunig provides a novel approach to apply principles of relationship marketing to social marketing using the expanded new two-way model of symmetry, which emphasizes cultivating relationships with publics. In 1995, Dozier, Grunig, and Grunig encouraged public relations practitioners to use symmetrical principles to achieve ethical exchanges with publics. Then, in 2002, they challenged marketers to adopt these symmetrical principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524500412450489">Grunig, Grunig, &amp; Dozier, 2002</xref>). In this way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524500412450489">Grunig (2006)</xref> suggested that public relations symmetry theory could contribute to marketing practice by moving “beyond the messaging, publicity, and asymmetrical communication common in marketing communication and use our theories to develop symmetrical principles of cultivating relationships with consumers” (p. 170).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to discover how health communication professionals understand social marketing and public relations. In particular, this analysis explored the relationship between social marketing and public relations to fill a gap in the communication literature. The premise in this study was that the new, two-way model of symmetry is situational and problem-specific. In conjunction with recent theoretical advances, nonprofit health organizations might use the new two-way model of symmetry to think strategically about publics and the need to form relationships with them. By providing a case illustration of the ways that social marketing and public relations compete and interact, this study explores how and why these fields work together.</p>

<title>Description of the Organization</title>
<p>Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) provides an exemplar case to study how public relations (including the new two-way symmetry model) and social marketing function to achieve organizational objectives. As an international organization with national, state, and local branches, the trail of the philosophy, strategy, and practice of social marketing and public relations was easily identifiable and traceable. Between 2003 and 2008, Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), Inc. employed a director of social marketing at the national level. The director of social marketing was enlisted to “increase mature, respectful public talk about sexuality and increase healthy sexual behavior in the U.S.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524500412450489">Dunlevy, 2003</xref>, p. 43). The director of social marketing succeeded in leading local and national social marketing initiatives and educating PPFA staff about social marketing. In 2008, a reconfiguration of communication duties at PPFA led to the decentralization of social marketing functions to the Departments of media relations and new media.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood serves as an example of a health organization with excellent communication and public relations. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1524500412450489">Miller (2008)</xref>, Planned Parenthood’s approach in framing the abortion debate reflects the organization’s symmetrical view of public relations (p. 23). PPFA provides a three-pronged approach to women’s health care, including medical care, education, and advocacy. PPFA maintains national offices in New York City and Washington, DC, and 88 independent local and state affiliates that operate more than 840 health centers throughout the United States. PPFA is the nation’s leading sexual and reproductive health care provider and advocate serving women, men, teens, and families. More than 3 million women and men in the United States visit Planned Parenthood affiliate health centers each year. Planned Parenthood has more than 4 million activists, supporters, and donors working for women’s health and safety and fundamental reproductive rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1524500412450489">Planned Parenthood Federation of America, 2007</xref>–2008).</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The purpose of this literature review is to provide conceptual definitions of public relations, symmetry, and the promise of a relationship between social marketing and public relations. The research also highlights the challenges faced in forging this new relationship and the necessity for a greater understanding of the ways in which practitioners make meaning of social marketing and public relations. In addition, this literature review provides a foundation for studying the relationship between social marketing and public relations at PPFA.</p>
<sec id="section3-1524500412450489">
<title>Public Relations</title>
<p>There are many definitions of public relations and myriad ways that organizations shape the public relations function. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524500412450489">Grunig and Hunt (1984)</xref>, public relations is “the management of communication between an organization and its publics” (p. 6). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524500412450489">Dozier et al. (1995)</xref> emphasize the strategic role of public relations practitioners in excellent organizations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500412450489">Coombs (2001)</xref> focuses on the link between organizations and publics, where public relations is “the use of communication to manage relationships between an organization and its stakeholders” (p. 106). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524500412450489">Heath (2001)</xref> expands the role of relationships in public relations: “public relations is the management function that rhetorically adapts organizations to people’s interests and people’s interests to organizations by co-creating meaning and co-managing cultures to achieve mutually beneficial relationships” (p. 36). In addition to managing relationships, scholars highlight public relations’ strategic role and practical function. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412450489">Botan and Taylor (2004)</xref>:<disp-quote>
<p>The field of public relations is developing into a theoretically based area of applied communication that has the potential to reform several areas of communication/mass communication and to offer theoretic and conceptual tools useful to health, risk, and political communication, among others. (p. 645)</p>
</disp-quote>These definitions offer a variety of perspectives of the public relations function, including a focus on relationships and applied contributions to health communication.</p>

<title>The New Two-Way Model of Symmetry</title>
<p>Scholars have investigated the ways that an organization manages and builds relationships with its publics. The traditional view of public relations involves one-way communication through publicity. Building on this approach, the two-way asymmetrical model relies on audience research to persuade or deceive publics to accept the organization’s position. The two-way symmetrical model offers an ethical alternative; however, it privileges the public’s position above the organization.</p>
<p>The new two-way model of symmetry describes the ways that an organization can interact with its publics, incorporating asymmetrical and symmetrical tactics as found in organizations with excellent public relations practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524500412450489">Dozier, Grunig, &amp; Grunig, 1995</xref>). The new two-way model of symmetry builds on previous models of symmetry and asymmetry to more accurately reflect the reality of public relations practice. Ideally, public relations practitioners use symmetrical and asymmetrical communication to move publics and the organization to a win–win zone. In this way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524500412450489">Dozier et al. (1995)</xref> allow for the use of asymmetrical tactics to achieve symmetrical goals. The new two-way model of symmetry seeks to build long-term relationships with publics, while allowing strategic situational responses.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524500412450489">Kent and Taylor (2002)</xref> reinforced the importance of the model to improve organizational effectiveness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1524500412450489">Plowman (1998)</xref> developed the mixed motive model of public relations, which “deals with degrees of each over the spectrum of asymmetrical and symmetrical communication” (p. 246). Most recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1524500412450489">Porter (2010)</xref> urged researchers to move beyond the two-way model of symmetry toward a postsymmetrical theory of public relations, elevating the effects of public relations and focusing on audiences. Finally, Grunig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524500412450489">2006</xref>) built on the two-way model, arguing, “I now believe that the concept of relationship cultivation strategies is the heir to the models of public relations and the two-way symmetrical model, in particular” (p. 168). In this way, the new two-way model of symmetry and the cultivation of relationships align the goals of public relations more closely with social marketing.</p>

<title>Social Marketing</title>
<p>Social marketing offers a systematic, multidisciplinary framework to develop best practices in health communication research and practice. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524500412450489">Homel and Carroll (2009)</xref>, “one of the most well developed and empirically grounded frameworks for systematically analyzing and implementing a process for transferring evidence-based knowledge into action can be found within the principles of the social marketing approach” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524500412450489">Homel &amp; Carroll, 2009</xref>, p. 2). This approach provides a distinctive focus on audiences and marketing solutions that offers an improved roadmap for health communication research and practice. By elevating the needs and wants of the audience, social marketers are able to design the most effective health communication campaigns. Social marketing shifts the focus away from “expert” solutions that fail to resonate with audiences. A social marketing approach provides a more robust framework for health communication initiatives.</p>
<p>Social marketing offers a socioecological model for change agents to tackle a range of complex social issues. Social marketing offers evidence-based, tested approaches to changing individual behavior (downstream) and macro-level (upstream) development and social change<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1524500412450489">1</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524500412450489">Gordon, McDermott, Stead, &amp; Angus, 2006</xref>). In the United States, governmental agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and nonprofit organizations, such as the American Legacy Foundation, successfully implemented social marketing initiatives, such as the truth<sup>®</sup> campaign to promote smoking cessation, the VERB<sup>TM</sup> campaign to increase physical activity (Huhman, Heitzler, &amp; Wong, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524500412450489">2004</xref>), and initiatives to increase fruit and vegetable consumption, promote breastfeeding, and influence a host of other behaviors (Grier &amp; Bryant, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500412450489">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Social marketing is a multidisciplinary field that relies on an open theoretical framework to solve today’s most difficult social challenges, such as poverty, health disparities, climate change, and crime. Public health professionals were among the first practitioners of social marketing, and campaigns to increase contraceptive use were among the first successful initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500412450489">Harvey, 1999</xref>). Early social marketing efforts proved effective in the development goals of developing countries. In particular, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank led successful social marketing initiatives to promote family planning. Social marketing has been used to address diverse social problems, including poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1524500412450489">Kotler &amp; Lee, 2009</xref>), health disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1524500412450489">Thomas, 2009</xref>), injury prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1524500412450489">Smith, 2006</xref>), climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524500412450489">Fuller et al., 2010</xref>), and crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500412450489">Andreasen, 2006</xref>). In developed countries, social marketing initiatives have successfully improved heart health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500412450489">Baker, 2002</xref>), physical activity (Huhman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524500412450489">2004</xref>), mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500412450489">Donovan &amp; Henley, 2010</xref>), and environmental advocacy and awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524500412450489">Landers, Mitchell, Smith, Lehman, &amp; Conner, 2006</xref>), among others.</p>
<p>Social marketing offers a unifying framework that incorporates insight and best practices for applied scholarship from a variety of disciplines. Social marketing develops solutions to public health challenges by targeting communities, policy makers, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and even for-profit corporations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412450489">Bhattacharya &amp; Elsbach, 2002</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524500412450489">French and Blair-Stevens (2010)</xref>, “social marketing is a dynamic interdisciplinary cross-sector approach to creating social good” (p. 42). By incorporating concepts from psychology, sociology, anthropology, public health, political science, and communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500412450489">Donovan, 2011</xref>), social marketing offers a framework to address complex social, environmental, and health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1524500412450489">Kotler &amp; Zaltman, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2002, Andreasen developed six benchmark criteria for evaluating social marketing. These benchmark criteria included: (1) behavior change, (2) consumer research, (3) segmentation and targeting, (4) marketing mix, (5) exchange, and (6) competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500412450489">Andreasen, 2002</xref>). In 2010, French and Blair-Stevens developed evidence-based additions to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500412450489">Andreasen’s (2002)</xref> benchmarks, offering eight criteria for social marketing (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524500412450489">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524500412450489">French and Blair-Stevens (2010)</xref> offer four key components of social marketing: a focus on <italic>social good</italic>, <italic>behavior change</italic>, <italic>marketing techniques</italic>, and the <italic>audience </italic>(p. 34), which are described below.

<title>Social good</title>
<p>The goal of social marketing is to implement behavior change for social good. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524500412450489">French and Blair-Stevens (2010)</xref>, “social marketing’s primary purpose is to achieve a particular ‘social or public good’ (i.e., there is some benefit to individual, groups, communities, and society)” (p. 32). The social good should be defined by target audience members based on their observation of needs and might include environmental sustainability, improving public health or reducing health disparities. French and Blair-Stevens argues, “social marketing is fundamentally a user- or citizen-focused activity that seeks to develop deep contextual understanding about what will help people to choose to behave in ways that will benefit them and wider society” (pp. 42–43).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524500412450489">
<title>Marketing mix</title>
<p>The 4 Ps of marketing (product, price, place, and promotion) remain an essential component of social marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524500412450489">Hastings, 2007</xref>), but the presence of these strategies alone is not sufficient to define a social marketing initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1524500412450489">Thackeray, Neiger, &amp; Hanson, 2007</xref>). The tools of social marketing include marketing management and applied behavioral science. The 4 Ps are one technique that social marketers employ to change behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524500412450489">Andreasen, 1994</xref>). A social marketing campaign includes a product, which ranges from a tangible product to a service or a piece of information; a price, which may include a monetary cost, time, or effort; a place, such as a physical location, phone, or other locations that fit the audience’s lifestyle; and promotion, which involve communications designed to elicit action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1524500412450489">Kotler &amp; Lee, 2009</xref>, p. 196).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524500412450489">
<title>Behavior change</title>
<p>Social marketing may be differentiated from health communication, education, and public relations based on its foundation in exchange theory. This marketing philosophy requires an exchange to increase benefits and decrease barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1524500412450489">Rothschild, 1999</xref>). In a social marketing framework, it is essential to tailor messages to the audience’s unique needs. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1524500412450489">Lefebvre (2011)</xref>, “social marketing aims for aggregated behavior change—priority segments of the population or markets, not individuals, are the focus” of social marketing programs (p. 55). In addition to exchange theory, a host of behavior change theories and models guide social marketing practitioners. Behavior change theories seek to understand the predictors of human behavior. Social marketing and health communication campaign planners often pick and choose among a host of behavior change theories and models to develop health messages and design interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1524500412450489">Maibach, Abroms, &amp; Marosits, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1524500412450489">Noar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1524500412450489">Smith, 2004</xref>). The most commonly used behavior change models and theories in social marketing include the health belief model, the theory of reasoned action/theory of planned behavior, social cognitive theory, transtheoretical (stages of change) model, and diffusion of innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1524500412450489">Lefebvre, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Audience</title>
<p>The field of social marketing continues to differentiate itself from other education, promotion, or communication functions by focusing on the audience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500412450489">French (2010)</xref> argues that the role of social marketing is to provide “services and interventions being driven by a desire to meet citizens’ needs and not needs defined solely by experts” (p.4). In addition, government and nongovernmental officials may be the audience of a social marketing initiative. Since many behaviors are a function of both individual and societal properties, “social marketing recognizes that policymakers and organizations need to be targeted in order to successfully effect change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1524500412450489">Truss, Marshall, &amp; Blair-Stevens, 2010</xref>, p. 23). Ultimately, desired behaviors are determined by the audience through formative research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524500412450489">French and Blair-Stevens (2010)</xref> argues that social marketing can “refocus the delivery of public service from an overdominance of expert opinion to one that is also informed and shaped by the public’s view and what users of public services and interventions say will help them” (pp. 42–43).</p>
<p>Lefebvre and Flora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1524500412450489">1988</xref>) suggests that social marketing “has the potential of reaching the largest possible group of people at the least cost with the most effective, consumer-satisfying program” (p. 301). He draws this conclusion based on a number of obstacles that traditional intervention efforts confront, including the limitations of individual counseling, the difficulty of disseminating health education methods to “hard-to-reach” groups, and the lack of necessary resources and technology to enact long-lasting behavior change. Social marketing addresses these challenges by involving the audience in the planning and execution of behavior change campaigns.</p>

<title>Social Marketing and Public Relations</title>
<p>The dynamic relationship between marketing and public relations continues to evolve, especially amid constant technological developments. The place of marketing and public relations in organizations remains fluid as departments organize and reorganize around technological advances. Public relations and marketing scholars continue to negotiate their roles in this environment. Grunig, Grunig and Dozier (2002) argued, “excellent public relations departments integrate their programs, do not sublimate them to marketing or other organizational functions, and base their communication programs on strategic and symmetrical ideals rather than message-only, asymmetrical views of communication” (p. 281). Grunig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524500412450489">2007</xref>) remains wary of marketing attempts to subsume public relations: “I resist attempts to make public relations a marketing function or part of the marketing mix . . . Both are critical organizational functions, and sublimation of one to the other reduces the contribution of each” (p. 28). Weiner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1524500412450489">2007</xref>) responds to Grunig’s concern: “there’s the practical matter of how PR functions in reality. I think a CEO would not view the question so much in terms of “sublimation,” but in terms of doing what it takes to get the job done” (p. 28). Weiner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1524500412450489">2007</xref>) continues, “rather than PR disappearing, I see it augmenting the great things for which we’re [PR professionals] already recognized by showing how dominant we are in the field of marketing. I would suggest that everyone in PR learn more about marketing mix modeling” (p. 28).</p>
<p>One approach to unifying an organization’s public relations and marketing functions involves integrated marketing communication (IMC). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1524500412450489">Smith (2008b)</xref>, “integrated marketing communication (IMC) is a strategic approach to corporate communication that entails the coordination of all company communications to present a harmonious and consistent message to consumers and publics” (p. 3). IMC proposes a mix of communication strategies to target specific audiences for maximum message impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412450489">Cornelissen &amp; Lock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524500412450489">Kim, Han, &amp; Schultz, 2004</xref>; Kitchen, Brignell, Tao, &amp; Jones, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1524500412450489">2004</xref>; Weiner &amp; Bender, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1524500412450489">2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524500412450489">Grunig, Grunig and Dozier (2002)</xref>, this may be too simple of a distinction; instead, they describe the scholarly shift from integrated marketing communication to integrated communication (IC): “dropping the “M” from “IMC” expanded the definition to include stakeholders other than consumers and dropped the inference that public relations was a marketing function” (p. 269).</p>
<p>In the 2008 article, Dangerous Liaisons or Perfect Match? Public Relations and Social Marketing, McKie and Toledano argue for the marriage of public relations and social marketing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1524500412450489">McKie and Toledano (2008)</xref> suggest that both disciplines would benefit from working together and potentially joining together in a more permanent arrangement. McKie and Toledano that social marketers often complete public relations tasks and marketers could benefit from the assistance of public relations professionals, who would be more experienced and effective at completing these activities. On the other hand, public relations could benefit from social marketing’s focus on the client and providing benefits in terms of behavior change. According to McKie and Toledano, public relations professionals could learn from social marketing’s ethical and social focus. Similarly, public relations maintains a stronger academic and professional reputation than social marketing, based on the number of academic conferences, journals, university departments, and funding that is available to public relations professionals. In this way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1524500412450489">McKie and Toledano (2008)</xref> contend that social marketing would benefit from the academic and professional foundation of public relations.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The case study method allows researchers to examine a phenomenon that is ongoing, such as an organization’s structure and culture. This method allows for a holistic investigation into theory and the ways that individuals make meaning of contemporary events. The case study method provides a realistic approach in an organizational setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1524500412450489">Yin, 2009</xref>). Although results from the case study method cannot be generalized to larger populations, findings advance theory development and contribute to in-depth understandings of the field. Qualitative methods were essential to understanding how individuals understand and perform public relations and social marketing functions in an organization. In-depth interviews allowed participants to describe their work and discuss the meaning of public relations and social marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1524500412450489">Rubin &amp; Rubin, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section13-1524500412450489">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>This case study relied on a combination of interviewing and document analysis. Initially, access to the organization was gained through the Media Relations Specialist, who was selected for an in-depth interview based on a convenience sample of employees at the organization. To broaden the interview sample, purposive and snowball sampling allowed each of the research participants to recommend the names of other employees who were directly responsible for creating, implementing, and communicating about social marketing initiatives. Purposive and snowball sampling are nonprobability sampling techniques, which allow researchers to recruit participants based on specific criteria, such as job function, that is not readily apparent outside the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524500412450489">Berg, 2009</xref>). Specifically, the duties of the former social marketing director were integrated into the roles of the National Media Director, the Media Director for Public Policy and Advocacy, and the Director of New Media Content. In total, four individuals participated in one-on-one in-depth interviews: the National Media Director, the Media Director for Public Policy and Advocacy, the Director of New Media Content, and the Media Relations Specialist. Three individuals worked in the Washington D.C. office in the Media Relations Department of PPFA and one individual worked in the New York City, N.Y. office as the Director of New Media Content. Despite the different geographic locations, these two offices are considered one national office in terms of strategic communication decision making and authority.</p>
<p>The interviews lasted 90 minutes on average. Two interviews took place at a location jointly determined by the participants and researcher, and two interviews were completed over the telephone. Participants were informed of the researcher’s wish to audiotape the interview for purposes of accuracy. All participation was voluntary, and participants were notified that they could withdraw from participation at any time. Participants signed Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved consent forms prior to the start of the interview. A semistructured question guide facilitated discussion during the interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1524500412450489">Rubin &amp; Rubin, 2005</xref>). After some general questions about daily working routines and tasks, participants answered questions about public relations and social marketing, such as “How would you define public relations?” “Could you tell me about a social marketing project that you are working on?” and “How do social marketing and public relations fit together in your organization?”</p>
<p>The document analysis portion of the study involved an analysis of documentation, archival records, and physical artifacts, such as the website, newsletters, annual reports, promotional items (such as brochures and flyers), and internal documents provided with the consent of the organizational leader and other employees. In addition to internal and publicly available documents, a media analysis was conducted by searching Lexis-Nexis for the terms “social marketing,” “public relations,” and PPFA.</p>
<p>In most cases, the document analysis was limited to a 1-year period between January 2009–2010. Online sources included the PPFA website (http://www.plannedparenthood.org/), the Planned Parenthood Action Center Website (http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/), Planned Parenthood on Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/PlannedParenthood), Planned Parenthood Action Center Twitter (http://twitter.com/ppact), Planned Parenthood My Space (http://www.myspace.com/plannedparenthood), Planned Parenthood on YouTube, Dr. Vanessa Cullins' podcast, Get Yourself Tested Website (http://gytnow.org), Get Yourself Tested Twitter (http://twitter.com/gyt09), and the Social Marketing Institute e-mail Listserv (http://www.social-marketing.org/). These online resources were able to provide a variety of items, including newsletters, press releases, action alerts, annual reports, and personal communications. Lexis Nexis was also used to locate five news stories related to Planned Parenthood and social marketing during 2009–2010. A number of internal documents were also made available for analysis, including “The Strategy Behind Planned Parenthood Online,” “Planned Parenthood in the Spotlight: Planned Parenthood Fights for Affordable Birth Control,” “GYT09: Campaign Outreach Kit,” and “2008 Survey Findings on Women Voters Analysis.”</p>

<sec id="section14-1524500412450489">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The data analysis relied on the theoretical propositions that guided the development of the case study. These theoretical propositions include the use of public relations functions, such as the new two-way model of symmetry to cultivate relationships and an IC function that includes social marketing. Based on these theoretical propositions, pattern matching was used to compare the emerging patterns from data collection with predicted patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1524500412450489">Yin, 2009</xref>). Interviews and documents were coded to identify key patterns from the data. Specifically, open coding and axial coding was used to code data line by line to identify emergent themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500412450489">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). These themes, or patterns, emerged after studying the interviews and the documents, grouping the findings, and comparing patterns to the initial theoretical propositions suggested at the beginning of the study. When a pattern emerged, alternative explanations were sought in both interviews and documents. The use of memos and observer comments throughout the data collection and analysis process maintained reflexivity and identified emerging concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1524500412450489">Rubin &amp; Rubin, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>PPFA has successfully implemented a variety of social marketing campaigns to create social change in communities around sexual and reproductive health, including <italic>Real Life. Real Talk.<sup>®</sup> </italic>and <italic>ManPhone.</italic> The <italic>Real Life. Real Talk. </italic>social marketing campaign was piloted in four communities and rigorous, national survey evaluation indicated that the initiative proved successful in meeting objectives, such as reducing stigma and shame around healthy sexuality and increasing openness, acceptance, and engagement around sexual health (Brookes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500412450489">2010</xref>). During the period of this case study, PPFA engaged in one national social marketing campaign: “GYT” (Get Yourself Tested).</p>
<sec id="section16-1524500412450489">
<title>Research Question 1</title>
<p>PPFA integrated public relations and social marketing into the organization’s communication function. Specifically, a tactical paradigm of public relations emerged, which emphasized publicity and promotion, as well as a situational approach to messaging and communication functions.</p>
<sec id="section17-1524500412450489">
<title>Integrated tactical communication</title>
<p>The predominant pattern that emerged from this study was an evolving understanding of IC with an emphasis on collaborative decision making and a focus on messaging. The Director of New Media Content described the overall goal of messaging as “right people, right time, right message.” This philosophy emphasizes an awareness of audience, context, and content. The interviews revealed a collaborative approach to message development, which recognized the expertise of employees ranging from physicians to communication professionals. According to the Media Director for Public Policy and Advocacy, content development is consistent across the organization, “mirroring the overall message, mission, and values of Planned Parenthood,” while simultaneously tailoring the approach to fit the issue and audience. According to the National Media Director, “while messages permeate across the country, the message can’t always be universal: what works in New York City won’t always work in Wichita, Kansas.” With affiliates in every state, the national communication staff collaborates with local and state offices to give advice, seek input, and develop messages in the local community. According to the Media Relations Specialist, “sometimes national spokespeople step back and other times affiliates refer back to PPFA.” According to the Director for Public Policy and Advocacy, the affiliates also play an important role in discovering real-life “stories to help propel our message.”</p>
<p>At Planned Parenthood, social marketing is primarily understood in the context of IC. The National Media Director described “GYT” as a “public information campaign” that “married social marketing with traditional media relations strategies.” This perspective reflects PPFA’s IC strategy. The Director of New Media Content described the overarching goals of the “GYT” campaign as raising awareness, encouraging testing, and reducing the overall stigma associated with getting tested for sexually transmitted infections. The GYT09 Campaign Outreach Kit highlights a number of strategies and tactics that PPFA used to integrate public relations and social marketing. The “GYT” campaign provided the opportunity for PPFA to reach out to new audiences and firmly establish the organization as the leading provider of trusted, reliable sexual health information and services. To provide community-level support for the campaign, promotional materials, including posters, buttons, stickers, and compilation reels were provided nationwide at PPFA’s network of health centers.</p>
<p>PPFA earned media through “Burma Shave” action events to attract attention and raise awareness of the campaign. “Burma Shave” refers to the types of roadside advertising used by the Burma Shave company starting in the 1920s. Messages included “GYT—Get Yourself Tested at Planned Parenthood!” and “Honk if you love Planned Parenthood. Get Yourself Tested!” Other “GYT” visibility events included press conferences, lobby visits, and pub crawls to hand out condoms and safe sex information. The “GYT” campaign employed a number of new media tactics to build relationships with publics, including offering virtual GYT information online, through Facebook, Twitter, and Second Life. PPFA and local and state affiliates uploaded videos and photos to the photo-sharing site, Flickr, to promote the “GYT” campaign. The campaign also hosted a mobile companion to www.GYT09.org, the GYT short code (49809), which offers details about local testing locations by texting a zip code.</p>
<p>PPFA partnered with MTV and the Kaiser Family Foundation to create this social marketing campaign. In March 2009, the campaign used “guerilla” viral marketing tactics by introducing the acronym, “GYT” and asking, “What do you think GYT means?” Public Service Announcements featuring celebrities and Twitter feeds generated anticipation for the campaign. On April 1, 2009, the world premiere of the MTV movie, <italic>Pedro</italic> kicked off the GYT campaign. According to the internal campaign documents:<disp-quote>
<p>The goal of GYT09 is to generate buzz, remove the taboo and stigma about getting tested, and get young people talking about STD testing in a comfortable way. GYT is a call to action that will become part of young people’s vernacular, like OMG, and LOL . . . now introducing GYT. (GYT09: Campaign Outreach Kit)</p>
</disp-quote>This campaign integrated traditional public relations publicity and promotion, in the form of “buzz,” with new media strategies designed to facilitate a national conversation about sexuality and STD testing. PPFA press releases, as well as external news stories cited increased testing rates (i.e., behavior change) as an indicator of success for this social marketing campaign. “GYT” evidenced the 4Ps: product included an STD test and the benefits of getting tested; price included the monetary and psychological cost of getting tested; place included testing centers across the country; and promotion involved the new media and publicity described above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1524500412450489">
<title>Beyond ads</title>
<p>The simple and pervasive mission of the organization guided the messaging decisions. The interviewees described the importance of “getting the message out,” “repeat, repeat, repeat,” “rapid response,” and “message discipline.” Above all, the goal in all messages is to convey the “importance of women’s health.” According to the Media Specialist, a recent goal has been to “counteract the idea in the public space that Planned Parenthood is all about abortion.” In choosing outlets for these messages, the Media Director for Public Policy and Advocacy describes the process as “open, but selective,” when faced with conservative media outlets. An important part of the process of getting the message out is through third-party “independent validators.”</p>
<p>The GYT social marketing campaign relied on the public relations strategy of employing a third-party “independent validator” using the CDC’s 2008 announcement that at least one in four teenage girls has an STD and by the age of 25, one in two sexually active young people will contract an STD (http://www.cdc.gov/STD). This campaign evidenced integration of social marketing into the overall communication and public relations function. Currently, PPFA is rebranding the campaign as “GYT NOW” and has launched an ongoing, year round social marketing campaign, offering free or low-cost testing in combination with marketing and advertising to increase testing rates for STDs.</p>
<p>According to Rebecca <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524500412450489">Brookes (2010)</xref>, former social marketing director at PPFA, the community-based social marketing initiative the <italic>ManPhone</italic> incorporated all elements of the marketing mix, including:<disp-quote>
<p>…community partners; free or low-cost condoms available in non-traditional locations (e.g., at the co-op); special hours for young men at health centers; peer educators who made themselves available at local hang outs like bars and garages; a confidential hotline with information about men's sexual health with scripts written by the young men themselves; and promotion including online, TV, radio, &amp; bar posters.

<title>Research Question 2</title>
<p>PPFA engaged the new two-way model of symmetry through cultivating relationships and two-way dialogue. The new media context emerged as an opportunity for social marketing and public relations to evolve together.</p>
<sec id="section20-1524500412450489">
<title>Cultivating relationships</title>
<p>PPFA employed the new two-way model of symmetry through a strong commitment to cultivating relationships and providing mechanisms for two-way communication. The interviews and documents revealed an integrated approach to reaching customers and understanding their needs and wants through research. Each of the interviewees discussed “clients,” or “consumers,” which included patients, potential patients, affiliates (e.g., medical providers/staff), volunteers/activists, and reporters. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524500412450489">Brookes (2010)</xref>, “And this is what I love about social marketing: we as the practitioners come away as changed as the audience as a result of our learning.”</p>
<p>Coalition building among pro-choice groups, such as NARAL, Pro-Choice America, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the Black Women’s Health Imperative, is also an important part of PPFA’s relationship cultivation. PPFA collaborates with like-minded groups to form a cohesive coalition for reproductive justice. According to the National Media Director, “we communicate with as many audiences as we can, to let them know that Planned Parenthood is there for them in their daily lives.” The Media Relations Specialist echoes this sentiment, “when people know who we are, we don’t need to persuade them.”</p>
<p>The Director of New Media Content discussed the organization’s emphasis on research and “listening to the audience.” The interviewees and internal documents described focus group research, web analytics, and online interactive research to determine “what’s working and what’s not working,” for their clients. PPFA relies on research in their practice of public relations, reflecting a new two-way model of symmetry approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1524500412450489">
<title>Two-way dialogue</title>
<p>Guided by these principles, PPFA cultivates relationships through a commitment to two-way communication. The organization fosters two-way relationships by ensuring accuracy and truthfulness in messaging. According to the National Media Director, “public relations is not a way to ‘spin’” a story, instead, PPFA is dedicated to providing information quickly and accurately, while constantly fact-checking and ensuring ethical practices. According to the Media Relations Specialist, “there is the notion that ‘the public’ is somehow separate from those who use Planned Parenthood.” To counter this idea, PPFA created a variety of spaces for dialogue, such as Facebook and MySpace, where comments are welcomed, in order to allow people’s stories and voices to speak for themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1524500412450489">
<title>New media</title>
<p>PPFA confirmed their reputation as a visionary organization when they recruited a director of social marketing in 2003. Since that time, PPFA created a New Media Division. According to the National Media Director, the New Media Division, “is not a technical role, it is content-driven, communicating with an audience.” The Director of New Media Content mirrors this view, describing her role as “a little bit social marketing, public relations, and direct response.”</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood has begun the integration of new media and social media in its communication approach. According to the Director of New Media Content, Planned Parenthood is involved in an authentic culture shift, which facilitates “more robust conversations between the organization and the individual.” The Media Specialist supported this view of new media as a way to reach clients and “make their voices a part of the conversation.” According to the Director of New Media Content, the culture shift is a way to “encourage, not stifle conversation online,” while simultaneously “empowering individuals to become supporters of our brand, to speak on our behalf, and to become our ambassadors.” This approach fulfills the promise of the new two-way model of symmetry.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>Planned Parenthood offers a model for organizations to integrate new media into the communication function. The focus on new media and two-way dialogue provides fertile ground to solidify the integration of social marketing and public relations. Structurally, PPFA displayed an IC function, guided by a strong and relevant mission. PPFA integrated social marketing and public relations into the communication function through a tactical approach to public relations strategies and by focusing on the audience and cultivating relationships. The case study revealed the importance of cultivating relationships through two-way communication and practicing ethical public relations. PPFA continues to employ a social marketing approach with the “GYT NOW” campaign. PPFA evidences an IC function, with a horizontal, collaborative structure, combining public relations and social marketing functions.</p>
<p>Scholars suggest the existence of a tactical paradigm for the practice of public relations. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1524500412450489">Toth (in press)</xref>, “Sha’s (2007) categorization of “tactics” helps describe more precisely the works of several scholars of media relations, media choices, and social media as tools” (p. 718). This paradigm helps explain how PPFA practices public relations. Media relations, as well as publicity and promotion, and a focus on the “message” remain a prominent focus at PPFA. However, the case study showed that practitioners relied on situational context to determine message strategy. PPFA viewed public relations as part of the overall communication function of the organization. Practitioners engaged in a variety of “tactical” techniques, including marketing, advertising, and public relations strategies, such as third-party validation.</p>
<p>PPFA evidenced social marketing practices in four ways: (1) programs and messages aimed at reproductive justice (a social good), (2) emphasis on behavior change (such as getting tested), (3) using the techniques of marketing (including the 4Ps in the “GYT” campaign), and (4) emphasis on the audience. In particular, GYT emerged as an exemplar of a social marketing campaign, which incorporated the needs and values of the audience into the campaign’s objectives. This case study revealed an opportunity for the coordination of social marketing and public relations at PPFA. As predicted by IC scholars, PPFA was in the process of renegotiating the role of communication, and in particular social marketing, due to the rapid advancement of technology. In order to organize this new technology, PPFA created a New Media Department.</p>
<p>These findings reflect the new two-way model of symmetry. PPFA evidenced the new two-way model of symmetry though cultivating relationships and two-way dialogue. While the organization conducted research to frame messages (asymmetrical), participants in this study described the open and transparent process they used to create programs and messages. Ultimately, they acknowledged that the best long-term relationships were a result of publics getting to know the organization and their mission, so that they did not have to be persuaded. PPFA also encouraged and sought opportunities for two-way dialogue with publics through new media, proving their commitment to accurate and ethical messaging.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500412450489">Botan and Hazelton (2006)</xref>, “we are confident, however, that co-creation—the idea that publics are a self-standing and often self-directing force in public relations—will be at the core of theory development in the next decade or two” (p. 13). This position reflects the social marketing approach, which privileges the voices and needs of the audience, even above experts. PPFA validates the theoretical premise that the future of symmetry rests with the cultivation of relationships, particularly in the new media era. The ethical, symmetrical practice of public relations becomes the foundation for cultivating relationships by creating a dialogic space for two-way communication at PPFA. Research and outreach provides a venue for understanding publics and engaging in the new two-way model of symmetry. New media enhances the organization’s ability to create true dialogic spaces for publics to direct the conversation and guide PPFA’s programs.</p>
<p>These findings illustrate an effective integration of social marketing and public relations guided by a commitment to relationships and understanding publics. Perhaps, one of the primary challenges to the establishment of social marketing in today’s organizations is the influx of new media. As practitioners struggle to make sense of technological advancements, the social marketing approach becomes confused with social networking and social media approaches. While social marketing, as well as public relations, must use new media to effectively engage with publics, there is a danger in the strategic approach losing focus in the new technology. As the Director of New Media Content warned, practitioners must remain “true to the medium.” These findings suggest the necessity of social marketing approaches to behavior change and relationship cultivation strategies. This case study highlights the success of social marketing initiatives, and the opportunity for social marketing and public relations to evolve together.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>The small number of interviewees may be a limitation of this study and could skew the findings and interpretations. However, by focusing on the day to day of the organization, interviewing only four people in the Media Relations and New Media Departments may have provided a comprehensive and accurate portrayal of the organization’s public relations function. Results from the case study method cannot be generalized to larger populations; however, analytical generalizations may still be made to advance theory.</p>
<p>The main question that arose from these findings is the relationship between social marketing and new media. Undoubtedly, social marketing and new media are inextricably linked. The proper use of new media is essential to the effective practice of social marketing. Further research is needed to identify where social marketing “lives” or perhaps where it should live in organizations that are constantly adapting to new technology. Research that addresses how social marketing can be most effective given its complicated relationship with public relations and new media will contribute to our understanding of IC.</p>
<p>This study contributed to the social marketing scholarly body of knowledge by bringing together public relations excellence and relationship cultivation theories, and applying them in the areas of IMC and social marketing. It also provided the first step toward greater theory development regarding social marketing and its potential influence on public relations and IMC. On a practical level, findings contributed to the understanding of public relations by helping professionals examine IC and one organization’s response to the emergence of new media, while using social marketing to achieve its behavior change goals.</p>
