<abstract>
<p>Food allergies are newly emerging health risks, and some evidence indicates that their prevalence is increasing. Public perception, however, is that the prevalence of food allergies is much greater than systematic estimates suggest. As food allergies increasingly permeate everyday life, this paper explores how associated risks are constructed through the mass media. In particular, nine years of media coverage of food allergies are analysed through the lens of issue framing and claims-making. Results show that advocates and affected individuals dominate discussions around policy action, while researchers and health professionals are diagnosing the causes of food allergy. Results also suggest that there is competition over the definition of food allergies, which may, in turn, be shaping public understanding of the related risks. There is also an indication that the framing of food allergies is evolving over time, and that the discussion is becoming increasingly one-sided with affected individuals leading the charge.</p>

<p>These headlines highlight examples of how food allergies have been framed in the Canadian media over the past decade. More and more they are recognized as risks or – perhaps more appropriately – dangers that permeate our everyday environments (e.g. churches, holidays, schools) and activities (e.g. dining out and smooching) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662510393083">Nettleton et al., 2009</xref>). Food allergies are now topics of children’s books (e.g. <italic>The Princess and the Peanut Allergy</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662510393083">McClure, 2009</xref>) and there is an abundance of available coping resources for parents of allergic children (e.g. <italic>Doctor Mom’s Prescription for Managing Food Allergies</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662510393083">Malhotra-Kuczabski, 2009</xref>). Other notable publications include a recent book documenting the self-described <italic>epidemic</italic> of peanut allergy we are currently experiencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662510393083">Fraser, 2010</xref>). In the Canadian context, a national advocacy group dedicated to helping people live with deadly allergies was instrumental in having May declared “Food Allergy Awareness Month” by the federal government in the spring of 2010. Each of the above examples illustrates how food allergies have emerged as increasingly important public health risks.</p>
<p>Estimates vary, but the most recently established prevalence rates indicate that food allergies affect 2–5% of adults and 4–8% of children in the Western world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662510393083">Ben-Shoshan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662510393083">CDC, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662510393083">Mills et al., 2007</xref>). They typically develop in early childhood, and reactions range from mild (e.g. itchy throat, hives) to potentially fatal anaphylactic reactions that affect the respiratory and cardiovascular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510393083">Health Canada, 2009</xref>). The causes of food allergy remain a mystery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662510393083">Schneider Chafen et al., 2010</xref>), and there is some strong evidence to suggest that incidence is increasing, particularly so in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510393083">Grundy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662510393083">Sicherer et al., 2003</xref>). However, apparent increases are the object of some debate in the growing scientific literature related to food allergy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662510393083">Ben-Shoshan et al., 2009</xref>). Previous work on the public understanding of the risks associated with food allergies has found that <italic>perceived</italic> prevalence rates often exceed 30%, far surpassing systematic estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510393083">Harrington et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662510393083">Rona et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite a lack of consensus with respect to prevalence, perceptions of risk associated with food allergy have prompted varied management responses, and these too have been the subject of debate in both the literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662510393083">Christakis, 2008</xref>) and the popular press (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662510393083">Pearson, 2009</xref>). Solutions have most often been implemented in an effort to protect allergic children in environments outside the home, primarily by focusing on improving ingredient labelling, and providing safe school environments. In Canada, for example, the provincial government in Ontario enacted a precedent-setting law in 2006 requiring all publicly funded schools to establish and maintain strategies for managing life threatening allergies. This law was championed by Sara Shannon, the mother of a thirteen-year-old student who died of anaphylactic shock in her school’s cafeteria.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662510393083">1</xref></sup> Sabrina Shannon was an advocate for anaphylaxis education, and two years prior to her death, created a nationally aired radio documentary, “A Nutty Tale,” which described her experiences living with food allergies.</p>
<p>Under Sabrina’s Law, most schools have adopted precautionary banning of particular allergens from the schools altogether (peanuts in particular). These bans have been implemented despite a lack of consensus in the literature with respect to best management practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662510393083">Munoz-Furlong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662510393083">Schneider Chafen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963662510393083">Young et al., 2009</xref>). The efficacy of school-wide bans for preventing reactions is still unknown, but some authors suggest that they may lead to other adverse outcomes such as stigmatization, bullying, and a false sense of security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963662510393083">Young et al., 2009</xref>). More extreme criticisms have suggested that such bans may even be fuelling the (potential) increases in allergy prevalence through a feedback process. That is, banning allergens means all children in that school would be practising avoidance. This could result in sensitization to the allergen and contribute to the increasing prevalence of food allergies we appear to be experiencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662510393083">Christakis, 2008</xref>). “Allergen-free” environments (e.g. nut-free schools) have also raised some ire from the non-allergic population who believe they infringe on their rights to eat/carry any foods they wish.</p>
<p>It is important to contextualize this debate by recognizing the broader shift in the politics of food over the past several decades from issues of access and nutritional value, to issues of risk (e.g. toxins in foods, GMOs, feeding practices) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510393083">Blue, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662510393083">Pollan, 2008</xref>). Food allergies represent a new food-related risk, and as policymakers respond, the rules around eating are changing (i.e. what is and is not allowed). Food-related risk is a unique area of inquiry in that scientists, policymakers and lay publics all engage in discussions about risks and their consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662510393083">Shaw, 2002</xref>). Policies that exhibit control over food are often contentious because of the engagement of all these actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510393083">Blue, 2010</xref>). Voices from these groups may use different strategies to persuade and shape beliefs about the risks of food allergy, leading to contesting claims and counterclaims that are at once complex and emotional. In this way, there is a “wrangle in the marketplace,” whereby the ideas of different voices compete to construct the risks and consequences of food allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510393083">Heath, 2009</xref>). Much public debate occurs in the news media, and as such this paper analyses media coverage of food allergies towards an understanding of their recent emergence on the public health risk landscape.</p>
<p>In his theories on the “world risk society,” Ulrich Beck gives prominence to the mass media as privileged sites for social definition and construction of risks and their consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510393083">Beck, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662510393083">Cottle, 1998</xref>). In particular, Beck highlights the central role of the media as fora for claims-making and contestation about risk. When emerging risks are characterized by limited, uncertain, or competing scientific information (e.g. food allergies, climate change), the media can play an especially important role in shaping people’s perception of that risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662510393083">Augoustinos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510393083">Kasperson et al., 1988</xref>). Quality news sources have been recognized as being trusted sources of health risk information for the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510393083">Frewer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662510393083">Krewski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510393083">Major and Atwood, 2004</xref>). By exploring how food allergies are represented in the news media, we aim to reveal why they have become so visible in the contemporary risk society defined by the ubiquity of risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510393083">Beck, 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>2. Risk communication, risk perception, and the media</title>
<p>Primarily, the media confer legitimacy to emerging risk issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662510393083">Powell et al., 2007</xref>), and have in some cases been found to influence public health policy decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662510393083">Bomlitz and Brezis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510393083">Driedger, 2007</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662510393083">Wilson et al. (2004)</xref> describe how media reports of the theoretical risks of contracting Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease through blood resulted in a voluntary recall of blood products by the Red Cross in Canada in 1995 despite substantial economic impacts. That risks are legitimized through representation in the mass media, however, does not imply a completely decisive role in determining risk perceptions. Though this has been advocated by some (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662510393083">Combs and Slovic, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510393083">Koné and Mullet, 1994</xref>), the general consensus is that individual/societal perceptions cannot be solely attributed to the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662510393083">Augoustinos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662510393083">Powell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662510393083">Wåhlberg and Sjöberg, 2000</xref>). The <italic>Social Amplification of Risk Framework</italic> suggests that amplification and/or attenuation of risk perceptions occurs at various stages of the communication process, of which the media represent a part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510393083">Kasperson et al., 1988</xref>). That is, the meaning of a message is not universal, but dependent on socio-cultural context, social group behaviours, and the interpretation by individual audience members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662510393083">Driedger and Eyles, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>As a main conduit of risk information between experts and the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510393083">Major and Atwood, 2004</xref>), the media has had several factors conceptualized as influencing public risk perceptions through this role: volume of coverage, accuracy of reporting and how claims-making and issue framing are used to (re)construct risks. Regarding volume of coverage, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662510393083">Wåhlberg and Sjöberg (2000)</xref> found that media are diverse in their content surrounding risk events, and often not as biased as commonly thought. Alternatively, they report that risk perceptions are more strongly influenced by the amount of media coverage an issue receives. Indeed, number of media reports has been shown to be associated with amplified perceived risk in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963662510393083">Young et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510393083">Koné and Mullet, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662510393083">Combs and Slovic, 1979</xref>). This phenomenon aligns with the availability heuristic, a theory which suggests that increased exposure to an issue can facilitate risk recall, which inflates related perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963662510393083">Tversky and Kahneman, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the responsibility as an informal risk communicator, the media are often charged as problematic in this role given that their mandate is based on increasing readership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963662510393083">Wakefield and Elliott, 2003</xref>). With this end goal, media coverage may focus on the <italic>newsworthy</italic> qualities of an issue. Newsworthy stories about risk focus on the rarity or the exceptional nature of a hazard, or stories may be newsworthy because media professionals see the risks as emotionally arousing due to their economic, political, or cultural relevance (e.g. children with potentially fatal food allergies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510393083">McCarthy et al., 2008</xref>). Some research has shown that journalists may even inject unnecessary uncertainty or controversy into a story to make a story more newsworthy, which may amplify perceived risk in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662510393083">Combs and Slovic, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963662510393083">Trumbo (1996)</xref> outlines two fundamental issues around the construction of emerging risks through the media. The first of these resonates with Beck’s idea of the media as a forum for claims-making, and the second is related to what aspects are presented to the public as being the most important. Owing to a lack of expertise in certain subject areas, journalists will often rely on information from sources representing various stakeholder groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963662510393083">Wakefield and Elliott, 2003</xref>). Through this process, these sources are afforded a voice in constructing the issues around risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662510393083">Wåhlberg and Sjöberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662510393083">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>). As these voices make claims about risks and their consequences, the meanings of risks are continually re-formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510393083">Major and Atwood, 2004</xref>). Those sources that receive strong representation in the media have a greater chance of getting the audience to accept their message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662510393083">Driedger and Eyles, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Reliance on particular sources can also result in a reporting bias towards the qualities of issues that resonate with the sources’ particular values or philosophies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662510393083">Wåhlberg and Sjöberg, 2000</xref>). Particular aspects of a perceived reality may be selected by these claims-makers, and presented as more important. This frames the risk in a particular way, which can subsequently influence its social definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662510393083">Augoustinos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662510393083">Driedger and Eyles, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662510393083">Rock, 2005</xref>). Previous explorations of health issues in the media have highlighted the impacts of framing on public perception. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662510393083">Musso and Wakefield (2009)</xref> reported that framing of cancer in the media unfairly stigmatized the disease by adopting an overarching frame of “blaming the victim.” Similar findings have been reported with respect to obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662510393083">Hilbert and Ried, 2009</xref>). Emerging risks are characterized by scientific uncertainty and contention between different social groups. In this context, their social construction is especially malleable through claims-making activities, and framing.</p>
<p>Food allergy risk is a contentious emerging health risk, and recent appeals in the allergy literature have called for more sociological understandings of the way people think about the risks of food allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662510393083">Nettleton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662510393083">Shepherd, 2006</xref>). We hypothesize that the volume of coverage in the news media has increased over the past several decades, which may partially explain, and perhaps be echoing perceived increases in the public perception of food allergy risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510393083">Harrington et al., 2010</xref>). Further, this paper will argue that stakeholder claims-making and issue framing are central to the construction of food allergy risk, and will aim to tease out the relationships between these concepts.</p>
<p>That is, this paper explores <italic>who</italic> is saying <italic>what</italic> about food allergies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662510393083">Lasswell, 1948</xref>), by endeavouring to answer the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0963662510393083" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Is the frequency of food allergy-related news items time dependent?</p></list-item>

<title>3. Methods</title>
<p>A content analysis of 18 daily newspapers from across Canada was conducted for a nine-year period between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2008, inclusive. Newspapers were chosen as the medium for several reasons, including their known role as an agenda-setting medium in Canada, and their previously reported usefulness in exploring the coverage of emerging risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510393083">Dreidger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510393083">Hayes et al., 2007</xref>). Print news articles have also been used as proxies for news coverage through all media (e.g. television) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662510393083">Bomlitz and Brezis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510393083">Dreidger, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Newspapers were selected based on a number of criteria. Following a recent media analysis of newspaper coverage of major determinants of health in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510393083">Hayes et al., 2007</xref>), the sample reflects: a mix of corporate ownership, publication in both official languages (English and French), and both broadsheet and tabloid outlets. The final sample included the two national English language papers (<italic>Globe &amp; Mail</italic>, <italic>National Post</italic>) and 16 papers representing regional markets in Calgary (<italic>Calgary Herald</italic>, <italic>Calgary Sun</italic>), Halifax (<italic>The Chronicle-Herald</italic>), Edmonton (<italic>The Edmonton Journal</italic>), London (<italic>London Free Press</italic>), Montreal (<italic>The Gazette</italic>, <italic>La Presse Canadienne</italic>, <italic>Le Devoir</italic>), Ottawa/Hull (<italic>The Ottawa Citizen</italic>, <italic>Le Droit</italic>), Quebec City (<italic>Le Soliel</italic>), Saskatoon (<italic>The StarPhoenix</italic>), Toronto (<italic>Toronto Star</italic>, <italic>Toronto Sun</italic>), Vancouver (<italic>Vancouver Sun</italic>), and Winnipeg (<italic>Winnipeg Free Press</italic>). All Canadian provinces are represented by this sample except for Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. However, the <italic>Halifax Chronicle-Herald</italic> has the highest level of circulation from the Atlantic region, which includes these provinces. Combined market share of the selected papers as a proportion of the total national daily newspaper circulation is 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510393083">Canadian Newspaper Association, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Three online textual databases were used to draw the sample: LexisNexis Academic, Canadian Newsstand, and Eureka. All newspaper stories featuring the key search terms “food allergy,” “peanut allergy,” “allergy free,” “nut allergy,” “peanut free,” and “anaphylaxis,” or variations of these terms (e.g. food allergic, food allergies) were included in a preliminary sample of stories. Though we were interested in press related to all food allergies, peanut was searched explicitly because peanuts are among the most common food allergies, and most likely to cause anaphylactic reactions. As such, they are most often the target of policies (e.g. nut bans in schools) and appear to be at the centre of most debate in the popular press. This strategy yielded 747 stories. Recipes (<italic>n</italic> = 7), advice columns (<italic>n</italic> = 12), book/movie reviews (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and food recalls (<italic>n</italic> = 96) were removed from the database, as were articles that mentioned food allergies in passing (<italic>n</italic> = 32) (e.g. asthma-related articles with mention of food allergy as a similar condition). The final sample consisted of 598 articles.</p>
<p>Each article was coded for simple publication details as well as presence of a prevalence estimate of food allergies, assigned a unique identification number, and stored in a database. French language articles were translated using an online machine translator (Google translator) before coding. Since the goal was to perform more of a manifest content analysis versus a latent content analysis, the translated versions of the articles were sufficient, and the mechanical translator used has been recognized as an efficient tool for translating French to English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662510393083">Callison-Burch, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Frames and claims-makers</title>
<p>Frames were defined as the primary themes or ideas presented in a particular article. The article’s primary frame was most often defined by the headline and opening paragraph, and identified as the most salient aspect of the story. If the story began with an anecdote, or human interest piece, further reading may have been necessary to identify the primary frame. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662510393083">Entman (1993)</xref>, the purpose of framing is to promote problem definitions, diagnose causes, make moral judgements about actions, or suggest remedies. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963662510393083">Table 1</xref> presents the coding scheme for frames based on Entman’s theory.

<p>Claims-makers were defined as the sources of information referenced in the articles. Such sources were either individuals who had been interviewed by the journalist, or referenced material from reports, manuscripts, or statements from organizations or groups. Referenced materials most often came from advocacy groups, the food industry, academic journals, and government. Individuals were classified as advocates, affected individuals, health professionals, researchers, government representatives, and school officials. Advocates were individuals affiliated with an established advocacy group, though these individuals were often directly affected by allergies themselves, or indirectly through their children. Affected individuals were allergic adults, adolescents and children, as well as parents or relatives of allergic children. Government representatives were from government agencies, or were policymakers at municipal, provincial, or federal levels. Allergists, dieticians, and other health professionals were coded as health professionals. School officials were coded separately because of their central role in the issues or regulations surrounding provision of safe environments for allergic children. Over 90% of the groups referenced and individuals quoted were coded according to this scheme. The information for each article was appended to the database with the physical publication details and unique identifiers. The resulting database was analyzed quantitatively using R v. 2.9.0. Chi-square tests were used to answer the research questions as outlined previously.</p>

<title>4. Results</title>
<p>Of the 598 articles, 87 (14.5%) were written in French. There were no significant differences in how stories were framed depending on language of publication (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.66, <italic>p</italic> = 0.44), so French and English articles were analyzed jointly. The mean length of all articles was 458.2 words, with a minimum of 36, and a maximum length of 2948 words. 197 articles (33%) were from news sections of the newspapers, and 413 articles (69%) were classified as news items, versus 185 editorial stories. Editorials encompassed human interest stories (<italic>n</italic> = 56), personal experience stories (<italic>n</italic> = 19), or other opinion-based items including letters to the editor (<italic>n</italic> = 110). The majority of stories were written by staff writers (<italic>n</italic> = 270, 45.2%) or copied from wire services (<italic>n</italic> = 167, 27.9%).</p>
<p>The prevalence of food allergy was reported in 39.8% of the articles; however, 50% of these estimates were not reported in reference to an information source. Stories that did provide some reference for their prevalence estimates cited advocacy groups/advocates and affected individuals (<italic>n</italic> = 40, 17%), research groups/researcher and published reports (<italic>n</italic> = 40, 17%), and government websites (<italic>n</italic> = 13, 5%) most frequently. Slightly more than 80% of the articles (<italic>n</italic> = 484) had some reference to at least one source of information. Of the total articles, 70% quoted at least one individual, 30% (<italic>n</italic> = 178) referenced a group or organization (e.g. advocacy group, research group), while 9% (<italic>n</italic> = 53) referenced a government source. As individuals were overwhelmingly used as sources, they were the focus of the analysis.</p>

<p>Media coverage in terms of the distribution of articles over the collection period is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662510393083">Figure 1</xref>, stratified by article type (e.g. News versus Editorial). Chi-square tests indicated that the frequencies of news articles (χ<sup>2</sup> = 16.3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04) and editorial articles (χ<sup>2</sup> = 24.8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0017) were both dependent on the year of publication. The frequency of news articles increased across the time period, starting with 16 articles in 2000, and peaking in 2008 with 76 articles. Years with increased editorial activity typically corresponded with policy or regulatory change, a relationship that will be revisited in the discussion section of the paper.</p>

<title>Framing</title>
<p>Allergy issues were found to be framed with different frequencies at a significant level (χ<sup>2</sup> = 18.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). According to the coding scheme (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963662510393083">Table 1</xref>), 221 articles (37%) were identified as stories framed as defining food allergies as a problem. 195 (32.6%) stories were classified as suggesting remedies, followed by 124 (20.7%) framed to diagnose the causes of food allergy. Stories that primarily made moral judgements about actions and issues around food allergy were relatively less frequent (<italic>n</italic> = 58, 9.7%).</p>
<p>These results are particularly interesting when changes in the proportion of story frames are examined over the collection period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963662510393083">Figure 2</xref>). That is, stories defining food allergies as a problem have been decreasing as a proportion of the total food allergy stories since 2004. This decrease is in contrast to the growing proportion of stories focused on remedies (χ<sup>2</sup> = 33.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). We will note here that the year 2004 has significance for food allergies in the Canadian context and discuss the relevance in further detail in the following section of the paper.</p>

This was true for articles organized around defining problems (χ<sup>2</sup> = 44.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), diagnosing causes (χ<sup>2</sup> = 193.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), making moral judgements (χ<sup>2</sup> = 196.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and suggesting remedies (χ<sup>2</sup> = 47.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The most obvious relationships show that advocates and affected individuals are represented in the majority of articles framed to make moral judgements (68%) and suggest remedies (53%). Second, health professionals and researchers are most strongly represented in stories diagnosing the causes of food allergy, representing 79% of all quoted sources. Results also indicate that there are a variety of interests represented in stories framed to define food allergies as a problem.

<title>5. Discussion</title>
<p>A prominent result from the analysis relates to the overall increasing trend of articles across the collection period. Within the literature on food allergies, there is a growing perception that food allergies are a growing problem in the Western world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662510393083">Madsen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662510393083">Shepherd, 2006</xref>). This is certainly the perception of the general population, which often greatly overestimates prevalence, and ascribes a substantial level of risk to food allergies. For example, it has been reported previously that almost 70% of the general population would rank food allergies as high or moderate risks to the Canadian public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510393083">Harrington et al., 2010</xref>). Though the media can build and set policy agendas by selecting which issues get attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510393083">Driedger, 2007</xref>), they also reflect issues of contemporary interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662510393083">Nettleton et al., 2009</xref>). The nature of this relationship is unclear in this research, though it is likely a combination of the two roles. That is, the increasing coverage of food allergies could be both echoing the increasing public interest in the issue, and amplifying public perceptions of food allergy risk through the availability heuristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963662510393083">Tversky and Kahneman, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>Those years with a larger proportion of editorial articles published on the topic were typical during times of contention around regulatory action or change. For example, in 2001, Nestlé Incorporated announced that they would be closing their lone Canadian peanut-free facility which produced many packaged foods that allergic individuals had grown to recognize as safe for consumption. Following the announcement, newspapers were flooded with letters to the editor and other articles from parents of allergic children, allergic individuals, doctors, and teachers scolding Nestlé for ignoring the needs of the allergic population to adjust to the market demand for more nut- and peanut-based products. For example, concerning the decision to discontinue production in a nut-free facility:
<disp-quote>
<p>As a parent of a young child with life-threatening food allergies, I find that these products represent a degree of normalcy in our little girl’s life, which is otherwise far from normal … The sadness and disappointment my family felt, especially my daughter, upon hearing the announcement by Nestlé Canada cannot be fully understood. Our options are limited and our need to provide a safe, yet somehow normal, life for our child is paramount. [Affected Individual] (<italic>The Ottawa Citizen</italic>, May 3, 2001)</p>
<p>Isn’t it time for people to become more compassionate, especially given the fact that this allergy is on the increase? Grocery shopping is a nightmare. Wouldn’t it be more practical for Nestlé and other companies to expand their nut-free lines? [Affected Individual] (<italic>Calgary Herald</italic>, April 25, 2001)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The backlash from the affected population gained significant media attention, and within a month Nestlé reversed its decision and maintained the nut-free facility, despite increased financial costs to the company.</p>
<p>At a cursory glance, the majority of the stories were framed to define food allergies as a problem (37.0%), followed by those suggesting remedies (32.6%), diagnosing causes (20.7%), and finally making moral judgements (9.7%). However, exploring the proportion of frames over the collection period revealed a more complex relationship. In particular, since 2004 the proportion of stories framed to define problems has decreased, while the proportion of stories suggesting remedies has increased. As prefaced in the introduction to this paper, this point in time was a watershed moment for food allergies in the Canadian context. September of 2003 marked the death of Sabrina Shannon, which received much exposure in the news media, and eventually led to the legislation of “Sabrina’s Law.” This law was the first of its kind in Canada, and since it was enacted, there has been a variety of regulatory responses to food allergies. In this context, the trajectory of frames makes intuitive sense. In particular, the discussion in the media changed trajectory in 2004 from stories concerned with defining food allergies as a problem, to stories suggesting remedies; stories that include reports of implemented policies, or proposed solutions. Temporal shifts in framing risks in the media have been reported elsewhere. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963662510393083">Trumbo (1996)</xref> discusses climate change in terms of an issue-attention cycle, finding that presentations of risk issues align with particular phases in the lifecourse of an issue. In particular, the focus evolves from problem definitions and diagnosing causes towards solutions and remedies for social problems (e.g. risks) over time.</p>
<p>It is consistently reported in the literature that journalists rely on expert testimony, primarily because of a lack of expertise in an area, but also because the constraints of journalism demand increasingly up-to-the-minute information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662510393083">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>). This was echoed by the results of this research. Seventy per cent of the articles in this study relied on individuals with various interests in the construction of food allergy for information. Affected individuals, and particularly the parents of allergic children, received the majority of this representation. Advocates, who were frequently affected individuals as well, were also well represented, quoted third most after researchers. Those with direct experience with risks can play an important journalistic role by framing an issue in an emotionally arousing, or personalized way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662510393083">Wåhlberg and Sjöberg, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>To these ends, many articles began with anecdotes or experiences with food allergies as told from the perspective of these individuals, for example:
<disp-quote>
<p>Last May, Derek suffered a severe allergic reaction at his private elementary school &amp;…; Derek’s father, typical of most parents who have raced to the hospital with their child in their arms, describes the anxiety he now feels. “After you see how fast it can happen, it becomes a constant scare,” [he] said. “To me, a kid who comes to school with a chocolate is worse than a kid who comes to school with a gun.” (<italic>The Gazette</italic>, August 25, 2001, p. A1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This journalistic strategy aligns with the concept of newsworthiness, which ultimately translates into readership – the main objective of the news media sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510393083">Major and Atwood, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963662510393083">Wakefield and Elliott, 2003</xref>). However, affected individuals and advocates also have a keen interest in being represented in the media, particularly around issues of regulation and policy, and particularly so when these apply to their children:
<disp-quote>
<p>As an advocate, I know more can be done to prevent anaphylactic reactions – from awareness and education to medical research and food safety. But as a parent, if the proposed changes to Canada’s food labelling policy are enacted, at least I can worry a little less. [Advocate] (<italic>Winnipeg Free Press</italic>, July 27, 2008, p. B4)</p>
<p>As a parent of a six-year-old boy who has a life-threatening peanut allergy …; I think there’s something more dangerous and insidious than the anxiety that banning nuts in schools is propagating. It’s the false sense of security. [Affected Individual] (<italic>Vancouver Sun</italic>, December 19, 2008, p. A.16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore, it could be that media representation is sought out by these groups in order to promote their own understanding of the issue. The nature of the relationship between purposeful media representation by these groups and journalistic strategy is unclear from the analysis. Despite not knowing how these interests gain media representation, our findings show that there is certainly a substantial role being played in the definition and construction of food allergies by those who are directly affected.</p>
<p>An interesting result from this analysis was the distribution of claims-making groups or “voices” in stories framed as defining problems. While stories framed in other ways privileged certain groups, stories defining food allergies as problems appear to be the most likely site for contesting claims and counterclaims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510393083">Beck, 1992</xref>). In particular, advocates, affected individuals, health professionals and researchers received approximately equal representation. This could represent a potential source of confusion and uncertainty for the general population, as the values of these groups differ greatly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510393083">Major and Atwood, 2004</xref>), and each group could represent a unique idea about the risks of food allergies. However, it is interesting that this particular result resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510393083">Gross’ (1994)</xref> contextual model of public understanding. That is, the knowledge of science (e.g. researcher, health professionals) is not being privileged over the knowledge of the public (i.e. advocates, allergic individuals). Rather, science appears to be interacting with “local knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662510393083">Cottle, 1998</xref>: 13) to cooperatively construct a social definition of food allergies. Such competition may ultimately provide a more robust public discourse of the related risks.</p>
<p>Stories organized around diagnosing the causes of food allergy, were dominated by researchers and health professionals, comprising almost 80% of total quoted sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662510393083">Figure 3</xref>). Stories framed in this way were reporting treatments for food allergy, other new research in the area of food allergies, or theories of the cause of food allergy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662510393083">Wilson et al. (2004)</xref> suggest journalists may defer to experts in the sciences owing to a relative lack of scientific literacy, particularly when issues are wrought with scientific uncertainties. This would be especially true in stories framed to diagnose causes, where discussions were focused on complex methodologies for assessing or diagnosing food allergies, and theoretical relationships between genes and the environment.</p>
<p>Advocates and affected individuals dominated the discussions on solutions and moral judgements. These particular groups have vested interest in how policies are implemented and enforced, as they would be directly affected by such action, and this is reflected by their disproportionate representation in related discussions. The non-allergic population did voice some criticism about policy decisions in these stories as well, particularly around peanut bans, citing the “tyranny of the teeny-tiny minority” (<italic>Toronto Sun</italic>, May 6, 2000, p. 15). These groups most often focused on how a small group is “wielding authority over the masses” (<italic>London Free Press</italic>, May 8, 2000, p. A9), and voiced worry about infringements on their rights to choose what they want to eat, and about what foods would be targeted next (e.g. dairy, soy). However, the “volume” of their voice in policy debates measured by their representation is muted by the voice of the allergic population. The shift in story frames also factors in to this relationship. A growing focus on remedies since 2004 and a decreasing number of stories defining problems and causes appears to be providing a stronger voice to advocates and affected individuals. The implication here is that other groups (e.g. health professionals, researchers) are not being proportionally represented, and that discussions of solutions are gradually becoming one-sided.</p>
<p>We would like to offer two perspectives on increasing reliance on advocates and affected individuals. On one hand, this could be problematic, in that the more the discussion around solutions is controlled by one group, the greater the backlash from other groups could become. There is already a contingent of the non-allergic population that has voiced their displeasure with policy decisions, and criticism of existing solutions has also been asserted in the literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662510393083">Christakis, 2008</xref>). On the other hand, the reasons why the other groups are relatively absent from discussions around solutions are unknown. We offer that it may be partially a function of the lack of scientific consensus regarding prevalence, diagnostics, and best management practices for food allergies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662510393083">Schneider Chafen et al., 2010</xref>). Despite a lack of a full understanding from scientific “experts,” however, society and policymakers must respond to and accommodate this emerging health risk, and require information to do so. In this context and at this time, affected individuals and advocates <italic>are</italic> valuable experts with privileged knowledge of food allergy risks. This idea could potentially be why they are sought out by journalists, or why they pursue media access to suggest solutions to a greater degree than other groups.</p>

This decision was made primarily to follow up previous research that has reported a high level of perceived risk in the general Canadian population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510393083">Harrington et al., 2010</xref>). Canada’s political environment related to food allergies is also unique in that Sabrina’s Law (Ontario) represents the first piece of legislation to regulate the school environment for children with severe allergies, though other provinces have more recently followed suit. Extension of this work to other political contexts could provide insight into the role of claims-making in shaping discourses about food allergies.</p>
<p>Secondly, this study was designed to be a manifest content analysis, which is consistent with survey research in terms of its goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662510393083">Nuendorf, 2002</xref>). Such an analysis is concerned with recording and measuring physically present elements in an article, and producing summaries of articles as coded by an a priori coding scheme. As mentioned previously, this analysis found that groups are “competing” to define food allergies. Evident in even the small sample of quotes provided in our discussion, it is clear that claims-makers from different groups often use strong metaphors, and emotionally charged language to persuade the public to accept their claims. Such rhetoric plays a significant role under a contextual model of public understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510393083">Gross, 1994</xref>). More rhetorical analyses of these texts could shed some light on how these groups specifically frame their arguments to shape the definition of food allergies.</p>
<p>Finally, while we know that there is a high level of perceived risk of food allergy in the general population, it is still unclear what the public understand about food allergies. Though this research has provided some insight into how the media may play a role in this understanding, further investigation into how the messages are interpreted is necessary. This will be crucial to understand if increasing media coverage is echoing the legitimate concerns of the public, or amplifying public concern.</p>

<title>7. Conclusion</title>
<p>Attribution of a message to a source, as well as the way in which that message is framed can provide critical insight into how a health risk is constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662510393083">McCarthy et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, this process matters for public perception, as representation of a risk issue influences whether the general population understands, attends to, or acts upon risk information. In an era defined by the emergence of new risks in an increasingly information mediated environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510393083">Beck, 1992</xref>), stories in the media are vulnerable to claims-making, and often issues are framed to resonate with the public. The literature in and around food allergies is recognizing that various social actors and interests are involved in the social construction of definitions of food allergy, as evidenced by differences in lay and expert understandings. This is certainly reflected in media representations of food allergies, and the results of this paper can extend this contention. While many voices compete to define the risks of food allergies, discussions of causes and solutions are relatively one-sided, with potential consequences for public understanding. As food allergies and other new risks continue to be constructed and re-constructed through claims-making and framing in the media, it is of great interest to acknowledge who is saying what.</p>
