<abstract>
<p>Shane (2009) has suggested that encouraging more people to become entrepreneurs is bad public policy because it is existing firms that bring jobs and productivity growth and not new firms. To test this view this article shifts the perspective onto existing firms and away from start-up by examining firm survivability in the regions and countries of the UK and its relationship with employment and productivity growth. The article provides some evidence to support Shane’s (2009) view that it is existing firms that are important for economic development.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094212466024" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>For many years government policy in the UK has focused on the economic benefits stemming from high levels of start-up. For example, the Labour Government of 1997–2010 sought to increase start-up levels as they thought this would bring both increased efficiency through enhanced productivity growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094212466024">Atherton, 2006</xref>: 22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094212466024">Derbyshire and Haywood, 2009</xref>: 310; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212466024">DTI, 2003</xref>: 20; HM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094212466024">Treasury, 2006</xref>) and greater equity and cohesion between poorer and wealthier regions through a closure of the ‘enterprise gap’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094212466024">Derbyshire and Haywood, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094212466024">Huggins and Williams, 2009</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>However, policy makers’ assumption of the positive economic impact of high start-up rates is increasingly questioned. A prominent instance of this questioning is that by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane (2009)</xref> who seeks to dispel what he sees as a number of ‘myths’ about start-up. One of these is what he refers to as ‘The job creation myth’ (p. 144). Shane implies that it is not new firms but existing firms which account for the majority of job creation. He cites a number of studies and uses them to suggest variously that <italic>existing</italic> firms account for 93% of job creation in the US (drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212466024">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2008</xref>), that firms over 10 years old account for 74.5% of job growth in Sweden (drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094212466024">Davidsson and Delmar, 2000</xref>), and that firms more than one year old account for 93.6% of net job creation in US manufacturing (drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094212466024">Davis and Haltiwanger, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>A further target for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane (2009)</xref> is the claim that new firms bring greater economic growth because of their alleged superior productivity. Shane states (p. 142) that: ‘To get more growth by having more start-ups, new companies would need to be more productive than existing companies. But they are not’. He draws on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094212466024">Haltiwanger et al. (1999)</xref> to claim that firm productivity increases with firm age, rather than the opposite as implied by the recent policy focus on start-up.</p>
<p>This article adds to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane’s (2009)</xref> critique by shifting emphasis from start-up to the existing firms he claims are of more importance. It provides additional evidence lending some support to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane’s (2009)</xref> view. It distinguishes between the regions and countries of the UK by examining the length of time firms exist (survive), and relates this to their employment and productivity growth. The survival statistic employed in this analysis is a new one that has not been used previously.</p>
<p>Survival is measured in terms of the survival ‘half-life’ of the cohort of all enterprises established in each Government Office Region (GOR) and country of the UK in 2001. It is measured in the same way that the ‘half-life’ of a decaying sample of atoms is measured – through an exponential decay function. The decay (deformation) of firms exhibits some of the same characteristics. It is initially relatively sharp as a significant proportion of any cohort of start-ups immediately goes out of existence in the first year after formation. The rate of decay then slows and stabilises. As employed here, the survival ‘half-life’ of firms can be characterised as an estimate of the number of years it took for firms established in 2001 to decay (deform) to a point where exactly 50% remained in existence. So, for example, as will be seen subsequently, the survival ‘half-life’ of firms in the South East of England is estimated at 6.32 years. In other words, it is estimated to have taken 6.32 years for 50% of the cohort of all enterprises created in the South East in 2001 to deform, leaving 50% still in existence. In comparison, the figure for Northern Ireland is 7.18 years.</p>
<p>By relating these survival half-life statistics to employment and productivity growth we can test the validity of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane’s (2009)</xref> viewpoint that it is existing firms that are important for economic development. If <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane (2009)</xref> is correct and it <italic>is</italic> existing firms which bring economic development, not start-ups, then those regions in which firms are able to go on existing for longest should exhibit a better performance in terms of economic development.</p>
<p>By shifting perspective onto the ability of firms to go on existing (surviving) in this way, this article adds to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane’s (2009)</xref> critique by questioning the simplistic assumption of the beneficial effects of start-up upon economies. This shift in perspective is also in keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212466024">Storey’s (2011</xref>: 304) recent exhortation for research to place greater emphasis on examining closure as this is the dominant performance characteristic of new and small firms.</p>
<p>The plan for the article is as follows. The next section describes in greater detail the method used for estimating survival half-life. It also describes the source of the survival data employed in the analysis. The third section outlines the relationship between survival half-life and employment growth over 2001–2007 and shows that those regions in which firms exist for the longest time had the highest rates of employment growth over this period. The fourth section outlines the relationship between survival half-life and productivity growth and shows that it is by no means as clear cut as start-up policies suggest. The final section makes some concluding remarks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094212466024"><title>Estimating the survival ‘half-life’ of firms</title>
<p>The survival data employed in this analysis is from The Beta Model (TBM) database. The method of data capture employed by TBM has been usefully described in the following way:<disp-quote>
<p>The existence of a firm is registered on the database through its entry in one of two (or both) major business directories, The Yellow Pages or Thomson Local. The 1982 Telecommunications Act compels operators to provide a network-wide directory service of their users, for their users. Under a voluntary arrangement, all UK providers are participants to a common scheme known as the Operator Services Information System (OSIS) and this is used to inform the content of the directories. Inclusion in the OSIS scheme is driven by the opening of business-tariff contracts. A further source for the directories, which captures non-business-tariff users such as those with residential or mobile-only lines, is taken from the online directory Yell.com, as well as free local papers. The closure of the business-tariff contract initiates removal from the directories. The application for such a business-tariff phone line or self-registration in the directory is likely to come much sooner in the business’s life-cycle than its arriving at the VAT threshold. Therefore, its existence is captured much sooner and the database contains many more new start-ups for this reason. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094212466024">Derbyshire and Haywood, 2009</xref>: 315)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Because of this method of data capture, the database is better able to capture the creation, continued existence and closure of enterprises, and has more firms registered on it than any other database in the UK (about 2.5 m in 2010 compared to about 1.8 m on the UK Government’s VAT database). For this reason it is widely employed by local authorities throughout the UK. The TBM database has a facility to track the continued existence of all firms established in a particular year. So, for example, TBM shows the number of firms created in 2001 in each of the regions and countries of the UK and then shows the number of these that remained in existence in each of the following years. The cohort whose existence has been tracked for the longest period is that created in 2001. At time of writing, the firms created in this year had been tracked for survival through to 2007. The ‘half-life’ statistics created here are therefore estimates based on the survival of the cohort of all firms created in the regions and countries of the UK in 2001 and tracked over the period 2001–2007.</p>
<p>For each region and country we model the decay of the 2001 cohort over the period 2001-2007 using an exponential decay function of the form:

<p>The procedure for fitting the decay function to the data and then estimating half-life occurs in two stages. First, an Ordinary Least Squares regression is performed corresponding to the following equation:

<p>The estimates for half-life shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094212466024">Table 1</xref> are then calculated simply according to the equation:

</p>
<p>To clarify in simpler terms what has been done: a curve (an exponential decay function) has been fitted to the survival data. A regression has been carried out to understand the extent to which the curve accurately fits the survival data. The <inline-formula id="ilm5-0269094212466024"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math5-0269094212466024"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of the regression is very high, suggesting that the curve fits the data very well, leaving little unexplained variation. The curve has then been used to estimate the point (the number of years) at which exactly half of the cohort would no longer be in existence, projecting forward on the basis of the six years of survival data available.</p>
<p>It is necessary to measure the ‘half-life’ of survival, rather than just measuring the outright average survival length of all firms, for the same reason that physicists do not measure the full lifespan of atoms and instead measure ‘half-lives’ for them. While it is true that the majority of a cohort of firms has deformed within just six or seven years of creation, a small proportion of any cohort will go on existing for decades, and a still smaller proportion may go on living for hundreds of years. To estimate the average full lifespan is therefore impossible. However, by instead comparing the number of years it takes for 50% of a cohort to die through the ‘half-life’ statistic, we can get a good impression of the relative ease of survival in each region and country and, conversely, the ease with which firms are able to go on existing.</p>

<p>In this section the survival half-life of the 2001 cohort of all firms<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094212466024">1</xref></sup> created in 2001 in each region and country of the UK is related to employment growth. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094212466024">Figure 1</xref> illustrates this relationship between survival half-life and employment growth.

<p>The employment data used in this analysis is from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094212466024">Cambridge Econometrics’ (2012)</xref> UK Regional database. It originates from the UK Office for National Statistics’ ABI data and is validated by the Institute for Employment Research at Warwick University. Importantly, the data used in this analysis excludes employment in the public sector. The SIC 2003 codes for which employment has been excluded are divisions 75, 80 and 85 which relate to public administration, defence, health and education. These sectors have also been excluded from the analysis of productivity growth in the next section. This exclusion is important because a considerable amount of the employment growth over 2001–2007 resulted from Labour’s expansion of the public sector. To include this employment growth would distort the analysis because some regions and countries were disproportionate beneficiaries from it and, anyway, it did not result from either start-up or survival of enterprises and so is not relevant.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094212466024">Figure 1</xref> suggests that those regions in which firms exist for longest on average are those which experienced the strongest average per annum employment growth over 2001–2007. The relationship is not an exact one but it is sufficient to lend some support to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane’s (2009)</xref> questioning of what he calls ‘the job creation myth’ associated with start-up. It suggests that the considerable emphasis placed by policy makers on the job-creation benefits from higher start-up rates may not be justified and that it may be existing (surviving) firms that are more important.</p>
<p>If it is existing firms (survivors) that bring employment growth as suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094212466024">Figure 1</xref>, then encouraging more people to become entrepreneurs really is bad public policy as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane (2009)</xref> suggests. This is because such policies, if successful, will inevitably reduce survival and the average length of time for which firms exist. There is a negative relationship between start-up and survival because of the ‘whopping’ correlation between start-up and deformation, as highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane (2009</xref>: 143). Where start-up is higher, survival half-life will tend to be lower. By increasing start-up rates policy makers therefore reduce survival and, if survival is related to employment growth as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094212466024">Figure 1</xref> implies, they will therefore also reduce employment growth.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0269094212466024"><title>Survival half-life and productivity growth</title>
<p>In this section attention is switched to the relationship between survival half-life and productivity growth. The UK’s Labour Government of 1997–2010 saw the promotion of entrepreneurship as a key method to boost the UK’s lagging productivity rates (Huggins and Williams, 2006: 20) as specifically stated in a 2006 policy document titled ‘Meeting the productivity challenge’ (HM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094212466024">Treasury, 2006</xref>). The logic behind this was set out in an earlier policy document (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212466024">DTI, 2003</xref>: 20) which referred to the creation of a ‘dynamic start-up market showing high levels of entry by new businesses and the efficient exit of less productive businesses’. The logic was therefore that increased rates of churn (start-up and closure of enterprises) would bring greater competition to the business stock and result in new, more productive firms driving out weaker and less productive firms. The implication of this is that where churn rates are lowest, and the average survival length of firms is therefore longest, the challenge to incumbent firms from start-up is less intense and productivity growth is therefore relatively slow.</p>
<p>Productivity growth is here calculated simply as GVA divided by number of employees and then transformed into a per annum average growth rate for the period 2001–2007. The employment data used in the previous analysis is again used here and the GVA data comes from the same source: Cambridge Econometrics’ UK Regional database. As previously, the public sector is omitted from the analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094212466024">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the relationship between survival half-life and productivity growth.
<fig id="fig2-0269094212466024" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Survival half-life and average pa productivity growth 2001–2007.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212466024-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>An initial examination of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094212466024">Figure 2</xref> suggests that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane (2009)</xref> may be wrong in his view that it is existing (surviving) firms that bring higher productivity growth. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094212466024">Figure 2</xref> the relationship initially suggests that regions and countries in which firms exist for longest had the lowest rates of productivity growth over the period 2001–2007. This would imply that encouraging more people to become entrepreneurs is <italic>good</italic> public policy as it brings greater challenge to incumbent firms and assists in the process of knocking weaker firms out of the business stock and replacing them with more efficient firms, just as the UK’s Labour Government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212466024">DTI, 2003</xref>: 20) assumed.</p>
<p>However, there is clearly an outlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094212466024">Figure 2</xref>: London. London was an outlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094212466024">Figure 1</xref> also but its removal does not greatly change the nature of the relationship between survival half-life and employment growth evidenced there. The relationship remains a positive one and, if anything, the trend line would be steeper still if London were removed from that analysis. However, removing London from the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094212466024">Figure 2</xref> <italic>does</italic> significantly alter the relationship between survival half-life and productivity growth, as is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269094212466024">Figure 3</xref>.
<fig id="fig3-0269094212466024" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Survival half-life and average pa productivity growth 2001–2007, without London.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212466024-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>When London is removed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269094212466024">Figure 3</xref> shows there now to be no obvious relationship between survival half-life and productivity growth. There is no longer the evidence to refute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane’s (2009</xref>: 142) suggestion that it is existing (surviving) firms which bring productivity growth and to support the dominant policy view that increased start-up (and therefore reduced survivability) brings productivity growth. However, neither does this evidence <italic>support</italic> Shane’s view that it is existing (surviving) firms that are important when it comes to productivity growth. The evidence is inconclusive.</p>
<p>What this evidence does do, however, is to provide a contrast to the certainty with which recent government policies have assumed that increased efficiency can be achieved by increasing start-up (and, therefore, reducing survival). The assertion that start-ups bring productivity growth lay at the core of the Labour Government’s enterprise policy over 1997–2010 as commented on by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094212466024">Derbyshire and Haywood (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094212466024">2010</xref>) and as evidenced by the Government’s own enterprise-related policy documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212466024">DTI, 2003</xref>; HM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094212466024">Treasury, 2006</xref>). The evidence to support this assertion is much weaker than suggested by the strength with which it was made. If the logic of government policy was correct and increased start-up was a certain driver of increased productivity growth then we would expect the regions with the longest survival length in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269094212466024">Figure 3</xref> to have the lowest rates of productivity growth since increased start-up tends to lead to shorter average survival because of the ‘whopping’ correlation between start-up and closure highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane (2009</xref>: 143).</p>
<p>While the evidence examined here also fails to support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane’s (2009)</xref> view on the importance of existing (surviving) firms for productivity growth, this view does make a certain amount of sense. A good deal of productivity enhancement obviously stems from investment in capital of both the physical and human type and this investment may require firms to exist for some time before the returns from it are realised. For example, skills are often acquired by individuals on the job through learning-by-doing. This may require them to be in the same job and, possibly, even in the same enterprise, for a certain amount of time. Only then could skill levels be built up to a sufficient level for productivity enhancement to occur and for it to be realised by the firm.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0269094212466024"><title>Summary</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane (2009)</xref> has implied that it is existing firms rather than new firms which bring economic development. In order to test this idea this article has taken the perspective of firm survival and examined its relationship with employment and productivity growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane (2009)</xref> has referred to the view that new firms bring employment and productivity growth as ‘myth’. If it is true that it is existing firms that bring economic development rather than start-ups then those regions in which firms are able to exist for longest should perform best.</p>
<p>This article has employed a new measure of firm survival – survival ‘half-life’ – in order to distinguish between regions and countries of the UK in terms of the length of time for which firms exist on average. The survival half-life is the number of years it takes for exactly 50% of a cohort of firms to deform, leaving exactly 50% still in existence. The cohort of firms employed in the analysis was that for 2001. Its survival was tracked over 2001–2007 and based on this data the survival half-life for each region and country was estimated using an exponential decay function.</p>
<p>The length of survival half-life is related to the level of start-up because of the strong correlation between start-up and closure, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane (2009</xref>: 143). Because of this relationship between start-up and survivability, to seek to increase start-up rates is to seek to reduce firm survival. It is therefore important to be sure whether it is genuinely start-up which is related to economic development, or whether it is existing firms as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane (2009)</xref> has implied. If it is existing firms then by increasing start-up rates policy makers may potentially have a negative effect on economic development rather than the positive effect intended. To increase start-up would be to undermine the existence (survival) of the existing firms which do most to contribute to economic development.</p>
<p>In relation to employment growth at least, this article provides some support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane’s (2009)</xref> view that it is existing firms that are important for economic development. Those regions and countries in which firms exist for longest have tended to have the highest rates of per annum employment growth over 2001–2007.</p>
<p>In relation to productivity growth the evidence examined here does not support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466024">Shane’s (2009)</xref> view that it is existing firms that are important. However, neither does it support the view that it is start-ups that are overwhelmingly the important factor in this respect, which is the impression one would get from recent government policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212466024">DTI 2003</xref>; HM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094212466024">Treasury, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, an examination of firm closure is likely to provide fruitful policy insights because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212466024">Storey (2011</xref>: 304) has recently emphasised, closure is the dominant characteristic of new and small firms. This article represents an initial attempt at shifting the debate in that direction by employing a new measure, ‘half-life’, of survivability to estimate the number of years it takes for exactly 50% of a cohort of new firms to close and by relating this measure to employment and productivity growth. It is hoped to provide more detailed analysis using this measure in the future.</p>
