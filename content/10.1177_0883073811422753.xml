<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811422753">3</xref>
</sup> The assessment and treatment of psychogenic movement disorders can be complex. Most movement disorders are diagnosed based on their phenomenology, that is, clinical presentation and history. Symptoms can mimic organic movement disorders and can affect gait, speech, and several parts of the body, leading to very disabling symptoms. There are no laboratory tests or other tests to reliably diagnose psychogenic movement disorders. These factors make it one of the most challenging conditions to diagnose and treat effectively.</p>
<p>We report patients seen during the past 5 years, diagnosed with psychogenic movement disorders. All patients were evaluated in the Pediatric Movement Disorders Clinic at a tertiary care center. We have described three cases in detail, and summarized the rest in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811422753">Table 1</xref>
. We discuss in this article some patient characteristics and some strategies that are effective in the management of this group of patients. Two main factors are integral to the effective treatment of children and adolescents presenting with psychogenic movement disorders: (1) a multidisciplinary approach and (2) family involvement. Case examples presented in this article all involve adolescents who met criteria for a psychogenic movement disorder.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective review (approved by The Hospital’s Research Board) of all patients seen in the pediatric neurology movement disorder clinic was undertaken. This was conducted using a clinic database, with chart review and review of video recordings, where available. Diagnosis of psychogenic movement disorder was made by one of 2 movement disorder specialists. The psychogenic movement disorder was classified according to the organic disorder they most closely resembled, that is, dystonia, myoclonus, tremor, etc. All patients were investigated for organic disorders, which were ruled out, before a diagnosis of psychogenic movement disorder was made. The diagnosis of psychogenic movement disorder was made based on several factors such as presence of precipitating factors, abrupt onset and social stressors on history, clinical characteristics of distractibility (ie, change in frequency, intensity, or duration of movement when the patient is distracted by performing another task simultaneously), and variability (ie, change in nature of involuntary movement) and investigations to rule out organic disorders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0883073811422753">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Three hundred patients were seen in the movement disorder clinic between 2005 and 2009. Thirteen patients (4.3%) were identified with a psychogenic movement disorder. This is similar to the report in adult literature that 3.3% of all movement disorders are psychogenic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811422753">3</xref>
</sup> There were 10 female patients affected. Age range was 6 to 17 years (mean age = 13.1 years). Common presentations were dystonia (5), tremor (3), chorea (3), and myoclonus (3). In the children with dystonia, the neck and trunk were affected in 3 children whereas the leg was affected in the other 2. Only 1 patient had fixed dystonia and two had paroxysmal dystonia. In children with myoclonus, 2 had upper limb involvement whereas 1 had a generalized myoclonus. All 3 children with tremor had upper limbs affected. Three children had chorea. All had involvement of neck, trunk, and upper extremities. One patient had associated bradykinesia and mutism.</p>
<p>Psychological stressors and/or psychiatric comorbidities were identified in 10 patients (77%), and one was lost to follow-up. Ten patients improved or recovered completely.</p>
<p>In all the children, the abnormal movements started abruptly. The stressors were clearly identified in 7 patients: 1, after being bullied in school; 1, after sexual abuse; 1, after the death of a close family member; and 1, after divorce of the parents. Two children were involved in competitive sports and 2 were involved in competitive dance at a national or provincial level. They all had stopped participating in these activities as a result of their movement disorder. One child had onset of the movement disorder within 1 week of a minor injury. One child has psychogenic tics in addition to organic tics.</p>
<p>Although many stressors were identified by the treating neurologist, all children were referred to a psychiatrist and a social worker with experience in psychological counseling. Psychiatric diagnoses like obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety disorder were made by our child psychiatrists and treatment for these conditions was also initiated by them. Ongoing psychological counseling was provided by social workers. Eleven patients improved, 2 patients showed no improvement and 1 was lost to follow-up. Improvement was noted in the abnormal movements, as noted by the neurologist. Data on follow-up on the psychiatric symptoms were not available.</p>
<p>Two main factors were identified as integral to effective treatment of children and adolescents presenting with psychogenic movement disorder: (1) a multidisciplinary approach and (2) family involvement. Patient characteristics and associated features are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811422753">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Case Examples</title>
<sec id="section4-0883073811422753">
<title>Patient 1</title>
<p>Patient 1, a 15-year-old female, initially presented with right hand tremor. The episodes ranged in duration from half an hour to 3 hours at a time, and typically occurred during the daytime hours. Episodes progressed to involve her whole body and would last several hours. She had significant difficulty sleeping on account of her condition. On examination, she had evidence of a distractible tremor of the right arm without further evidence of other neurologic abnormality. She was extremely active in extracurricular activities and was a national champion in one sport prior to onset of her symptoms. She was unable to participate in sports and also stopped attending school after onset of her symptoms.</p>
<sec id="section5-0883073811422753">
<title>Course, progression, and outcome</title>
<p>Diagnosis of psychogenic movement disorder was made based largely on clinical characteristics and clinical examination. The effectiveness of treatment for patient 1 can be largely attributed to the two main factors described below. A multidisciplinary approach, involving neurology, psychiatry, and social work was used. After consultation with a movement disorders specialist, a diagnosis of psychogenic tremors was confirmed. Psychiatric consultation with patient 1, her parents, and sibling revealed that patient 1 met <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders–Fourth Edition</italic> criteria for a Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Patient 1 was prescribed medication for anxiety, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and had regular follow-up with the psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy was used in addition to drug therapy. The social worker incorporated several family members in treatment. The family issues identified were addressed throughout her treatment by incorporating family sessions. After beginning counseling, patient 1 made several steps toward recovery. She continued to make large gains throughout the treatment process and began to attend school full time.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0883073811422753">
<title>Patient 2</title>
<p>Patient 2, a 12-year-old female, has known complex partial epilepsy with onset at age 12 years. Seizures resolved on treatment with carbamazepine and the patient was admitted with increasing dystonic movements, with neck twisting movements thought to be a medication side effect. In spite of changes in medication, she continued to have increasing dystonic movements. She was treated with a dose of Cogentin on one emergency department visit but re-presented and was admitted with dystonic-type movements of her face, neck, limbs, and trunk. She was subsequently treated with Artane, Tetrabenazine, and diazepam, with only minimal effect apart from sedation. She was unable to attend school because of the severity of her symptoms.</p>
<sec id="section8-0883073811422753">
<title>Course, progression, and outcome</title>
<p>After a period of inpatient observation over a few days, the dystonic movements were diagnosed to be nonorganic and all medications were withdrawn. Ruling out an organic cause allowed the medical team and the family to engage in a dialogue about other possibilities, including the option of a psychogenic movement disorder.</p>
<p>Multiple family stressors were identified and a referral was made to psychiatry on an outpatient basis. The importance of involving the family in the psychiatric consultation in light of the family stressors identified became evident. When patient 2 and her family attended the psychiatric assessment 3 weeks later, there had already been a reduction in her symptoms. She was diagnosed by the psychiatrist with obsessive-compulsive disorder using <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders–Fourth Edition</italic> criteria.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0883073811422753">
<title>Patient 3</title>
<p>Patient 3, a 17-year-old female, had a history of foot dystonia for almost 2 years prior to being seen at our clinic. Her condition was characterized by a painful back spasm onset accompanied by foot turning inwards, and followed by leg shaking. She had received a trial with Sinemet and trihexyphenidyl. She also had undergone administration of botulinum toxin injections for her leg. She was referred for deep brain stimulation for persistent dystonia. On examination, she had inward turning of the right foot and leg, which appeared to be fixed when sitting as well as standing. However, there would be an extension of the leg at the knee when she was sitting and focusing on other tasks. Rest of her neurologic examination was normal. Prior to the onset of symptoms, she was dancing at a competitive level. She was unable to continue dancing because of her symptoms and was using a cane to help her walk.</p>
<sec id="section11-0883073811422753">
<title>Course, progression, and outcome</title>
<p>A diagnosis of psychogenic movement disorder was made during a videotaped clinical examination, when the symptoms resolved gradually under suggestion. However, the patient and her parents were not comfortable with the diagnosis of psychogenic movement disorder and thus it was extremely difficult to engage the family in assessment and/or treatment. After consultation with two neurologists, several psychiatrists, and a social worker, the parents continued to explore medical causes for their daughter’s symptoms. The patient continues to pursue several medical therapies including medication and regular physiotherapy without any symptom relief. Ultimately, this case demonstrates the importance of engaging the whole family in the effective treatment of psychogenic movement disorders.</p>

<sec id="section13-0883073811422753">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Psychogenic movement disorders cannot be strictly classified into clearly defined psychiatric disorders such as somatoform, dissociative, or conversion disorders.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811422753">4</xref>
</sup> Although there are no formal criteria to diagnose psychogenic movement disorder, especially in children, there are some “red flags” listed below, that should raise suspicion.<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Sudden or abrupt onset</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Fast progression in symptoms</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Presence of multiple types of movement phenomenology</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Movement inconsistent with known patterns of movement disorders</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Phenomenon of “distractibility”—This is the disappearance of the abnormal movement when patient is challenged with complex, competing tasks.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Phenomenon of “variability” or frequent change in the intensity, frequency, direction, and amplitude of abnormal movements</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Degree of disability incongruent with severity of movement abnormalities</p>
</list-item>
</list>The diagnosis of psychogenic movement disorders is usually considered as a diagnosis of exclusion. However, if the clinical suspicion is high, these patients can be diagnosed early and help speed the recovery.</p>
<p>As illustrated in the cases above, the effective treatment of patients 1 and 2 was largely due to the multidisciplinary approach applied along with the inclusion of the family in treatment. It is believed that patient 3’s treatment was significantly limited by the family’s lack of engagement in the assessment and treatment process.</p>
<sec id="section14-0883073811422753">
<title>Multidisciplinary Approach</title>
<p>It is believed that a multidisciplinary approach involving neurology, psychiatry, and social work/psychology results in the most effective treatment outcome for adolescents with psychogenic movement disorder for several reasons. Patients are often referred to movement disorder specialists (ie, neurologist) because of the atypical presentation of the movements the adolescent is experiencing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811422753">4</xref>
</sup> Therefore, in order to adequately assess a child or adolescent’s symptoms, the involvement of a neurologist is imperative. Ruling out the possibility of an organic cause for the patient’s symptoms is both a part of the assessment and treatment for psychogenic disorders, making neurologists typically the first specialist to become involved. The primary care physician should also remain involved throughout as they usually have a long-term relationship with the patient and family.</p>
<p>The strong association between psychogenic movement disorder and an underlying psychiatric condition makes the involvement of a psychiatrist essential. The psychiatrist is able to assess for any underlying psychiatric conditions that might be contributing to the psychogenic movement disorder (eg, anxiety, depression). A psychiatrist can also assess the need for medication as part of the larger treatment plan. Moreover, many adolescents are unable to engage in counseling because of increased anxious or depressive symptoms. Therefore, medication for clinical levels of anxiety and/or depression often plays a key role in effective treatment of psychogenic movement disorder. Typically, psychiatrists are involved as a consultation service and as an adjunct to the ongoing therapy. Ultimately, the psychiatric assessment will inform the treatment plan. If an underlying psychiatric condition is diagnosed, this will be the focus of the therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>A psychologist or social worker is often the allied health professional responsible for providing ongoing counseling to the youth and family. It is extremely important that the counselor or therapist work closely with the neurologist and psychiatrist to support the overall treatment plan. If a psychiatric condition has been identified, this will likely be the focus of the work. The therapeutic approach should be tailored to the presenting issue. For example, if the adolescent is presenting with anxiety, depression, or obsessive compulsive disorder, a cognitive-behavioral therapy model would be indicated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811422753">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811422753"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811422753">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The school staff should also be included in the multidisciplinary team whenever possible. Even if the school is not actively involved, we recommend that a member of the multidisciplinary team stay in touch with the school. In our model, the social worker would take on this role.</p>
<p>Contrary to the usual practice, we felt that given the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, it is ideal for assessment and treatment to occur within a hospital setting. This setting certainly supports the need for ongoing and frequent communication among medical and allied health professionals. In addition, it may be easier for youth and families to engage in treatment in a more medical setting given the complexity of psychogenic movement disorder. More specifically, adolescents and their families might initially be resistant to the idea that their symptoms are medically unexplained and essentially not organic; therefore, treatment within the medical setting may allow for increased engagement rather than referring the family to a mental health setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0883073811422753">
<title>Family Involvement</title>
<p>The assessment and treatment of adolescents with psychogenic movement disorder must involve the family. It is imperative that the family play an active role in both the assessment and treatment stage to ensure optimal effectiveness. Involving parents and siblings is important for several reasons. First, families provide invaluable information and insight into the identified patient’s symptoms. A thorough assessment must involve the family, as many times, the identified patient cannot see past their symptoms to objectively analyze any stressors in their lives. Parents and siblings can also provide information about family dynamics and how these might be contributing to the identified patient’s symptoms. In fact, problematic family relationships are more prevalent in anxious rather than nonanxious children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811422753">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811422753"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811422753">10</xref>
</sup> Although the cause-and-effect direction of this relationship is not known (ie, whether dysfunctional family relationships cause children to be anxious or children with anxiety disorders adversely affect family functioning), the relationship is clear and therefore involving the family in treatment may be essential to maximize treatment outcomes.</p>
<p>Second, family involvement is essential as families must learn the role they play in the treatment plan. Siblings and parents undoubtedly affect the adolescent’s symptoms either by maintaining or exacerbating them. Without significant understanding of psychogenic movement disorders, parents and siblings might be seen as unsupportive and/or as enabling of the adolescent’s condition. Enabling certain anxious or depressive behaviors limit the success of the treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811422753">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811422753">12</xref>
</sup> Specifically, enabling behaviors might result in the adolescent slipping further and further into a “sick role” and compromise the effectiveness of the therapeutic interventions. On the other hand, a lack of understanding from family members and the idea that the identified patient is “faking” or pretending to have a medical condition may exacerbate symptoms. Ultimately, a lack of understanding and the adolescent feeling blamed or targeted may also limit the youth’s progress toward rehabilitation. Thus, involving the entire family in treatment is essential in order to provide pscyhoeducation on psychogenic movement disorders and the recommended course of treatment. Just as families might contribute to the maintenance or exacerbation of symptoms, they are also the key to the success of the treatment program.</p>
<p>Third, families also play a key role in assessment and treatment because of the tendency for psychiatric conditions to run in families. If a parent or sibling is untreated for a psychiatric disorder, this will undoubtedly limit the success of the treatment. For example, up to 80% of anxious children have parents with anxiety.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811422753">12</xref>
</sup> It might be necessary for the adults involved to seek their own psychiatric support should their symptoms be contributing to their adolescent’s psychogenic disorder. An important factor in involving parents and other family members is to help them understand that psychogenic movement disorder is a medical expression of the child’s inability to cope with the ongoing stressors or conflicts because of difficulty communicating their problems. Thus parents and other family members play a crucial role in managing psychogenic movement disorder symptoms at home based on the ongoing behavioral treatment plan, reestablishing normal life routines, and assisting the child to return to school as soon as possible.</p>

<sec id="section16-0883073811422753">
<title>Concluding Thoughts</title>
<p>The assessment and treatment of psychogenic movement disorders is complex because of multiple factors outlined in the current paper. The symptoms of psychogenic movement disorders are debilitating and greatly limit the psychological, emotional, social, and academic functioning of children and adolescents. Therefore, a successful treatment outcome is essential in resuming, sustaining, and promoting healthy child and adolescent development. This disorder is more prevalent in teenage girls. Moreover, involvement in competitive sports or other competitive activities might to be a risk factor.</p>
<p>Overall, children have a better prognosis than adults, with psychogenic movement disorder. The case examples presented in the current paper demonstrate the importance of two factors in the successful treatment of psychogenic movement disorder. Applying a multidisciplinary approach and engaging the family when considering a diagnosis of a psychogenic movement disorder are essential components in the treatment of psychogenic movement disorders. Despite the complexity of these types of disorders, with effective treatment, children and adolescents can overcome a psychogenic movement disorder and resume typical daily functioning.</p>
