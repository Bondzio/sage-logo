<abstract>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate response rates for online and paper versions of an identical questionnaire and the differences between respondents to each and between respondents and non-respondents among a population with type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We mailed letters containing an invitation to complete an online questionnaire to 2045 individuals, followed by two reminders; the second included a paper version of the questionnaire.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 1081 people responded to either version of the questionnaire, yielding a response rate of 54%. Compared to total respondents, respondents completing the online version were more likely to be male, better educated, and younger, and have had diabetes for a shorter period of time. Compared to non-respondents, respondents were more likely to be male and have a lower hemoglobin A1c level.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Web-based surveys are capable of delivering a substantial number of responses cost-effectively. However, disadvantages related to selection bias should be taken into account, and mixed-mode methods should be considered when surveying populations with type 2 diabetes.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742395311413307" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Worldwide, the number of persons living with diabetes is increasing, resulting in challenges for global healthcare systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395311413307">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395311413307">2</xref></sup> It has been stated that healthcare would be cheaper, more effective and closer to individuals' desires and expectations if nurses, physicians and healthcare planners knew more about patients' needs and health-related preferences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395311413307">3</xref></sup> It is therefore necessary to find efficient and effective ways to collect information about patients' preferences and needs for patient education, care, and support. Concurrently, the advantages of using the Internet to communicate with and collect data from persons with diabetes are evident: simultaneous data entry and collection, avoided postal costs, and fast delivery. Thus, online surveys are increasingly being used as an easy, fast, and cost-effective way to gather data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395311413307">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The majority of people living with type 2 diabetes are elderly and have a lower socio-economic status than the population without diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395311413307">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395311413307">9</xref></sup> The Danish population with no or limited access to the Internet typically is older and has lower educational attainment and poorer health status, compared to the population with Internet access.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395311413307">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395311413307">11</xref></sup> Similarly, in the US, compared to Internet users with type 2 diabetes, non-Internet users with type 2 diabetes are older and substantially less educated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395311413307">12</xref></sup> In Denmark, 84% of the population has Internet access at home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395311413307">10</xref></sup> However, Internet access does not necessarily mean that users are adept at functions such as answering online surveys or using web-based educational tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395311413307">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>To understand the advantages and limitations of using the Internet to collect data from individuals with type 2 diabetes, we investigated to what extent responses on a survey targeted at this population could be obtained via the Internet. Further, we investigated differences between individuals responding to an online questionnaire, to a mixed-mode survey (either an online or a mailed paper questionnaire), and those not responding at all.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1742395311413307" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1742395311413307"><title>Population and survey methods</title>
<p>The survey population included all individuals with type 2 diabetes receiving care at Steno Diabetes Center, a diabetological specialist clinic in the Copenhagen area of Denmark. In Denmark, approximately 10% of patients with type 2 diabetes are treated in outpatient clinics such as Steno Diabetes Center, and 90% are treated by general practitioners. The group of patients being treated at outpatients clinics, has longstanding diabetes and a high prevalence of complications, and a majority are treated with insulin. Letters containing information about the survey and the web address for the questionnaire were mailed to all patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to Steno Diabetes Center, in total 2045 individuals. The patients were not informed about the survey beforehand and were not given information about the possibility of receiving a paper based version of the questionnaire in the first letter. The questionnaire contained 39 questions focusing on preferences for patient education, care, patients' psycho-social problems, social network and self-management behaviours among the patients. Patients who called the phone number listed in the letter were either given instructions on how to find and fill out the online questionnaire or they received a paper version of the questionnaire by mail if they did not have access to the Internet or a computer.</p>
<p>Two weeks after the first mailing, we mailed a reminder to participants who had not responded to the online questionnaire. The reminder provided detailed instructions, including screenshots, on how to access the questionnaire. Two weeks after the reminder was mailed, we mailed a third letter to individuals who had not answered the questionnaire. This letter included a paper version of the questionnaire and a prepaid return envelope. The data collection continued for 6 weeks.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1742395311413307"><title>Data sources and analysis</title>
<p>Information on age, gender, latest body mass index (BMI), duration of diabetes and latest hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were obtained from the electronic patient record at Steno Diabetes Center. We used logistic regression analyses to compare non-respondents to respondents on these variables. Several studies have found that age, gender and socio-economic status are related to non-responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395311413307">14</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395311413307">19</xref></sup> BMI, duration of diabetes and HbA1c were included as indicators for disease severity in order to investigate if people with more severe disease participated less in the survey and if fewer responded to the online version of the questionnaire compared to people with less severe diabetes. Regressing the binary variable of response on all the mentioned variables from the patient records allows to assess the independent effect on the response of each variable. We used a similar logistic regression to compare respondents who answered the online questionnaire with those who did not answer online (non-respondents and paper version respondents). This provides a way of comparing the representativeness of the online respondents to the representativeness of the mixed-mode survey respondents who used either the online survey or a paper version. <italic>P</italic> values &lt;0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS 9.2.</p>
<p>All procedures were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 1975, revised Hong Kong 1989.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742395311413307" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>During the data collection period, 1081 individuals completed the online and paper questionnaires, corresponding to a response rate of 54%. Fifty-nine people who had died, had dementia, or reported that they did not have type 2 diabetes were excluded from the study. Of the respondents, 628 (58%) completed the online questionnaire and 453 (42%) completed the paper questionnaire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742395311413307">Figure 1</xref>). After receiving the initial letter, more than 200 individuals, corresponding to more than 10% of the participants, called a phone number listed on the letter. About half of the calls came from those with limited or no Internet access, computer skills, or both. The other half of the calls came from people with Internet access who had experienced problems locating the questionnaire online. In total, 303 people (28% of all respondents), including those who received instructions by phone, completed the online questionnaire after receiving the initial letter. An additional 325 people (30% of all respondents) answered the online questionnaire after receiving the second letter.

<sec id="sec6-1742395311413307"><title>Mixed-mode respondents v. non-respondents</title>
<p>Among total respondents of the mixed-mode survey (online or paper version), 35% were women, compared to 48% of non-respondents. On average, respondents were 0.3 years older than non-respondents, but age was not a significant predictor of response. Significantly more non-respondents (20%) had HbA1c levels above 9%, compared to respondents (15%). Respondents and non-respondents did not differ significantly in terms of BMI and duration of diabetes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742395311413307">Table 1</xref>). The logistic regression of response showed that being male and having a lower HbA1c were significant predictors of response, whereas age, BMI, and duration of diabetes were not.

<sec id="sec7-1742395311413307"><title>Respondents to the online version of the questionnaire</title>
<p>Of the 1986 surveyed individuals, 628 completed the online survey corresponding to an online response rate of 32%. The subgroup using the online version of the questionnaire included a smaller proportion of women than did the group of total respondents. Those who responded to the online questionnaire tended to be younger and had had diabetes for a shorter period of time, compared to total respondents. Of the total respondents a significantly greater share of people had low educational attainment compared to the subgroup using the online version. There were no significant differences between the respondents using the online survey and total respondents in terms of HbA1c and BMI.</p>
<p>The results of the logistic regression analyses of online response vs. non response and paper version response showed that being male, younger and having a lower HbA1c level were significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) related to responding to the online version of the questionnaire.' (`vs. non response and paper version response' is added)</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1742395311413307" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results provide insight into the challenges and possibilities of using online surveys among populations with type 2 diabetes. Of all respondents, 58% completed the online version of the questionnaire. Of the total sample that received mailed information about the survey, about one third completed the online questionnaire, and one fourth completed the paper version of the questionnaire. Respondents included a greater proportion of men than did the group of non-respondents, and a greater proportion of men completed the online questionnaire, compared to the total group of respondents. This means that relatively more women responded to the paper version compared to the online version. Not surprisingly, respondents completing the online questionnaire were better educated, younger, and had a shorter duration of diabetes, compared to the total group of respondents including those who responded to the paper version. The results revealed that the group answering the mixed-mode survey was more representative than the group answering the online survey as fewer patient characteristics were significant predictors of response to the mixed-mode survey.</p>
<p>This is consistent with results from a previous study, which found that patients with type 2 diabetes who did not use the Internet were older and less educated than those who did.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395311413307">12</xref></sup> Further, Statistic Denmark documented that 65% of Danish individuals between the ages of 60 and 74 had access to the Internet, compared to 90% of individuals between 40 and 59 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395311413307">10</xref></sup> In addition, fewer persons with low educational attainment had Internet access than did those with higher educational attainment. On an aggregate level, there are only small differences in Internet use for women and men, but a study of activities of Danish people on their way to retirement showed that men in their 60 s were more interested in using the Internet than were women. There were no significant gender differences for respondents in their 50 s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395311413307">20</xref></sup> This indicates that over time the representativeness of women in online surveys may improve for the elderly.</p>
<p>Limitations to our study include the fact that our study populations may not be representative of the larger population of people with type 2 diabetes in Denmark. Our study population was drawn from a diabetes clinic in Copenhagen. While some patients at the clinic are newly diagnosed and were referred to the clinic for education and self-management support, the majority of clinic patients have had diabetes for many years; they are either receiving care for a short period of time to improve control or are receiving ongoing care due to diabetes complications. As a result, our study population may include more elderly individuals and more people with severe disease and/or diabetes of long duration, compared to the larger population of patients with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of the survey was to uncover preferences regarding patient education and included a number of hypothetical choice questions that are cognitively demanding and increased the length of the survey. These factors may have affected our response rate; a previous survey of persons with type 2 diabetes in the Danish Healthcare System yielded higher response rates than we obtained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395311413307">21</xref></sup> However, differences we observed in age, gender, and educational attainment between respondents using the online survey and those using the paper survey are likely to be similar across populations with type 2 diabetes. The relatively low response rate may also reflect a general trend with declining response rates in Danish surveys. Ekholm et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395311413307">22</xref></sup> found declining response rates in self-administered health questionnaire from 68% in 1994 to 52% in 2005.</p>
<p>A rapidly increasing number of websites offer educational programmes, support groups, chat rooms, and the like for individuals with diabetes. However, our results indicate that a large proportion of patients will not be able to benefit from online programmes. Alternative means for providing support and education are critical to the health of the entire population.</p>
<p>Collecting data using online surveys are fast and cost-effective. However, our results suggest that using mixed-mode surveys compared to using only online surveys may yield a more representative sample. If data are only collected via the Internet, interpretation of results must take into account the likelihood that women, elderly persons, and less educated persons are underrepresented in the sample.</p>
<p>Further, our experience suggests that it is important to give very detailed and easy to understand instructions for locating and completing web-based questionnaires. Providing telephone support can help boost response rates.</p>
<p>Previous studies conducted in the US have found that response rates were higher for online than for paper-based survey instruments, and rates were highest when respondents were offered either format.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395311413307">23</xref></sup> Despite our use of mixed-mode data collection, our response rate was only 54%. Sending out paper questionnaires initially, followed by reminders that included the web address for an online version, resulted in a higher response rate than did the reverse order.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395311413307">23</xref></sup> This approach would have marginally increased the costs of our study, but may have resulted in a higher response rate. Likewise, using face-to-face or telephone interviews may have increased the response rates but would significantly have increased the costs of the data collection.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that it can be difficult to overcome selection bias when conducting web-based surveys in a population of persons with type 2 diabetes. Respondents to online instruments tend to be younger and better educated, compared to those who complete a paper version. Women were underrepresented among those completing the online questionnaire and among all respondents. Online surveys can potentially deliver a substantial number of responses in a cost-effective way, but disadvantages related to selection bias should be taken into account. Mixed-mode methods should be considered when surveying populations with type 2 diabetes and other populations containing a high number of elderly people.</p></sec>
