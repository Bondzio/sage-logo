<abstract>
<p>Studies have examined individual-level associations between fear of crime and various environmental and cognitive assessments but have largely dismissed the relationship between various dimensions of fear and broad behavioural adaptations. Drawing on the risk interpretation model, we specify path models to assess the nature of relationships between perceptions of risk of crime and disorder and the patterning of voluntary and compulsory routine activities. We also explore whether these activities influence the relationship between disorder, risk and fear. Using data from the 2007–8 British Crime Survey, we find support for the proposed distinction between types of routine activities. Although we also find that the various manifestations of fear exhibit different associations with these activities, our models offer marginal support for the proposed mediating role of behavioural policies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fear of crime has received considerable attention across a number of disciplines. This interest has evolved over time from an narrow focus on the computation of prevalence estimates to a broader set of subjects ranging from the examination of different manifestations of fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477370811421648">Liska et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477370811421648">Moore and Shepherd, 2007</xref>) to the specification of links between covariates across levels of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1477370811421648">Rountree and Land, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1477370811421648">Taylor et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1477370811421648">Tseloni and Zarafonitou, 2008</xref>) and over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370811421648">Markowitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1477370811421648">Robinson et al., 2003</xref>). More substantively, the study of fear of crime has also expanded in terms of more systematic theory construction and theory testing. For example, the conventional use of opportunity theories to study fear has been supplemented by emerging frameworks that specify ecological principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370811421648">Gibson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1477370811421648">Wilcox et al., 2003</xref>) or psychological mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477370811421648">Farrall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477370811421648">Gabriel and Greve, 2003</xref>). Moreover, the attention to fear of crime remains strong owing to its intersection with central areas of criminological research including, for example, group threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477370811421648">Chiricos et al., 1997</xref>), delinquent lifestyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1477370811421648">Melde, 2009</xref>), neighbourhood decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1477370811421648">Skogan and Maxfield, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1477370811421648">Wikstrom and Dolmen, 2001</xref>) and police activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370811421648">Ferguson and Mindel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477370811421648">Hinkle and Weisburd, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the importance of these contributions, research has not fully specified the nature of behavioural adaptations linked to the various manifestations of fear. Assessments of the likelihood of criminal victimization, for example, may lead persons to reconfigure some components of their activity spaces, especially those shaped by voluntary decisions (for example, going out at night) rather than by more structured arrangements (for example, work, school). Assessments of local environmental conditions such as levels of physical or social disorder may trigger similar processes of reallocation of leisure and non-leisure activities in terms of relative frequency, nature and setting of specific activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811421648">Ferraro, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these propositions have been articulated in different ways by a number of theoretical approaches (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370811421648">Cohen and Felson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811421648">Ferraro, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370811421648">Skogan, 1990</xref>), most studies have largely focused on the specification of the linkages between specific dimensions of fear and the enactment of discrete preventive measures – for example, installation of alarms, carrying devices for self-defence. Relatively fewer studies have associated perceptions of risk of crime and disorder to broadly defined behaviours or activity spaces. In particular, empirical research has not fully examined how the configuration of these broadly defined behaviours may shape the long-standing positive relationship between perceptions of risk of crime and fear of crime and whether such influence may vary by type of activity space – that is, leisure or voluntary activities vs. non-leisure or compulsory activities. These are important questions because they are part of a set of initiatives to better specify the relationship between attitudinal and behavioural responses to assessments of disorder and other local environmental dangers (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477370811421648">Gabriel and Greve, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370811421648">Jackson and Gray, 2010</xref>) and because they facilitate the articulation of the fear of crime literature with more general analytical frameworks such as routine activities theory.</p>
<p>This study addresses this gap in the literature by exploring the extent to which the general configuration of activity spaces along voluntary and compulsory domains is shaped by perceptions of risk of crime and disorder. We also assess the mediating role of these activity spaces in the relationship between the <italic>cognitive</italic> manifestation of fear of crime (risk of crime) and the <italic>emotional</italic> manifestation of fear (worry of criminal victimization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811421648">Ferraro, 1995</xref>) and between these constructs and perceptions of disorder. To investigate these linkages, we specify a series of path models using individual-level data from a subsample of the 2007–8 British Crime Survey. This article extends prior research by testing a more comprehensive model of fear of crime that includes emotional (worry of crime), cognitive (risk of crime) and environmental (disorder) assessments of personal vulnerabilities. More importantly, it provides an empirical account of the linkages between these various manifestations of fear and two distinct but interrelated types of routine activity – an area of research highlighted by theoretical works but largely dismissed in quantitative studies. As such, our findings may inform not only more theory development in the area of fear of crime but also similar efforts in other substantive areas involving individual choice and behavioural adaptations to environmental conditions – for example, routine activities and victimization, active offenders and rational choice.</p>
<sec id="section2-1477370811421648">
<title>Fear of crime and risk of crime</title>
<p>The conceptualization of fear of crime has been marked by a wide array of contributions and approaches (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1477370811421648">Sparks, 1992</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370811421648">Hale, 1996</xref>, for two contrasting overviews). Models developed in the 1970s and early 1980s tended to consider fear as a single domain encompassing both attitudinal and behavioural manifestations of emotional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477370811421648">Furstenberg, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370811421648">Hale, 1996</xref>). In the late 1980s, a number of works proposed general typologies and more substantive theoretical frameworks. Among these, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477370811421648">Ferraro and LaGrange (1987)</xref> developed an individual-level ‘risk interpretation’ model based on the conceptualization of fear as two distinct but interrelated constructs, a cognitive-based assessment of personal vulnerability (perception of risk of criminal victimization) and a more emotive set of manifestations aligned with the worry of criminal victimization (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811421648">Ferraro, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Research guided by this general framework has consistently shown significant alignment between the cognitive and emotive constructs of fear (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1477370811421648">Wilcox and Land, 1996</xref>), although the measurement of these constructs has not been consistent across studies. For some authors, issues of operationalization of variables illustrate more substantive problems associated with the specification of models and the interpretation of findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477370811421648">Lagrange et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1477370811421648">Sparks, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1477370811421648">Taylor, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1477370811421648">Wilcox and Land, 1996</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1477370811421648">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite these limitations, research has consistently shown that women and older individuals are more likely to report higher levels of fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477370811421648">Liska et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1477370811421648">Warr 1984</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1477370811421648">Wilcox and Land, 1996</xref>), mostly owing to heightened perceptions of risk in terms of perceived likelihood of victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1477370811421648">Smith and Torstensson, 1997</xref>) or perceived lack of personal safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1477370811421648">Wilcox and Land, 1996</xref>). Other studies indicate that direct victimization experiences have a greater impact on perceptions of risk of crime rather than fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370811421648">Ferguson and Mindel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370811421648">Jackson and Gray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477370811421648">Lagrange et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477370811421648">Mesch, 2000</xref>). Similar patterns have been identified with regard to some sociodemographic variables, particularly non-minority status and low socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370811421648">Ferguson and Mindel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1477370811421648">Wilcox and Land, 1996</xref>). Researchers have also found that ratings of risk of crime are negatively influenced by perceptions of disorder and weak social integration and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477370811421648">Lagrange et al., 1992</xref>). Similar findings have been reported using different measures of risk and fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370811421648">Gibson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1477370811421648">McGarrell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477370811421648">Moore and Shepherd, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370811421648">Skogan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1477370811421648">Wyant, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>There have been few empirical studies on individual-level responses to these various manifestations of fear partially owing to the absence of a dominant theoretical framework, but also because of more structural limitations related to the nature of available survey data and research designs. For example, given the pervasive use of single-equation regression models applied to cross-sectional data, researchers have been unable to investigate the underlying mechanisms explaining some of the observed relationships between key constructs, thus limiting their ability to fully disentangle direct and indirect relationships among constructs, as well as some of the causes of fear of crime from its consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1477370811421648">Miller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370811421648">Rader et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these shortcomings, a number of typologies on the consequences of fear of crime have been developed by level of response (individual vs. neighbourhood) and nature (behavioural vs. cognitive) or setting (public vs. private) (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1477370811421648">Skogan and Maxfield, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1477370811421648">Yin, 1985</xref>). In this context, behavioural responses to perceptions of fear and risk have been largely conceptualized as encompassing different types of coping strategies, including those aimed at preventing victimization or mitigating losses by substituting or modifying activity spaces or implementing more narrowly defined protective measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811421648">Ferraro, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477370811421648">Lee and DeHart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1477370811421648">Yin 1980</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370811421648">Jackson and Gray, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477370811421648">Liska et al. (1988)</xref>, for example, report that fear of crime defined in terms of low levels of perceived safety constrains social behaviour, creating a feedback loop by which more fear leads to more social isolation and subsequently even higher fear (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370811421648">Garofalo, 1981</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370811421648">Markowitz et al. (2001)</xref> find that the relative quality of neighbourly activities is both a cause and a consequence of fear. According to Rountree and Land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1477370811421648">1996</xref>: 152), the reconfiguration of behaviours or activities ‘can be structured rationally by cognitive perceptions, such as fear of crime or perceived risk’. For some, the alignment between attitudinal dimensions of fear and its behavioural manifestations is such that these constructs can be collapsed into a single indicator measuring ‘threat of criminal victimization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370811421648">Rader et al., 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811421648">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>) or a new dimension of ‘functional fear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370811421648">Jackson and Gray, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>More generally, however, both the theoretical and empirical associations between attitudinal measures of fear and behavioural responses remain elusive. Conceptually, as posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477370811421648">Cook (1986)</xref>, opportunity theories traditionally employed to study individual-level variation in fear of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370811421648">Cohen and Felson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370811421648">Garofalo, 1981</xref>) have dismissed the idea that exposure to public interactions and risky activities may be guided by concerns about potential victimization, and that persons may configure their activity spaces based on calculations of vulnerability, perceived dangers and the seriousness of potential threats. Empirically, studies adhering to this paradigm have conceptualized daily behavioural patterns as exogenous factors determined by socioeconomic factors and demographic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1477370811421648">Rountree and Land, 1996</xref>), with fear of crime or perceived risk of victimization playing a marginal role in the general structuring of these activity spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811421648">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1477370811421648">Yin, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>A handful of studies have moved away from this set of approaches, examining routine activities and other broadly defined behavioural responses as covariates of fear of crime. However, the scope of their contributions has been limited by the narrow operationalization of routine activities in terms of neighbourly activities or social gatherings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1477370811421648">Yin, 1985</xref>), unidimensional measures of fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370811421648">Rader et al., 2007</xref>), small sample sizes and low response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477370811421648">Mesch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1477370811421648">Miller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1477370811421648">Otis, 2007</xref>). These are significant shortcomings because proposed associations between routine activities and fear of crime are based on broad measures of these two constructs across contexts and populations (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370811421648">Cohen and Felson, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>To address these concerns more adequately, we examine the role of routine activities in explaining individual-level variation in levels of the emotional dimension of fear of crime (worry of criminal victimization). Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477370811421648">Ferraro and LaGrange (1987)</xref>, we model worry of crime as associated with cognitive assessments of risk of crime (perceived likelihood of criminal victimization) as well as perceptions of social and physical disorder (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811421648">Ferraro, 1995</xref>). We extend prior research by examining (a) the extent to which voluntary and compulsory routine activities are shaped by cognitions of crime and disorder, and (b) whether voluntary and compulsory routine activities influence the association between the various dimensions of fear (cognitive, emotional) and between these and perceptions of disorder. The next section provides a rationale for this strategy, and is followed by a description of the data and methods employed in the study.</p>

<title>Specifying the role of routine activities and disorder</title>
<p>A number of theories focus on the role of patterned social behaviours and social interactions to explain variation in fear of crime. For the most part, these borrow from the broader literature on adaptations to the threat of criminal victimization. For example, within the general family of opportunity theories, the lifestyle exposure theory of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811421648">Hindelang et al. (1978)</xref> argues that the distribution of fear and victimization across individuals is conditioned by relatively stable patterns of behaviour associated with demographic and socioeconomic factors such as gender, race, age and income. These factors are said to alter both voluntary and compulsory activities, modifying an individual’s exposure to crime via interactions with crime-prone settings and personal contacts. A more comprehensive opportunity theory is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370811421648">Cohen and Felson’s (1979)</xref> routine activities theory, which argues that crimes are more likely to occur when motivated offenders, suitable targets and incapable guardians converge in time and space. Routine activities are broadly defined to include formal and informal activities that are both prevalent and recurrent. These can increase the likelihood of victimization events at the individual and aggregate levels by increasing target suitability and decreasing relative guardianship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1477370811421648">Tewksbury and Mustaine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1477370811421648">Wittebrood and Nieuwbeerta, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies guided by this opportunity-oriented framework have generally found that individuals who spend more time at home decrease their actual risk of victimization (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477370811421648">Meier and Miethe, 1993</xref>). However, research on the relationship between activity spaces and perceived risk of crime or worry of criminal victimization is more difficult to document, given pervasive differences in measures and analytical models. Through the 1980s, this line of research received considerable attention, partially owing to the growing saliency of fear of crime as a distinct social phenomenon but also, and more importantly, owing to the notion that some population groups such as the elderly were de facto ‘prisoners of fear’ in an era of high crime rates and great social anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1477370811421648"><italic>TIME Magazine</italic>, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Early studies did not provide support for the positive relationship between higher levels fear of crime and the configuration of more limited voluntary behaviours (Clarke and Lewis, 1982; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1477370811421648">Yin, 1985</xref>), although more recent works have reported opposite findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477370811421648">Liska et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1477370811421648">Oh and Kim, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477370811421648">Mesch (2000)</xref> showed that heightened perceptions of local crime were associated with a lower frequency of leisure activities measured in terms of night-time activities (for example, going to the cinema or the pub). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1477370811421648">Otis (2007)</xref> reported that respondents who perceived a greater likelihood of victimization were significantly more likely to spend more time alone, although more pro-social measures of routine activities did not exhibit a similar pattern (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370811421648">Rader et al., 2007</xref>). In a carefully designed study, Liska et al. found that perceptions of personal safety and activity spaces were related in an ‘escalating causal loop’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477370811421648">1988</xref>: 835) with lower levels of perceived safety, leading to more constrained behaviours and these behaviours further amplifying ratings of vulnerability (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370811421648">Markowitz et al., 2001</xref>, for a similar finding linked to neighbourly activities). Despite the value of these contributions, however, the broader set of studies on behavioural responses to fear are significantly limited by the use of a single construct to measure fear, and the narrow and inconsistent operationalization of behavioural responses – largely limiting these to local social interactions (for example, attending parties, talking to neighbours, staying at home). Overall, the relatively thin empirical support for the relationship between broad behavioural patterns and fear of crime contrasts with the theoretical emphasis granted to this interaction by some scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370811421648">Cohen and Felson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477370811421648">Cook, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370811421648">Garofalo, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on the link between fear and behavioural responses has focused on narrowly defined activities more closely associated with coping strategies such as protective and preventative actions used to modify more general ‘behavioural policies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811421648">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>) – for example, jogging during the day rather than at night. This line of research has received more empirical attention: for example, fear of crime has been linked to avoidance patterns and precautionary measures – for example, limited exposure to public areas at night, group travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1477370811421648">Skogan and Maxfield, 1981</xref>) – and protective behaviours – for example, purchase of extra locks, weapons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1477370811421648">Miller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1477370811421648">Warr, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1477370811421648">Yin, 1980</xref>). These findings have been replicated across various dimensions of fear, including not only fear as an emotional construct but also perceived risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811421648">Ferraro, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1477370811421648">Liska, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1477370811421648">Otis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370811421648">Rader et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies combining opportunity theory with other frameworks such as social disorganization and control theories argue that broad activity patterns are usually the cause and not the consequence of perceived levels of risk and that these levels of risk in turn affect a more narrowly defined set of precautionary measures (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1477370811421648">Wilcox and Land, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1477370811421648">Wilcox et al., 2003</xref>). Within this tradition, some studies have linked perceptions of disorder to routine activities, finding that behavioural patterns may lead to more fear in areas with higher levels of perceived disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1477370811421648">Wilcox and Land, 1996</xref>). Disorder may also directly influence the mobilization of precautionary activities (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477370811421648">Carvalho and Lewis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477370811421648">Casten and Payne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1477370811421648">Wilson and Kelling, 1982</xref>) and lead to weaker interactions with neighbours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370811421648">Markowitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1477370811421648">Robinson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1477370811421648">Taylor, 1997</xref>). As a whole these studies show that, despite the methodological limitations associated with the use of perceptual data to measure disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1477370811421648">Taylor, 1999</xref>), ratings of disorder may not only explain variation for various constructs of fear but also influence fear levels through the reconfiguration of routine activities. Although the former proposition has been systematically addressed in the literature, the latter has been somewhat limited to the narrow specification of behavioural patterns such as neighbourliness and protective measures of overly general indicators of routine activities that ignore the substantive distinction between voluntary and compulsory behaviours. Our research aims to substantiate this argument with a more comprehensive model of fear of crime and broader measures of routine activities.</p>

<title>Current study</title>
<p>The current study answers three interrelated questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1477370811421648" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How are perceptions of risk of crime and disorder related to routine activities?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is there empirical support for the distinction between voluntary and compulsory routine activities in the context of broad behavioural responses to fear of crime?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do routine activities influence the relationship between the various dimensions of fear of crime – that is, emotional (worry), cognitive (risk of victimization) and environmental (perception of disorder)?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To address these questions, we draw on the risk interpretation model by Ferraro and LaGrange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477370811421648">1987</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811421648">Ferraro, 1995</xref>) to specify a series of recursive path models using maximum likelihood estimators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370811421648">Arbuckle, 2005</xref>). This approach allows us to test simultaneously our full theoretical model using a series of multiple equations while also providing a better way to identify underlying mechanisms linking key constructs via the estimation of direct and indirect effects.</p>
<p>Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811421648">Ferraro (1995)</xref>, we first hypothesize the emotional dimension of fear of crime (worry) to be positively related with cognitive assessments of risk of crime and disorder. Second, we expand this baseline model to include voluntary and compulsory routine activities, which we hypothesize to vary in the opposite direction of individual assessments of risk and disorder (that is, more perceived risk and disorder, more limited activity spaces). Further, we anticipate this inverse relationship to be more pronounced for voluntary activities, because these provide more opportunities for realignments of activities based on individual cognitions. Lastly, we hypothesize that greater exposure to public settings through routine activities will be associated with lower levels of emotional fear, because we expect individuals to adjust their activity spaces to calculations of risk of victimization and perceptions of disorder.</p>
<sec id="section5-1477370811421648">
<title>Data and methods</title>
<p>The 2007–8 British Crime Survey (BCS) was used for this analysis. The BCS is one of the largest social research surveys in England and Wales and includes a wide array of measures on attitudinal and behavioural correlates of crime and victimization. Since 2001 the BCS has been administered annually to over 40,000 respondents aged 16 and above using face-to-face interviews. Consistent with earlier waves of data collection, sampling for the 2007–8 BCS was conducted using a multi-stage stratified random sample using the Postcode Address File of the general population as the sampling frame (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477370811421648">Kershaw et al., 2008</xref>, for more details). Given that the BSC has asked respondents about fear of crime since 1982, it has been consistently employed to assess various aspects of fear of crime, including, for example, its relationship with age across different fear constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477370811421648">Moore and Shepherd, 2007</xref>), linkages between poverty and perceptions of vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1477370811421648">Pantazis, 2000</xref>) and new domains of fear based on measures of frequency and intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477370811421648">Gray et al., 2008</xref>). The BCS is an ideal data set for the purposes of this research because it contains rich information on the behaviours, attitudes, lifestyles, perceptions and fears of respondents.</p>
<p>Our analyses did not take full advantage of the core sample of the BCS because survey items on perceived likelihood of victimization were asked only for a randomly drawn subsample of respondents (25 percent of the core sample or about 11,500 cases). This sample was reconfigured to include only individual respondents with complete information for all study variables (<italic>N</italic> = 11,315).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1477370811421648">2</xref></sup> Respondents were between 16 and 101 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 50.03, SD = 18.36). Over 53 percent of the sample was female and 93 percent white. About half of the sample was married, and approximately 8 per cent reported a victimization incident in the prior 12 months. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477370811421648">Table 1</xref> shows additional descriptive statistics for the study sample.</p>

<title>Fear of crime (emotional dimension of fear of crime)</title>
<p>Worry of criminal victimization – the emotional dimension of fear of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811421648">Ferraro, 1995</xref>) – was measured using a four-item standardized scale. Respondents were asked how worried (from 1 = ‘not at all worried’, to 4 = ‘very worried’) they were about being victimized (that is, being physically attacked by a stranger, having their house broken into, being mugged or robbed, and being insulted or pestered). The items were reverse-coded to reflect increasing worry of victimization. Using principal axis factoring (varimax rotation) we confirmed that each of these items was highly associated with the others and loaded into a single factor capturing 60 percent of the total variance (α = .85) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477370811421648">Table 3</xref> in the Appendix).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1477370811421648">
<title>Perceived risk of crime (cognitive dimension of fear of crime)</title>
<p>To measure perceived risk of crime, we developed a two-item standardized scale. BCS respondents were asked to rate the likelihood of becoming the victim of specific crimes, including burglary, robbery and assault, among others (from 1 = ‘very likely’, to 4 = ‘very unlikely’). Although these items loaded into a single factor, some variables (for example, burglary) exhibited very low factor loadings and low inter-item correlations, reducing the internal consistency of the resulting construct. As such, we retained the two items with the highest factor loadings – likelihood of being ‘mugged or robbed’ and ‘attacked or physically assaulted’ (α = .82). Answers were reverse-coded to reflect higher risk of victimization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1477370811421648">
<title>Perceived disorder</title>
<p>A four-item standardized scale was used to measure the construct of perceived environmental disorder. The items were reverse-coded to reflect increasing perception of local social and physical environmental threats. BCS respondents were asked how much of a problem (from 1 = ‘not a problem at all’, to 4 = ‘very big problem’) particular disorders were in their neighbourhood. These disorders included: teenagers hanging around, rubbish or litter, vandalism or graffiti, and people being drunk or rowdy. We developed the construct of perceived disorder using principal axis factoring with varimax rotation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477370811421648">Table 3</xref> in the Appendix). The items were highly associated and loaded into a single factor capturing approximately 53 percent of the variance (α = .81).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1477370811421648">
<title>Voluntary and compulsory routine activities</title>
<p>We examined four questions of the BCS related to activity spaces of survey respondents. More specifically, these questions elicited information about the number of hours respondents spend away from home during the day (from 1 = ‘none’, to 6 = ‘7 hours or more’), their full-time student or employment status ( for each of these questions, 1 = full-time employment or student status, 0 = otherwise), and the number of times they visited pubs or bars, and nightclubs and discos during the month prior to the interview (for each of these questions, response categories ranged from 1 = ‘none’, to 5 = ‘more than 12 times’). As in the case of measures of emotional and cognitive fear of crime, we assessed the association between these items using principal axis factoring with varimax rotation. Results revealed the presence of two distinct factors aligned with our substantive distinction between compulsory and voluntary routine activities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477370811421648">Table 3</xref> in the Appendix). The variables of time spent away from home during the day and full-time employment/education status loaded into the construct of compulsory routine activities (α = .60). The construct of voluntary routine activities included both BCS measures of night-time activities – frequency of visits to pubs and bars, and visits to nightclubs or discos (α = .41).</p>
<p>Although similar measures of activity spaces have been employed by prior studies on fear of crime (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477370811421648">Mesch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1477370811421648">Otis, 2007</xref>), no studies that we are aware of have sought to combine these items into higher-order constructs. Our operationalization of routine activities is a first step in this direction, broadening the scope of measures and grounding these on relevant theory and research on fear of crime. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370811421648">Cohen and Felson (1979)</xref> for example, our measure of compulsory routine activities reflects not only stable activity spaces (that is, full-time work/education) but also other more general and recurrent forces that structure people’s social routines ( that is, time spent outside of the home during the day). Voluntary routine activities, in contrast, reflect not only day-time but also night-time patterns of social interaction (that is, frequency of visits to pubs and clubs) aimed primarily at fulfilling leisure or recreation needs. Although more comprehensive measures of both compulsory and voluntary activities could have been implemented (for example, childcare, shopping, attending parties), these may lack the stability and frequency to become activity spaces as described by routine activities theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370811421648">Cohen and Felson, 1979</xref>). More generally, the use of a broader set of behavioural markers to measure these activity spaces may introduce new challenges: For example, the creation of latent constructs to study these markers requires significant dependency across items, an issue that may have an uneven impact on the specification of voluntary and compulsory routine activities – that is, the former are more likely to include a greater set of independent and more heterogeneous patterns reflecting broader individual choices and resources. Thus, the development of more complex, multidimensional accounts of activity spaces, particularly in the case of voluntary activities, may amplify measurement problems in constructs and may be significantly limited by the nature of available data.</p>
<p>The low internal consistency of our measure of voluntary routine activities illustrates this set of challenges (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477370811421648">Table 3</xref> in the Appendix). We sought to address this problem by examining the stability of model estimates to various specifications of the construct and by discussing implications for the interpretation of our findings and results.</p>

<sec id="section11-1477370811421648">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>We include a number of control variables related to all of our key constructs of interest. Residential tenure was measured using a single survey question that asked respondents how long they have resided in their neighbourhood (from 1 = ‘less than 12 months’, to 7 = ‘20 years or longer’). Recent victimization was measured using an index derived from six survey questions that asked respondents whether or not they have been victims of various personal and property crimes in the past 12 months (0 = ‘no’, 1 = ‘yes’). The coding for the demographics variables was as follows: sex (0 = female, 1 = male), age (respondent’s age in years), race (0 = non-white, 1 = white) and marital status (0 = not married, 1 = married).</p>

<p>Some of these bivariate results were consistent with prior research and theory – for example, the relative alignment between the two measures of routine activities and between the cognitive (risk) and emotional dimensions of fear (worry).

Also, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1477370811421648">Table 4</xref> in the Appendix provides the estimates in table form as well as general information on the goodness of fit of all the models discussed here. Consistent with prior research (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477370811421648">Lagrange et al., 1992</xref>) we find that variation in worry of criminal victimization is largely associated with variation in perceived risk of victimization (<italic>β</italic> = .385), with perceptions of disorder having a positive but largely indirect effect through risk. The overall fit of the model was adequate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1477370811421648">3</xref></sup></p>

<p>Model 2 is used to address our first research question aimed at examining how perceptions of risk and disorder relate to routine activities. Drawing from our factor analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477370811421648">Table 3</xref> in the Appendix), we specify these activities using two distinct constructs (compulsory/voluntary activities). The regression results are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477370811421648">Figure 2</xref>. Consistent with our second set of hypotheses, estimates indicate that a heightened sense of disorder is associated with more limited routine activities, although this pattern was significant only for voluntary activity spaces activities (<italic>β</italic> = –.051). However, contrary to our expectations, we find a direct relationship with regard to perceptions of risk of victimization, with higher levels of perceived risk associated with more voluntary routine activities (<italic>β</italic> = .046). Results suggest that individuals who perceive a higher likelihood of victimization and lower levels of disorder are also those with more expansive voluntary routine activities, although estimates should be interpreted with caution owing to their relatively small effect sizes. Overall, however, the fact that disorder and risk are shown to influence routine activities in different directions highlights the importance of accounting for multiple dimensions of fear of crime and associated constructs.</p>

<p>Our second question on the empirical distinction between voluntary and compulsory activities was partially verified by the confirmatory factor analysis on the four BCS questions on activity spaces (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477370811421648">Table 3</xref> in the Appendix). Model 2 provides additional support for this distinction – the overall fit of the model was lower when specifying a single construct of routine activities – showing a moderate positive correlation between the two measures of behavioural patterns (<italic>r</italic> = .145).</p>
<p>Somewhat aligned with our expectations, the measure of voluntary activities was more sensitive to assessments of risk of crime or disorder compared with compulsory activities (the latter was not statistically linked to either assessment). This provides partial support for the idea that routine activities reflect perceptions of dangers and that this linkage of perceptions and behaviours may be more fluid for activity-spaces with more room for individual choice.</p>
<p>Model 3 combines the paths from Models 1 and 2 to examine the relationship between routine activities and emotional fear (worry) controlling for perceptions of risk of crime and disorder. We use this model to answer our third research question, that is, to assess whether the specification of routine activities mediates the baseline relationship between fear, risk and disorder. The standardized regression results generated are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477370811421648">Figure 3</xref>. Consistent with our expectations on the association between activity spaces and fear, we observe small yet significant negative relationships between routine activities and levels of worry of crime, with a greater effect size for voluntary activities (<italic>β</italic> = –.051 vs. <italic>β</italic> = –.028). More importantly, model estimates fail to provide support for our mediation hypothesis – that is, the direction, significance and magnitude of associations between fear and risk and disorder in the baseline model remained largely unaltered when including our two measures of routine activities. We confirmed this finding using the bootstrap method to recalculate our maximum likelihood estimates for direct and indirect effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477370811421648">Cheung and Lau, 2008</xref>). Using this approach we found that both measures of routine activities not only contributed very little to the indirect (positive) effect of disorder on worry of crime but actually suppressed somewhat the total (positive) effect of risk of crime on emotional fear. Overall, these results suggest that voluntary routines in particular are sensitive to calculations or risk of victimization and disorder and that these adaptations also vary across levels of emotional fear. Both routine and compulsory activities may suppress some emotional fear, partially in reaction to these perceptions.</p>

<p>Across all three models, the significance and direction of associations between key constructs and control variables were consistent with prior research. For example, compared with men, women reported higher levels of perceived risk of victimization and, to a lesser extent, worry of crime; we found no effect of sex on perceptions of disorder (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1477370811421648">Table 4</xref> in the Appendix). Consistent with our rationale for the split specification of voluntary/compulsory activities, the former were more fluidly shaped by socioeconomic predictors, whereas the latter were entirely structured along strata of gender/age and marital status.</p>
<p>We found our estimates to be rather robust to various specifications of constructs and associations. For example, we tested our main model (Model 3) using several unidimensional versions of routine activities – in all cases, model fit and parsimony were lower than reported using the version presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477370811421648">Figure 3</xref>. Given the low reliability of our construct of voluntary routine activities, we re-specified the main model entering the construct’s survey items separately and found no significant differences in estimates. We also estimated all three models using a more expansive construct for risk of victimization that include risk of burglary – coefficients and fit estimates were nearly identical to those presented here.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This paper sought to specify the relationship between routine activities and fear of crime, while controlling for environmental cues (that is, perception of social and physical disorder) and cognitive mechanisms (that is, assessment of risk of criminal victimization). To estimate the magnitude and significance of these relationships, we operationalized the risk interpretation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811421648">Ferraro, 1995</xref>) using a series of path models applied to individual-level data from a subsample of the 2007–8 British Crime Survey. More specifically, we expanded the conventional approach to the assessment of behavioural correlates of fear by specifying two broadly defined types of routine activities – compulsory and voluntary – and expanding the operationalization of fear using three interrelated constructs (disorder, perceived risk of victimization, and worry of criminal victimization). Consistent with prior studies, we find a close degree of alignment between these constructs (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370811421648">Markowitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1477370811421648">Robinson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1477370811421648">Wilcox and Land, 1996</xref>). However, results also indicate that their association with routine activities was not uniform: Partially consistent with our initial set of hypotheses, we find that variation in perceived risk of crime and disorder influences voluntary routine activities but not compulsory activities, with a more expansive activity space reported by those perceiving less disorder and greater likelihood of victimization (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477370811421648">Mesch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477370811421648">Meier and Miethe, 1993</xref>). This suggests that persons may effectively adapt daily activities <italic>under their control</italic> to explicit calculations of perceived environmental dangers and other vulnerabilities. Contrary to expectations, however, greater perceptions of risk of crime were linked to more frequent voluntary routine activities, suggesting perhaps that respondents normalize exposure to threatening environments or use recreation as a coping mechanism. It is also possible that assessments of risk of victimization are in fact determined by voluntary activities, with people who spend more time socializing outside having a greater sense of awareness of potential dangers (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370811421648">Jackson and Gray, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Results from Model 2 and the confirmatory factor analysis of routine activities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477370811421648">Table 3</xref> in the Appendix) provided support for our second hypothesis, that is, the need to differentiate general behavioural patterns along voluntary and compulsory domains. Although this distinction had been proposed by some scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811421648">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>), studies have not fully explored its empirical relevance, leading to inconsistent findings regarding the significance of routine activities to explain variation in fear. Our study shows not only that routine activities are correlated with variation in cognitive assessments of risk of victimization and disorder but also that these two constructs shape behavioural patterns in different directions (more frequent voluntary activities linked to heightened sense of risk of crime and lower perceived disorders). Further, consistent with our expectations, models also show that voluntary activities are more fluid and sensitive to variation in socioeconomic variables compared with compulsory activities and that, as such, it is more effectively linked to lower levels of emotional fear (worry).</p>
<p>The mediating role of routine activities in the relationship between risk of crime, disorder and emotional fear was more systematically addressed in Model 3. We hypothesized that increased exposure to public settings along voluntary and compulsory activity spaces would be associated with lower levels of fear, particularly in the case of voluntary activities. Findings provide some support for this hypothesis. The more respondents engaged in both voluntary and compulsory activities, the lower their levels of worry of crime. This relationship holds at the bivariate level, and when specifying a multivariate model with other manifestations of fear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477370811421648">Figure 3</xref>). However, the substantive interpretation of these associations suggests a rather marginal direct influence of routine activities on emotional fear, as indicated by the small effect sizes of these constructs. Similarly, we found little evidence supporting the mediating role of routine activities in the relationship between disorder, cognitive fear and emotional fear: indirect effects of both disorder and risk through routine activities were significant but minimal in magnitude.</p>
<p>We draw on these observations to posit that cognitions of vulnerability (disorder and risk of crime) are linked to a minor adjustment of behavioural routines, particularly those more likely to be controlled by individuals (voluntary activities), although emotional manifestations of fear remain sensitive to the overall level of individual exposure to threatening environments and structural vulnerabilities (for example, gender, race). This finding is consistent with recent research seeking to better integrate attitudinal and behavioural adaptations to fear of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370811421648">Jackson and Gray, 2010</xref>). Our findings also lend support for studies arguing for the need to consider the role of choice in the configuration of broad behavioural policies (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811421648">Ferraro, 1995</xref>). Consistent with this general orientation, we find that the relationship between routine activities and emotional fear is more pronounced for voluntary behaviours compared with compulsory activities because activities such as going to the pub can be more easily realigned on the basis of individual calculations.</p>
<p>These findings should be interpreted with caution given the low reliability of our measure of voluntary routine activities. This may be indicative of an oversimplification of this particular type of behavioural policy caused by the underlying heterogeneity of choice-based (voluntary) activities relative to the more structured and interrelated set of structured (compulsory) routine activities. The weak construct validity of the voluntary routine activities measure may have also led to biased model results – that is, identification of non-significant relationships regardless of actual links between variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1477370811421648">Shook et al., 2004</xref>). To minimize these challenges we operationalized voluntary activities in different ways and found model estimates to be consistent with those presented in this paper. Further, we also noted that all key relationships involving the construct of voluntary activities remained significant across these various specifications.</p>
<p>More generally, although this study provided a basic distinction in types of routine activities along compulsory and voluntary domains, other individual-level behavioural patterns may also be related to variation in various manifestations of fear – for instance, considering whether these activities occurred in outdoor locations or indoor locations. In addition, future data collection and data analysis efforts should consider adding additional survey questions and protocols to further refine theory and research on the relationship between cognitive and behavioural processes linked to fear. For example, more specific individual-level information on patterns of utilization of leisure time (for example, frequency, duration, access) would not only strengthen empirical distinctions between types of routine activity but also better inform theory development on the relationship between individual choices and fear of crime.</p>

<p>Some studies operationalize perceptions of risk as a diffuse notion of personal vulnerability linked to a sense of safety (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477370811421648">Liska et al., 1988</xref>). Others define vulnerability in terms of subjective crime rates or concern about crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1477370811421648">McGarrell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477370811421648">Mesch, 2000</xref>) or even worry about crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370811421648">Ferguson and Mindel, 2007</xref>). Although there is generally substantial alignment across these measures of risk, differences in specification approaches have important implications for the interpretation and contextualization of findings. Because our research seeks to better specify links between attitudes and behaviours, we decided to narrowly bound the measurement of risk and fear to estimates of the likelihood of criminal victimization (risk of crime) and worry about criminal victimization (emotional fear). This approach is consistent with many BCS-based studies of fear of crime (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477370811421648">Kershaw et al., 2008</xref>). We are indebted to the anonymous reviewers for this helpful suggestion.</p>

<p>BCS variables reflecting socioeconomic status (for example, educational attainment, income) were not included in the analyses because of high levels of missing data. Preliminary analyses showed that the list-wise deletion of cases implemented for this study did not alter significantly the composition of the original sample.</p>

<p>Consistent with prior research, we assess goodness of fit relying primarily on the Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477370811421648">Hu and Bentler, 1999</xref>). Acceptable levels of the GFI should exceed .90 and the RMSEA should be less than .05.</p>
