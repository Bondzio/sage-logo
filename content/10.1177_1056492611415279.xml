<abstract>
<p>Isolating the cultural within organizational analysis and extracting cultural lessons from managerial situations have generated cross-national categories of culture and competing paradigms for studying the cultural, intercultural, and cross-cultural influences of economic and social life. As organizations around the world combine different cultural diversities, and the use of individual, national, and political aggregates of study do not necessarily transpose well onto many business situations (especially in atypical examples such as those presented in nongovernmental organizations [NGOs], clubs, associations, and public agencies), the use of nation profiles and dimensions as analytical terms for culture in organizations has become questionable. This conceptual article draws from critical theory, anthropology, cultural studies, and management literature in investigating to what extent national character and dimensions should still be the dominant filter for studying people and culture in organizations. Postcolonial theory has revealed that research paradigms promoting gender, nation, age, ethnic, and other categories suffer from bias implicit in all “essentializing” and “reifying” projects. Such designs are too overconfident in their account of culture and do not sufficiently recognize a diversity of organizational subjects as a variable for study. A postnational cultural analysis is prescribed requiring a mitigated use of nation and dimension frameworks, a stakeholder perspective, and a research standpoint that transcends the perspective of the managerial function. Cross-cultural, intercultural, and multicultural business situations in the context of global work require a transcultural paradigm, created by and serving multiple cultures and acting across national and occupational boundaries. This accommodates the fact that much global trade is conducted primarily by oligopolistic corporations and that organizations not prioritizing profit objectives (NGOs, humanitarian associations, virtual chats, and public agencies) offer completely original avenues of cultural research. This article explores options for integrating the cultural credibly among the explanatory tools of contractual human organization and for innovating on the methods, designs, and formats of cultural research for management studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This conceptual article draws from critical theory, anthropology, cultural studies, and management literature in investigating to what extent national character and dimensions should still be the dominant filter for studying people and culture in organizations. The section titled “An Overview of Cross-Cultural Research Streams” provides an overview of different streams of cross-cultural research as they have emerged in the social sciences and particularly management studies over the last 50 years, framing these within the circumstances of ever-developing economies. The section “A Critical Perspective on ‘Scientific’ Cultural Study” offers a broad critical analysis of the most well-known research applications, pointing to key advances as well as problematical flaws (particularly the use of universal dimensions summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1056492611415279">Table 1</xref>) and more importantly the questionable sustainability of many cultural claims for contemporary organizations working within interdependent economies. The section “The Art and Philosophy of a New Cultural Study” points to subject areas and methodological avenues where some of these flaws may be addressed, emphasizing a multidisciplinary and transcultural perspective based on previous groundbreaking publications summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1056492611415279">Table 2</xref>. The last section “Three Proposals for Reframing, Deframing, and Unframing Culture” offers three overarching recommendations for designing research that integrates the cultural credibly among the explanatory tools of contractual human organization, innovating with multidisciplinary and multiparadigmatic methods, designs, and epistemologies.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Uncertainty avoidance</td>
<td>To avoid uncertainty by reliance on social norms, rituals and bureaucratic practices</td>
<td>Attempts to make the human condition more predictable belong to the realm of religion, science, and law. Uncertainty testing evaluates risk aversion, conformity, faith, and bureaucracy, which are inversely proportional to entrepreneurial activity. Educational level, gross domestic product (GDP), type of industry, and local history will skew uncertainty indices. This is a path-dependent dimension with probable overlap with many other variables such as personality, recent political conflict, natural disaster, poverty, wealth, corruption, and gender.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Power distance</td>
<td>Expectations of and compliance with unequal power distribution</td>
<td>The unequal distribution of power in organizations reiterates other institutions such as patriarchal authority common in many preindustrial societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1056492611415279">Inglehart, 1997</xref>). As power distance collapses with higher levels of education, secularism, well-being, and GDP, it is mediated by the local economy, competition, and political institutions. There is the additional problem of distinguishing between the terms <italic>power</italic> and <italic>hierarchy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492611415279">D’Iribarne, 1997</xref>). Strong egalitarian values happen to correlate with small, wealthy states exhibiting high levels of general education (Scandinavia and the Germanic countries are good examples).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Individualism/collectivism (Hofstede’s framework)</td>
<td>The degree to which people feel autonomous in their life decisions or rather tied to social constraints and expectations.</td>
<td>“Individualism” and “collectivism” serve situational, historical, and institutional predicaments and can be considered a rational and functional response to an environment rather than an unconscious, genetic, or value-induced reflex built into cognitive structures inculcated by a cultural past. Variations on the typologies of collectivism and individualism have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-1056492611415279">Triandis, 1995</xref>). Self-expression and individualism increase with economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1056492611415279">Inglehart, 1997</xref>), independent of any culture, and they are vital in small populations faced with outside competition for resources. Entitled individuals in positions of power embrace autonomy even if they live in a “collective” culture. Like the power index, the individualism and collectivism surveys scatter countries according to predictable economic and demographic patterns (Triandis, 2004), so they might not really inform us at all about any particular organizational dynamic, nor do they inform about the organizational and individual variations within similar socioeconomic circumstances. Individual aggregate needs careful separation from nation aggregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1056492611415279">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Although individuals are the basic subject of psychological analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1056492611415279">Smith, 2004</xref>), the socialization of individuals and their interaction with a society is a matter to be studied at the level of families, peers, neighborhoods, schools, cities, and nations each with its own statistical imprint of culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1056492611415279">Smith, 2004</xref>). S. Schwartz controlled his value data with gross national product and a social index, leading to his proposal of differentiated individual and nation indices of itemized values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1056492611415279">Schwartz, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1056492611415279">1994</xref>) for cross-cultural comparison. The assumed “isomorphism of constructs” has been central in deciding how to use and understand culture in the managerial sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1056492611415279">Fischer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1056492611415279">Van de Vijver, van Hemert, &amp; Poortinga, 2008</xref>). As no individual can create his or her discourse and sensemaking process in isolation to the rest of society, individuals are poor candidates for cultural sensemaking. Postmodern criticism rejects the possibility of any self-determining individual because the unitary, personal self is an illusion of contemporary society evidenced by the necessary reproductions and simulations in language and behavior that individuals engage in to sustain membership in any society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611415279">Alvesson &amp; Deetz, 2006</xref>; Baudrillard, 1983).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Societal collectivism</td>
<td>Encouraging collective distribution of rewards and action</td>
<td>The ethics of solidarity may be encouraged by certain religious and spiritual doctrines, but egalitarian ethics are one of the hallmarks of the welfare state. The dimension is not methodologically neutral and overlaps with mechanisms exterior to organizations and individuals including political climate and institutions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In-group collectivism</td>
<td>Expression of pride, loyalty and cohesiveness within organizations and/or families</td>
<td>Loyalty and commitment to core family often parallels strong patriotism and nationalism. In-group collectivism follows levels of uncertainty avoidance and GDP.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Masculine/feminine (Hofstede’s framework)</td>
<td>Preferential forms of social behavior that privilege either competition, materialism and wealth (masculine), or security, well-being and harmony (feminine).</td>
<td>The bipolar model follows typical distinctions made between liberal or socialist political philosophy. Although liberal economies value assertiveness, autonomy, materialism, aggression, money, competition, and rationalism, welfare socialism seeks protection and provision for the weak, greater involvement with the environment, an emphasis on nature and well-being, and a strong respect for quality of life and collective responsibilities. Masculine societies happen to include the most successful economically during the period of Hofstede’s study (the United States, Japan, and Germany) with the successful feminine societies having either smaller populations, less economic scale and/or strong collective, and welfare philosophies (Scandinavia, Costa Rica, France, Thailand). The masculine–feminine dichotomy divides organizations into those exhibiting either compassion, solidarity, collectivism, and universalism or competition, autonomy, merit, results, and responsibility. This dimension is eurocentric and sexist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1056492611415279">Gilligan, 1982</xref>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gender egalitarianism</td>
<td>Extent of gender role differences and tolerance of gender discrimination</td>
<td>Gender egalitarianism is closely correlated with secular-rational authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1056492611415279">Inglehart &amp; Welzel, 2005</xref>) as traditional authority tends to differentiate male and female social roles resulting in males having more money, power, and places of entitlement. This dimension may be redundant with power distance and may be moderated or not by organizational forces and certainly by the dominant economic and religious ethos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Assertiveness</td>
<td>Acceptance of confrontation and aggressiveness as a means to interact with others</td>
<td>Assertiveness has a strong psychological component that may be fostered by family education and social expectations. Some evolutionary psychologists believe that men have evolved to be more aggressive and motivated by competition, whereas women avoid physical confrontation and coercive behavior in favor of cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492611415279">Barkow, Cosmides, &amp; Tooby, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056492611415279">Buss, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1056492611415279">Van Vugt et al., 2007</xref>), but the impossibility of separating learned behavior from genetic programming makes this item biased.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Future orientation</td>
<td>Focus on planning, investing and delaying gratification</td>
<td>This is a secular-rational value that challenges fate-based attitudes common to traditional society. Focus on the future is nurtured in liberal economies fueled by speculation and investment and the replacement of old technologies with new ones. Bias will occur when evaluating states forbidding speculation and assessment of future events creating the illusion of a culture “focused on the present” because its focus on the future does not coincide with investment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Performance orientation</td>
<td>Encourages excellence and improvement</td>
<td>To value achievement is typical of the modernization period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1056492611415279">Inglehart, 1997</xref>) and reflects “masculinist” thinking because it is based on rationalization and optimization emphasizing the belief that people should shape their universe and control the future. It recalls both individualism and masculinity dimensions, and it will be enhanced in industrial societies where technology and bureaucracy are institutionalized through education and the media.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Human orientation</td>
<td>Encourages fairness, altruism, caring and kindness</td>
<td>The focus on well-being and the de-emphasis on authority are associated with postmodern society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1056492611415279">Inglehart, 1997</xref>), but humane fatalism also pushes populations to make the best of what they have and be kind to others. A human orientation could also arise from social philosophies that seek to mitigate the level of aggression and egocentrism that high GDP or alternatively high uncertainty inadvertently fosters. It may recall both feminine and collective indices. It may be supported or aborted by organizational imperatives, historical factors, or scarcity.</td>

<title>Management Studies</title>
<p>Cross-cultural study applied to the organizational sciences that emerged in recovering World War II economies, marshaling methods from applied anthropology to support first-world, postwar, modernization ambitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492611415279">Boyacigiller, Kleinberg, Phillips, &amp; Sackmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1056492611415279">McSweeney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1056492611415279">Sackmann &amp; Phillips, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1056492611415279">Sackmann, Phillips, Kleinberg, &amp; Boyacigiller, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1056492611415279">Westwood, 2006</xref>). Drawing from the work of Edward and Mildred Hall (1959-1976), Clyde <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1056492611415279">Kluckhohn (1953)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1056492611415279">Inkeles and Levinson (1954)</xref> to name a few, universals were adapted as a basis for comparing cultural differences in intercultural encounters. Primary cultural data were collected through the use of questionnaires to which increasingly sophisticated statistical analysis was applied to identify stable, national, and regional profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1056492611415279">Hofstede, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1056492611415279">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1056492611415279">House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, &amp; Gupta, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1056492611415279">Schwartz, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1056492611415279">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-1056492611415279">Triandis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-1056492611415279">Trompenaars, 1993</xref>). Universals, the collection of primary data by survey, and the empirical credibility lent by statistical analysis became the standard framework for cultural study within the management professions.</p>
<p>Geert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1056492611415279">Hofstede’s (1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1056492611415279">1991</xref>, 2001) groundbreaking use of four “universal” cultural dimensions in his study of employees working in IBM facilities across the world revealed by statistical analysis how culture matters in making decisions, forming teams, and embracing styles of management and leadership. Hofstede’s dimensions became subsequently the premier reference for factoring culture into organizational analysis, and his survey results are often quoted to form the basis of a national ranking mechanism used in management literature and teaching for its simplicity. Among the most quoted management books of the last century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1056492611415279">Minkov &amp; Hofstede, 2011</xref>), <italic>Culture’s Consequences</italic> has become required reading in many international business programs worldwide.</p>
<p>The global leadership and organizational behavior effectiveness (GLOBE) studies, seeking to improve Hofstede’s framework, took on the statistically ambitious enterprise of working from the perspective of more than 25 countries to validate experimentally seven dimensions of culture, thereby bypassing the problematical use of studying just one company, from one cultural perspective, and addressing the contested aggregate of nation in its use of regional clusters based on history, political institutions, religion, and other path factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1056492611415279">House et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1056492611415279">Javidan &amp; House, 2002</xref>). Conceptualized to compare leadership, teamwork, collaboration, role allocation, and organizational structure across the world, the GLOBE studies tested respondents’ perceptions of “what is” as well as what “ought to be,” tracking differences between idealized values and reported practice, and proposing extensive statistical profiles with regional comparisons. The GLOBE studies moved the Hofstede paradigm forward in seeking to resolve the problematical parameters of research design, cultural subject, and the limits of cultural claims.</p>
<p>Increasing knowledge of national cultural profiles became a training, management, and communication concern to enhance the effective interaction between managers and workers especially for enterprises set up in foreign countries with expatriates in managerial situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056492611415279">Berry, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-1056492611415279">Triandis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-1056492611415279">Trompenaars, 1993</xref>). Popular management literature produced pragmatic lists of “do’s and taboos” and critical incidents to increase awareness of national habits and preferences, shedding light on the particular problems of midlevel personnel involved in joint ventures, mergers, and the management of multinational teams. Focusing on the dialogue and interaction between diverse “others,” these studies offered explanatory devices for cultural otherness and prescribed coping behavior to enhance the impact, effectiveness, and output of admixing in work situations. These hands-on approaches provided simple constructs of culture to enable communication, technology, and educational development on the subject. Inspired by Hofstede and anthropological models instructed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1056492611415279">Kluckhohn (1953)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1056492611415279">Kluckholn and Strodtbeck (1961)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1056492611415279">Hall and Hall (1976/1990)</xref>, Schwartz expanded these psychosocial applications by testing universal value dimensions at both the individual and national levels. Valid individual constructs included hierarchy, embeddedness, harmony, egalitarian commitment, intellectual autonomy, and mastery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1056492611415279">Schwartz, 1992</xref>). National aggregates included power, achievement, hedonism, stimulation, self-direction, universalism, benevolence, tradition, conformity, and security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1056492611415279">Schwartz, 1994</xref>). His study was not tailored for organizational purposes and did not have a particularly large sample. However, his framework allowed for introducing lifestyle and philosophical preferences to social science techniques and marked a first attempt to align individual and national aggregates to strengthen cultural and character study, enhancing the way in which universal dimensions could be investigated. Schwartz’ value studies also innovate by not subordinating the study of culture to the social transactions that take place only at work. In a similar vein, but applied to organizations, Trompenaars tested preferential behaviors found to be statistically prominent in certain national organizations validating the dimensions of time, achievement, ascription, individualism/collectivism, universalism/particularism, emotional/neutral, specific/diffuse, and man/nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-1056492611415279">Trompenaars, 1993</xref>). He consolidated these in a study conducted with Hamden-Turners to evaluate managerial cultures worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1056492611415279">Hamden-Turner &amp; Trompenaars, 1997</xref>). A recent innovation on values study introduces social axioms from multicultural perspectives as a means to measure qualitatively the way people’s beliefs shape their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1056492611415279">Leung, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1056492611415279">Leung, Bhagat, Buchan, Erez, &amp; Gibson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1056492611415279">Leung &amp; Bond, 2004</xref>). All these studies enhance organizational understandings of the cultural dynamic at work through a multivariate approach considering individual, organizational, and national values.</p>

<title>General Political and Social Science Studies</title>
<p>From the broader perspective of political and social science, the ongoing World Values Surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1056492611415279">Inglehart &amp; Baker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1056492611415279">Inglehart, Basanez, Diez-Medrano, Halman, &amp; Luijkx, 2004</xref>) drew inferences from individual census to measure national character trends by tracking personal attitudes and values and rejecting bipolar universals. This large-scale, cross-national survey conducted by an international consortium of professional statisticians, sociologists, and political scientists combines survey questions on a range of cultural, social, political, religious, and economic topics, classifying results according to the demographic spread of respondents and comparing banks of data over decades. Testing a range of reported opinions on a host of factors in modern life, these individual questionnaires cull and process data nationally but present results by statistical segments of age, gender, education level, and salary reporting group variations, thanks to a time series comparison of reported national values. The analysis draws attention to the dynamic nature of value change under the gradual influence of technology, globalization, industrialization, and democracy. Most importantly, the statistical framework is constructed so as to provide socioeconomic and path-related data to contextualize how wealth, technology, and political philosophy shape values with noticeable subregional dynamics acting within agrarian, industrial, and postindustrial contexts. The World Values Survey weighs socioeconomic data and education levels against cultural, regional, and path-dependent factors reminding of how individuals are embedded within political, religious, historical, and economic contexts that enable or disable certain character traits, something already noticed by eminent scholars of economics and history, including Marx, Weber, Landes, and Huntington (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1056492611415279">Table 2</xref>). Although the World Values Survey has been influential in political science, it has been noticeably absent from management research with a few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1056492611415279">Minkov &amp; Hofstede, 2011</xref>), which is surprising because the census uses a similar framework with group survey as primary data and sophisticated statistical analysis to map national character against political climate.</p>

<sec id="section5-1056492611415279">
<title>Organizational Studies</title>
<p>An emphasis on the organizational as the primary manifestation of culture is again evident in the rise of corporate culture studies that collapse culture into the managerial–organizational manifestations of national and regional preferences. Types of culture within organizations have included vertical–horizontal, autocratic–democratic, and paternalistic–entrepreneurial to name a few. However, not all discussions of organizational culture focus on the functional aspects of management and communication. Some develop a rhetoric more familiar in cultural studies and sociology with organizational dichotomies including East–West, collective–individual, neutral–emotional, and tight–loose. As a result, the cultural, national, domestic, international, and transnational became enmeshed with these designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492611415279">Boyacigiller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1056492611415279">Sackmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1056492611415279">Sackmann &amp; Phillips, 2004</xref>). In this functional approach, the mechanical study of the organization requires unpackaging (corporate) culture and collapsing the sociocultural into the organizational–cultural, a multilevel task that blends culture with many other social questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1056492611415279">Fischer, 2009</xref>). These approaches innovate by providing organizational data that are then examined within the context of macrocultural forces.</p>
<p>Other studies focused on the organizational manifestations of culture have borrowed from ethnographic and narrative techniques, using the study of conversation, observation in situ, or corporate diaries to piece together a detailed snapshot of organizational character. “Emic” techniques, or taking an insider’s approach in understanding a foreign firm, have been used to identify ineffective or best practices within foreign organizations. The study of Japanese management, for example, combined the cultural, the organizational, and its economic outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1056492611415279">Ouchi &amp; Wilkins, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1056492611415279">Westwood, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-1056492611415279">Wilkinson, 1990</xref>). Today, growing interest in China triggers similar cultural productions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1056492611415279">Ghuari &amp; Fang, 2001</xref>). Focus on organizational culture drawing from interviews, ethnographic observation, and the case study method to provide thick description have gradually been gaining ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1056492611415279">Geertz, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1056492611415279">Sackmann &amp; Phillips, 2004</xref>), and a paradigm shift has indeed become noticeable in published research evidenced by gleaning the table of contents of recent issues of <italic>Cross Cultural Management: An International Journal</italic>, the <italic>International Journal of Cross Cultural Management</italic>, and <italic>Cross Cultural Research</italic> in which qualitative, quantitative, interpretive, and empirical studies are published side by side.</p>
<p>The historical understanding of the cross-cultural discipline—characterized by the nation lens, dimension testing, and focus on comparative and organizational aspects—still inform a great part of the knowledge base offered in business education and consulting firms today. These paradigms simplify the big picture of culture as essentially a question of national, context, and location differences permeating organizations, associations, and societies, and they are believed credible, thanks to mechanical, stable, and universal dimensions validated by statistical tools. They continue to be used because they enable comparison, have a predictive claim, and provide background to explain consumer, communication, and behavioral difference. This knowledge base situates culture as a key organizational and strategic feature addressed through appropriate communication, training, and recruitment of diverse others. This framework has the overall detraction of simplifying considerably the culture question, subordinating culture to the world of work and aiming to make steadfast cultural claims, whereas the cultural subject—like personality—is necessarily transient and unstable.</p>

<title>A Critical Perspective on “Scientific” Cultural Study</title>
<p>Many objections to the predominant framework for cultural analysis within business, inspired by Hofstede’s model and others of the same ilk, have received extensive critical commentary from theoretical, statistical, and practical perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056492611415279">Baskerville, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056492611415279">Boyacigiller &amp; Adler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1056492611415279">Dermot, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492611415279">Dorfman &amp; Howell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1056492611415279">Gerhart, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1056492611415279">Hamden-Turner &amp; Trompenaars, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1056492611415279">Jacob, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1056492611415279">Javidan, House, Dorfman, Hanges, &amp; de Luque, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1056492611415279">Kirkman, Lowe, &amp; Gibson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1056492611415279">Lingui &amp; Koveos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1056492611415279">McSweeney, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1056492611415279">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1056492611415279">Orr &amp; Hauser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1056492611415279">K. H. Roberts &amp; Boyacigiller, 1984</xref>). For example, the sampling discrepancy of Hofstede’s initial survey disqualifies his results from being authoritative on organizations, societies, or nations as interviews involved sales and engineering personnel at IBM with few, if any, women and undoubtedly fewer social minorities participating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1056492611415279">Moussetes, 2007</xref>). Even if country indices were used to control for wealth, latitude, population size, density, and growth, privileged males working as engineers or sales personnel in one of the elite organizations of the world, pioneering one of the first multinational projects in history, cannot be claimed to represent nations or even work cultures, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1056492611415279">Hofstede (1980)</xref> himself discouraged the reader from using his data in any narrow way. Other critics have objected to the use of questionnaires as a valid method for cultural inquiry. Reported behavior is not equivalent to observed behavior or espoused values especially in organizational situations where people are likely to provide the “right” answer and behave the “right” way. The conflation of attitudes, behaviors, and values is problematical as it is important to distinguish between what is, what one thinks, what one does, and what one thinks should be done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611415279">Boje, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492611415279">Boyacigiller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056492611415279">Clifford &amp; Marcus, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056492611415279">Czarniawska, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492611415279">D’Iribarne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-1056492611415279">Soin &amp; Scheytt, 2006</xref>). The GLOBE studies suffer from similar distractions, diminishing the validity of its statistical frameworks and inferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056492611415279">Dansereau &amp; Yammarino, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1056492611415279">Hanges &amp; Dickson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1056492611415279">Hofstede, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1056492611415279">Javidan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1056492611415279">Van de Vijver, van Hemert, &amp; Poortinga, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of universal dimensions (in Hofstede, the GLOBE studies, and many cross-cultural publications) has also been widely contested as a valid means to draw up cultural maps. Universal dimensions were created as constructs to measure and compare character forces internationally. They respond to environmental, political, historical, and psychological forces that cannot be truly separated. They are often biased by the perspective of the researcher, and they often contain implicit and explicit links to exogenous forces that affect behavior and character (such as political climate, wealth, and generation). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1056492611415279">Table 1</xref> offers a summary of some of these dilemmas.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1056492611415279">Table 1</xref> summarizes many interpretive challenges of universal dimensions. Research paradigms using them to promote gender, nation, age, ethnic, and other cultural categories may suffer from bias implicit in all “essentializing” and “reifying” designs even though such initiatives cannot be discarded altogether as they sometimes prove convenient and yield vital insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492611415279">Ang &amp; Dyne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492611415279">D’Iribarne, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1056492611415279">Smith, Peterson, &amp; Thomas, 2008</xref>). By compiling “empirical” cultural data sorted into preestablished categories, subjects are narrowed by stereotypes and an ethnocentric ordering process that contemporary critical study seeks to transcend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1056492611415279">Osland &amp; Bird, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1056492611415279">Yeganeh &amp; Su, 2006</xref>). Claiming that there are human taxonomies suggests that culture, nation, and ethnicity are immutable personality characteristics that seal identity and that skill, character, and essence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1056492611415279">Prentice &amp; Miller, 2006</xref>) can be revealed by questionnaires and critical incidents arranged in columns and communicated meaningfully with statistics and graphs. The bipolar modes of comparison (e.g., small or large power distance) confine many universal concepts to highly generalized and mechanical portraits of character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1056492611415279">Osland &amp; Bird, 2000</xref>) that end up as stereotypes. The overlap between dimensions may skew comparisons between surveys, compromising coherence within the body of data published on the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1056492611415279">Minkov &amp; Hofstede, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the data-collection methods of much cross-cultural analysis resemble those used in economics, statistics, and demography, offering a means to make legitimate the “science” of cultural study for an economics and business readership requiring certain knowledge formats. A number of professional publications in prestigious cross-cultural journals now exceed beyond expectations the clever use of statistical technique to make pointed assertions about culture, and some premier journals of cross-cultural study explicitly require extensive empirical data as a publication requirement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1056492611415279">1</xref></sup> The combination of statistical analysis, the use of universal dimensions, and survey data has expanded the area of culture to include studies of just about everything. This has resulted in the collapse of the very notion of culture into psychological, historical, religious, organizational, economic, and generational forces. These attempts to use scientific protocol in human study do not fully factor the subjective influence of the researcher and the assumed but questionable “objective” and observable reality of human relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056492611415279">Clegg, Hardy, Lawrence, &amp; Nord, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Moving from these specific criticisms in the design of cross-cultural research, one can move to a more general series of objections concerning the output of much cross-cultural study. The first concerns the claims of national character. There are many reasons why neither societies (people, their values, and collective resources) nor economies (institutions, divisions of power, and rule of law) can be satisfactorily portrayed as “national.” The notion that people in a nation make up a homogeneous ethnic, linguistic, or religious group can almost always be proven inaccurate. In fact, polyethnicity has been an enduring reality of the majority of the world’s nations, actually composites of smaller cultural groups evidenced by a diversity of languages and local customs, united under a dominant religious, linguistic, historical, or symbolic cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1056492611415279">Kluckholn &amp; Strodtbeck, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1056492611415279">McNeill, 1986</xref>). Today, the interaction of ethnicities and nations in an interconnected world necessarily creates a myriad of new hybrid cultural and linguistic communities that are also “cultural” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1056492611415279">Pieterse, 1995</xref>), sometimes “nationless” (Palestinians or Kurds) and often transient (virtual chats). The idea that a political economy and its institutions function autonomously within a national border is also erroneous as there are no economies, societies, or educational systems in the world today that function without contact with counterparts abroad, phenomena that have been accelerated given technology and global media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492611415279">Castells, 2000</xref>). The nation-state is an institutionalized and bureaucratized agreement of solidarity, which replaces ethnicity with a dominant political philosophy, rule of law, government, and system of policing deviants. Nation is a set of professed affiliations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492611415279">Arnason, 2003</xref>) and not an empirical state of being, as it is the functional and historical outcome of a struggle for dominance in group norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1056492611415279">Gellner, 1983</xref>), suppressing some subcultures, empowering others. According to one scholar, nations have never been more than figments of the collective imagination harnessing patriotism in the service of paternalism, made possible on a grand scale by the homogenizing forces imposed on language and discourse that only the media can marshal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056492611415279">Anderson, 1983/2006</xref>). Modern nations grapple with the permeable character of territory, people, and institutional arrangements, and the seeds of human innovation—ideas, genes, and money—are frequently migratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1056492611415279">Witte, 2010b</xref>). In addition, there are strong generational and gender patterns that stratify most human societies evolving unevenly over time, necessitating an historical and comparative dimension to all social and economic questions. Minorities, foreign nationals, migrants, tourism, and cultural artifacts (music, art, clothes, narratives, and technology) erode the likelihood that any particular nation, society, or organization correctly reflects anything but broad motivations and values of changing and arbitrary groups.

<p>The motivations to preserve a national framework for understanding culture are undoubtedly complex. Pragmatism would warrant studies that draw from available national data generated to serve business and industry across the world and allow political leaders to compare and contrast national data for the purpose of development, competition, and knowledge as they experiment with urban, employment, and institutional policies. The national paradigm also fits the way a large number of people describe their own identity as educational, and civic systems are likely to propound the view that one’s nation is a great part of one’s psychological and social reality and people are likely to embrace the story of their own nation as an integral part of who they are in the world today. Despite jet transportation and sophisticated satellite communications, most people are very aware of the local place and era that shape their consciousness, and they often form their most important emotional relationships based on these simple parameters. Finally, preserving the ideology of national identity maintains the political aftermath of 19th- and 20th-century military clashes that have now been made acceptable by media and marketing strategies promoting national branding through soccer leagues, consumer goods, corporate logos, wealthy families, and movie stars. Organizations rally behind these mechanical and rational manifestations of national sovereignty, and a diversity of legal, political, economic, and institutional realities are further served by borders, international organizations, and the military that police their frontiers. Friction is produced when cultural consciousness works like an evolutionary force, seeping through borders, adapting best practices, imitating effective and pleasurable behaviors, learning to respond ecologically to the environment, and migrating when necessary. This emotional, unconscious, and intuitive inspiration, pushing collectivities forward on a multicultural quest, is a reality of human history, proven by our genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056492611415279">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Cavalli, 1995</xref>).

Explaining management, leadership, and organizations relying on the device of organizational, microeconomic and national universals narrows the ecological, path-dependent, and situational nature of people and groups.

This requires accepting nonquantifiable evolutionary and idiosyncratic forces operating over short and long terms.

<title>Three Proposals for Reframing, Deframing, and Unframing Culture</title>
<p>Now that some of the shortcomings of nation profiling, data collection, and universal dimensions as a basis for cross- cultural study have been identified, and multiperspective publications involving a more dynamic treatment of culture identified in other disciplines provides a roadmap, finding alternatives to moving the cross-cultural paradigm forward in management studies proves challenging. Based on the summary data reviewed in this article calling into question national and statistical inferences, the dilemma of using universals summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1056492611415279">Table 1</xref> and the hallmark studies proposed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1056492611415279">Table 2</xref>, three recommendations may direct this repositioning: mitigate nation frameworks and universal dimensions, integrate a stakeholder perspective, and take a research standpoint that transcends the perspective of the managerial function and explores unique and unconventional instances of organizational exchange. In summary, a transcultural paradigm is proposed based on the observations made in the first three sections—“An Overview of Cross-Cultural Research Streams,” “A Critical Perspective on ‘Scientific’ Cultural Study,” and The Art and Philosophy of a New Cultural Study”—of this article. A new definition of the cultural subject for organizational analysis is now required, removing the all-knowing cultural expert as the primary voice, employing qualitative research designs that feature multiple narrative accounts of cultural situations, and exploiting interactive formats in which this new cultural analysis can be presented, consumed, and revised continuously.</p>

<title>Mitigate Nation Frameworks and Universal Dimensions</title>
<p>Transnational organizations draw on a culturally diverse consumer base and are served by people socialized and educated all over the world. With migration, tourism, company mergers, and deeper international economic integration, some recent studies have been evaluating the impact of so many diverse others on the presumed “norms” of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1056492611415279">Leonard &amp; Levine, 2006</xref>). This has fostered a growing interest in managing diversity in the workplace, rather than studying any particular national model that may or may not be predominant. Paradoxically, recruitment policies in large industries that screen employees using assessment centers are still prone to creating a normative managerial and employee base accentuating certain types of behavior and values, creating a corporate culture that may actually suppress local, ethnic, or national cultures within the firm. As a contrast, small businesses, NGOs, and public administrations that do not use standardized screening measures to hire employees federate people and resources around skills and character profiles serving different corporate and cultural interests, and they are likely to form unique cultural federations polarized around values. These nonnational realities of the contemporary organization make the workplace a transitional, transnational culture, contingent on corporate culture pressures as well as individual and collective behaviors inculcated by education, political, religious, or regional affiliations.</p>
<p>New workplace realities have shifted the formats in which culture “other” knowledge is sought and generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1056492611415279">Sackmann &amp; Phillips, 2004</xref>). A growing power base of consumers and managers with non-Western educational credentials and philosophies has been integrated into organizational, managerial, and communications processes with an ever-expanding number of cultural typologies and cultural admixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492611415279">Boyacigiller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1056492611415279">K. H. Roberts &amp; Boyacigiller, 1984</xref>). Emerging economies and new business ventures are constantly reinventing organizations, and they are joined by a growing constituency of NGOs with new business models and novel ways to manage them. The rise of multicultural virtual teams operating globally now increases exponentially the types of intercultural encounters any one person will have in a work situation. New forms of media and communication now include a greater number of interest groups communicating strategy, advertising, and consulting advice. Many are devised by self-learners without business degrees, less inclined to privilege one way of managing or prioritizing over another especially because business education, degrees, and business schools can be counted as yet other forms of cultural influence and cultural training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1056492611415279">Witte, 2010a</xref>), and in situ entrepreneurship is likely to give equal importance to intuition and opportunity. Pressure can be felt in many advanced capitalist societies to integrate greater diversity within the corporation by deliberate campaigns to include minorities, promote more women to senior positions, and embrace ethical and environmental philosophies to prove their corporate social responsibility. Bicultural people, third-culture kids, and growing numbers of cosmopolitan individuals living, socializing, and working in multicultural environments derive from a diversity of sources their cultural lifestyles, consumer habits, spiritual beliefs, and practical behaviors. New clusters of regional multistate activity (i.e., the European Union [EU], North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA], Mercado Comun Sudamericano (MERCOSUR) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN]) are places of both cultural convergence and divergence, effacing the centrality of any one nation or philosophy in the organization of socioeconomic life. Although nationality continues to be used as a broad indicator for identity and values, cultural behavior has come to encompass in our raised social consciousness the interdependent variables of gender, age, ethnicity, education, occupation, function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1056492611415279">Sackmann &amp; Phillips, 2004</xref>), kinship, social class, and personality. Taking into consideration this new social environment in which work takes place, new methods for studying culture, organizational culture, and interacting cultures are needed because it no longer makes sense to compare monocultures when people and organizations draw from so many cultural references, and static descriptions of cultural behavior are likely to become invalid quickly. Moreover, transnational corporations and the rise of virtual technology compromise the credibility of using within nation, institutional, or psychosocial measures of culture because synergy and assimilation better reflect the reality of an embedded cultural world. In addition, the world of work sometimes collapses into worlds of leisure, worlds of political and social causes, and virtual enterprises ill adapted for applying the conventional theories of organization. With multicultural researchers viewing multicultural subjects for a multicultural readership, the variables of culture as well as research paradigms and epistemologies for culture have greatly multiplied, compromising the use of common points of cultural comparison, gathering cultural data according to preset categories, or using any fixed concept of culture as an explanatory device for human activity.</p>
<p>Given these complexities, the format of books and articles by which organizational scholars propose understandings of culture may also prove less appropriate than media featuring fluid and adaptable communication options. The imperfect, evolutionary, and tentative conclusion requires new standards for reading and writing culture. Alternative formats might include narrative insider accounts assembled by teams of multicultural authors or participants interested in piecing together a snapshot of one instance in the evolution of cultural dynamics in the workplace that affects the outcomes of microeconomic activity. Literary accounts, film, and collective narratives would contribute to this qualitative perspective. The blog, webinar, forum, and interactive formats including podcast, twitter, and facebook offer the features of peer-based revision, stakeholder participation, constant editing, and the interaction of a wide readership.</p>
<p>Individuals worldwide regularly in contact with TV, radio, film, and the Internet have identities shaped by many subcultures and identity sets rather than any one national culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611415279">Ashforth &amp; Mael, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492611415279">Boyacigiller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1056492611415279">Sackmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1056492611415279">Sackmann et al., 1997</xref>). Fiction in particular (stories, myths, books, films, and TV series) allows individuals to imagine a multitude of subjective worlds in which it is possible to live and act. These fictional models influence behavior, prompt dress codes, launch new expressions, generate trends, and set the social agenda, driving the economy and social dialogue in ways that are vastly understated. Fictional accounts of “what should be,” “what could be,” “what is,” and so on might allow surveyed participants enough psychological distance from the conformity of some work situations to think creatively and critically. The financial crises of the 1980s, the 1990s, and the first decade of the 21st century remind us more than ever that rumor, conformity, and groupthink trigger herding behavior, driving an otherwise “rational” community of risk experts to operate in extremely risk-averse ways contingent on global information and communication channels. Tapping into these areas of unconscious emotion opens the research paradigm to embrace the subjective and imaginative areas of the cultural being that are part of our human reality.</p>
<p>People in organizations responding to questionnaires may not always distinguish between what they say and what they actually do. The propensity to lie, to exaggerate, to subvert, to dissimulate, and to pay lip service is within the standard realm of human behavior and not taking these distractions into account compromises the degree to which reporting can be considered “truth.” Data collection methods that factor for possible sources of ambiguity, subjectivity, complexity, paradox, hypocrisy, and contradiction are admittedly fallible. Integrating idiosyncrasy and the uncertain integrity of respondents to reflect the unconscious and hidden dimension of human agency multiplies endlessly the parameters of culture for standard economic and business consumption. Accepting that these undeclared, inconvenient, and messy forms of culture spontaneously enacted in the workplace are an integral part of the human subject warrants a qualitative approach to research designs, more modest claims about what data mean, and the willingness to read data that are not always neatly packaged. Rejecting coherence and the absence of definitive cultural patterns is a prerequisite for transcending more conventional designs of a cultural analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1056492611415279">Geertz, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1056492611415279">McSweeney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1056492611415279">Sackmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1056492611415279">Sackmann &amp; Phillips, 2004</xref>). Symbolic, subjective, implicit, imaginary, situational, chaotic, unconscious, psychodynamic, and nongeneralizable elements of human interaction are necessarily a part of cultural life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056492611415279">Bourdieu, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1056492611415279">Goffman, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492611415279">Habermas, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1056492611415279">Ouchi &amp; Wilkins, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1056492611415279">Smircich, 1983</xref>). Management and organizational science would greatly enhance its repertory of cultural forces through the integration of ethnographic techniques that capture some of these dimensions, including worker journals, narrative methods, literary formats, unedited film, fictional representations, photos, humor, and drawings provided by insiders, participants, and stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611415279">Boje, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056492611415279">Clifford, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492611415279">Czarniawska, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492611415279">Denning, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492611415279">D’Iribarne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1056492611415279">Gabriel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1056492611415279">Gannon &amp; Audia, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1056492611415279">Rosen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-1056492611415279">Soin &amp; Scheytt, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Integrate a Stakeholder Perspective</title>
<p>Management studies have traditionally been concerned with managers, and many studies attempt to use culture as a means of enhancing managerial competency. Prescriptive studies recommending courses of action (how to motivate, best practices of leadership, team building, and communication) are poorly disguised policy formulation of how to maintain control, and they are informed by the experiences of the powerful (even if this is not conscious or intentional). This is another straw man delivered in many popular business books imitating celebrated authors such as Tom Peters and Peter Drucker where the sole experiences of top leadership in major corporations inform the principles of management. Unobserved and unnoticed groups of workers and other participants are often faceless, and their motivation, attitudes, and particular contributions are left largely unexamined or confined to “culture” profiles that managers seek to understand. Yet, social relationships are conditional, situational, and adaptive, and they resist static description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1056492611415279">Goffman, 1959</xref>). The set of organizational constraints into which managers and workers are embedded have been neglected in the analysis of behavior as if culture somehow escaped these institutional, contextual, social, and class forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611415279">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>). By including the perspectives of those who do not necessarily manage organizations and the larger perspective of organizational stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, and society at large, a sharper picture of social interaction in the workplace comes into focus allowing for new spaces of meaning and a closer examination of the human, cultural, and social capital factors driving organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1056492611415279">Sackmann, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Polling for data in this postcultural research environment might include rejecting preestablished questionnaires and surveys and relying on “indigenous self-representations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1056492611415279">Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1056492611415279">Westwood, 2006</xref>) or self-reporting, which has the advantage of letting people describe their unique experience of situations. Integrating a stakeholder perspective requires interpretative methodologies used in the humanities and social sciences, including discourse analysis, narrative study, ethnographic interview, and field observation as well as the willingness and openness of managerial audiences to read such scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1056492611415279">Westwood, 2006</xref>). By recognizing the subjective positions that surface in open interviews and participant observation, it is still possible to engage in research that is both qualitative and quantitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1056492611415279">Kwek, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-1056492611415279">Soin &amp; Scheytt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1056492611415279">Yeganeh &amp; Su, 2006</xref>). In addition, this transcultural research construct assumes variability within and across cultures and introduces items that are not of universal interest to the managerial professional but rather specific to individuals or groups across occupations allowing for a local cultural synergy to be declared. By making all voices audible, and tolerating the unstructured and contradictory contributions of diverse stakeholders, bicultural individuals, and multiple cultural perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1056492611415279">Sackmann, 2003</xref>), an enriched organizational picture can emerge where interdependence and variation illuminate questions about work, the economy, and the social narratives that drive institutions. This opens the possibility of examining synergy, diversity, and assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1056492611415279">Yeganeh &amp; Su, 2006</xref>) as organizational opportunities. Mostly, a clearer picture of “the cultural” (as opposed to “Culture” and “Nation”), its corporate culture facets, and its centrality or insignificance to people, processes, and events can come to light.</p>

Feminist theory has pioneered new research paradigms seeking to remove the authoritative claims of an all-knowing agent of cultural, economic, and social knowledge to transform the way in which we frame questions of difference, egalitarianism, power, and discursive practices that nuance social realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056492611415279">Calás &amp; Smircich, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1056492611415279">Ely &amp; Padavic, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1056492611415279">Gilligan, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1056492611415279">Harding, 1998</xref>). To resolve these epistemological conflicts, numerous interdependent “subjective” perspectives can be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056492611415279">Calás &amp; Smircich, 1999</xref>) as well as multiparadigmatic explorations of a fluid cultural object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1056492611415279">Primecz et al., 2009</xref>). Correcting bias also entails that the perspective of the researcher as a disciplinary expert in management should be declared as just one of many subjective approaches to “knowing” about situational cultures to avoid producing cross-cultural inferences that confirm and mirror more or less the preoccupations of authors and publishers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611415279">Alvesson &amp; Deetz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1056492611415279">Tajfel, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1056492611415279">Trice &amp; Beyer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1056492611415279">Westwood, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1056492611415279">2006</xref>).

Focusing on new cultural instances arising in the context of cross-cultural and intercultural exchange and in particular cultural novelty in the context of global work, global communication, and global teams as the basic unit of an analysis shifts the field of study to a transcultural paradigm, accommodating the fact that much global trade is conducted primarily by oligopolies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1056492611415279">Robinson, 2003</xref>) and that organizations not prioritizing profit objectives (NGOs, humanitarian associations, virtual chats, and public agencies) offer completely original avenues of cultural research within atypical institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1056492611415279">De Maria, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492611415279">Eberle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492611415279">Grabowski &amp; Roberts, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1056492611415279">Lewis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1056492611415279">S.

<title>Conclusion—A Postnational Analytical Model for Organizations</title>
<p>The aim of this analysis is not to efface the importance of previous advances in cross-cultural management studies but to position different streams of organizational study as a process within a changing social consciousness. I am not proposing either that culture or nation is entirely abandoned as filters for organizational study, although I would not be the first to point out the problematical associations made with these contested social science paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056492611415279">Brumann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1056492611415279">Kuper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1056492611415279">McCrone, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1056492611415279">McSweeney, 2009</xref>), especially as organizations work within the regulatory framework of state economies and much data are only available in nation formats. Proposing the term <italic>postnational</italic> or <italic>postcultural</italic> has nothing truly novel either when juxtaposed with postmaterial, postmodern, and postindustrial epistemologies and the sister term <italic>postsocial</italic> appearing in the opening chapter of a collection of works on globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1056492611415279">Robertson &amp; White, 2003</xref>). I recognize my own subjective interests in advancing a postcultural cause because I fail to see how an abridged vision of culture or nation for managerial purposes promotes knowledge about human systems, and I agree with others that many cross-cultural declarations produce stereotypes that are unethical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1056492611415279">Kwek, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>I am especially eager to position the full range of the humanities in their rightful relevance to organizational study as the tools and techniques used in language, literature, art, history, and philosophy offer many creative outlets for thinking about development, management, motivation, communication, and the world of work. But the argument for a postnational cultural analysis is not ultimately a political, personal, or disciplinary preference. It is a knowledge-based petition to use the full gamut of humanities, social science, and scientific learning with all their possible and integrated methodological, theoretical, and philosophical filters to understand what influence the cultural has on making organizations what they are and what they can be.</p>
<p>Culture is a fugitive concept, contingent on esoteric, hybrid, and partly invisible variables. It is more prism than lens, more mutt than pedigree, and more organic than structural. It is bottom-up and top-down, historical and contemporary, and mechanical and idiosyncratic. Its study requires intuition and creativity as much as documentation and statistics. The collective sets of behaviors and values reinforcing or shaping moral, political, economic, and lifestyle choices that we have come to call culture, crafts and is crafted by, both random and predictable courses of gradual adaptation, selection, and competition in the Darwinian sense of the social analogy. The disparity between tangible and measurable “culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1056492611415279">Smith et al., 2008</xref>) and the contemporary anthropological and sociological treatment of culture as a problematical, inconsistent, contradictory, and variable concept in complex and unstable social fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056492611415279">Appadurai, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056492611415279">Brumann et al.,1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1056492611415279">Geertz, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1056492611415279">Kuper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1056492611415279">Smircich, 1983</xref>) has yet to gain currency in organizational research despite important advances in thinking about the methodologies and goals of cross-cultural research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1056492611415279">Primecz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1056492611415279">Sackmann, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Sociology, literature, and cultural studies have long outgrown the concept of culture as an overarching metaphor, recognizing fragmentation, locus, and resistance as part of the situational realities of group life. Maintaining the outmoded master narrative and method of culture as a dimension, construct, and core metaphor to understand organizations has pushed culture into defending its importance with the “techno-logical-scientific-strategic” forms of knowledge (universals, statistics, and nation truths), barring the subjective, finite, dynamic, and interpretative contexts of the “life world,” which are ethical, political, and communication alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1056492611415279">Habermas, 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492611415279">1984</xref>). A growing corpus of ethnographic, narrative, discourse analysis, critical, postmodern, postcolonial, and indigenous alternatives nuance this criticism and have pioneered an innovative variety of organizational thought experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611415279">Alvesson &amp; Deetz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056492611415279">Alvesson &amp; Skoldberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611415279">Boje, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056492611415279">Calás &amp; Smircich, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056492611415279">Clifford &amp; Marcus, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492611415279">Czarniawska, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056492611415279">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492611415279">Denning, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1056492611415279">Gabriel, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056492611415279">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1056492611415279">Gannon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492611415279">Grant, Hardy, Oswick, &amp; Putnam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1056492611415279">Leung &amp; Bond, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1056492611415279">Martin, Frost, &amp; O’Neill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1056492611415279">Rosen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1056492611415279">Sackmann, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1056492611415279">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1056492611415279">Schaffer &amp; Riordan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1056492611415279">Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-1056492611415279">Soin &amp; Scheytt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1056492611415279">Westwood, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1056492611415279">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The cultural differences distinguishing people and organizations worldwide are less straightforward than epistemologies proposed in the measurement and administrative sciences would lead us to assume. The risk of overestimating dimensions of culture and perpetuating cultural stereotypes to be consumed by audiences demanding empirical “proof” of culture trumps another possible goal of studying culture in organizations, which is to enhance prosperity, create worker satisfaction, and find viable group contracts allowing for advantageous multicultural interaction. “Culturalizing” management is a lot like racializing humanity in its imposition of presumed character categories and shared social histories. If culture is a social construction, so too is the research that claims to unravel culture. “Consumed” in the academic and corporate arena to become forms of organizational “distinction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611415279">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>), this mechanical perspective on culture leaves other possibilities to be regarded as unempirical, politically biased, flawed, or peripheral to administrative concerns. This is implicit (even sometimes explicit) in the publication policies of many authoritative journals on cross-cultural management research.</p>
<p>An investigation of culture at work does not have to be the pursuit of monolithic cultural categories, universal traits, and multivariate diagnostics. It does not have to be about gender/nation/age/ethnic group but rather about the economies, institutions, and circumstances into which individuals and groups are embedded, as well as their educational and functional formatting as they align with organizational histories. It is the job of the organizational scholar to tease out these factors and see in chosen “cultural” dimensions facets of many subjective worlds. As people in organizations and organizational scholars draw their values from multiple cultural realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492611415279">Boyacigiller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1056492611415279">Sackmann &amp; Phillips, 2004</xref>) only transcultural perspectives seeking transcultural outcomes are a viable alternative. A successful postnational cultural framework might allow for studying manifestations of the cultural outside the ideological constraints of research in business making for analytical subjects that include the perspectives of understudied populations and a greater use of atypical and nonbusiness organizations including NGOs, virtual organizations, and other “side streets” of occupational interest. Accepting that these sketches of organizational life are necessarily incomplete, subjective, and transitional requires of cross-cultural readership the ability to transcend the standardized empirical demands of economics to accept that the fuzzy, messy, and surprising facets of the life world are equally parts of our economic and organizational realities. It may require rethinking the formats in which cultural investigation is shared with the academic community integrating peer generated, multiperspective, and even fictional designs including blog, tweeter, and webinar. The opportunities of this transcultural paradigm far outweigh the inconveniences because they inject infinite subjects of human possibility into the investigation, restoring to the study of the world of trade the creative, subjective, human dynamic prone to variation, mutation, and evolution.</p>

<p>See, for example, the publication constraints of the prestigious journal <italic>Cross Cultural Research: The Journal of Comparative Social Science</italic>. “Studies that deal with measured differences between or among cultures (or subjects therefrom) must link them to other measured differences between or among the cultures. The study must do more than just compare two or more cultures (or people from them). The dependent variable(s) must be linked statistically (or causally, at least by argument) to one or more independent variable(s) that have been measured. The journal has this requirement because an observed difference could be the result of any other difference(s) between or among the cultures compared. The study should present evidence that narrows down the causal possibilities with regard to the dependent variable(s).”</p>
