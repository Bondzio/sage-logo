<abstract>
<p>Injury is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among adolescents in developed countries. Jessor and Jessor’s Problem Behavior Theory suggests an association between risk behaviors (e.g., smoking, drunkenness, cannabis use, and sexual intercourse) and adolescent injury. The present study examined whether early engagement in risk behaviors would predict injury at age 15. It also examined whether such associations were consistent in strength across countries. Based on the data from the 2005-2006 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey, a multigroup logistic regression analysis was conducted. Our findings demonstrate a cross-national consistent association (with relative odds of injury rising to 1.85; 95% CI: 1.70-2.02). Based on the study findings, early engagement in risk behaviors was considered a marker for a trajectory that places adolescents at higher risk for physical injury, independent of their national context.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In developed countries, injury is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611414062">Chiolero &amp; Schmid, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431611414062">Currie, Nic Gabhainn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431611414062">Danseco, Miller, &amp; Spicer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272431611414062">Lescohier &amp; Scavo Gallagher, 1996</xref>). In addition to negative physical and psychological effects on individuals, pediatric injury exacts a significant toll on society in terms of direct and indirect costs associated with treatment, rehabilitation, and long-term care, as well as loss of income and productivity due to disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431611414062">Krug, Sharma, &amp; Lozano, 2000</xref>). The etiology of adolescent injury is, therefore, an obvious health research priority.</p>
<p>Researchers from different countries have related substance use with higher risk of adolescent injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431611414062">Jessor, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431611414062">Koven, McColl, Ellis, &amp; Pickett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272431611414062">Pickett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431611414062">Pickett, Garner, Boyce, &amp; King, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431611414062">Pickett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272431611414062">Pickett, Schmid et al., 2002</xref>). Whereas some studies have suggested that substance use (e.g., alcohol misuse) is a direct cause of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431611414062">Pickett et al., 2005</xref>), another plausible theory is that substance use is related to injuries in an indirect manner. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431611414062">Jessor and Jessor (1977)</xref>, for example, proposed a theoretical framework, the problem behavior theory, which stated that a large variety of risk behaviors in adolescence are interrelated as they are all expressions of an underlying propensity for problem behavior. Whether or not a youth has this propensity depends on various factors, including the adolescent’s personality and his or her environment (e.g., peer influence, parental support, school system, neighborhood). Youth with a propensity for problem behavior are more likely to adhere to a high-risk lifestyle, which fosters both engagement in risk behaviors and the experience of adverse health outcomes such as injuries.</p>
<p>Sexual intercourse is rarely examined as a risk behavior in etiological studies of adolescent injury, as it is obviously not a direct risk factor. However, early sexual intercourse has a prominent place in problem behavior theory. Moreover, recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431611414062">Bellis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431611414062">Willoughby, Chalmers, &amp; Busseri, 2004</xref>) demonstrated that early sexual activity is part of a special cluster within problem behavior theory, which also includes alcohol misuse, smoking tobacco, and illicit drug use. This cluster may be perceived as an expression of the underlying propensity of problem behavior, which is, according to the theory, predictive of adolescent injury.</p>
<p>Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431611414062">Jessor and Jessor’s (1977)</xref> theoretical framework focused on risk behaviors of adolescents in general, the present work focused on risk behavior specifically in early adolescence. This choice was based on the assumption that risk behaviors are not, as a rule, problem behaviors. From a developmental perspective, adopting adult-like behaviors is part of the normal growing-up process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431611414062">Moffitt, 2006</xref>). Since most adults use or have used substances and are sexually active, it is not surprising that young people would adopt these behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431611414062">Luijpers, 2000</xref>). For them, such behaviors might fulfill important social functions and could be an essential aspect of psychosocial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431611414062">Moffitt, 2006</xref>). It is, therefore, important not to problematize risk behaviors. For early adolescents, however, engagement in smoking, drinking, cannabis use, and sex is deviant; most early adolescents are not (yet) interested in these kinds of behaviors. The behaviors, therefore, do not fulfill the same social function they do for older youth. Indeed, previous research has shown that early onset of risk behaviors can be considered problematic. A famous study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431611414062">Moffitt (1993)</xref> demonstrated that youth with an early onset of risk behaviors were more likely to become involved in problematic levels of substance use and engage in risky and unsafe sexual activities later in life compared to youth with a later onset of risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431611414062">Moffitt, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431611414062">2006</xref>). Although for late onset youth engagement in risk behaviors during adolescence was perceived as a temporary phenomenon, it was considered the beginning of lifelong engagement in risk and other unhealthy behaviors for early onset youth. A variety of other studies, in different countries, confirmed that early onset risk behaviors are a marker for later adherence to a high-risk lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431611414062">Basen, Edmundson, &amp; Parcel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431611414062">Bellis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431611414062">DuRant, Smith, Kreiter, &amp; Krowchuk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431611414062">Gullone, Moore, Moss, &amp; Boyd, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272431611414062">Petridou et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>To the authors’ knowledge, no study to date has investigated the relationship between early onset of risk behaviors and later injury in a cross-national sample. As policies and attitudes toward risk behaviors, as well as prevalence rates of early risk behaviors and injuries, differ considerably cross-nationally, identification of a cross-national consistent association would be quite profound. Furthermore, there is neither scientific evidence nor a logical rationale to assume that early risk behaviors in some countries would be more strongly related to the occurrence of injury than in others. To date, only two studies have conducted cross-national analyses on the association between adolescent risk behavior and injuries. However, neither tested whether associations were consistent across countries. Moreover, these studies focused on concurrent risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431611414062">Pickett et al., 2005</xref>) or only one risk behavior, rather than the clustered risk behavior concept (i.e., alcohol misuse; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431611414062">Borges et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study investigated the association between injury and early engagement in alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use and sexual intercourse in 25 European and North American countries. We first described the prevalence of medically attended injuries and early risk taking in each country, then evaluated the association between injury at age 15 and the number of early risk behaviors youth had engaged in. We hypothesized that the more early risk behaviors youth had engaged in, the higher their likelihood of being injured at age 15. On the basis of our assumption, that early risk taking might be a phenomenon with the same meaning in different populations of early adolescents, we expected our findings to be similar in strength across different countries and cultures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0272431611414062" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study was based on international records from the 2005-2006 Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey. The HBSC study is a World Health Organization (WHO) collaborative cross-national study on health and related behaviors and the social contexts of young people’s health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431611414062">Currie, Nic Gabhainn et al., 2008</xref>). Students aged 11, 13, and 15 years were surveyed across Europe and North America. In the present study, we used reports from 15-year-old students. Data were collected using a questionnaire that was completed in the classroom. Participating countries and regions obtained institutional ethics approval.</p>
<sec id="section3-0272431611414062">
<title>Countries</title>
<p>In 2005-2006, 38 countries participated in the HBSC study. Countries were excluded from these analyses if they had not asked students about the age of onset of at least one of the four risk behaviors of interest (seven countries: Ireland, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and the United States) or if they had at least 50% missing values on variables that were included in the analyses (six countries: Bulgaria, Greece, Greenland, Malta, Israel, and Macedonia). Included countries were Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the Russian Federation, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales). In addition, eight countries (Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia), which had very few students who reported engagement in all four early risk behaviors, were included in the analysis but with a limited range of early risk indicators (at most three). National sample sizes for 15-year-olds ranged from 1,191 to 5,006.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0272431611414062">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>The HBSC sampling methods are described extensively in the international protocol (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431611414062">Currie, Samdal, Boyce, &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272431611414062">Roberts et al., 2009</xref>). Cluster sampling was conducted in accordance with the structure of national education systems within each country. Sampling was stratified by region or school type, as appropriate. The primary sampling unit was the school class, or the whole school where a sample frame of classes was not available.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-0272431611414062">
<title>Injury</title>
<p>Occurrence of injury was measured via a single question that asked how often students experienced an injury event in the past 12 months that required medical attention from a doctor or a nurse. The question was preceded by the following statement: “Many young people get hurt or injured from activities such as playing sports or fighting with others at different places such as on the street or at home. Injuries can include being poisoned or burned. Injury does not include illnesses such as Measles or the Flu.” Response options were: <italic>I was not injured in the past 12 months, one time, two times, three times, four or more times</italic>. The outcome was dichotomized into <italic>not injured</italic> or <italic>injured at least once</italic> as per existing precedents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431611414062">Pickett, Garner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272431611414062">Pickett, Schmid et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0272431611414062">
<title>Early risk behaviors</title>
<p>Participants were asked to report if and at what age they first engaged in (a) smoking a cigarette, (b) being drunk, and (c) having sexual intercourse. Although drunkenness is a subjective term, we focused on drunkenness rather than the age of the participants’ first time drinking alcohol because drunkenness indicates alcohol misuse. Participants were also asked whether they had ever used cannabis. Of note, asking youth to report the age at which they first engaged in cannabis use was considered a sensitive topic in many countries; therefore, it was not included as a question in the mandatory international questionnaire. Early initiation was defined as having smoked a cigarette before age 13, having been drunk before age 14, having had sexual intercourse before age 15, and having used cannabis by age 15. We selected these cutoffs based on literature-based precedents (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431611414062">Baumeister &amp; Tossmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431611414062">Currie, Nic Gabhainn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272431611414062">Zimmer &amp; Helfand, 2008</xref>) and on the average age of onset of these behaviors in the 25 countries (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431611414062">Table 1</xref>). The average age of onset per risk behavior across countries provided an indication of the age of onset that would be considered early for each risk behavior. Finally, a summary score was created by adding the four dummy variables for early engagement in the risk behaviors (values ranged from 0 to 4).</p>

<title>Imputation of Missing Values</title>
<p>As our sample was very large and the number of missing values was rather small (2.9% to 37.5% across countries; mean 25.9%) missing values were imputed using multiple imputation in Amos (version 17: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431611414062">Arbuckle, 2008</xref>). The Bayesian imputation method was selected, which is considered an appropriate approach with large samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272431611414062">Schafer, 1997</xref>). With multiple imputation, missing values are replaced by several simulated values. In this study, six simulated values were used, which resulted in six complete data sets. Based on the results of these six analyses, pooled model parameter estimates were computed following Schafer’s guidelines.</p>
<p>Imputed values for missing data are generated within a so-called imputation model that contains all the variables from the final research model. When possible, variables that are assumed to be related to missingness are added to the model. In the present study, several variables (i.e., gender, academic achievement, self-rated health, and involvement in physical fights) were added to the imputation model for this purpose. To ensure an adequate model fit as well as ensure that the data were consistent with observed values, the imputation model was defined as a saturated multivariate regression model with risk behaviors as dependent variables and the other variables as independent variables. Furthermore, this model was applied to the original data set of each country. Subsequently, the data sets of the countries were merged to allow for multigroup analyses across countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0272431611414062">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics from each country were presented to estimate the average age of onset of each of the four early risk behaviors (based on youth reporting the behaviors). Next, percentages of children who reported early risk behaviors were presented, as were country-specific rates of injury.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we performed a series of logistic regression analyses to predict injury at age 15 based on the additive risk behavior score. We also analyzed a multigroup model with country as a grouping variable, using the software package Mplus (version 4.0: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272431611414062">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2006</xref>). We included all 25 countries and examined the number of early risk behaviors (0, 1, 2, and 3 risk behaviors) as a predictor of injury. To test whether associations were similar across countries, the model was analyzed initially with all regression paths constrained. We subsequently allowed regression paths to vary across countries and compared the fit of the two models. Because the sample size was very large and as the chi-square statistic is sensitive to sample size, we focused on the Tucker–Lewis Index (<italic>TLI</italic>) and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (<italic>RMSEA</italic>) values as evidence of model fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431611414062">Chen, 2007</xref>). The <italic>TLI</italic> is related to the total variance accounted for in the model and corrects for model complexity; values larger than 0.90 are desired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431611414062">Kline, 2010</xref>). In addition, the <italic>RMSEA</italic> is related to the residual variance; values less than 0.05 indicate a good fit; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431611414062">Kline, 2010</xref>). Comparison of fit for the current analysis was based on Chen’s guidelines (i.e., the fit of the two models differs significantly if <italic>ΔTLI</italic> &gt; 0.010 and <italic>ΔRMSEA</italic> &gt; 0.005). If the fit of the freely estimated model was significantly better than the fit of the constrained model, then the freely estimated model was preferred, which would indicate that associations between early risk behaviors and injury differed in strength across countries. If this was not the case, then the constrained model was preferred, which would indicate that the associations were similar across countries.</p>
<p>Next, we performed a multigroup analysis with those countries (<italic>N</italic> = 17) that had sufficient students who reported engagement in four early risk behaviors, following the same procedures as described earlier. On the basis of our findings, we defined a final model for presentation.</p>
<p>Finally, as an additional analysis, we performed a multigroup analysis for boys and girls to determine whether the associations differed by gender.</p>
<p>Since the type of cluster sampling varied from one country to another, commonly applied sandwich estimator methods were not possible. A decomposition of the variances revealed that school and class levels accounted for only 1.3% and 0% of the variance in injury, respectively. To be conservative in our analyses, we therefore applied the 0.1% alpha-error threshold rather than the usual 5% threshold.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 47,106 adolescents were included in our analyses. Each country had a large, nationally representative sample, 48.5% of whom were boys. The rate of engagement in physical activity each day differed substantially across countries, ranging from 9.2% (Iceland) to 26.9% (Russian Federation). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431611414062">Table 1</xref> presents the mean age of onset of risk behaviors in the 25 countries included in this study (based on youth reporting the behaviors). Smoking tobacco yielded the lowest mean age of initiation (13.1), followed by drunkenness (13.8), and sexual intercourse (14.2). The percentage of children reporting engagement in early risk behaviors and injuries within countries differed substantially cross-nationally (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431611414062">Table 2</xref>). Overall, 40.7% of the adolescent population in the 25 countries engaged in at least one early risk behavior; 18.2% engaged in multiple early risk behaviors.</p>

<p>The second multigroup analysis included only those countries that had sufficient students reporting engagement in four early risk behaviors (<italic>N</italic> = 17). This model had a good fit with all paths constrained. Allowing the paths to vary across countries did not improve the fit (<italic>ΔTLI</italic> = 0.008 and <italic>ΔRMSEA</italic> = 0.002), which supported the consistency of our findings across countries. Adolescents who engaged in multiple early risk behaviors were up to 1.85 fold more likely to report medically attended injuries compared to adolescents who did not engage in early risk behaviors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272431611414062">Table 4</xref>). As the odds ratios of engagement in one, two, and three early risk behaviors were comparable to those in the previous model (<italic>N</italic> = 25), we assumed that the odds ratio of engagement in four early risk behaviors in the final model (<italic>N</italic> = 17) was also applicable to the eight countries that did not have sufficient students engaging in four early risk behaviors. The final model also revealed that (a) boys were more likely to be injured than were girls, (b) increasing frequency of physical activity was associated with increasing chances of becoming injured, and (c) adolescents with higher family affluence were more likely to be injured.</p>

<p>Finally, to test whether the current findings were similar in strength for boys and girls, we defined and tested a multigroup model with two groups defined by gender. Both the model where regression paths were constrained across gender and the model where they were freely estimated had a perfect fit (<italic>RMSEA</italic> = 0.000, <italic>TLI</italic> = 1.00 and <italic>RMSEA</italic> = 0.001, <italic>TLI</italic> = 0.999, respectively). As there was no significant difference between the fit of the models (<italic>ΔTLI</italic> = 0.001 and <italic>ΔRMSEA</italic> = 0.001), we chose the most parsimonious model, which was the model with constrained paths. This indicates that there were no observed gender differences in the association between early risk behaviors and injury.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study resulted in two major findings. First, it profiled the prevalence of early risk taking in 25 countries in terms of smoking, drunkenness, cannabis use, and sexual intercourse. Second, it demonstrated a cross-national consistent and cumulative association between the number of early risk behaviors that adolescents engaged in and the occurrence of injury at age 15. The fact that we found an association is remarkable, as much time had passed between the engagement in some risk behaviors (e.g., smoking before age 13) and the experience of injury at age 15. Because of the cross-sectional design of the current study, we cannot make inferences regarding causality. However, a causal pathway between early risk behaviors and injury has been questioned in previous studies that had found a high correlation between psychosocial characteristics, stress, risk taking, and injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431611414062">Macdonald, Erickson, Wells, Hathaway, &amp; Pakula, 2008</xref>). It seems likely that a third variable (i.e., a high-risk lifestyle) explains both adolescent early risk behavior and injury at age 15. This conclusion is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431611414062">Moffitt’s (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431611414062">2006</xref>) findings in that early onset of risk behavior is related to unhealthy behaviors and negative outcomes later in life.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, due to the cross-sectional nature of the current data, the temporal sequence between some reported risk behaviors and injury remains unclear. To illustrate, the 15-year-old youth were asked whether they had experienced injuries in the year before this study; however, participants were also asked whether they had ever used cannabis. Thus, participants may have experienced an injury prior to using cannabis. However, this was not viewed as a major issue for the interpretation of our findings as we placed both behaviors in the context of a high-risk lifestyle.</p>
<p>The cross-national relationship as demonstrated by our modeling is important. Specifically, the consistency of our findings is remarkable in that there are many factors that could potentially eliminate the associations between early risk behaviors and injury. For example, there are large variations in access to medical care for the treatment of injuries across countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272431611414062">Schoen &amp; Doty, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, cultural factors are likely to influence individual adolescents’ decision to seek medical assistance when injured. Existing studies have demonstrated that cultural dimensions play an important role in medicine use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431611414062">Deschepper et al., 2008</xref>), medical communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431611414062">Meeuwesen, van den Brink-Muinen, &amp; Hofstede, 2009</xref>), and medical compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272431611414062">Larsen, Stovring, Kragstrup, &amp; Hansen, 2009</xref>). All these factors may cause an injured adolescent in one country to visit a doctor and be treated, whereas an adolescent in a different country with a similar injury might not be treated or might not even seek medical assistance. Finally, countries differ considerably in terms of prevalence rates and policies with respect to young people’s substance use and sexual activity. Sex education strategies for youth in European and North American countries differ noticeably concerning educational curricula and approach taken in the classroom (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272431611414062">Lewis &amp; Knijn, 2003</xref>). Similar differences in approach can be found with respect to substance use policies. For example, though alcohol is prohibited for youth up to age 20 in Iceland, youth from age 16 onwards are legally allowed to purchase and drink alcoholic beverages in Italy and Portugal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272431611414062">International Center for Alcohol Policies, January 2011</xref>). Because so many differences exist concerning laws on substance use, it is noteworthy that we observed a cross-national consistent relationship between early risk behavior and injury.</p>
<p>Past efforts have focused on the detection of cross-national differences in risk behaviors and their relationship to health outcomes. Therefore, it is significant that the current results yielded similarities in associations across countries. They suggest that the relationship between early risk behaviors and physical injuries may not be significantly influenced by cultural factors. The possibility remains, however, that mediating effects vary between countries; future research is encouraged to investigate these mechanisms in more detail.</p>
<p>A secondary finding that deserves attention in this discussion is that youth from more affluent families were more likely to be injured, independent of their engagement in early risk behaviors, physical exercise, and gender. A possible explanation for this is that youth from more affluent families have better access to medical facilities compared to youth from less affluent families. This may especially be the case in countries with large socioeconomic inequities. In addition, youth from more affluent families are more likely to engage in injury-producing sports frequently than are youth from less affluent families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431611414062">Gorely, Atkin, Biddle, &amp; Marshall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431611414062">Seabra, Mendonça, Thomis, Peters, &amp; Maia, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272431611414062">Walters, Barr, Wall, &amp; Neumark, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Limitations of this study include the self-reported nature of our data, which are subject to social desirability and recall bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431611414062">Aday &amp; Cornelius, 2006</xref>). Although far from perfect, self-administered surveys are virtually the only practical method that can be used to simultaneously obtain a broad range of health indicators for a study of this size. Our questionnaire items were developed iteratively over many years and were supported by validation efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431611414062">Currie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431611414062">Currie, Nic Gabhainn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611414062">Currie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272431611414062">Roberts et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the effect estimates in our final model were modest, which may lead one to conclude that the associations are not important. However, the estimates should be interpreted with caution as they were conservative; specifically (a) the association tested was indirect, and (b) our outcome variable of injury was broadly defined. Rather than focusing on severe injuries, we included any type of injury an adolescent had experienced for which they received medical attention. This broad definition of injury likely biased our results toward no effect. A final limitation of the current study was the cross-sectional nature of the study design, and no causal inferences could be made. Therefore, longitudinal confirmation of the observed relationships is encouraged.</p>
<p>The current study is unique in several respects. First, our examination of the cumulative versus individual effects of the four risk behaviors, though consistent with problem behavior theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431611414062">Jessor &amp; Jessor, 1977</xref>), has rarely been the focus of past etiological studies of injury in adolescent samples. Second, the current focus on early risk behaviors was unique in comparison to other research that has predominantly focused on concurrent risk behaviors as well as a more direct link between risk behaviors and the occurrence of injury. Third, the quality of our analyses was considered high due to our application of modern imputation techniques, which minimized the potential for bias from missing data. Finally, a major strength of this study was its international scope; it included populations of young people from diverse cultures. Our confirmation of a cross-national consistent pattern that links early risk behaviors with later occurrence of injury is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Our findings have implications for prevention as they provide confirmation that early engagement in risk behaviors may be related to a lifestyle that includes a high risk for injury. Public health interventions may need to consider the multiple risk behavior phenomena during early adolescence as an important determinant of health and focus on this clustered risk behavior phenomenon, as opposed to focusing on individual risk behaviors in isolation. At a societal level, this may affect the content of health promotion campaigns. At an individual level, children who engage in a number of early risk behaviors may benefit from individual, focused interventions that promote a healthier lifestyle in general. Our list of risk behaviors provides a basis for a useful administrative tool that may be used in the early screening for at-risk adolescents.</p>
