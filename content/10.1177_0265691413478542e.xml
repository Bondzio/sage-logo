<p>It is only in the past few generations that scholars have taken taverns, alcohol consumption and public drinking as serious subjects of historical inquiry. This may seem surprising as these themes offer the perfect opportunity to illuminate questions surrounding state formation, economic exchange, cultural norms, social behaviour and consumer tastes. However, in the last few decades significant studies have been produced which take the places where alcohol was served and consumed as important topics of historical consideration. This four-volume collection is a valuable companion to much of that literature as it brings together an impressive range of primary source material from France, the Holy Roman Empire and America. The sources from each country form a separate volume, which is edited and introduced by specialists in the respective fields. Thomas Brennan, an expert in eighteenth-century France, edited that volume and also served as the general editor for the entire collection. He provides a stimulating general introduction, which highlights key themes across the three centuries and two continents. First and foremost it seems that these spaces were above all places of sociability for the common people of the early modern world; they represented according to Brennan ‘the plebean communal sphere’ (I, xx). Not only were reputations made and notions of honour played out in taverns, but they also became the centre for news, gossip and social exchange as well as places to lubricate business deals and cement professional relationships. The notion that these spaces provided a type of public sphere in this period serves as a corrective to much of the literature on ‘the public sphere’ which tends to focus on elites and their discursive practices and fails to account for the tangible role that inns, taverns and drinking houses played in early modern culture.</p>
<p>A number of key questions guide the collection. What were the differences in drinking establishments in the different countries and how were these regulated? The quality and quantity of drinks consumed from beer, mead, cider and wine to various types of spirits is also prevalent in the sources. Brennan estimates that national averages for pure alcohol consumption per annum were between 12 to 15 litres per person. So the question is not so much what people were drinking but how and why they drank, that is to say the more cultural aspects of alcohol consumption rather than the biological ones. Much has been made of the debauchery and violence associated with taverns, but what about the constructive aspects of public drinking? How did taverns contribute to the commercialization of society? Also what role did women occupy within these spaces? The sources in this collection attempt to shed light on these important questions (and many others), and some of the answers are striking. For example, the introduction of spirits in much of Europe caused many problems because, gin, most notably, was sold in shops for taking away or in stalls on the street. Spirits in North America did not seem to cause the same consternation, as they were served and integrated into the taverns, inns and public houses of the New World.</p>
<p>The sheer range of sources is remarkable. Not only are there legal documents relating to controlling the availability of alcohol through opening times and licensing, but also the inventories of tavern-keepers, illumintating the range of drinks on offer. There are also various tax records, police interrogations and catering menus. Government officials, the police and clerics have spilled much ink in describing the social ills caused by public drinking. In the volume on the Holy Roman Empire, edited by Beat Kümin and B. Ann Tlusty, a sermon against drunkenness delivered around 1540 in Halberstadt by the Lutheran theologian Eberhard Weidensee is reproduced. Here we see how clearly drink is linked with sin, ‘a drunkard is just as bad as an adulterer, pedophile, idolater, thief and murderer, etc., and will not inherit God’s kingdom, but join the Devil and all of the damned in the eternal fires of Hell’ (II, 103). While there has been much work on how the Reformation theologians viewed alcohol consumption, it is valuable to have relatively unknown sermons translated and reproduced in this fashion. Another fascinating inclusion is the advertisements for taverns in America in the volume edited by David Hancock and Michelle McDonald. In the second half of the eighteenth century there were more and more taverns in the British colonies vying for customers’ trade. The tavern keepers became increasingly aware of pricing and offering their customers the most competitive rate for their drinks. They took out adverts in local newspapers calling attention to their businesses and the good value they offered. Did this reflect a burgeoning American entrepreneurial spirit? Advertisements of this nature may have existed in Europe, but they are not mentioned or included in the volumes on the Holy Roman Empire and France.</p>
<p>One of the great strengths of this collection is the diversity of experience that is captured by the documents. It is a testament to the extraordinary dedication and years of work in the archives that were needed to bring this collection to fruition. It is a pity that the planned volume on England could not be included as so many of the comparisons in the introductions are with English public houses. Yet there is still much for scholars to savour, especially since the hundreds of sources from Europe have been translated into English for the first time. This fine collection has succeeded in opening up new aspects of tavern life for scholars, teachers and students and will provide rich material for seminars and research projects on drinking in the early modern world for years to come.</p>
