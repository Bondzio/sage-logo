<p>When people think of a brand, they often think of a logo or specific graphic identity: the Nike swoosh, Apple’s apple, the Komen Foundation’s pink ribbon, Coca-Cola’s distinctive typeface and color. Therefore, it is unsurprising that branding requests often include phrases like “we need to update the logo” or “we need to update our messaging.” The unspoken logic seems to be: <italic>Through creative alchemy, the right graphic identity or messages will result in accomplishing all our objectives—greater recognition, more behavior change, more funders, maybe even the ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound . . ..</italic>
</p>
<p>I suspect great brands do involve a little creative alchemy—though it results in greatness only when applied to a solid strategic foundation. Just as a chef uses a thorough understanding of food chemistry, carefully selected ingredients, <italic>and</italic> creativity to construct a memorable meal, great brands are built using a thorough understanding of how brands and people work, the ability to carefully select ingredients, <italic>and</italic> creativity. These first two components often get overlooked.</p>
<p>Those who ask for branding support and think they just need a new logo or message are akin to some restaurant customers: They know they want something good but are not chefs themselves. The challenge, then, is to help our non-chefs prepare a great meal. To that end, here is a crash course in branding. To stretch our chef analogy, think of it as a cookbook in progress. Pulled together from resources old and new, it has been sampled and refined as colleagues and I work with people who are trying to harness branding’s power to improve their social marketing efforts.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524500412451557">
<title>Identity Versus Identifiers</title>
<p>Often when we are asked to work on a branding effort, it is immediately clear that we need to help the decision makers deepen their knowledge of how branding works. A good starting point is to step back and distinguish a brand’s <italic>identity</italic> from its <italic>identifiers. </italic>The identifiers are the familiar visual (and sometimes aural) indicators of the brand, such as logos, tag lines, color schemes, and typefaces; the identity is something quite different:<disp-quote>
<p>A brand is a collection of perceptions about an organization, formed by its every communication, action, and interaction. It is what people collectively say, feel, and think about your organization. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500412451557">Daw &amp; Cone, 2011</xref>, p. 20)</p>
</disp-quote>Building on this definition, there are a couple of points to keep in mind about brands: First, organizations, products, and programs that already exist are not starting with a blank slate. They <italic>have </italic>a brand identity—a set of perceptions—in the minds of people who have interacted with them.</p>
<p>Second, this brand identity comes from individuals’ collective experience with the organization. The identity cannot be changed simply by changing (or introducing) brand identifiers; all the brand identifiers do is evoke the brand identity. Here is an analogy I find useful: A brand’s identifiers “work” the same way a picture of a person, place, or object works. If the person, place, or object is familiar, the picture brings to mind specific feelings or memories associated with the image. If the depicted person, place, or object is unfamiliar, aspects of the image—color, style, and so on—will determine how it “feels” to us and, in turn, whether we perceive it as personally relevant and appealing—or not.</p>
<p>The third point is that people react emotionally to brands. Though this is one of the areas that can cause discomfort for data-driven people who run or approve many social marketing programs, behavioral economists and psychologists are piling up evidence that humans are not known for being rational when making decisions.</p>
<sec id="section2-1524500412451557">
<title>Your Brand: Superhero or Sage or Best Friend?</title>
<p>Before we can develop a brand’s identifiers, we must first determine its identity—both the one it has, if it already exists, and the one we would like it to have. An easy, fun, and popular approach is to think of brands in terms of the role they play in people’s lives. Using stories, specifically archetypal characters and plots, is very helpful. Why? Because we are evolutionarily hardwired to think in story terms: humans have communicated using stories for over 100,000 years—much longer than written communication (6,000 or 7,000 years) or modern expository forms such as argument, persuasion, and logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412451557">Haven, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Archetypes are universally recognized personalities and behaviors that occur across cultures and time periods. They are used in a number of branding systems; the oldest and most famous may be the 12-archetype system described in <italic>The Hero and the Outlaw: Building Extraordinary Brands through the Power of Archetypes</italic>, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524500412451557">Margaret Mark and Carol Pearson (2001)</xref>. Carol Pearson’s website provides detailed descriptions of each archetype: http://www.herowithin.com/, though the names alone convey the basics: Innocent, Everyperson, Hero, Caregiver, Explorer, Lover, Revolutionary, Creator, Magician, Ruler, Sage, and Jester. Jim Signorelli’s recent book, <italic>StoryBranding: Creating Stand-out Brands through the Power of Story </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500412451557">2012</xref>) is another particularly useful resource. Type “archetypal brands” into a search engine to find many other branding systems based on archetypes. While the systems differ on the number and exact characteristics of the archetypes and whether a brand can reflect more than one archetype, they operate on the same underlying premise: by using archetypal characters and stories, we connect to people using a universally understood “language.” Archetypes help us clarify and focus brands so that they engage people with a consistent, recognizable identity. They also help us understand how organizations offering essentially the same product or service can differentiate themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, when you first mention to educated left-brainers that they should think of the brand as a character in someone’s life, you may be met with skepticism and rolling eyes. Here is some evidence they may find compelling: Research has demonstrated that we remember information presented as a story better and longer than the same information presented in any other form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412451557">Haven, 2007</xref>). One of the main reasons we build brands is to be memorable to our audiences, so why not use the information structure that best accomplishes that? If you need to convince a skeptic or just want a fascinating read, consult Kendall Haven’s <italic>Story Proof: the Science Behind the Startling Power of Story </italic>(2007).</p>

<sec id="section3-1524500412451557">
<title>Doing Your Homework</title>
<p>Like cooking a meal or painting a room, time invested in preparation results in a final brand of higher quality. The exact amount of time will depend on the scope of the branding effort, the amount of existing information available, and the number of decision makers. Creating a brand for a new program might take a month or two; updating an organization’s brand identity and identifiers can easily take 6 months or longer. Brand development is a three-stage process, with each stage customized to the needs and time available: assess current perceptions, craft a brand identity, and bring the brand to life.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524500412451557">
<title>Phase 1: Assess Current Perceptions Among Audiences and Stakeholders</title>
<p>How do customers, employees, volunteers, funders, and partners “see” the organization, product, or service—and how do they see competing organizations, products, or services? The goal here is to understand a brand’s current identity and those of its “competitors”—in the brand owner’s mind and in the minds of audiences and stakeholders. The starting point is an environmental scan to determine how the organization describes itself or its product or program—and how competitors describe their offerings. “Competitors” in this sense means any organization, product, or program that an organization’s stakeholders—funders, partners, intermediaries, or target audiences—might turn to or support instead of yours.</p>
<p>Primary research with stakeholders can help identify the roles your organization or product and its competitors are perceived to play. At a minimum, internal stakeholders should be involved; ideally, you will engage external stakeholders and target audiences as well. Engagement can be via group discussions, one-on-one interviews, or a mix. A starting point can be asking them what role each organization plays, or what they consider to be the organization’s/product’s/program’s strengths. It is important to uncover their salient beliefs and feelings about the brands. “What thoughts and feelings come to mind when you think of. . . ?” can be quite enlightening. To use archetypes during this phase, one technique that works well is to give research participants a set of archetype definitions and ask them to assign an archetype to each the organization or product. Supplementary activities can include asking them to complete brand personality inventories in which they are given a list of adjectives and asked to choose those applicable to the brand, such as that developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524500412451557">Aaker (1997)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524500412451557">
<title>Phase 2: Develop an Appropriate Brand Identity</title>
<p>What does or can this organization, product, or service offer that will satisfy the wants and needs of audiences and stakeholders—and do so better than any alternatives? Answering this question involves looking for the niches where an organization’s expertise or a product’s benefits match up with stakeholders’ desired benefits. Ideally you will find an unoccupied niche—a place where no competing organization or product already meets stakeholder wants and needs. A starting point for this exercise is to identify the archetypes your organization or product aspires to. One approach is to present the results of earlier research on the organization/program’s current role and that of competitors. Once aspirations have been identified, they often need tempering with the reality of what stakeholders will see as believable roles for your organization to play. Think of stakeholders as teens and your organization or program as parents: some roles just will not be acceptable, no matter how much your organization might want to play them.</p>
<p>Developing the appropriate brand identity is typically an iterative process conducted among a group of internal stakeholders. Other exercises that can be useful here include asking participants to describe your organization or product and competitors using familiar personalities—celebrities, brands of beer or wine, and so on. Asking participants to complete the following sentence (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412451557">Sutton, Balch, &amp; Lefebvre, 1995</xref>) also can be helpful:<disp-quote>
<p>If I (choose brand) instead of (a competitor), I will (benefit) because (support).</p>
</disp-quote>Traditionally many of us have used a standard creative brief to convey brand identity by describing the target audience, the action they should take after exposure to the brand, the benefit they will receive in exchange, how to make attainment of that benefit compelling, and the openings and image to use to reach the audience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500412451557">Signorelli (2012)</xref> suggests an interesting alternative, which is to craft an “I am” statement. It basically takes the “If I” sentence above and explodes it into a story written from the audience member’s point of view that describes the experience she or he has now (obstacles to be overcome) and the experience she or he would like to have (desired benefits). It conveys all the information contained in a creative brief, but in a more personal way that allows the creative team (and everyone else using the brief) to connect with and understand the prospect emotionally as well as analytically. “I am” statements can provide insight into anything you are creating, whether it is a brand, a slide presentation, or this article. They are a quick, powerful way to establish empathy with an audience and then determine what to say and how to say it.</p>
<p>When developing a brand identity, some organizations also wrestle with whether to have one organizational identity across all products, programs, or departments, whether to have completely separate program identities, or whether to coordinate organizational and program identities in some fashion. One option is an “endorsed” brand architecture, in which each program uses its own logo or name, with the organization’s logo becoming an endorsing mark—similar to how the Good Housekeeping “seal of approval” is used. Another is the relational, or “branded house” model: The organization’s logo appears in conjunction with the program or product name; separate program or product logos are not used, though each program or product may have a distinct graphic identity, such as a signature color that harmonized with the main brand color/colors (Kirby, Taylor, Freimuth, &amp; Parvanta, 2001). Providing examples of each approach can help people visualize the possibilities, such as General Electric’s organizational branding versus the product-specific branding used by Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524500412451557">
<title>Phase 3: Developing Identifiers and Implementing the Identity</title>
<p>Once we know the role a brand will play and have a brief describing the brand identity, it is time for the alchemy: We can turn it over to a creative team that will use symbols, metaphors, and visuals to evoke that character by tapping into our cultural code—our shared understanding of how to read symbolic meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500412451557">Hirschman &amp; Thompson, 1997</xref>). As with earlier phases, this process tends to be iterative—and as with all creative endeavors, the strongest products reflect one point of view. The cliché “too many cooks spoil the broth” comes to mind.</p>
<p>Changing the visual or aural identifiers and developing new message points and graphic identity system are just the starting point in conveying brand identity. Every interaction an individual has with an organization, its products, and its representatives shapes its brand identity in the person’s mind. Every interaction—from how a phone call is answered to how easy it is to get to a product to what appears in social media or how well a product works—can reinforce or detract from desired brand identity. The final step of implementation is taking a critical look at every touch point and making any needed renovations to ensure each contact delivers the brand promise.</p>

<title>Applications and Inspiration</title>
<p>Examples of brands embodying these concepts are all around us; many of the sources in the reference list discuss some of them in detail. A wonderfully literal application is provided by our publisher<italic>:</italic>
</p>
<p>“Sage” is, after all, an archetype. Here is a description of it from Carol Pearson’s website (www.herowithin.com): “Sage organizations often are very successful at developing significant expertise; gathering and analyzing information so that it’s useful to others; and contributing knowledge to almost any situation.” Note how the brand identifiers reinforce this positioning, particularly the shade of blue (see www.sagepub.com), which is often associated with descriptors such as credible and authoritative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500412451557">Eiseman, 2006</xref>).</p>
