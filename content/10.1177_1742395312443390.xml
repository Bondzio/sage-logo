<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To explore the use of metaphoric language to convey emotion in interviews with people affected by motor neurone disease, a progressive neurological condition that sits between chronic and terminal illness.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Secondary analysis of 46 interviews with people affected by motor neurone disease in the United Kingdom (35 individuals with the condition, 11 carers).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Metaphor and figurative language was used to communicate the intensely emotional experiences of being diagnosed with and living with motor neurone disease. We focus on three pervasive themes that were threaded throughout the interviews: battling and fighting; the self under attack and journeying through a physical and emotional landscape.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> This secondary analysis of qualitative research interviews enriches our understanding of the articulation of emotion in motor neurone disease and adds to the literature on metaphor in chronic illness. Of particular interest is how the metaphors used contrasted with other conditions in the relative absence of metaphors of ‘fighting’ the disease. Furthermore, we analyse the ways in which participants used metaphors to give voice to emotions that are extremely difficult to articulate in ‘literal’ language, and how, in doing so, they blurred the distinction between ‘physical’ symptoms and ‘emotional’ states. Sensitivity to metaphors may help professionals communicate with people affected by motor neurone disease.</p>

<p>The analysis of how people talk about, and make sense of, their own and others’ experiences of illness is a major branch of research in the sociology of chronic illness. This takes many forms, including discursive and narrative analyses of the media and interviews. In this paper, we examine how people describe their experiences of living with motor neurone disease (MND), both as patients and as carers, with particular focus on the use of metaphoric language to articulate different emotional states.</p>
<p>Since Sontag’s much-discussed <italic>Illness as Metaphor</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312443390">1</xref></sup> the metaphoric analysis of illness-related discourse has developed into a vibrant research area. Sontag’s central thesis, critiquing the dominant cancer-related metaphors of the time, was that the use of ‘unscientific’ metaphors has a primarily destructive effect. However, while Sontag called for a stripping away of metaphor from discourses of illness, the feasibility and the benefit of doing so has been questioned.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312443390">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395312443390">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Metaphor has been described as ‘understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312443390">4</xref></sup><sup>(p.5)</sup> Furthermore, it has been argued that metaphor is more than a rhetorical device and that metaphoric ways of knowing are fundamental to how we experience and understand the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312443390">4</xref></sup> Thus, we treat metaphoric language as an important way in which people express their experiences of chronic illness and as part of the process of coping with the changes taking place in their bodies and lives.</p>
<p>Metaphoric analyses have been carried out in relation to many conditions but have been particularly popular in relation to HIV/AIDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395312443390">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395312443390">8</xref></sup> and cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312443390">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395312443390">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312443390">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312443390">10</xref></sup> Sontag’s initial critique of cancer metaphors was concerned with the culture of blame surrounding cancer and the psychologisation of the ‘cancer personality’ as repressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312443390">1</xref></sup> Yet, many metaphors of cancer are centred on hope and enlist the imagery of the ‘survivor’ and ‘hero’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395312443390">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312443390">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312443390">10</xref></sup> Indeed, the analysis of the metaphors used in cancer narratives demonstrates how illness metaphors are not stable. For example, Seale has shown how they differ in relation to the cancer in question as well as gender.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312443390">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>This raises questions on the role metaphor plays in how people communicate their experience of different illnesses in order to convey intense and unfamiliar emotions. Here, we explore the use of metaphoric language in interviews conducted with people affected by MND, both to enrich our understanding of emotion in this condition and to add to the existing body of work on metaphor in chronic illness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1742395312443390"><title>Motor neurone disease</title>
<p>MND is a rare, incurable and unpredictable condition characterised by progressive muscle weakness, affecting the arms, legs and/or muscles associated with breathing and swallowing. It typically affects people over the age of 40, with men affected approximately twice as often as women. Speed of progression is impossible to predict. People with the commonest form of MND starting with limb weakness – amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) – usually survive 2–5 years from diagnosis. Those whose symptoms start in the throat and mouth (‘bulbar onset’) tend to deteriorate faster and may live only a few months. Rarer, more slowly progressing forms include primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and progressive muscular atrophy (PMA). MND is sometimes characterised by ‘emotional lability’ – involuntary expression of emotions which are judged to be ‘inappropriate’ in the circumstances, such as laughing at a funeral. While this pertains to the expression of emotions, we do not include this as an aspect of the condition because it affects a person’s involuntary expression of emotion rather than their ability to articulate their emotions.</p>
<p>Given the lack of effective treatment, and the prospect of rapid deterioration, a diagnosis of MND is an ‘existential shock’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395312443390">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, Brown argues that ‘MND lies astride the terminal and chronic categories’, an ‘uneasy interface’: people know they will die, usually fairly soon, but in the meantime they need to adapt to a series of progressively dependent states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395312443390">12</xref></sup><sup>(p.216)</sup> Yet, the variability of symptoms makes it difficult to know what they need to adapt to and when. Although the cause of the disease is usually unknown, approximately 5–10% of those diagnosed will have an inherited form (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mndassociation.org">http://www.mndassociation.org</ext-link>).</p>

<sec id="sec4-1742395312443390"><title>Original study</title>
<p>We report findings from a re-analysis of narrative interviews from a study conducted in 2006–2007. One author (LL) was the lead researcher on the original study, which was a wide-ranging exploration of what it is like to live with MND. Interviews were conducted with 35 people living with MND across the United Kingdom (including three joint interviews with a carer where the individual was unable to speak). Eleven people with experience of caring for a family member with MND were also interviewed on their own, making 46 interviews and 49 participants. Variation was sought across demographic variables as well as type of experience. Most people with MND in the sample had ALS or bulbar onset forms; eight had PMA or PLS. Ethical approval for the study was received from the Eastern Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee (ref: 03/05/016), and this included approval for secondary analysis.</p>
<p>Participants were interviewed at home. Most interviews lasted 1 to 2 hours. The first half of the interview used a narrative approach, inviting people to tell their story in their own words. Semi-structured interviewing was then used to explore key topics in more depth and to cover additional ones not raised during the narrative portion of the interview. The semi-structured section of the interview included issues of relevance to MND derived from the clinical and social science literature on illness experiences generally and MND specifically – for example mobility and mobility aids, but also the psychosocial impact of loss of mobility. Interviews were video- or audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>
<p>The data collection and thematic analysis methods used in the original study have been reported in detail elsewhere,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395312443390">13</xref></sup> and results of another secondary analysis (on social comparison and peer support) have been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395312443390">14</xref></sup> Other findings from the study are available in a format designed for patients and family members at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.healthtalkonline.org/Nerves_and_brain/motorneuronedisease">http://www.healthtalkonline.org/Nerves_and_brain/motorneuronedisease</ext-link>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742395312443390"><title>Secondary analysis</title>
<p>Using Heaton’s five categories of secondary analysis, we suggest this paper falls into the category ‘supra-analysis’, which ‘transcends the focus of the primary study from which the data were derived, examining new empirical, theoretical or methodological questions’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395312443390">15</xref></sup><sup>(p.38)</sup> For the purposes of this re-analysis, LL and co-author FM each took half the interviews and coded all instances of emotional description and vivid language use, including metaphor and simile. Each then examined the coded sections independently to identify overarching thematic categories, and extract instances from each interview in each category. The categories identified at this first stage are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742395312443390">Table 1</xref>. LL and FM then met for reflection and discussion, to compare their different categories and identify the most significant emergent themes, which are presented in ‘Results’ below. These were the themes where there was most agreement between the two coders and which occurred most frequently in the data. At this point, some smaller themes were absorbed into one of the major themes if there seemed to be a clear link. Third author JP independently read through the extracted data around these themes and helped strengthen and confirm the selected thematic focus, and all three then met for further reflection and drafting.

<p>When we started our analysis, we were interested in how people drew on metaphoric language when describing their emotional responses to MND. During the course of this analysis, it became evident that it was extremely difficult, even impossible, to disaggregate when people were using such language to describe ‘emotional’ versus ‘physical’ experiences. For example, when describing the impact that MND had on his life, one interviewee described it as being ‘cut off at the knee’ [James]. While this was a description of his <italic>physical</italic> symptoms of leg weakness, he was, at the same time, using these symptoms as a means of articulating how MND had a major limiting effect on his life, in his words: ‘it rations you’. Thus, we do not attempt to separate out ‘literal’ or ‘figurative’ language use. Rather, following work on the sociology of emotions, we treat emotions as always embodied and bodily symptoms as entangled with emotions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395312443390">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In what follows, we do not provide a complete survey of the metaphors used, which were numerous and varied, but focus on the three major metaphoric themes emerging from our analysis used to describe different emotional states at different stages of the illness. These were battling and fighting; the self under attack and journeying through a physical and emotional landscape. The majority of quotations are from people who themselves have MND; those from carers are indicated as such. Randomly assigned pseudonyms are used to protect the anonymity of interviewees.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1742395312443390"><title/>
<sec id="sec8-1742395312443390"><title>Battling and fighting</title>
<p>Military metaphors are common in lay medical discourse. Indeed, the language of fighting against the enemy ‘disease’ is so commonplace, we barely notice it. Yet differences have been noted in how these images are applied to different conditions. For instance, a comparative analysis of the language used in relation to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and AIDS shows that collective war metaphors were common in the discourse about AIDS, whereas in SARS they were surprisingly absent and the debate was framed more around the condition as a ‘killer’, a single entity rather than an army or force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312443390">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, in the MND interviews analysed here, war-related images and language, such as that of being under attack, as well as ‘battling’, ‘fighting’ or ‘surrendering’, to MND, were used. However, the patterns in which these metaphors were employed differed considerably from the ways in which they have been discussed in relation to most other conditions. For example, in the cases of HIV/AIDS and cancer, there is a preponderance of war-metaphors directed towards the condition, for example, the ‘battle against cancer’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742395312443390">18</xref></sup> In our data, it was strikingly rare for interviewees to describe being at war with MND or fighting the disease directly.</p>
<p>This undoubtedly reflects the lack of treatment available for MND, where the only currently available pharmaceutical therapy, riluzole, may extend life expectancy by just a few months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395312443390">19</xref></sup> In fact, some interviewees drew direct comparisons between MND and cancer, highlighting how in the case of MND, the idea of fighting or doing battle with the disease was not a feasible psychological strategy. For instance, one woman said: ‘So it’s a funny thing because you can’t fight it, whereas with cancer you can. It wiped me out’ [Lucy]. In other cases, what was highlighted was the need to take control and being determined without necessarily being ‘at war’: ‘Because you do have to – not fight exactly – but you have to be determined’ [Patricia]; ‘I want to be in charge of this illness as much as I can be, I suppose’ [Patricia]. Occasionally, people referred to taking part in research as a way to ‘beat’ MND by finding a cure – but crucially this was not directly for themselves but rather indirectly for future unknown patients.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in the cases where people spoke more directly of fighting MND, they had either managed to survive for a long time or had a slower progressing form of the condition such as PMA or PLS. For example: ‘with a very positive attitude you can beat the disease’ (man diagnosed with PMA 7 years before interview) [Henry]. However, even in these cases, this came with a caveat of a need to accept as well as fight:</p><disp-quote>
<p>Fight it, don’t give in to it. Most of the time you can fight it. There are times when I would describe it as hitting a brick wall, and you have to rest, sit down. At those times, listen to your body, because it is a brick wall, and unless you’re aware of it you can’t get through it. (Man with PLS) [Richard].</p></disp-quote>
<p>While it was comparatively rare to find examples where the disease itself was ‘fought’, battle metaphors were drawn on in different, often implicit, ways, to describe other conflicts. In particular, both patients and carers often spoke of needing to ‘fight’ in order to get the support they needed: ‘We’ve had to fight for everything’ [Grant]; describing the district nurse as ‘fighting in our corner’ [Ben]; having to ‘fight’ to get the GP to make a home visit [Ted; carer]. In addition to ‘fighting’ for assistance and support, interviewees occasionally spoke of the people who gave them support in military terms as their ‘troops’ or ‘rallying around’ them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1742395312443390"><title>The self under attack</title>
<p>The distinctive way in which battling metaphors were used in these interviews is closely related to our second theme. Instead of people <italic>fighting</italic> MND, which seemed pointless, the emphasis was rather on being physically <italic>attacked by</italic> MND and destroyed by it.</p>
<p>Interviewees nearly always described receiving the initial diagnosis of MND as an extremely emotional experience. The imagery used included being ‘flattened’, ‘gutted’, going ‘to pieces’, finding it ‘shattering’, ‘crushing, devastating’ or ‘a hammer blow’. While describing a diagnosis as a physical ‘blow’ or attack is not unique to MND, it is important to distinguish between the shock of receiving the diagnosis of <italic>any</italic> serious illness, and the specific case of MND.</p>
<p>First, the imagery of violent attack and bodily collapse was not limited to descriptions of emotional responses to the diagnosis, but was blurred with descriptions of the actual symptoms of the disease in which people spoke of legs ‘collapsing’, being ‘chopped off’ or ‘cut off at the knee’, and becoming ‘trapped’ in a failing body. Although more clinical descriptions, such as the wasting of muscles, were referred to – ‘You are actually wasting. Your muscles are dying off and your nerves are dying with them’ [Matthew] – in general interviewees used imagery that implied more abrupt and dramatic changes than that of ‘wasting’. Others felt trapped in their minds by their inability to communicate. One carer deployed a physical disability word – ‘crippling’ – to convey the impact on her husband of losing speech.</p>
<p>Second, this extended into how people understood their whole future lives and sense of self as being brutally cut off – conceptualised elsewhere as ‘biographical abruption’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395312443390">13</xref></sup> Indeed, Brown and Addington-Hall identify a ‘fracturing’ narrative as one of the ways people describe their experiences of MND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395312443390">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>MND was often described as a physical object or force impacting on people’s bodies and lives: ‘this thing has arrived in my body, something from outside’ [Tim]; ‘It’s almost as though it can strike, you know, like lightning, anywhere it feels first’ [Anthony]; ‘It was like they were saying this big thing is going to like crash onto you’ [Charles]; ‘it’s like living with a time bomb’ [Jane]. In some cases, the disease became personified as an unseen assailant (interestingly this metaphor was explicitly and visually used in the 2009 MND Association awareness campaign ‘Sarah’s Story’), implying a vulnerable, trapped and defenceless situation and a deep sense of personal threat. One couple said the diagnosis ‘crept up on us’, and a woman who watched her father die characterised MND as a thief which ‘robbed him of all movement, of his voice, of the expression in his face’ [Anna; carer]; or the attack might be more overt, as implied in the phrase ‘taking it on the chin’ derived from fist-fighting.</p>
<p>Thus, like cancer, the disease might be conceptualised as an enemy, but unlike cancer its incurable nature held out little prospect of successful retaliation or organised defence – though one woman living with MND described how her mother and brothers ‘built a wall around me and made me feel safe and protected’ [Christine], as if there were some refuge against the besieging force.</p>
<p>In some cases, people employed the idea of judge and/or executioner, describing diagnosis as ‘a death sentence’. For example, a woman present at her mother’s diagnosis said: ‘I felt that the consultant was very used to delivering these verdicts, and that’s what it felt like, it felt like a death sentence. It felt awful’ [Amy; carer].</p>
<p>In one unusual personification of the condition, a man who drew on Buddhist and Hindu philosophy described it as an unexpected guest:</p><disp-quote>
<p>The body is a home… That disease comes in my body, which is entering in the house of my own. Now we always say, ‘Whatever enters is a guest, and I am the host.’ Now, there’s a relationship between the host and the guest. When a host arrives, we have to accept and welcome. Now it’s up to the guest to see the same thing… If we both have to live together happily, we have to behave happily both together. [Tim]</p></disp-quote>
<p>Whilst this might be presented as something (or someone) you must accommodate, the lack of invitation nonetheless suggests a degree of personal invasion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1742395312443390"><title>The journey through physical and emotional landscape</title>
<p>Feeling the self to be under attack was most acute around diagnosis but could persist or resurface later on. Nonetheless, people described a process of realising that the threat was not quite as immediate as they first thought, and having to adjust to living with the condition for whatever time they had left. If ‘fighting’ MND was not a feasible way to proceed, what alternative imagery was available to people?</p>
<p>Like ‘fighting illness’, the metaphor of the patient ‘journey’ has a well-established place in healthcare vocabulary. In conditions where recovery is possible, these journeys can be seen as forward progress to a desired goal. In long-term conditions, the journey may be a continual one of self-management and adjustment to each new phase, but never a final arrival. In MND, as with other degenerative conditions, there is a twist in the terms ‘progress’ and ‘progression’: words that can convey positive direction here represent a negative trajectory. However, rather than the metaphor of a journey being disregarded or avoided, interviewees employed a rich interconnected range of images of journey, place, and landscape to describe feelings about life with MND.</p>
<p>Some people, especially immediately after diagnosis, spoke of how they either felt they had no sense of direction (consistent with Frank’s chaos narrative)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395312443390">21</xref></sup> or described a descent to a very dark place: ‘We went through hell, there’s no two ways about it. You have got nowhere to turn’ [Geoff]; ‘I did feel blackened by the diagnosis’ [Maria]; ‘I’ve been in that black place, I don’t like it’ [Jane].</p>
<p>As the illness progressed, imagery involving descent and downward paths were common, for example ‘down the road’ (for the future), and ‘going down’ or ‘downhill slope’ to describe symptom progression: ‘Some people do stabilise, I appreciate, but mine just continues to go downhill’ [Cathy]; ‘And that’s a gentle or a, or a slide down, down the ladder’ [Brian; carer]; ‘Once you’re on that downhill slope there’s no brake goes on, there’s no remission with this one’ [Cathy]. This last expression vividly conveys a sense of careering out of control and gathering speed; the fact that the speaker was a wheelchair user gives particular resonance to the lack of brake.</p>
<p>The downward trajectory was not limited to depictions of hills and slopes but often involved images of water and the sea, perhaps reflecting a fear of the sea as an unknown and dangerous place:</p><disp-quote>
<p>I can’t bear to be overwhelmed by it at once [information about MND]. Don’t want to plunge into a sort of rough sea. I’d rather stand on the shore a bit longer and see what goes… I do want support, a bit, but I just at the moment don’t want to be engulfed in it. [Maria]</p></disp-quote>
<p>The word ‘engulfed’ suggests a fear of drowning, which also came across in other interviewees’ use of phrases such as ‘thrown in at the deep end’ [Julia; carer], ‘disappearing in quicksand’ (watching her father with MND) [Anna; carer] and ‘you’ve got to have something to cling onto’ [Lucy], or, in the words of one interviewee: ‘once you give in, I think you’ll just go under’ [Frances; carer]. Again, this may blur the figurative and the physical: many people with MND fear drowning in their own saliva as they lose the ability to swallow.</p>
<p>Others described a sense of being cut off from the familiar world. One woman described how the family felt when they assembled just after her mother’s diagnosis:</p><disp-quote>
<p>It was a bit like being on a desert island, really. It was a week of just disbelief and tears and anger and, you know, just an extraordinary time, really, where none of us wanted to go out, or do anything. It’s really hard to see the day is dawning and to see life, actually, when suddenly you’ve been told that death is the prospect in front of you. [Amy; carer]</p></disp-quote>
<p>The word ‘isolation’ derives from the Latin for ‘island’, an apt geographical metaphor in this case.</p>
<p>Yet, as people adjusted to the idea that they were not going to die immediately, the extended metaphor of being on a journey emerged in various, even positive, ways. While metaphors of ‘going downhill’ reflected irreversible decline, they were coupled with an appreciation that this happened at various speeds, with the ‘plateau’ invoked as a source of hope, though in this example it is checked by the word ‘down’:</p><disp-quote>
<p>I said [to the specialist] ‘I met a man at a garden party who’d got MND, but he’d had it for nine years and he’d plateaued.’ And I said, ‘That could happen to me. I could plateau.’ And this specialist said, ‘Ah, but a lot’s happened in the last year, hasn’t it?’ [laughs] And I thought, ‘Oh, I was trying to be upbeat and, you know, trying to look on the bright side.’ And he was like, ‘Get back down.’ [Lucy]</p></disp-quote>
<p>In addition to drawing on the idea of a ‘plateau’ to describe disease stabilisation, some people said they actively resisted thinking about what lay ahead and managed their emotions through controlling knowledge of the ‘journey’ they were on. One couple described being shocked by seeing others with the condition and thinking, ‘If this is the path he’s going to go down, we’re not going to go there. We’re going to do this our way’ [Julia; carer]. Two particularly prominent ways described for doing this was through judicious mapping of the future and burying heads in the sand.</p>
<p>For example, one man combined mapping and weather forecasting metaphors for describing why he felt healthcare professionals should minimise how much prognostic information they provided:</p><disp-quote>
<p>[Health professionals] should only say how to cope with it, rather than showing all the map, future map. We don’t know. No one knows. A miracle could happen… Anything can happen. Today the forecast is rain is going to happen, but there’s sunshine. Where did it go wrong? So one should never believe in these forecasts, and better not say it. [Tim]</p></disp-quote>
<p>However, it is important to note that as we progressed with our analysis we became increasingly aware of the risk of conflating imagery with meaning. While similar images were often used to indicate similar experiences or emotions, they could also be used in dramatically different ways. For instance, in contrast to the interviewee above where maps represented unwelcome clarity about prognosis, one man used the map metaphor to describe helpful practical guidance from talking to other people with the condition.</p><disp-quote>
<p>Why travel the same road and map it out when somebody’s already been down it and made it a motorway? So, you know, you can whip down, you can bypass all the hurdles, because people have already done them for you. And then you can start finding hurdles further down that you can attack and, and progress on with. [Geoff]</p></disp-quote>
<p>Avoidance and denial were commonly described using the metaphor of the proverbial ostrich that buries its head in the sand, often as a positive choice and coping tactic:</p><disp-quote>
<p>I’m a person that’s a bit like an ostrich, I bury my head in the sand… As much as I can, I try and put the MND to the back of my mind, and live life as I want. [Richard]</p></disp-quote><disp-quote>
<p>I tend to have the keep my head in the sand theory. I know what’s happening. I know roughly what my life span is. I’ve got obviously a good idea of the process and how my life is going to end, so I don’t need to know any more than that. I’ll just accept things as they come and work through the problems as they arrive. [Holly]</p></disp-quote>
<p>In other cases, however, this was seen as problematic, as in the quotation below from a woman with MND about her husband:</p><disp-quote>
<p>He put his head in the sand for a long time. And I had to keep saying to him, ‘Come on. This is happening, you know. You’ve got to face up to it, because I can’t carry you through it. I need your help to get me through it.’ And that’s how I felt, that I was being the strong one for him. But then sometimes I’m not that strong, and I need him to lift me up. [Lucy]</p></disp-quote>
<p>The notion that the road ahead is strewn with hurdles or obstacles occurred in several interviews. People referred to ‘blocks’, ‘barriers’ and ‘brick walls’ in their path, and even a ‘minefield’ in the form of the welfare benefits system. There were many mentions of finding ways ‘round’, ‘through’ and ‘over’ various difficulties or stages in their disease. Starting to use a wheelchair rather than a walking frame made one woman feel that ‘all access was denied’; this was not simply the literal problems of getting to places as a disabled person, but also a sense of exclusion. She explained further using a powerful metaphor of different lands.</p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s a huge jolt when you go to the chair, and by then your friends have lost interest anyway… They don’t realise that that’s the biggie… The [walking] frames are, you’re still vertical. You’re still in the land of the vertical, which is a big difference to the land of the sitting. [Cathy]</p></disp-quote>

<sec id="sec12-1742395312443390"><title>Summary</title>
<p>In this paper, we have focused on three broad interrelated themes: battling and fighting; the self under attack; journeying through a physical and emotional landscape.</p>
<p>In particular, we draw attention to the way interviewees used descriptions of their more concrete physical symptoms to give voice to emotional ones that were hard to express. Rather than the body disappearing in discussions of emotions, bodily experiences and symptoms were constantly employed as a means of articulating emotions. This was particularly poignant in the way that interconnected geographical images were used to structure how people spoke of their experiences of MND, a condition in which their bodies became increasingly recalcitrant and immobile, as part of the extended metaphor of a journey. In contrast with other illnesses, we found a relative absence of metaphors of ‘fighting’ the disease, as opposed to being attacked by it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1742395312443390"><title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>The original research study did not set out to address the use of metaphoric language to describe emotion. This is of course a common concern with secondary analysis. However, our initial round of coding, in which we were looking for references to emotions and metaphoric language use, resulted in a 365-page coding report – in itself an indication of the predominance of such language in the interviews. Many other intriguing metaphors and images were used by interviewees that we have not been able to cover. In some instances, often in response to questions explicitly asked about emotions (for example, ‘could you tell me any other emotions that you felt at that time?’), emotional states were referenced directly (for example, through the words anger, sadness, fear, happiness). More frequently, however, emotions were described using metaphors or other forms of figurative language. We feel therefore that the data were well suited to address this new research topic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1742395312443390"><title>Relation to existing literature</title>
<p>Our findings are in keeping with research that suggests metaphors are used regularly to describe emotions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395312443390">22</xref></sup> Indeed, studies in the history of psychology indicate that in this discipline, where emotions are a central object of concern, multiple, changing metaphors have been used to try and grapple with the nature and meaning of emotions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395312443390">23</xref></sup> Sontag, despite calling for the stripping away of metaphors in favour of biomedical discourse, herself notes that ‘one cannot think without metaphors’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742395312443390">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Various functional reasons have been suggested as explanations for the prevalent use of metaphor, including: ‘compactness’ (achieving rich nuanced meanings in limited space), inexpressibility (giving expression to things that are extremely difficult to express in literal language) and vividness (getting across powerful and affective messages).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742395312443390">24</xref></sup> People affected by MND may reach for metaphor to enable others to understand what they are feeling with an immediacy that factual biomedical language cannot achieve. By focusing on pervasive examples of what have been referred to as structural metaphors – ‘cases where one concept is metaphorically structured in terms of another’ – our aim has been to draw attention to metaphors that not only give expression to but also play a role in how people experience being diagnosed, living and, in many cases, dying, with MND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312443390">4</xref></sup><sup>(p.</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395312443390">14</xref></sup><sup>)</sup></p>
<p>We also note the similarities and differences between the metaphors used in the context of MND compared with other conditions. In a comparative analysis of the metaphors used in relation to AIDS, cancer and heart disease, Weiss drew attention to the way that different types of metaphors are used in relation to different diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742395312443390">25</xref></sup> In heart disease, metaphors centre on the body as (failing) physical machinery, while AIDS and cancer metaphors focus on imagery of pollution and transformation. A significant feature of MND is its diffuse nature; nerves and nerve damage are perhaps less easily visualised than a specific organ or a tumour. Moreover, the rarity of the condition means that it is difficult for individuals to set their experience within the context of a well-rehearsed social narrative. There is neither a shared vocabulary nor an extensive repertoire of stories to invoke, and – given its progressive nature and the absence of any effective treatment – no ‘heroes’ who have fought the illness and won. The closest equivalent is British scientist Stephen Hawking whose long-term survival with the condition provides hope for many, but at the same time, he is acknowledged as an exception. We suggest that these features of MND – its progressive but unpredictable course, its unfocused nature and the lack of a shared social narrative about the condition – shape the way people are able to express their feelings about it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1742395312443390"><title>Clinical implications</title>
<p>Use of metaphor is not just of academic interest. Developing sensitivity to the different metaphors people use to articulate their experience may also aid health and social care practitioners in thinking how they communicate with people affected by MND. If we take the power of metaphor seriously, we must recognise that it can, in some contexts and for some people, have both positive and negative effects. Clearly, the context within which metaphors are used is important, and as our analysis is based on interviews that participants knew would be made available online, they may have used particularly strong metaphors in order to get their points across as vividly as possible. While this may have increased the frequency of metaphoric language use, we do not believe it would change the type of metaphors used.</p>
<p>A potential danger of metaphor is that of becoming prescriptive, promoting only one image or set of metaphorical tools for how to deal with the condition. If people are led to feel ‘fighting’ the condition is the norm, for example, this may lead to a sense of failure or weakness. Unconscious use of imagery we take for granted in other contexts may be inappropriate or even cause distress. The repeated image of the ‘brilliant mind of Stephen Hawking trapped in a failing body’ may be in part responsible for what is now felt to be under-recognition of cognitive problems in MND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742395312443390">26</xref></sup> While there may not be an extensive repertoire of MND stories to invoke, many of the metaphors analysed here echo clinical terminology, patient information literature and charity awareness campaigns. As more people turn to online peer support services, it becomes increasingly likely that metaphors will be picked up, shared and adopted in these forums. Healthcare practitioners and charitable organisation can help by understanding the range of metaphors people employ and offering a more varied discourse. It is worth noting, for example, that the UK MND Association has moved away from the strapline ‘fighting MND’ to ‘our vision is a world free of MND’ and has adopted ‘incurable optimism’ as a campaign tag.</p>
<p>As has already been discussed in the literature, some of the metaphors we have explored, for example the ostrich, suggest that some individuals need to be offered a choice to avoid information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742395312443390">27</xref></sup> This prompts further questions on the potentially therapeutic use that language has in coming to grips with the complex interplay between symptoms and emotions that people deal with while grappling with degenerative conditions.</p>
