<p>Thom Reilly has enjoyed a long and distinguished career, having administered a statewide child welfare system and served as a county manager in Clark County, Nevada, and as vice-chancellor for the Nevada System of Higher Education. Reilly, a fellow in the National Academy of Public Administration, is currently a professor and director of the School of Social Work at San Diego State University and an executive director for the Caesars Foundation. In <italic>Rethinking Public Sector Compensation</italic>, Reilly employs his considerable knowledge and background to examine how public employees are compensated. He argues public employees
<disp-quote>
<p>are paid in many of the wrong ways—in ways that make life easier on public managers, union leaders, employee groups, and elected officials in the short run but create significant challenges for service delivery, government efficiency, and responsiveness in the longer run. (Reilly 2012, p. xvi)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The opening chapters of Reilly’s book—the introduction and Chapter 1—lay the foundation for much of his broader argument. In them, he maintains several recent developments have elevated interest in public sector compensation to the foreground. Most notably, the so-called Great Recession and shortsighted fiscal policies driven by an emphasis on immediate political gains have led to enormous budget shortfalls in many public organizations, especially at the state and local levels. Of equal import, however, has been governments’ tendency to offer defined benefit packages and robust health care plans to public employees, a general lack of transparency in how employee benefits and compensation are adopted, a growth in public sector unions, and rigid, outdated civil service systems. When considered together, current and projected budget shortfalls and mushrooming employee obligations have necessitated cuts in essential programs and services, thereby harming citizens and the broader public interest.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, Reilly examines how the civil service system limits governments’ ability to perform in “effective, efficient, and responsive ways” (p. 39). For Reilly, the U.S. civil service system unduly emphasizes security and seniority and subsequently fosters a culture of mediocrity among public sector employees. Historically, civil service systems protected employees from excessive political interference. However, evidence from modern state and local governments that have transitioned to “at-will” employment suggests we should worry less about political intrusions today. Instead, Reilly maintains we need flexible human resource management systems that attract younger employees, encourage accountability and entrepreneurial thinking, and account for dynamic, networked work environments. He argues modern human resource management systems should be based on at-will employment, incorporate broadbanding and flexible classification systems, and require new institutional arrangements that emphasize the importance of cross-boundary work.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 highlights perceived differences between public and private sector unions. Private sector unions, Reilly argues, greatly improved employees’ work environment and the balance of power and authority in organizations. Public organizations, however, “never exploited public employees, mainly due to the existence of civil service protections” (p. 71). Consequently, it is troubling, in Reilly’s opinion, that membership in private sector unions has declined while membership in public sector unions has grown. Reilly also expresses grave concerns about unions’ ability to exert substantial political pressure within public organizations and on politicians. For instance, he notes unions frequently shape the outcomes of elections and that politicians elected by unions are subsequently responsible for negotiating employee benefits and work conditions. When confronted with the overwhelming political power of public sector unions, politicians are unable to make fiscally sound long-term policy decisions about employee benefits and compensation, and citizens are likely to suffer.</p>
<p>In Chapters 4 and 5, Reilly considers issues of pay and compensation across the public and private sectors. He argues much of the existing research leads to the conclusion that public workers “are either modestly over- or underpaid, depending on the accounting assumptions used” (p. 87). These studies, however, fail to include the value of deferred compensation such as defined benefits pension packages and health care. When deferred compensation is included in models, results across white-collar engineers and blue-collar janitors indicate public employees receive higher compensation and are frequently able to retire earlier than their private sector counterparts, suggesting lifetime benefits must be included in any analysis of public–private sector differentials.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 argues the financial crisis facing governments is likely to continue absent substantial pension reform. First, Reilly maintains public sector organizations should abandon defined benefit pension systems in favor of defined contribution systems for all new employees. Second, state and local governments should be required to fully fund pension obligations. Until they do so, Reilly contends a “moratorium on any new increases in benefits” is necessary (p. 123). Third, Reilly calls for increased transparency in how pensions are awarded and what true pension costs will be over the long run, particularly given the influence of unions. Finally, in Chapter 7, Reilly summarizes his conclusions, arguing a fresh take on compensation necessitates increasing transparency, adding mechanisms that limit conflicts in how compensation is awarded, reducing employee benefits, shifting from defined benefit to defined contribution systems, grounding civil service reforms on at-will employment, and limiting public sector unions’ collective bargaining rights.</p>
<p>On one hand, Reilly’s book would make a welcome addition to any undergraduate or graduate human resource management class for its usefulness in framing contemporary personnel issues and obvious ability to generate considerable classroom discussion and debate. On the other hand, <italic>Rethinking Public Sector Compensation</italic> is remarkably one-dimensional and far from novel. Many of Reilly’s solutions have been proposed and discussed by others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734371X13476051">Battaglio &amp; Condrey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734371X13476051">Sanders, 2004</xref>). More troubling, however, is Reilly’s tendency to overlook or ignore evidence that undermines his basic assertions. Two examples come to mind. First, regarding at-will employment and pay, public administration research consistently raises considerable concerns about the viability of pay-for-performance in public organizations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734371X13476051">Kellough &amp; Lu, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734371X13476051">Perry, Engbers, &amp; Jun, 2009</xref>); critiques have also grown more common among scholars and practitioners interested primarily in the private sector (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734371X13476051">Erturk, Froud, Johal, &amp; Williams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734371X13476051">Matsumura &amp; Shin, 2005</xref>). Second, consider the recent G. W. Bush U.S. Attorney General scandal in which the White House was accused of using attorney positions for political advantage, suggesting administrators may not be quite as immune from political intrusion as Reilly would like us to believe. Had Reilly more thoroughly assessed the challenges and weaknesses associated with his recommendations, many of his arguments would bear more weight.</p>
<p>A second set of concerns involves Reilly’s treatment of the public interest. Throughout his book, Reilly maintains his recommendations are necessary to protect and further the public interest. Unfortunately, Reilly never offers readers any definition of what constitutes the public interest. At best, the public interest seems to encompass efficiency, effectiveness, responsiveness, and the long-term fiscal health of governments and programs. Certainly, each of these values serves the public interest, but so do other values and considerations. Among these are matters of equity, fairness, and representation. It is unclear from Reilly’s book why the values he identifies are, or should be, the most significant considerations when making decisions on behalf of the public interest. Moreover, Reilly frequently asserts public sector unions should not be regarded as a foil against private sector corporations (both construed as special interest groups). Any meaningful explanation why unions’ power is more substantial or problematic than that of private sector corporations is noticeably lacking in Reilly’s argument. Furthermore, it is troubling that public sector unions—comprised of citizens with claims against government at least as legitimate as those held by private sector interests—should inherently matter less or fail to be in the public interest. Once again, Reilly would have strengthened his position substantially by offering readers a more robust rendering of his arguments. Absent such detail, <italic>Rethinking Public Sector Compensation</italic> is, at best, a cursory review of a very narrow set of contemporary views.</p>
