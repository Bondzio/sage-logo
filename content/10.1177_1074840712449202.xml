<abstract>
<p>In an effort to examine translation of family nursing knowledge to practice, the Landspitali University Hospital Family Nursing Implementation Project (2007-2011), was thoughtfully initiated in Reykjavik, Iceland and systematically evaluated. The mission was to implement family nursing in <italic>every</italic> department of the hospital. This publication is the first formal research report from this landmark project. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of a short-term therapeutic conversation intervention with families who were receiving health care services at the Children’s Hospital at Landspitali University Hospital in Iceland related to childhood and adolescent acute and chronic illnesses. The therapeutic conversation was guided by Family Systems Nursing and used the Calgary Family Assessment and Intervention Models (Wright &amp; Leahey, 2005, 2009). Families (<italic>N</italic> = 76) were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (short-term therapeutic conversation: <italic>n</italic> = 41) or to a control group (traditional care: <italic>n</italic> = 35). Parents in the experimental group reported significantly higher family support after the intervention, compared to the parents in the control group. Differences were noted between families experiencing acute versus chronic illnesses. Recommendations are made for conducting and designing intervention research with families experiencing the hospitalization of a child or adolescent.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While family nursing science continues to grow in scope and sophistication, scholars have begun to shift their emphasis towards examine how family nursing knowledge is translated to health care practice environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840712449202">Duhamel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840712449202">Duhamel &amp; Dupuis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074840712449202">Leahey &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2009</xref>). Knowledge translation has been defined as the process of addressing the gap between what is known from science to implementing that knowledge, with the goal in mind to improve health outcomes of individuals and families as well as to improve the productivities of health care systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840712449202">Graham et al., 2006</xref>). An interactive process of knowledge translation involves collaboration between researchers and clinicians in health care settings whereby new knowledge is implemented in practice and the processes of implementation are also examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840712449202">Baumbusch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840712449202">Chesla, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840712449202">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sigurdardottir, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840712449202">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sigurdardottir, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840712449202">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sigurdardottir, 2005</xref>). Research agencies are supporting knowledge translation through the creation of targeted grants for knowledge translation projects and the development of background papers about the models, strategies, and measures of knowledge translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840712449202">Kitson &amp; Bisby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840712449202">Sudsawad, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The Landspitali University Hospital Family Nursing Implementation Project began in 2007 with a systematic plan to translate knowledge to practicing nurses about how to be helpful to the families of patients for whom they cared. This article reports the results of experimental research to evaluate the effectiveness of a short-term therapeutic conversation intervention with families who were receiving health care services because of their child’s/adolescent’s acute or chronic illness admission to the Children’s Hospital at Landspitali University Hospital (LUH) in Reykjavik, Iceland.</p>

<title>The Landspitali University Hospital Family Nursing Implementation Project (2007-2011)</title>
<p>At LUH between 2007 and 2011, a group of nursing scientists and clinicians collaborated to apply Family Systems Nursing (FSN) in clinical practice by (a) simultaneously creating new knowledge through research, and (b) applying it to clinical practices. In this circular process, a variety of strategies have been used and various steps have been taken to clarify the differences between the level of (a) knowledge creation, and (b) application of new knowledge into clinical practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840712449202">Svavarsdottir, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074840712449202">Leahey &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840712449202">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sigurdardottir, 2011</xref>). The major emphasis in this landmark project in family nursing was to (a) educate <italic>all practicing nurses</italic> at LUH in Family Systems Nursing; (b) strengthen the practicing nurses’ clinical skills for intervening with families by offering specific clinical training courses to all nurses using family skills labs; (c) explore and assess the difference that the theoretical and clinical programs make for the nurses, the patients and their families, as well as the family–nurse relationship; and (d) increase the number of nurses practicing at the LUH who could receive a master or a PhD degree in nursing from the University of Iceland. This was done by developing several series of research proposals including MSc and PhD theses, which would allow graduate students in nursing, to become members of the research team, and to work on their theses under the guidance of a Professor from the University of Iceland.</p>

<title>Implementing the Practice Framework of Family Systems Nursing at LUH</title>
<p>The conceptual practice framework of FSN guided the knowledge translation research of the Landspitali University Hospital Family Nursing Implementation Project. FSN was first identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840712449202">Wright and Leahey (1990)</xref> as nursing practice that focuses on the family unit as distinct from a focus on the individual in the context of the family. FSN has received further conceptual clarification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840712449202">Bell; 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712449202">Bell &amp; Wright, 2011</xref>) and has been examined in several studies using primarily qualitative research methods without control groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712449202">Benzein &amp; Saveman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840712449202">Clausson &amp; Berg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840712449202">Duhamel &amp; Talbot, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840712449202">Houger Limacher &amp; Wright, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840712449202">Martinez, D’Artois, &amp; Rennick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840712449202">Moules, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840712449202">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840712449202">Robinson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074840712449202">Robinson &amp; Wright, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1074840712449202">Tapp, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1074840712449202">2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In FSN, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840712449202">Wright and Leahey (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840712449202">Wright and Bell (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712449202">Bell and Wright (2011)</xref> emphasize that nursing practices occur <italic>within a relationship</italic> between the nurse and the individual and/or family, where family assessment and interventions are offered using a systemic interactional perspective. Nursing interventions are offered in a therapeutic conversation within a collaborative, strengths-focused relationship that makes room for multiple realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712449202">Bell &amp; Wright, 2011</xref>). Effective nursing interventions are those to which clients and families respond because of the “fit” between the intervention offered by the nurse and family members.</p>
<p>The Calgary Family Assessment (CFAM) and the Calgary Family Intervention (CFIM) models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840712449202">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>) were used in this study. According to the CFAM and the strength and resiliency-based intervention model (CFIM), nurses ask questions and collaboratively develop interventions (e.g., therapeutic conversation, family genogram and ecomap, therapeutic questions and commendations) with families to enhance their functioning during a health care episode. Families generally present themselves to nurses while coping with an illness or an acute health situation. These models therefore guide nurses in helping families to soften suffering and to promote, sustain or improve effective functioning, well-being, and quality of life. Nurses need to tailor their interventions to each family and to the chosen domain of family functioning (cognitive, affective and/or behavioral functioning). However, whether the family is open to an intervention depends on the family’s history of interactions among family members and between family members and health care professionals. It is helpful to remember that every therapeutic conversation that the nurse and the family have about the family system shapes that system and that this process of interaction (e.g. perceived family support) represents the core of clinical practice with families. It is, however, the families’ judgment as to whether or not they are functioning well that is the most important outcome when intervening with families.</p>

<sec id="section4-1074840712449202">
<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>More information is needed about effectiveness of a short-term FSN therapeutic conversation intervention offered to families using CFAM and CFIM. More controlled research is also needed. A study to test the effectiveness of an FSN intervention was conducted within the knowledge translation focus of Landspitali University Hospital Family Nursing Implementation Project. Based on a review of the empirical literature that has examined the usefulness of FSN intervention and the conceptual framework of FSN that guided the research, it was hypothesized that (a) the parents in the experimental group (both parents of children with acute and chronic illnesses) would report significantly higher family support than the parents in the control group, as a result of the short- term therapeutic conversation intervention. After having divided the sample into two subgroups based on the reason for the children’s hospitalizations (acute or chronic illnesses), we also hypothesized that (b) the parents of children with acute health conditions; and the parents of children with chronic illnesses in the experimental group would, as a result of the intervention, report significantly higher family support than the parents of the children with acute health conditions and the parents of the children with chronic illnesses, who were assigned to the control group.</p>
<p>The following research questions were asked: (a) What are the differences in <italic>emotional communication</italic> and in the <italic>communication and problem solving</italic> concepts, as measured by expressive family functioning, between parents who received the <italic>short-term therapeutic conversation</italic> (intervention group) and parents who received traditional care (control group)? (b) What are the differences in expressive family functioning based on the child’s health condition (acute or chronic illnesses) after the intervention compared to before the intervention?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1074840712449202">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Data for this experimental study were collected from 76 families of children who were receiving health care services in 2008 and 2009 in an inpatient unit, an acute unit, an outpatient daycare unit and at an outpatient clinic at the Children’s Hospital at LUH. Potential parent participants were introduced to the study by the clinic staff on the units and in the clinic after their child had been admitted for two or three days in the units or after the visit to the clinic, and invited to participate if they met the study’s eligibility criteria. The eligibility criteria for the parents were being able to read or write Icelandic at a minimum fourth-grade level and the willingness of at least one parent to participate in the study (the same parent who needed to complete the questionnaires at both data collection times). Exclusion criteria for parents included being participants in any other study regarding their children’s health condition at the time of the data collection, being participants in any study regarding their own health, and being treated for any major physical or mental health problems. Approval to conduct the study was received from the Scientific Committee at the LUH (No. 68/2008). The study was reported to the Data Protection Committee in Iceland (No. S4118, November 13, 2008). Data were collected between fall of 2008 and spring of 2009 using the Outcome electronic program.</p>

<sec id="section7-1074840712449202">
<title>Description of the Intervention</title>
<p>The <italic>short-term therapeutic conversation</italic> intervention consisted of the key elements of the 15-min Family Interview (i.e., therapeutic conversation, family genogram and ecomap, therapeutic questions, and recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840712449202">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>]). After the parents had signed the consent form, the study nurse accompanied the parents to the intervention room where the setting was arranged in such a way that the nurse was seated across from the parents at a round table. The nurse began by introducing herself to the parents, stating the purpose of the study, and giving her estimate of how long she expected the interview to take (e.g., about 30 min). Then the nurse drew a genogram of the family with the help and input of the parents. She also drew an ecomap, with a specific focus on identifying the quality of the parents’ relationships with other family members, friends, work environment and institutions in society. Next the nurse offered the parents some informative information regarding their child’s health condition and asked therapeutic questions such as “What is the greatest challenge facing your family now?” “Who in the family do you think the illness has the most impact on?” “Who is suffering the most?” “What has been most and least helpful to you in similar situations?” “If there was one question you could have answered now, what would it be?” “How can we best help you and your family?” “What are your needs/wishes for assistance now?” Some specifically tailored questions were also asked based on the child’s health condition. At the end of the interview the nurse thanked the parents for their participation and emphasized that they were welcome to contact the research team if they had any questions or concerns regarding the interview. They were also told that they could approach the nursing staff at the unit with questions or concerns. The therapeutic conversation (including asking the therapeutic questions) ranged from 15 to 50 min, lasting on average 30 min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1074840712449202">
<title>Procedure for Data Collection</title>
<p>The parents who participated in the study were randomly assigned either to an intervention group, who received <italic>the short-term therapeutic conversation</italic> intervention, or to the control group, who received the standard nursing care (e.g., education, prescribed medications, support as needed, etc.) offered to all families at the units and at the outpatient clinic at the time. On the second or third day of their child’s stay at the inpatient units at the hospital, each family in the intervention group was invited to accompany the data collector (the data collection lasted for 4-5 months). At the outpatient daycare unit and the outpatient clinic the families were invited to accompany the data collector after the child had received his or her medical care. The data were collected by three study nurses. Two of the study nurses had an MSc degree in nursing with a special focus on family system nursing and one of the study nurses had over 30 years of clinical experience in pediatric nursing and had, in addition, completed a family system nursing course at the graduate school at the Faculty of Nursing of the University of Iceland. All three study nurses were specially trained to administer the family nursing intervention and the data collection questionnaires. Parents went to a private room on all the data collection units and in the clinic to complete the questionnaires on a computer (the questions involved background information and child’s health, the Ice Expressive Family Functioning Questionnaire and the Ice Family Perceived Support Questionnaire; Time 1). After the parents had completed the questionnaires at time 1, they received the intervention from the trained study nurse. The parents were then given a code to use on their computer at home to answer the same set of questions again after their child had been discharged from the hospital or after the parents left the clinic. That is, the families were asked to respond to the questions again three to five days after their child had been discharged from the hospital (Time 2) or after the parents went home from the clinic. Most of the children at the inpatient units required a 5- to 7-day stay.</p>
<p>The parents in the control group, both at the units and the clinic, were administered the first set of questions in the same manner as the families in the experimental group, but these families did not receive any intervention beyond the standard care. These families were also asked to complete the same questions at home on their computers between three and five days after their child was discharged or after the parents left the clinic. However, the parents who were in the control group and received traditional care were offered an interview with the nurse (therapeutic conversation) after they had completed their participation in the study. If parents in both groups had not responded at time 2 on the fifth day after their child was discharged or after the parents went home from the clinic, they were sent an email reminder and asked to respond within the next two or three days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1074840712449202">
<title>Data Collection Tools</title>
<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions, two questionnaires were used. In addition, demographic information about the family, as well as information about the health conditions of the children from the parents’ perspective were collected.</p>
<sec id="section10-1074840712449202">
<title>Information on sociodemographic and child-health variables</title>
<p>The sociodemographic questionnaire included questions about the parent’s age, the category of relationship to the child (e.g., parent vs. guardian), marital status, education, and family income. This instrument also included questions for the parents regarding the gender of the child, the reason for the child being admitted to the hospital at the time of the study and the age of the child when admitted to the hospital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1074840712449202">
<title>Iceland Expressive Family Functioning Questionnaire (ICE-EFFQ)</title>
<p>The ICE-EFFQ is a 17-item instrument which includes four subscales: (a) expressive emotions, (b) collaboration and problem solving, (c) communications, and (d) behavior (α = .895; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1074840712449202">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2009a</xref>). It is conceptually derived from the Calgary Family Assessment Model [CFAM] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840712449202">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). The instrument uses a Likert-type scale, with a scoring procedure from 1 to 5. On this instrument, a higher score reflects better expressive family functioning. The instrument has been psychometrically tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1074840712449202">Sveinbjarnardottir, Svavarsdottir &amp; Hrafnkelsson, 2012a</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha of the total scale has been reported to be = .895; for the subscale of (a) emotional communication, α = .617; (b) collaboration and problem solving, α = .735; (c) verbal communication, α = .796; and (d) behavior, α = .808. In this sample of Icelandic families, Cronbach’s alpha for the total scale was = .890 to .933 (at Time 1 and Time 2). Cronbach’s alpha for the subscales in this sample were (a) emotional communication, α = .729 to 0.825; (b) collaboration and problem solving, α = .795-0.866; (c) verbal communication, α = .832-.809; and (d) behavior, α = .834 to .901 at Time 1 and Time 2.</p>

<sec id="section12-1074840712449202">
<title>Iceland Family Perceived Support Questionnaire (ICE-PFSQ)</title>
<p>The ICE-PFSQ is a 14-item instrument that includes two subscales: (a) cognitive support and (b) emotional support (α = .953; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840712449202">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2009b</xref>). This questionnaire is conceptually derived from the Calgary Family Intervention Model (CFIM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840712449202">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). The questionnaire uses a Likert-type scale, with a scoring procedure from 1 to 5. On this questionnaire a higher score reflects a perception of better family support. The instrument has been psychometrically tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712449202">Sveinbjarnardottir, Svavarsdottir &amp; Hrafnkelsson, 2012b</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha has been reported to be = .953 for the total scale; Cronbach’s alpha for the subscale of (a) cognitive support is α = .874, and for the subscale of (b) emotional support is α = .937. For the sample of Icelandic families in the current study, alpha for the total scale was = .939 to .952 (at Time 1 and Time 2). For the subscales in this sample: (a) cognitive support, α = .846-0.854; (b) emotional support, α = .913-.936 over time.</p>

<sec id="section13-1074840712449202">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Data were summarized using descriptive analyses, including means, standard deviations and frequency distributions. Comparisons of demographic characteristics and main study variables (expressive family functioning and family perceived support) between the experimental group (EG) and the control group (CG) were made using the Mann-Whitney U test (for ordinal variables) and the Yates’ corrected chi-square test of association (for nominal variables) to compare the two groups, since the expected frequency was less than five in some cells. When the data met the assumption for normal distribution (<italic>n</italic>&gt;10), repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to determine differences between the EG and the CG on parents’ perception of expressive family functioning and family support. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine predictors of parents’ perception of their perceived family support after the intervention.</p>
<p>A post hoc power analysis was calculated for repeated measures analyses of variance, based on the number of participants in both groups (<italic>N</italic> = 76), with the alpha level set at 0.05 and the effect size of 0.118 (indicating small effects, signifying that the test is catching small effect). The power was 0.597, which is medium, indicating a medium probability of type two errors, or a 40% chance of not catching a difference when there is a true difference between the two groups. Data analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows version 18.0; p &lt; 0.05 was used throughout.</p>

<p>The families were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (those receiving the <italic>short-term therapeutic conversation</italic>; <italic>n</italic> = 41) or to a control group (those receiving traditional care; <italic>n</italic> = 35). Of the families, 90 were introduced to the study (45 families to the experimental group and 45 families to the control group; 14 families rejected or were unable to participate at both time points), 76 families were however recruited at both times. Of the families in the experimental group, 41 completed participation in the study (e.g., at both time periods; 93.33% participation rate). In the control group, 35 families completed participation in the study (82.22% participation rate); a total of 76 families completed the study (84% participation rate among all the families; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1074840712449202">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Differences in means between parents of children with chronic illnesses in the experimental group and parents of children with chronic illnesses in the control group as results of the intervention</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main finding from the hypotheses testing supported the effectiveness of the short therapeutic conversation intervention for families who had a child or an adolescent receiving health care services from nurses within the Children’s Hospital at LUH. When the two subscales of family support were evaluated, the parents who received the short therapeutic intervention reported significantly higher cognitive support compared to the parents in the control group. These findings are promising and support the benefit and the need for offering such a short term therapeutic conversation intervention, on a regular basis, to families within pediatric settings with a specific focus on cognitive support (e.g., offering information and professional opinion; providing accessible and easy-to-read literature; informing families about the resources available; and providing information which enables families to learn and reflect on). However, even though no research results were found where the effectiveness of a short-term therapeutic conversation intervention was presented using an experimental research design, qualitative researchers have reported the 15-min Family Interview to benefit families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840712449202">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, Martinez and colleagues (2007) found that pediatric nurses report a positive impact of the 15-min Family Interview on their ability to conduct family assessments and to offer interventions. Similarly, clinical application of the 15-min Family Interview on a family-centered postpartum unit has been found to benefit families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712449202">Holtslander, 2005</xref>), and asking families the “one question” (e.g., If you could have just one question answered through our work together, what would that one question be?”) was found to provide a rich opportunity to identify family members’ most pressing concerns (Duhamel, Dupuis, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840712449202">Wright, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The benefit of the short therapeutic conversation intervention was evaluated further based on the child’s illness. Interestingly, parents of children with acute illnesses who received the intervention were found to report significantly higher family support on both the subscales of cognitive and emotional support, compared to the parents who received traditional care. This finding is new and has not been reported previously in the literature, but is in harmony with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840712449202">Nelms and Eggenberger (2010)</xref>, who found that families at an intensive care unit needed regular meetings, where the focus of the intervention was on acknowledging suffering and vulnerability and to offer families an opportunity to have honest and sensitive communication with the nurses. Further, even though the proportion of acute versus chronic illnesses was equal within our intervention group, the age range of the parents was found to differ and the age range of the children themselves also differed based on the type of illness the children were diagnosed with. The majority (95%) of the parents of children with acute illnesses (e.g., RSV viruses etc.) who received the intervention were young (between 19 and 40 years old) and 80% of the parents had a child less than 5 years of age. One explanation for the beneficial effect of the intervention for these young families of children with acute illnesses might be that these parents might have felt they were getting better cognitive and emotional support from the nurse in the form of useful information, better access to available resources, help with understanding how emotional response is related to the family member’s illness and increased awareness of their family strengths after the short therapeutic conversations than the parents who received the standard care.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the short-term therapeutic conversation intervention was not found to significantly benefit families of children with chronic illnesses (e.g., arthritis, epilepsy, IgA deficiency) when compared to families who received the traditional care. One explanation for this finding is that parents of children with chronic illnesses had been in connection with the health care system for a longer period of time compared to families of children with acute illnesses. The parents of children with chronic illnesses were also generally older but 40% of the parents in the intervention group ranged in age from 41 to 60 years and 60% of these parents had a child 6 years or older or had an adolescent with a chronic illness.</p>
<p>Interestingly, even though parents in the intervention group reported significantly higher family support after the short therapeutic conversation intervention, these parents also reported significantly lower expressive family functioning (e.g., emotional communication, collaboration, and problem solving, and verbal communication) after the intervention compared to the parents who received the traditional care. Similarly, parents of children with acute illnesses who reported significantly higher family support after the intervention also reported significantly lower expressive family functioning after the intervention compared to the parents who were in the control group. Nevertheless, parents of children with chronic illnesses did not perceive lower expressive family functioning after the intervention compared to the parents who received the standard care.</p>
<p>One explanation for this finding is that the parents who reported lower expressive family functioning postintervention, such as the parents of children with acute illnesses, were generally younger and were mainly parents of young children. These young families might have been having difficulties with taking care of routine activities of daily living but according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840712449202">Wright and Leahey (2009)</xref>, families who are not coping well with instrumental aspects of family functioning, such as activities of daily living, almost always have difficulties with expressive functioning issues. Another explanation for the lowering of expressive family functioning postintervention might be due to the fact that every therapeutic conversation that the nurses and the family have about the family system shapes that system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840712449202">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). These young families might therefore still be at the stage of establishing themselves as a family. Further, having had a conversation with a nurse about the functioning of their family as a unit and about their support system and the level of connectedness among family members, might have increased the parents awareness of their functioning and stimulated the parents to start to think more critically about how and in what way their family unit was headed under this stressful life situation of dealing with an acute illness. Such thoughts and or because of the trusting relationship that had developed between the parents and the study nurse, might have resulted in a more negative perspective towards evaluating their expressive family functioning postintervention compared to before the intervention. That is, the parents might have trusted the study nurse better after having received the intervention, with their real experience of their family functioning after the intervention when handling their situation of dealing with an acute illness in their child.</p>
<p>Also, these parents of children with acute illnesses were under the stress of having taken their child to a clinic or having had their child hospitalized because of an acute health condition. When the parents answered the questionnaires again about one week postintervention, they might still have been absorbing this difficult and often unexpected experience of having experienced an acute illness of a child family member. These families might also have needed more intensive intervention, or another type of intervention altogether, in order to have their perception of communication and problem solving steered in the right direction. However, even though these results only partly support the conceptual framework that guided the research, they do not overshadow the fact that the parents who received the intervention perceived significantly higher family support compared to the parents who received the traditional care. This finding might nevertheless support the need for modifying the intervention with a stronger focus on communication, problem solving and collaboration among young families of children with acute illnesses, or to offer this group of parents a more intense intervention over a longer period of time. Further studies are needed with a longitudinal design in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the short therapeutic conversation interventions across time.</p>
<sec id="section23-1074840712449202">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>This short-term therapeutic conversation intervention study needs to be interpreted within the context of the site and country in which it was conducted. It also needs to be interpreted within the context of overall purpose of the study which was to examine knowledge translation. Also, the sample size was small, there were no attention control for the control group, data collectors were not blinded as to who was in the experimental and control groups, and little was done to assure intervention fidelity. The findings themselves may not generalize to other countries, but the content of the short-term therapeutic conversation intervention offered, which was generated from CFAM and CFIM, can provide a framework for investigators’ to use in conducting intervention studies in other locations. In addition, the measures were newly developed, which creates a limitation within itself in that they had not been previously tested or evaluated within variety of different cultures or clinical settings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results from the effectiveness of the short-term therapeutic conversation intervention, specifically on perceived family support for families of children with acute illnesses, are promising. These findings support the usefulness of offering families, specifically families of children with an acute health condition at the Children’s Hospital at LUH, a short-term therapeutic conversation intervention, where the main focus of the intervention is on supporting the family as a unit while they are dealing with an acute health situation. Even though such an intervention might not necessarily have an immediate impact on expressive family functioning, these early results suggest it might have an impact on perceived satisfaction with the health care service as well as on the parents’ well-being. While this family intervention research is the first of its kind to be conducted within a program of knowledge translation, further research is needed regarding the effectiveness of the short-term therapeutic conversation intervention and its impact on satisfaction with health care services, quality of life among families, and job satisfaction among nurses.</p>
<p>This research was conducted within the larger context of knowledge translation of FSN to practice. Since nurses on all units at LUH have now, after this particular study, received education on how to apply FSN in their nursing practice, the most critical point from an administrative and implementation perspective will be to continue to support nurses to offer families “therapeutic conversations”. Strategies that might help to further build confidence in family nursing and to smooth the process of implementing and sustaining FSN in nursing practices at LUH include: a) offer all nurses in general practices further educational support in FSN in clinical settings, b) offer clinical consultation to nurses in advanced practices; and c) support nurses in further developing their skills in working with families. More investigation is needed about the knowledge translation processes themselves to identify facilitating and constraining factors that help or hinder knowledge translation efforts. As we continue to build knowledge about how to succeed in translating family nursing knowledge to practice within the Landspitali University Hospital Family Nursing Implementation Project, we hope this brave and pioneering work in Iceland will provide a useful foundation for more family nursing knowledge translation projects around the world.</p>
