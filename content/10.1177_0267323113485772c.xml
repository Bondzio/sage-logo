<p>The field of comparative communication research has enjoyed something of a renaissance over the last decade since the publication of Hallin and Mancini’s work comparing media systems in North America and Western Europe, although Blumler and Gurevitch can rightly lay claim to establishing comparative work in political communication in the 1970s albeit without encouraging the growth of the field. Comparisons are often thought to involve primarily similar or contrasting states of affairs in different states. However, units of analysis are not necessarily countries and we should think about comparison not necessarily in international terms but rather as a fundamental method of social scientific analysis that continues to develop. If we think in this way comparative media analysis is less a specific field of communication and more a specific approach to how to study media and communication generally. This is an important distinction to grasp and it is one that is not lost on the editors of this handbook who are conversant with the most sophisticated methodologies of comparison available across the social sciences. Indeed, if comparative media studies have generally lagged behind both methodologically and empirically the importance of comparative work in other humanities and social sciences, then the publication of this handbook showcasing the leading work in the field of media and communication should provide enough encouragement both for methodological innovation and empirical perseverance in the field.</p>
<p>After an introduction in which the editors lay out the case for comparison as a mode of enquiry, there are a number of essays that cover the development of comparative methods in a number of sub-fields of communication (political communication, visual communication, development communication and so on). Subsequently, there are essays that deal with research topics that have attracted a reasonable amount of comparative attention (elections, policy, media systems and so on). Ultimately, though, the value of this handbook resides primarily in the final chapters that interrogate what it means to do comparative media analysis, the problems that face the field, and how they may be breached, pointing to the future of the practice. This is continued in the editors’ conclusion, which reveals that we still have fundamental questions to answer about how we do comparative analysis as well as a good deal of empirical work to get through in order that we can be reasonably confident about furnishing explanations for why we have the media we have. This handbook then represents simultaneously a maturing of the field and an attempt to point it in new, potentially fruitful directions. There is still clearly much to do to catch up other humanities and social sciences and much to learn from their comparative methods.</p>
