<abstract>
<p>This study reports a 59-year-old man who suffered from multiple skeletal muscle amyloidomas and showed a rapidly fatal course. He noticed left inguinal pain and gait disturbance due to muscle weakness of the left leg. Protein in urine (3.3 g/d) and Bence-Jones protein of the κ type (2.3 g/d) were detected. Bone marrow aspiration showed 11.6% monoclonal plasma cells in nucleated cells. A core needle-biopsied and resected left inguinal tumor showed the deposition of eosinophilic amorphous materials positive for Congo red stain and the κ-light chain. He was diagnosed with plasma cell myeloma with AL (amyloid light chain) amyloidosis. Multiple soft-part tumors developed, grew rapidly, and he died 3 months after admission. At autopsy, 3 large amyloidomas were observed in the skeletal muscles, and prominent amyloid deposits were also seen in the diaphragm, intercostal muscle, iliopsoas muscle, and cervical skeletal muscles examined. Massive amyloid materials deposited diffusely in the propria muscularis of the gastrointestinal tract: the tongue to the rectum.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Amyloid is an in vivo–deposited material, which can be distinguished from nonamyloid deposits by a characteristic fibrillary electron microscopic appearance, a typical X-ray diffraction pattern, and typical histological staining reactions, particular affinity for Congo red dye with resulting green birefringence. A disease associated with (or caused by) amyloid deposits is called “amyloidosis.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911410690">1</xref></sup> Systemic AL (amyloid light chain) amyloidosis contains fibrils that are derived from monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains. A plasma cell clone produces the precursor, which is released into the plasma and detectable as a free light chain component. AL amyloidosis is more frequently caused by a small clone or can occur in association with multiple myeloma (MM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911410690">1</xref></sup> AL amyloid deposition is often seen in the heart, liver, spleen, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, kidney, thickened blood vessel walls, on basement membranes, and in the interstitium of tissues as fat tissue or bone marrow (BM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911410690">2</xref></sup> Marked amyloid deposits in the systemic skeletal muscles and propria muscularis of the entire GI tract are very rare.</p>
<p>Plasma cell myeloma (PCM) is defined as M-protein of &gt;30 g/L of IgG or &gt;25 g/L of IgA in the serum or &gt;1 g/d of urinary light chains, &gt;10% of monoclonal plasma cells in BM, and manifestations of end organ damage, including anemia, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, renal insufficiency, hyperviscosity, amyloidosis, or recurrent infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911410690">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>We report a 59-year-old man who suffered from systemic AL amyloidosis and selective amyloid deposits in the skeletal muscles and muscular layer of the GI tract and showed a rapidly fatal course.</p>

<title>Clinical Findings</title>
<p>The patient had been followed since March 1986 because of IgA nephropathy and hypertension. In August 1999, chronic renal failure progressed—39.0 mg/dL of blood urea nitrogen and 2.2 mg/dL of creatinine. He became aware of left inguinal pain and gait disturbance due to muscle weakness of the left leg in April 2009 (age of 59 years), the symptoms gradually aggravated, and he was admitted to our hospital in September. Laboratory findings showed the following: 4.2 g/dL of serum protein, 292 mg/dL of IgG, 41 mg/dL of IgA, 17 mg/dL of IgM, 3.3 g/d of protein in urine, 2.3 g/da of κ-type Bence-Jones protein (BJP), 70.6% α2-globulin in the urine protein fraction, 11.6% plasma cells in the BM, 953 U/mL of the soluble interleukin 2-receptor, 9 mg/dL of serum calcium, and 2306 IU/L of serum creatine phosphokinase. Radiographs of the left hip joint showed a lytic lesion of the femoral head. He was diagnosed with PCM of the κ-light chain type. Hemodialysis started in October 2009. Core needle biopsy and tumor resection of the left inguinal mass were conducted in November. He subsequently developed dysphagia. Multiple soft-part tumors in the bilateral shoulders, left knee, and right inguinal lesion developed and grew rapidly, and he showed disturbance of movement. VAD therapy (vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone) was started; however, respiratory failure developed, and he died 3 months after admission, in January 2010. Autopsy was performed 3 hours after death. He had neither macroglossia nor chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.</p>

<title>Pathological Findings</title>
<p>A BM aspiration smear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911410690">Figure 1A</xref>) and clot showed a mild proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells positive for the κ-light chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911410690">Figure 1B</xref>) and negative for the λ-light chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911410690">Figure 1C</xref>) according to an immunohistochemical method. He was diagnosed with BJP (κ-light chain)-type PCM based on the urine analysis and BM findings. Core needle biopsy and resection of the left inguinal soft-part tumor showed that it consisted of amorphous materials exhibiting eosinophilia on hematoxylin–eosin stain, and orange-red stain and yellowish-green birefringence in polarized light by Congo red stain, was resistant to potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>), and expressed the κ-light chain. The patient was diagnosed with AL-type amyloidosis.</p>

<p>At autopsy, 3 (about 7 cm in diameter) large amyloidomas were observed in the skeletal muscle of the right inguinal, left shoulder, and left knee regions. Amyloidomas were firm, pale, glossy, and waxy in texture in the cut surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911410690">Figure 2A</xref>), consisted of eosinophilic amorphous materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911410690">Figure 2B</xref>), and were positive for Congo red stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911410690">Figure 2C</xref>) and the κ-light chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911410690">Figure 2D</xref>), and their development was followed by the shrinkage and atrophy of muscle tissues. Similarly, prominent amyloid deposits in the striated muscles—the diaphragm, intercostal muscle, iliopsoas muscle, and cervical skeletal muscles examined—were also seen. The mucosa of the GI tract looked macroscopically normal. However, prominent amyloid deposits positive for Congo red stain were demonstrated in the propria muscularis of the GI tract: the tongue, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911410690">Figure 2F</xref>), and rectum. Only a few amyloid deposits were seen around the small vessels in the mucosa of the GI tract and no amyloid deposit in any nerve plexuses. Amyloid materials were consistently negative for the λ-light chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911410690">Figure 2E</xref>), amyloid A protein, transthyretin, and β2-microglobulin. No amyloid deposit was seen in other organs, including the heart (460 g), liver (1450 g), spleen (88 g), lungs (left, 322 g; right, 629 g), adrenals, kidneys (left, 56 g; right, 60 g), pancreas, lymph nodes, fat tissue, and BM. All specimens were stained with Congo red and examined under polarized light. The lumbar and sternal BMs examined showed an increase in monoclonal κ-light chain-positive plasma cells. Kidneys showed sclerosing glomerulonephritis, compatible with IgA nephropathy. Three (6 to 15 mm in diameter) parathyroid adenomas were observed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present patient showed more than 1 g/d of urinary M-protein consisting of α2-globulin in the urine fraction, slight proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells in nucleated cells of the BM, and AL-type amyloidosis in the skeletal muscles and GI tract. Therefore, he was finally diagnosed with BJP-type myeloma with AL amyloidosis, although the differential diagnosis from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance was difficult.</p>
<p>Amyloid myopathy in the skeletal muscles is rare: 16 cases out of 3937 muscle biopsy specimens (0.4%), and only 3 of them had MM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911410690">3</xref></sup> Three patients who showed massive amyloid deposits in the skeletal muscles have already been described. First, Ii et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911410690">4</xref></sup> reported a 59-year-old man autopsy case with immunocyte dyscrasia and amyloidosis that had progressive muscular stiffness with palpable tumors and BJP but no overt myeloma. Much amyloid was deposited preferentially in the skeletal muscles, forming various sizes of tumor, and most muscle fibers were replaced by a large amount of amyloid and showed extensive atrophy. Second, Yamada et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911410690">5</xref></sup> reported that one case (case 1 in their study) suffered from BJP-type MM and showed marked amyloid deposition in the skeletal muscles. Last, Joung et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911410690">6</xref></sup> reported a 61-year-old man with muscular amyloidoma presenting as bilateral inguinal masses that were observed in the iliopsoas, iliacus, and gluteus muscle, and BJP-type MM. Similarly, the present case had multiple skeletal amyloidomas and BJP-type myeloma. Ii et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911410690">4</xref></sup> postulated that κ-type BJP was found in most cases of amyloid myopathy. However, Yamada et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911410690">5</xref></sup> commented that there was no difference in skeletal muscle involvement between κ and λ types of BJP. The reason for the selective deposition of amyloid in the skeletal muscles is unknown. Abraham et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911410690">7</xref></sup> reported that patients with the VκI germline gene had primarily soft tissue (macroglossia, skin involvement, and carpal tunnel syndrome) disease. However, the present patient had neither macroglossia nor carpal tunnel syndrome, and he showed amyloid deposits in the muscular layer of the tongue and skeletal muscles not in the skin.</p>
<p>Six cases that showed massive amyloid deposits in the propria muscularis of the GI tract have been described. Araki et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911410690">8</xref></sup> reported 2 cases that developed severe GI complications due to dialysis-related amyloidosis. Case 1 was a 68-year-old man whose autopsy showed extensive amyloid deposits in the propria muscularis throughout the GI tract. Case 2 was a 56-year-old man whose resected colon showed massive amyloid deposits in the propria muscularis. Similarly, Kanai et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911410690">9</xref></sup> reported a 42-year-old male with β2-microglobulin-related amyloidosis, who had undergone hemodialysis for 13 years. He died of acute myocardial infarction, and an autopsy examination revealed the massive deposition of amyloid predominantly in the GI muscular layer, including the tongue, esophagus, stomach, small, intestine, colon, and rectum. They commented that since the amyloid deposition was limited to only the muscular layer, the endoscopical biopsy of the propria mucosa of the intestines failed to demonstrate amyloid deposition. Tada et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911410690">10</xref></sup> reported 2 cases with AL amyloidosis and a case with β2-microglobulin-related amyloidosis that showed extensive infiltration and the replacement of the propria muscularis by amyloid deposits throughout the GI tract. On the other hand, they also reported that amyloid deposits in the myenteric plexus without appreciable muscle infiltration were shown in 4 AA (amyloid A protein) amyloidosis cases. They concluded that chemical typing of the amyloid protein was very important for predicting the clinical characteristics, course, and prognosis of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911410690">10</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066896911410690">Table 1</xref> shows a summary of the reported cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911410690">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911410690"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911410690">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911410690">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911410690"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911410690">10</xref></sup> with muscular amyloidosis. Gilat et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896911410690">11</xref></sup> reported that in primary or myeloma-associated amyloidosis affecting the GI tract, parenchymal deposition predominated in the propria muscularis, whereas in secondary amyloidosis, it was mainly distributed in the lamina propria mucosa. The present case was AL amyloidosis, and the mechanism of amyloid deposition was myopathic not neuropathic.</p>

<p>Recently, it has been suggested that there is a preferential organ tropism for different variable light-chain gene products. Enqvist et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896911410690">12</xref></sup> studied the relationship between the structure of AL-proteins of the κ1b light chain and amyloid tissue deposition and observed that AL κ1b patients showed very pronounced GI deposits, especially in the propria muscularis. From the distribution of amyloid deposits, therefore, the present patient might have had AL amyloid proteins of the κ1b type. Comenzo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896911410690">13</xref></sup> also investigated the relationship between immunoglobulin light-chain variable region germline genes and preferentially dominant amyloid deposition, and suggested that patients with V(κ) clones were more likely to show dominant hepatic involvement. In the present patient, however, no amyloid deposit was seen in the liver.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, the present case is the first to be documented with a diagnosis of PCM and extensive amyloid deposits preferentially located in both systemic skeletal muscles and the propria muscularis of the GI tract from the tongue to rectum. The reason for the amyloid deposition in the selective tissues—the skeletal and smooth muscle of the propria muscularis—is very interesting but very difficult to clarify.</p>
