The second examines questions of expertise, dwelling on the skills recounted in the paper under discussions and the epistemological politics that underpin science-art collaboration. The third observation explores the relationships between post-human aesthetics, ethics and politics.

The presented argument for ‘remaking aesthetics for post-human worlds’ has programmatic aspirations and offers plenty of avenues for conversation. In this short commentary, I would like to briefly flag and develop three dimensions to this project, which are suggested by the empirical tracings offered. The first relates to questions of non-human difference, the second to expertise and the third to the relationships between post-human aesthetics, ethics and politics.</p><sec id="section1-2043820612468646"><title>Difference</title><p>The paper does a neat job of summarising some of the diverse post-humanist ontologies under consideration within and beyond geography, identifying and developing theories of material, corporeal and living difference. The deliberations on bowerbirds highlight a bounded and familiar aesthetic subject, while the theoretical reflections catalyzed by the thrombolites enable speculation upon more molecular, ecological and processural ontologies. However, the twofold case study structure of the paper means it touches on but rather glosses over the important ontological politics associated with these contrasting ways of cutting up the non-human realm, and how in turn these different ontologies might inform different approaches to post-human aesthetics. It would be helpful to be more systematic in the analysis to examine how non-human difference shapes aesthetics. To draw out the programmatic implications of this analysis, we could perhaps identify some more general grounds upon which we might formulate a taxonomy of post-human aesthetic subjects and modes of aesthetic performance.</p><p>Here the paper demonstrates the utility of the work of von Uexküll and of ethology more generally for examining the <italic>umwelten </italic>of different organisms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468646">Buchanan, 2008</xref>). Animal studies, animal art and animal geography have developed rich accounts of the life worlds of a range of organisms – generally large, easily individuated beings who are ‘big-like-us’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612468646">Hird, 2009</xref>). Here it has proved fairly easy (though still controversial) to map humanist models of perception onto sentient non-human organisms that share what Dixon et al. describe as a ‘cross-species “expressivity”’ (2012: 15). This allows us to begin to explore how organisms sense and judge their worlds. Ethology rethought by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612468646">Deleuze and Guattari (1987</xref>) in their work on ‘becoming-animal, becoming-molecular’ has also proved helpful for engaging with relational understandings of life associated with microbial, ecological, geological and post-genomic ontologies. I am personally drawn to how this work might help interpret the findings of big science initiatives like the <italic>Human Microbiome Project </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2043820612468646">Turnbaugh et al., 2007</xref>), which depict the human as an ecosystem in which the ‘its’ outnumber the ‘mes’ (to use Jane Bennett’s terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468646">2010</xref>: 112)). In this vital material world, our affective states and feelings towards each other are related to the microbial composition of our internal and wider ecologies.</p><p>The ontological properties of the agents of a post-human geomorphology (rivers, glaciers, plates, winds, etc.) or of molecular post-humanisms clearly necessitate different conceptions of perception and aesthetics than those that work with individual organisms. Perhaps it would be useful to dwell a little more on the differences between these ontologies and to be a little more specific when applying to them the term aesthetics. In the paper under discussion, the term folds together an older definition of aesthetics as questions of perception with a more contemporary and everyday understanding of aesthetics as judgement. These two are related, but in quite different ways for different components of our post-human worlds. For example, the paper details discerning, cultural bowerbirds whose artistry entails a space between perception and judgement. But there is not the same separation between perception and judgement in the case of rocks, rivers and gut flora. Instead we learn of aggregate, immanent expression. These offer new vistas for aesthetics, but also offer material grounds for a more comprehensive typology.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2043820612468646"><title>Expertise</title><p>Second, the paper would seem to speak to a wider set of initiatives within and beyond geography seeking to develop new, sometimes interdisciplinary, methods for tuning in to non-human life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820612468646">Kirksey and Helmreich, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612468646">Dixon et al. (2012</xref>) recount their interactions with various forms of human expertise, including science and art, dedicated to understanding and representing the character and dynamics of bowerbirds and thrombolities. I sense there are a number of important implications of this work that could be more fully discussed in order to draw out their programmatic import. For example, we hear little about the collaborative and ethnographic methods employed by the three authors in their interactions with the artist, her sources and materials. What were the spaces, times and power dynamics of these interactions? How did you trace how she ‘learnt to be affected’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612468646">Despret, 2004</xref>) by her non-human subjects and their aesthetics? How were you – individually and jointly – shaped by your encounters with this post-human world? How were these encounters witnessed and data recorded? How might they be presented to evoke the types of aesthetic under consideration; to prompt a shock to thought (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2043820612468646">Lorimer, 2010</xref>)? Finally, what are the types of skills required for this type of work and how might they be nurtured, taught and institutionalised to create post-human aestheticians?</p><p>The paper also recounts forms of collaboration that might tell us something interesting about the epistemologies and politics of interdisciplinarity – especially as mediated and performed by artists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612468646">Barry et al., 2008</xref>). Science and art work to different models of experimentation, assessed by different epistemological and aesthetic criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2043820612468646">Powell and Vasudevan, 2007</xref>), yet here one is documenting examples in which individuals and/or teams appear to agree upon common grounds for success. How was this achieved? Are there wider epistemological lessons that could be learnt in terms of how environmental science is done in the Anthropocene – where the world has become a laboratory, ecologies are unpredictable and people need to be deliberated with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2043820612468646">Latour, 2011</xref>)? If consensus was not common then perhaps we can learn something about the nature of contestation and knowledge controversy in relation to post-human art/science. How are post-human aesthetics disputed and what role does aesthetics play in framing and deliberating over these disputes?</p></sec><sec id="section3-2043820612468646"><title>Ethics</title><p>Third, I want to press the authors a little on the import of their analysis, returning to the discordant effect created by the opening poem, to encourage a more comprehensive consideration of the ethical implications of the post-human aesthetics they offer. It is by no means accidental that the current enthusiasms for post-humanism are coincident with a widespread sense of ambivalence and anxiety about the modern project and its consequences for non-human life. Such anxieties often inflect the animal and environmental art that is reported in the paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612468646">Baker, 2000</xref>). As such, it is a little surprising that the authors do not do more to draw out the ethical–political implications of their post-human aesthetics – beyond expressing vague enthusiasms for ‘creativity’ and ‘play’ (Dixon et al., 2012). There would be something to be gained by engaging more coherently with the growing body of work within and around geography that looks at the connections between aesthetics, ethics and politics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2043820612468646">McCormack, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2043820612468646">Thrift, 2007</xref>). What, for example, are the implications of post-human aesthetics for environmentalism, for animal studies, for understanding extinction or for engaging with the modes of planetary management being proposed for the Anthropocene?</p><p>Here we could link the arguments developed in this paper with parallel strands of aesthetic thinking being proposed by scholars like Donna Haraway, Bruno Latour and Jane Bennett. Drawing on similar theoretical foundations to those invoked in this paper, these authors present human–non-human interactions as aesthetic processes with important political ecologies. For example, in his recent ‘compositionist manifesto’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820612468646">Latour (2010</xref>) proposes a post-humanist or ‘multinatural’ mode of political ecology, premised on the idea that in the Anthropocene worlds are composed by and from human and non-human components. For Latour, the word composition ‘has clear roots in art, painting, music, theater, dance, and thus is associated with choreography and scenography’ and ‘draws attention away from the irrelevant difference between what is constructed and what is not constructed, toward the crucial difference between what is <italic>well </italic>or <italic>badly</italic> constructed, <italic>well </italic>or <italic>badly </italic>composed’ (2010: 473). Latour is vague about the aesthetic criteria for judging the merits of a composition, but it is clear that it should include an appreciation of non-human life.</p><p>Haraway is a little more specific in her recent writings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612468646">Haraway, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820612468646">2008</xref>). Drawing on the work of Charis Thompson, she presents interspecies’ interactions as acts of ‘ontological choreography’: aesthetic performances in which organisms become entangled in assemblages and learn to be affected by one another through the exchange of properties. Again the aesthetic criteria for judging the merits of a performance are not disclosed, though there is a clear Deleuzian emphasis on the flourishing of significant forms of difference and a quasi-Foucauldian focus on cultivating an aesthetic sense of ‘response-ability’ focused on material practices like ‘eating well’ and ‘sharing suffering’ (see also Hinchliffe and Whatmore on care, curiosity and cosmopolitics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612468646">Hinchliffe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612468646">Hinchliffe et al., 2005</xref>)). Jane Bennett discuses the connections between and potentials of a post-human aesthetics and ethics in her books <italic>The Enchantment of Modern Life </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468646">2001</xref>) and <italic>Vibrant Matter </italic>(2010). In the former, she also finds promise in reworking Kant to defend a place for enchantment in a lively non-human world, arguing that a post-humanist aesthetic is vital for impelling an ethical sensibility. The expressive potential of things is more fully developed in the latter book, which optimistically promotes a ‘vital materialism’ attuned to diverse agencies. Bennett and Haraway defend a form of critical anthropomorphism – performing an affirmative modality of post-humanism that invokes the humanist imperative towards improvement and critique. Critical but less exuberant reflections are also offered by Kathryn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2043820612468646">Yusoff (2011</xref>), who has explored the character and potential of aesthetics of violence and loss for engaging with contemporary ecologies of extinction. Together this work moves well beyond evolutionary psychology’s diagnoses of biophilia and biophobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612468646">Kellert and Wilson, 1993</xref>) to document the ethical energetics of a post-human aesthetics for driving contemporary concerns with things falling apart in late modern political ecologies.</p><p>In short, I think this is an important paper, which is perhaps a little humble about its import. I propose that it has wider implications for geographical thought and practice after the relational turn that are worthy of more extensive discussion.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2043820612468646"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group
