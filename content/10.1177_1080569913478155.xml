<abstract>
<p>The use of personal, reflective writing exercises is well documented in the disciplines of composition and management, and each discipline has been highly influential in establishing pedagogical practices in the business communication classroom. However, we see little evidence of the pedagogical practice, the use of personal reflective writing exercises, in the teaching of business communication. This article looks at pedagogy and theory that informs the use of personal, reflective writing exercises in composition and management and suggests the relevance of these same practices in business communication classrooms today. Building on relevant pedagogical theory and practice, the author also makes the claim that personal reflective writing exercises can make students better writers and more effective managers and leaders. The article concludes with sample exercises that readers might try in their own business communication classrooms.</p>

<body>
<p>Like many of us in business communication, where I began is not where I ended up. As a PhD student in composition, I taught a basic writing course to first-year students who did not place into college writing. The course’s custom text contained fictional stories and other narratives by authors from diverse backgrounds, which, in turn, typically reflected the backgrounds of the students in the class. After reading excerpts from texts, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1080569913478155">Piri Thomas’s <italic>Down These Mean Streets</italic> (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1080569913478155">Maxine Hong Kingston’s <italic>Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts</italic> (1989)</xref>, students were assigned writing exercises that often asked them to make personal connections as step one toward critiquing and grappling with the texts’ concepts. Given this framework, many of our scaffolding exercises were personal, reflective writings. The purpose of these exercises ranged from stimulating in-class discussion to preparing students for a more comprehensive essay that would soon follow.</p>
<p>Around the time I completed my PhD, I found myself teaching business writing in a business school. In making the switch from college writing to business writing, I turned to two textbooks, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1080569913478155">Janis Forman and Kathleen Kelly’s <italic>Random House Guide to Business Writing</italic> (1990)</xref> and shortly thereafter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1080569913478155">Kitty Locker’s <italic>Business and Administrative Communication</italic> (1994)</xref>. I immediately recognized principles of composition in both texts; however, the more I became involved in the field of business communication, the more I was surprised by how little use of personal, reflective writing I found.</p>
<p>By personal, reflective writing, I mean writing exercises and assignments that are self-reflective, self-referential, or self-expressive in nature. In short, I am talking about exercises that ask the writer to write about herself or himself.</p>
<p>In truth, we do see some examples of such exercises in Forman’s and Locker’s texts. Both ask students to perform a self-assessment as part of the job search. In keeping with self-assessments, students are asked to list achievements, strengths, and weaknesses and consider values, likes, and dislikes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1080569913478155">Locker (1994)</xref> asks students to think about experiences that “have given [them] the most satisfaction” (p. 527). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1080569913478155">Forman and Kelly (1990)</xref> ask about relevant educational experience with questions, such as, “What were you most successful in, and what did you enjoy?” (p. 681) and go on to suggest that student readers reflect on personal qualities, interests, work values, and preferred work environments that might make the student “happiest” (p. 683). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1080569913478155">Locker (1994)</xref> uses other composition practices, such as freewriting, as a technique for “brainstorming, planning, and organizing business documents” (p. 114). We can still find these recommendations and practices in subsequent editions of her text, and self-assessments as well as some written evaluative exercises are offered in other contemporary business communication texts. For example, we can find self-assessments as part of the oral presentation process, such as those offered in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1080569913478155">Newman and Ober’s <italic>Business Communication</italic> (2013)</xref>. We also see even more examples in business communciation texts with a focus, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1080569913478155">Barrett’s <italic>Leadership Communication</italic> (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1080569913478155">Dufrene and Lehman’s <italic>Building High-Performance Teams</italic> (2011)</xref>. However, examples are few. Personal, reflective writing is used very little compared with what we see in composition and in another primary affecting discipline of business communication—management.</p>
<p>Within management, especially organizational behavior or leadership textbooks and trade books, personal, reflective writing exercises are quite common. The standard self-assessment in organizational behavior often aims to help students assess leadership ability—their own or others’. Management and leadership author Andrew Dubrin has numerous examples of self-assessments in his texts, for example, in his <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1080569913478155"><italic>Leadership: Research Findings, Practice, and Skills</italic> (2012)</xref>. We can also easily find more exploratory personal, reflective writing exercises in publications, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1080569913478155">Schaetti, Ramsey, and Wantanabe’s <italic>Personal Leadership: A Methodology of Two Principles and Six Practices</italic> (2011)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1080569913478155">Neck and Manz’s <italic>Mastering Self-Leadership: Empowering Yourself for Personal Excellence</italic> (2012)</xref>. In fact, personal, reflective writing exercises are especially common in management and leadership texts and trade books, those often recommended to business undergraduates and MBA students. The exercises encourage students to engage in this type of writing as a form of self-discovery and as a way to validate personal experience.</p>
<p>Compositionists have touted the benefits of personal reflective writing for decades and have encouraged students to write about the self as a standard part of the writing process. Compositionists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1080569913478155">William Coles (1978)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1080569913478155">Ken Macrorie (1985)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1080569913478155">Peter Elbow (1991)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1080569913478155">Kathleen Yancey (1998)</xref> are especially notable early supporters with claims that written articulation of personal experience places responsibility on the writer to make her or his own knowledge and further the learning experience. We can see ongoing evidence of the theory and practice supporting personal, reflective writing in contemporary composition texts, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1080569913478155">Barbara Fine Clouse’s <italic>The Student Writer: Editor and Critic</italic> (2012)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1080569913478155">Traci Gardner’s <italic>Designing Writing Assignments</italic> (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1080569913478155">Chris Jennings’s <italic>Lesson Plans for Teaching Writing</italic> (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>Of course, business communication is a different field with its own uses for the practice and theory produced in management and composition. However, given the relationship of personal, reflective writing between these two affecting disciplines, I continue to be surprised by its limited existence in our literature and textbooks. In this article, my goal is to review the theory behind personal, reflective writing, as it is used in management and composition, and, in turn, suggest ways to use personal, reflective writing in the business communication classroom. Like theorists and teachers before me, I believe that incorporating reflective exercises in business communication courses can help our students take more responsibility for their own knowledge, become better writers and thinkers, and, in turn, become better managers and leaders.</p>

<title>Brief Historical Context and Perspective</title>
<p>During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, theory and pedagogy in management and composition were influenced by some of the same ideas and theories. In particular, we see influences from experiential learning, educational theories on reflection, humanistic psychology, and critical pedagogy. In addition, understandings of the different roles and functions of managers and leaders within organizations and the importance of understanding the self as a part of management and leadership development are directly linked to how personal, reflective writing is used in management and leadership texts and trade books.</p>
<sec id="section2-1080569913478155">
<title>Management and Leadership in Practice and Theory</title>
<p>Management, a relatively young academic discipline, developed as a field of study in the late 1950s and early 1960s with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1080569913478155">Fayol’s (1917/1967)</xref> documentation of the functions of organizational management. His study set in motion the formal academic study of managers in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1080569913478155">Koontz, 1961</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1080569913478155">Drucker (1954</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1080569913478155">1964)</xref> went on to establish the role of manager as someone within organizations who is empowered to make decisions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1080569913478155">Northouse (2013)</xref>, within organizational settings, management, as a structure or system, was established to provide order in an otherwise chaotic organizational body. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1080569913478155">John Kotter (1990a)</xref> went a step further to define differences between management and leadership. Kotter argues that, within organizations, management’s primary function is to provide order and consistency whereas the primary role of leadership is to seek productive change.</p>
<p>This history is important because much of the literature relevant to personal, reflective writing exercises and practice in management education is concerned with leadership theory and practice and, therefore, with effectiveness, goal setting, decision making, and skill development, as management and leadership scholars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1080569913478155">Yukl (1989)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1080569913478155">Kotter (1990b)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1080569913478155">Manz (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1080569913478155">Bennis and Nanus (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1080569913478155">Drucker (2002)</xref> have established.</p>
<p>Given this background, discussion of personal, reflective writing in management education journals and examples of exercises available in textbooks and trade books often focus on assessing one’s effectiveness, setting organizational and personal goals, considering choices and reflecting on decisions made, and evaluating skill sets. This approach spans decades, including examples in texts from Kolb in 1984, Yukl in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1080569913478155">1990</xref>, and Neck and Manz in 2012. Typically, their personal, reflective exercises are designed to help students become better (i.e., more effective, skilled, self-aware) managers and leaders. Several scholars emphasize the importance of conceptual skills in managers and leaders, first identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1080569913478155">Katz (1955)</xref>, and according to leadership scholar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1080569913478155">Pondy (1978)</xref>, a leader’s effectiveness can be best understood by her or his ability to make meaning for others. Additionally, leadership scholars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1080569913478155">Pfeffer (1977)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1080569913478155">Bennis (1979)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1080569913478155">Kotter (1990a)</xref> argue that an effective leader must also be able to make meaning for herself or himself. As a result, used as a form of personal leadership development, many personal, reflective writing exercises in management and leadership are designed to help leaders make meaning for themselves as well as make meaning for others.</p>

<title>Experiential Learning and Reflection</title>
<p>In the management classroom, theories on reflection and experiential learning clearly influence the use of personal, reflective writing exercises. They are used to illustrate course concepts and help students take charge of their own educational experience (and, therefore, practice making meaning for themselves). In composition, we see the same pedagogical approaches. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1080569913478155">Yancey (1998)</xref> puts it this way. Through reflection, “we can circle back, return to earlier notes, to earlier understandings and observations. . . . Reflection asks that we explain to others . . . so that <italic>in explaining to others we explain to ourselves</italic>. We begin to re-understand” (p. 24, italics in original). Yancey’s interpretation builds on theories of reflection from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1080569913478155">John Dewey (1933</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1080569913478155">1938)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1080569913478155">Donald Schön (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1080569913478155">1987)</xref>. She makes a case for the use of reflection in the writing classroom as an opportunity to help student writers become “agents of their own learning” (p. 5).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1080569913478155">Schön (1983)</xref> writes, “Phrases like ‘thinking on your feet,’ ‘keeping your wits about you,’ and ‘learning by doing’ suggest not only that we can think about doing but that we can think about doing something while doing it” (p. 54). Schön’s approaches to learning and knowledge-making parallel the experiential learning theory found in management education and established by organizational psychologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1080569913478155">Kolb (1984)</xref>, who defines learning as “the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience” (p. 40). Kolb’s idea of transformation parallels Yancey’s “re-understanding” and Schön’s “reflection-on-action-in-action.” We see Kolb’s theories on learning styles very much in practice today. A quick search on Google can easily yield more than 150,000 results. Not all are relevant, but many are. Relevant hits range from links to businesses (both for and not-for profit) to university course syllabi and lectures to YouTube videos describing the value of his work and how to apply it. In an instructional course video posted on YouTube, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1080569913478155">Antonette MacDonald (2011)</xref> of the University of Louisville discusses using Kolb’s model for writing critical thinking and reflective essays.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1080569913478155">
<title>Humanistic Psychology and the Writer/Student as Individual</title>
<p>We also see considerable overlap in the fields’ educational applications of principles from humanistic psychology. Humanistic psychologists treat personal growth as a positive experience and often characterize the process and achievement of human fulfillment as self-discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1080569913478155">Rogers, 1989</xref>), self-actualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1080569913478155">Maslow, 1971</xref>), or self-realization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1080569913478155">May, 1983</xref>). Rogers, Maslow, and May were, of course, hugely influential in management theory and education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1080569913478155">Maslow (1971)</xref> describes eight ways in which one self-actualizes, including listening to one’s own self, making choices, and “finding out who one is” (pp. 46-47). Of humanistic psychology’s influence on the field, management and leadership scholar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1080569913478155">Michael Reynolds (1998)</xref> claims that humanistic psychology takes “the form of experiential learning, personal and team development, and numerous variants of ‘self-managed learning’ which have played a considerable part in shaping professional practice in management development” (p. 185).</p>
<p>Compositionists began to use theories of humanistic psychology in the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1080569913478155">Berlin, 1987</xref>) to aid students in the process of self-discovery. Compositionists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1080569913478155">Rohman and Wlecke (1965)</xref> suggest techniques, such as journal writing, as a useful part of the prewriting stage of the writing process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1080569913478155">Rohman (1965)</xref> goes on to claim that journal writing can help a student make discoveries about herself or himself or, as one of his students put it, the discovery of “‘<italic>myself for myself</italic>’” (p. 109). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1080569913478155">Berlin (2011)</xref> labels most compositionists who are concerned with self-discovery or self-actualization “expressivist.” In expressivism, writing is treated as a creative act wherein the individual and her or his expression is the focal point; in expressivism, the writer’s experience of expression, the process, is as important as what is expressed, the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1080569913478155">Berlin, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In both management and composition, personal, reflective writing exercises are used to help students experience greater self-understanding or self-discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1080569913478155">Neck &amp; Manz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1080569913478155">Rohman, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1080569913478155">Waddock, 1999</xref>), agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1080569913478155">Yancey, 1998</xref>), and individual as well as community-based knowledge construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1080569913478155">Prasad &amp; Caproni, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1080569913478155">Shor, 1980</xref>).</p>

<title>Critical Pedagogy</title>
<p>Emphasis on the individual in relation to the greater community is especially important to critical pedagogy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1080569913478155">Richard Miller (2011)</xref> makes clear, composition scholarship on critical pedagogy ranges from discussion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1080569913478155">Paulo Freire’s <italic>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</italic> (1968/1970)</xref> and applicability of his theories in U.S. higher learning institutions generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1080569913478155">Berlin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1080569913478155">McCormick, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1080569913478155">North, 1991</xref>) to practical applications of his pedagogy in U.S. composition classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1080569913478155">Berthoff, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1080569913478155">Bizzell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1080569913478155">Shor, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1080569913478155">Shor (1980)</xref> defines critical pedagogy this way:

<p>Critical education prepares student to be their own agents for social change, their own creators of democratic culture. They gain skills of philosophical abstraction which enable them to separate themselves from manipulation and from the routine flow of time. Consequently, their literacy is a challenge to their control by corporate culture. (p. 48)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the body of research and scholarship on critical pedagogy is smaller in management than composition, there is a passionate group of educators who publish on critical pedagogy and its related schools of thought—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1080569913478155">Reynolds (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1080569913478155">1999)</xref> on critical pedagogy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1080569913478155">Densten and Gray (2001)</xref> on critical reflection; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1080569913478155">Alvesson and Willmott (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1080569913478155">Prasad and Caproni (1997)</xref> on critical theory.

<title>Personal, Reflective Writing Exercises in Today’s Business Communication Classroom</title>
<p>Examples of relevant personal, reflective writing exercises are easy to find. The ones I use I have developed over the years from theories, principles, and pedagogy from composition, management, and business communication. Most of the personal, reflective writing exercises I assign go ungraded and typically support another business writing assignment, facilitate learning about a business communication topic, or aim to get students in the mood to write and tackle a business writing task. What follows is a description of personal, reflective writing exercises useful in a business communication class.</p>

<title>Personal Leadership: Writing About Values, Beliefs, Experience, and the Career</title>
<p>The personal mission statement is, from my point of view, the quintessential personal leadership document. In his popular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1080569913478155"><italic>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</italic> (1989)</xref>, Stephen Covey offers readers numerous exercises in his “Application Suggestions” following each habit. While the purpose of each suggestion typically relates to the specific goals of one of the seven habits, his exercises generally require the reader to engage in some form of self-exploration through written expression. Representative of this type of book, Covey’s exercises range from personal mission statements to more open-ended reflections on past experience as well as visions of the future. For the personal mission statement, Covey suggests readers begin with writing tasks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1080569913478155">Covey (1989)</xref> instructs,

<p>I have used these exercises in my classes in different ways. For example, in an undergraduate leadership communication and other business communication classes, I launched the personal mission statement at the beginning of the semester and treated it, as Covey suggests, as something that takes time to develop. As a result, we revisited the mission statements periodically through the semester, occasionally taking 10 to 15 minutes of class time to work on them, discussing format and form, and even, for those who volunteered, sharing their statements with others. The personal mission statement can be easily coupled with a module on career documents or the job application process, allowing students to link who they are with what they want to be.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1080569913478155">Covey (1989)</xref> claims that creating a personal mission statement “changes you because it forces you to think through priorities deeply, carefully, and to align your behavior with your beliefs” (p. 129). Because the mission statement can take a lot of time in a semester, I often limit the work and ask students to create lists of roles, goals, and priorities. From the lists, they can go on to develop a mission statement or use them to develop resume and cover letter content or develop an elevator pitch. A Google search can yield excellent examples of personal mission statements as well as suggestions for building a mission statement and understanding its purpose.</p>

<title>Assessment, Evaluation, Feedback, and Reflection</title>
<p>Self-assessments are also excellent personal, reflective writing exercises for helping students assess a skill, ability, or performance, and they are not uncommon in business communication textbooks. For example, framed as a feedback exercise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1080569913478155">Newman and Ober (2013)</xref> ask students to provide feedback on their own presentations and on a peer’s presentation, guiding students to comment on both strengths and areas for development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1080569913478155">Barrett (2011)</xref> instructs students to take an oral presentation self-evaluation. Presented in a grid or table format and divided into two parts, the first part guides students through a self-evaluation based on viewing her or his videotaped presentation. Categories to evaluate include delivery, voice, content and organization, and graphics. Students rate their strengths as in a range from “needs work” to “excellent” (p. 179). The second part encourages students to develop an improvement plan, derived from reflecting on the presentation. In Barrett’s exercise, students are asked the following personal, reflective questions: “What was the best part of your presentation? What are key areas to improve? How do you propose working on improvement areas? How will you measure your progress in these areas?” (p. 180)</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1080569913478155">Barrett’s (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1080569913478155">Newman and Ober’s (2013)</xref> textbook examples, students use assessment, evaluation, and feedback to reflect on experience. The questions are concrete and the approach is goal-oriented. Their exercises allow students to become “agents of their own learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1080569913478155">Yancey, 1998</xref>, p. 5) and support Yancey’s claim that, through written reflection, “we come to know and understand our work and perhaps thus to improve it” (p. 12).</p>
<p>Dufrene and Lehman in their <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1080569913478155"><italic>Building High-Performance Teams</italic> (2011)</xref> ask students to reflect on team development by answering questions about “the greatest strength(s) [the student] brings to the group project” and about “area(s) [the student] needs most help with concerning the team project” (p. 6). Students are also asked to reflect on the forming stage, an early stage in team development, and to consider “the role [the student] is most comfortable playing,” the role he or she would like to try, and “the negative role” the student dislikes (p. 11).</p>
<p>In my classes, I assign similar exercises. I often start the self-evaluation of an oral presentation or of a role in a group project as an exercise that gets revised, placed in memo format, and submitted for a grade. Because the memo’s content is personal and reflective, I tend to keep the value of the grade low. However, I am comfortable requiring that the piece be reorganized as a final submission for credit because, in addition to all the pedagogical rationales and benefits to student learning I have discussed thus far, students must also be prepared to evaluate themselves and others in professional organizations. Finally, exercises that encourage reflection on their own performance help inform the feedback and evaluation processes they might use in a written evaluation about others. To this end, in my classes, I also require students to provide feedback, in memo form, to another student about her or his presentation. Students submit a copy of the feedback to their peers and to me. The guidelines they use for writing the feedback are similar to their self-evaluation and feedback exercise. However, with the peer feedback assignment, they have to be more conscious about other elements of good business writing, such as making it reader-centered and practicing positive or neutral wording.</p>

<title>Free Writes and Loosely Structured Prompts: Writing About (Almost) Anything</title>
<p>It is the compositionists who have the corner on free writing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1080569913478155">Ken Macrorie (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1080569913478155">Peter Elbow (1973)</xref> are probably best known among composition scholars for advancing the technique in the composition classroom. During free writing, students are instructed to write, without stopping, without worrying about grammar, without editing, without worrying about readers or the topic or the purpose of the piece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1080569913478155">Macrorie, 1985</xref>). In many ways, the guidelines for free writing are anathema to those of effective business writing, such as “determining the purpose or the channel” of the message or “envisioning the audience” and “adapting the message to the audience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1080569913478155">Lehman &amp; Dufrene, 2013</xref>, pp. 38-40). So the question is why use free writing techniques in a business communication class?</p>
<p>The answer is simple—making meaning and writing the truth. In an interview by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1080569913478155">Schroeder and Boe (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1080569913478155">Macrorie (1985)</xref> discusses writing the truth and treats the truth as more basic than grammar, spelling, and punctuation, more basic than writing for an audience and adapting to form; truth is meaning. As we know, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1080569913478155">Pondy (1978)</xref> established meaning making as a most valuable leadership quality.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1080569913478155">Elbow (1973)</xref>, free writing is a method by which a writer can produce more and more writing, keeping or rejecting what he or she wants from the session. Free writing, in its purest sense, is not guided or linked to an assignment or topic. In my business communication classes, I have used <italic>pure</italic> free writing exercises (as in, write for 10 minutes; write about anything; write about nothing; go) and free writing exercises that are more guided (as in, write for 10 minutes; write about your reactions to the reading assignment; consider your feelings, your opinions, or your positions; go). In the former example, free writing is designed to get the students’ writing juices flowing, to make them more comfortable with the task of writing. In the latter example, the exercise is designed to facilitate a classroom discussion that will follow about a case. In neither case is the exercise designed to help students produce a specific assignment. However, their writing could take any number of forms, including the production of something useful to an upcoming writing assignment. Free writing, too, has the potential to be the place and space for engaging a critical pedagogy, for example, to allow students to contemplate tough questions about the role of the corporation and the individual. Or a guided free write can allow students to consider their goals, values, and beliefs and serve as an accompaniment to the personal mission statement or a job application package.</p>

<title>Practical Applications for the Business Communication Classroom</title>
<sec id="section11-1080569913478155">
<title>Roles, Goals, and Priorities</title>
<p>As juniors and seniors in college, my business students are often in the middle of applying for internships and full-time jobs while taking my classes. To help students think deeply and carefully about career choices and other important aspects of their lives, I have them create three different lists. List directions follow below:</p>
<list id="list1-1080569913478155" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Make a list of the different roles you hold in your life, such as student, son, girlfriend, basketball player, and so on.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Make a list of things that are important for you to do in life, such as travel, play sports, write poetry, or go out with friends. List as many as you like.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>State three major goals you hope to achieve in the next 5 years.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>After creating such lists, I ask them to begin to focus on what’s most important and why. Usually I give them time between generating the lists and focusing on what’s important. For example, I may begin the list activity in class and ask them to chip away at it before our next class meeting. At the next class, I ask them to pull out their lists and begin to focus on the most important. I might spend 10 minutes of class time on this. However, I ask them to go back to the results of the activity at different points in the semester.</p>
<p>When working on resumes and cover letters or engaging in interviews, I suggest they use their personal, reflective writing in the following ways:</p>
<list id="list2-1080569913478155" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To help them think about jobs that might suit them best</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To generate content for an elevator speech</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To have conversation points that might come in handy during an interview</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>I may also take the exercise a bit further and ask the students to create a personal mission statement. At the end of the semester, the original lists, the career-related applications, and the final mission statement come together as a whole, as part of a process for reflecting on important aspects of who they are and what they want. I sometimes bundle the pieces together to serve as a career and professional development portfolio. My students routinely tell me that this work is meaningful to them because it allows them to think about important changes and experiences in their lives. For teachers of large classes, having an activity that is personal and meaningful to their students can bridge a gap between how much you can realistically do to help students personally and how much personal satisfaction they receive from a classroom experience and activity. Finally, because of the nature of the portfolio, I often give credit for its completion or simply give credit for effort.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1080569913478155">
<title>Reflecting on Performance</title>
<p>I film all of my students’ oral presentations, and in addition to having students evaluate each other, I ask them to evaluate themselves. I begin this assignment in class with a writing exercise in which I ask them to describe themselves as a presenter. Nearly all my students have already given an oral presentation in high school, in other college classes, or in other environments. They typically know (or think they know) their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Next, I ask them to set two goals for their upcoming presentation in my class. The goals should be narrow, such as to reduce the number of interrupters they use or to stop putting their hands in their pockets. I get them to file their goals away or send them to me as an email, and on presentation day, I ask them to keep their goals in mind as they present.</p>
<p>Once recorded, I have them watch their presentations and reflect on their earlier writing about strengths and weaknesses. Did they accurately describe themselves? What surprises did they find? Can they update their list of strengths and weaknesses? I also ask them to review their goals? Were they realistic? Did they meet them? What new goals should they set for future presentations?</p>
<p>This version of self-evaluation and reflection could be graded or not.</p>

<title>Free Writing: Guided and Just Plain Free</title>
<p>I have used free writing in my business communication classes in different ways. Sometimes, on days when students seem tired or overwhelmed by the semester, such as during midterm exam period, I call for a brief free write at the start of class. The free write takes as little as 10 or even 5 minutes. The idea is to use the time to help students get into the mood to write. During the free write, they can write about anything. They can write about how they are feeling, what we are doing in class that day, or how stupid they may think free writing is. The topic is truly open.</p>
<p>A guided free write can be more helpful for actually trying to move forward on a specific writing assignment. For example, I might ask them to write about the assignment, for example, about their feelings about their work so far, any struggles they may be having with the assignment, or plans for next steps. Or I might give them something brief to read and ask them to respond to the reading. The reading, ideally, is related to the assignment topic or purpose. In short, there is no prescribed form, no idealized product, just writing.</p>
<p>As such, when I bring free writing into my business communication classes, I emphasize process, not product. Nothing is collected. Nothing is graded, and what students produce remains private. As their instructor, I want the experience of writing to be liberating. I want them to be agents in charge of their own learning.</p>

<title>Emphasis on the Process of Writing</title>
<p>Personal, reflective writing is a pedagogical strategy that emphasizes the process of writing. Because business people often produce communications on a time-sensitive deadline and may have little opportunity to practice the process approach when tackling a writing task during an average workday, business communication scholars have argued against an emphasis on process writing in a business communication class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1080569913478155">Bracher, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1080569913478155">Kottle &amp; Hickey, 1987</xref>). However, like others before me, I contend that the process approach helps students take the steps necessary for reaching a final product and learn along the way about “the complexities involved in professional writing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1080569913478155">Barbour, 1987</xref>, p. 64). Because personal, reflective writing requires reflection and awareness of the self and others, it also has the potential to better prepare students for the realities of the business setting they will soon enter. Personal, reflective writing—as a pedagogical strategy for teaching business students to write—is designed to help students learn about themselves, take charge of their learning, generate ideas, reflect on experience, and connect with the work they are assigned to produce. If coupled with other business writing tasks or experiences that relate to our students’ experiences in business school, personal, reflective writing can help business students see the personal in business writing. By personal, I am talking about acknowledging the writer behind the communication, the person who makes decisions about words and content and who visualizes an audience as he/she writes. I am arguing for the use of personal, reflective writing as a way to fight technical rationality and avoid a potential tendency to objectify the other. Instead, I hope that personal, reflective writing can help make our students more accountable to themselves and others and, in turn, make our students better writers, managers, and leaders.</p>
