<p>A cross-sectional study on the home environment and children’s health in Northeast Texas was carried out in 2008–2009. Two thousand eight hundred and nineteen (2,819) parents of children (1–8 years) reported their housing characteristics, home interior surface materials, dampness and children’s health status. The response rate was 71%. Health outcomes studied were wheeze, dry cough, rhinitis, eczema in the last 12 months and diagnosed asthma and hay fever. Dampness was significant risk factor for wheeze and rhinitis with adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.3–1.7. Mould/damp spot, condensation and suspected moisture problems were more commonly reported in buildings with flat roof and pier/beam foundation in hot and humid Northeast Texas. Compared to single family houses, trailers were associated with more dampness, consequently a significant increased prevalence of asthma (AOR 1.5 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–2.3), rhinitis (AOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0–2.0) and hay fever (AOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–2.1). Central air-conditioning system, which re-circulates indoor air, was associated with less dampness problems. However, an increment trend of allergic symptoms was found in homes with air-conditioning system, especially for rhinitis (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.2). Carpet as floor covering and laminated panel as wall covering were associated with rhinitis (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0–2.5) and wheezing (AOR 4.7, 95% CI 1.8–12.7), respectively.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X13480373"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The prevalence of asthma and allergies in the world varies largely, with the highest prevalence of asthma about 20 times higher than the lowest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X13480373">1</xref>]. USA is among the high prevalence countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X13480373">2</xref>]. In 2006, 9.9 million US children under 18 years of age (14%) have been diagnosed with asthma, with 6.8 million children (9%) still having asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X13480373">3</xref>]. Asthma is responsible for about 500,000 hospitalizations, 5,000 deaths and 134 million days of restricted activity a year in USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X13480373">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X13480373">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Outdoor as well as indoor pollutants have been suggested as risk factors for the development of asthma. Outdoor air pollutants have been declining in many industrialized countries during the last decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X13480373">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X13480373">7</xref>], but this has not resulted in a decline in the incidence of asthma. Therefore, indoor pollutants might be of greater importance in influencing the health status of children. The home environment has changed considerably during the past three decades because of a rapid change in building technology, as well as in the type of materials used for interior decorations, furniture and textiles. A US study demonstrated that changes in heating and air-conditioning systems are associated with the increased prevalence of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X13480373">8</xref>]. In modern buildings, carpet or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) flooring have often replaced wooden flooring. PVC furnishing materials at home have been associated with asthma and allergies among children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X13480373">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X13480373">10</xref>]. In a case–control study, the risk of asthma in adults was related to the presence of wall-to-wall carpet at work, in particular in the presence of mould problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X13480373">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite growing evidence showing that residential exposures have dramatic impacts on children’s health, housing is largely ignored as a public health problem in USA. Limitations in exploring the links between health and housing are that many studies have health data but no data on housing characteristics, or vice versa, and that studies with data on both housing and health almost exclusively are on low-income populations. Data on the home environment and health for the general population are largely missing.</p>
<p>A study of the home environment and asthma and allergies among children aged 1–8 years, representative of the general population, in Northeast Texas, USA, was carried out in 2008–2009. This study is part of the global Damp Building and Health (DBH) study which has been carried out in Sweden, Bulgaria, Singapore, Taiwan, Denmark, South Korea and China. These studies have been conducted with similar questionnaires and protocols in order to establish comparable data sets. The overall aim with such global study is to picture a global map on the prevalence of asthma and allergy in children as well as on characteristics of homes and indoor environmental exposures. A further aim is to identify not only general risk and protection factors for asthma and allergy but also region-specific factors due to climate, culture, traditions, etc. The present paper focuses on housing characteristics, dampness and their associations with asthma and allergies in children in US.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X13480373" sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The study is a population-based cross-sectional study during which self-administrated questionnaires were delivered to parents of children (1–8 years) in Northeast Texas through Women, Infants and Children (WIC) agencies, independent school systems, daycare centres, hospitals, clinic centres and churches. Participants were from nine cities (Cayuga, Flint, Hawkins, Henderson, Larue, Lindale, Longview, Palestine and Tyler), which covered seven counties (Anderson, Gregg, Harrison, Henderson, Rusk, Smith and Wood) in Northeast Texas. The contents of the questionnaire is described in detail in a previous paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X13480373">12</xref>]. The medical part of the questionnaire follows the ISAAC study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X13480373">13</xref>], which consisted of wheeze, dry cough, rhinitis, eczema in the last 12 months and doctor-diagnosed asthma and hay fever. Housing characteristics investigated were housing type, housing age, type of foundation, roof, windows, ventilation system and interior surface materials. The social-economic status (SES) of participants was indicated by housing ownership. Dampness indicators were mould/damp spot, floor moisture, water leakage, condensation on window pane in winter and suspected moisture problem.</p>
<p>In order to find whether there is a selection bias between respondents and non-respondents, 527 people who did not respond to the survey were reached by a short questionnaire which consisted of questions on wheezing in the last 12 months, house type, visible mould on walls/ceilings and environmental tobacco smoke at home.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X13480373"><title>Statistic Analysis</title>
<p>Comparisons of dampness indicators in different housing type and housing construction period were analyzed by Chi-square tests. Odds ratios (ORs) of housing foundation, roof, window, ventilation system and interior furnishing material for dampness were calculated in logistic regression models with adjustment for housing type and construction period. ORs of dampness for health outcomes were calculated with adjustments for gender, age, allergic symptoms in the family and SES. Racial disparity of asthma and allergy, as well as housing type, was observed in Northeast Texas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X13480373">12</xref>]. The ORs of housing characteristics were calculated with adjustment for gender, age, allergic symptoms in family, SES, race and housing type. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze the data. A <italic>p</italic> value less than 0.05 indicates a significant level. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University of Texas at Tyler, Texas.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X13480373"><title>Results</title>
<p>This cross-sectional study obtained responses from 3,766 participants. After excluding children who did not meet the age criteria (i.e. aged 1–8 years), 2,819 responses were involved in the analysis. The demographic information of involved children is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X13480373">Table 1</xref>. One thousand four hundred and forty-two participants indicated their ethnicity, among whom 255 (18%) were Mexicans, 178 (12%) Afro-Americans, 40 (3%) Asian-Americans and 969 (67%) Caucasians. The comparison between participants with and without racial information on housing type, dampness, gender, age and health outcomes is shown in the online supplementary Table S1. There was no significant difference between these two subgroups. The prevalence of symptoms of wheezing, dry cough, rhinitis and eczema in the last 12 months was 28%, 20%, 51% and 15%, respectively. Doctor-diagnosed asthma and hay fever were 16% and 27%.

<p>Housing characteristics are shown in the online supplementary Table S2. Common housing characteristics in Northeast Texas are a concrete slab foundation, gable roof, carpet flooring, dry walls (also known as plasterboard or gypsum board which is a panel made of gypsum plaster pressed between two thick sheets of paper) and aluminium frame windows. Air-conditioning units were installed in more than 80% of homes. Compared to single family houses, more trailers had a pier and beam as foundation, a flat roof, vinyl flooring and panel walls. Trailers also had natural ventilation system more often (single family houses 18% vs. trailers 28%). Single family houses constructed after 1983 had more concrete slab as building foundation, more gable roofs, more carpets, more aluminium window frames and more air-conditioning than older buildings.</p>
<p>The frequencies of dampness problems are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X13480373">Table 2</xref>. Dampness indicators were reported in 10%–30% families. Trailers, as well as old buildings, had more dampness problems. AORs of housing foundation, roof, window, ventilation system and interior furnishing material for dampness are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X13480373">Table 3</xref>. Pier/beam as foundation, flat roof, aluminium window and natural ventilation system were associated to an increase of dampness indicators. PVC floor and carpet, as well as wallpaper, were related to more suspected damp problems.

<p>Associations between dampness indicators and asthma and allergies are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X13480373">Table 4</xref>. Dampness index were associated significantly with wheeze, dry cough, rhinitis, hay fever and eczema. There were non-significant associations of some dampness index with diagnosed asthma. Associations between housing characteristics and asthma and allergy are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1420326X13480373">Table 5</xref>. Living in trailers was associated with diagnosed asthma (AOR 1.5 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–2.3). This means the risk of children in trailers to have asthma was 1.5 times as high as those in single family house. Air-conditioning system was a significant risk factor for rhinitis (AOR 1.6 with 95% CI 1.1–2.2), and it was associated with a trend of increment of other allergic symptoms. Carpet as floor covering and laminated panel as wall covering were significantly associated with an increment of rhinitis and wheeze, respectively. Five hundred and twenty-seven (527) non-respondents answered short questionnaires. Four hundred and fifty-one (451) children met the age criteria. There were no significant differences in prevalence of wheezing, housing type and environmental tobacco smoke among respondents and non-respondents. However, more mould spots were reported from children’s room of non-respondents.

<sec id="sec5-1420326X13480373"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is subject to the limitations inherent in any cross-sectional survey. Data used for the analysis were collected retrospectively and relied on parental reports and thus could be subject to recall bias. However, the questions on outcomes and exposures in the present study have been validated in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X13480373">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X13480373">17</xref>]. Some studies demonstrated that parental reports of childhood asthma can identify more than 94% cases of diagnosed asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X13480373">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X13480373">19</xref>]. Non-respondents were reached by short surveys. There were no significant differences regarding reports of wheezing, house type and environmental tobacco smoke among respondents and non-respondents. Higher percentage of mould spot reported by non-respondents, compared to respondents, indicates that moisture-related problems may be underestimated. However, the response rate was as high as 71%. This means that selection bias could only be a minor problem. Ownership of dwellings was used as a proxy of SES. There may be variations in SES among non-owners and among owners. However, the strong association between housing characteristics, dampness and health outcomes should not be due to misclassification of SES.</p>
<p>Thirty-one percent (31%) of families in this study reported to have condensation on windowpane in winter. This is consistent with a prior study in Seattle, which showed that 34% of 925 participating families reported to have water condensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X13480373">20</xref>]. However, we found less mould/mildew spots in Northeast Texas families (18%) compared to those in Seattle (54%) and in Boston (38%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X13480373">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X13480373">21</xref>]. This was probably due to the cold weather in North USA regions, which cause more condensations on the cold surface of building enclosures.</p>
<p>The risk effect of dampness in our study is consistent with previous studies which show that relative risks of dampness for health effects in the airways are in the range of OR 1.4–2.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X13480373">22</xref>]. In the very extensive Swedish study “Dampness in Buildings and Health” (DBH), with the aim of identifying what agents in indoor air are responsible for the associations between “dampness” and allergies and asthma, so far it has not been able to identify these agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X13480373">23</xref>]. Moreover, Larsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X13480373">24</xref>] recently showed that the associations between dampness and health in cross-sectional studies disappear in a longitudinal study. Studies with sophisticated design and objective measurement on dampness are needed to discover what “dampness” means to health.</p>
<p>According to the US census Bureau, trailers accounted for nearly a quarter of all new single-family houses during the 1990s. Trailers (manufactured homes) built today often use materials and mechanical systems that could potentially contribute to poor indoor air quality and low durability. Trailers in hot and humid locations still use and install vinyl covered gypsum, which often results in problems with mould and mildew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X13480373">25</xref>]. In the present study, trailer, compared to single family houses, was related to more dampness, consequently, more asthma and allergic symptoms. Old housing had more dampness problems probably due to poor maintenance. This finding is consistent with those in Sweden, Finnish and American studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X13480373">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X13480373">28</xref>]. The Swedish and Finnish studies reported a common leakage problem associated with flat roof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X13480373">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X13480373">27</xref>]. This was confirmed in our Texas study. However, our study in hot and humid Texas found that pier/beam as foundation was risk type of construction for dampness, which was against the finding from the previous study in cold and dry Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X13480373">26</xref>]. In the present study, aluminium frame window was associated with increased report of condensation on windowpanes in winter. Aluminium window may make the building tighter compared to wooden frame windows. However, the moisture content could not be removed efficiently by ventilation, thus cause more dampness problems. This is consistent with a previous study in China, which shows that PVC frame windows were related to less air change rate and more condensations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1420326X13480373">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1420326X13480373">30</xref>]. Our study found that natural ventilation system compared to air-conditioning system could cause more dampness indicators. Future studies in hot and humid climate are needed to verify these findings.</p>
<p>The present study shows that, compared to natural ventilation system, air-conditioning system (which mainly re-circulates indoor air) is associated with an increased prevalence rate of wheeze, diagnosed asthma and hay fever and are significantly associated to an increased prevalence rate of rhinitis (<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05). It is interesting to find that air-conditioning system was associated with less dampness problems. This indicates that there must be other potential risks that may overcome the benefits of less dampness problems in houses with air-conditioning systems. The negative association between air-conditioning system and health outcomes is consistent with prior findings in homes and/or offices. In two large-scale studies in Europe and America on housing characteristics and health, it was reported that air-conditioning was associated with an increment of lower respiratory symptoms (relative risk 1.14) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X13480373">28</xref>] and asthma outcomes (AOR 1.0–1.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1420326X13480373">31</xref>]. Seppänen and Fisk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1420326X13480373">32</xref>] summarized that air-conditioning in offices, relative to natural ventilation, is associated with a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of one or more SBS symptoms, by approximately 30–200%. Mendell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1420326X13480373">33</xref>] identified that poor drainage in air-conditioning drip pans might increase adverse respiratory effects (AOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3–5.2), particularly among asthmatics. Menzies et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X13480373">34</xref>] demonstrated that installation of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) of drip pans and cooling coils within ventilation systems of office buildings would reduce microbial contamination, and thus occupants’ work-related symptoms.</p>
<p>The present study did not find significant associations between PVC floor covering and health outcomes. This is probably due to the limited sample size (122 (4.4%) families had PVC flooring). It can also be due to the fact that, with the increased health concern about plasticizers, manufactures have changed the composition of PVC products. In the European studies, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and butyl benzyl phthalate (BB<sub>z</sub>P) were associated with asthma and allergies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X13480373">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X13480373">10</xref>]. These plasticizers are today not used in, e.g. PVC flooring, in Europe and USA. Carpet is a common flooring material in Northeast Texas. Carpets with less-frequent cleaning can be a breeding ground for mites and a reservoir of dust. In the present study, carpet was significantly associated with an increment of rhinitis in children, which is in agreement with a previous case–control study among adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X13480373">11</xref>]. Laminated wall panel is an emerging decoration technique. This is a resin-based decorative layer pressed on high-density fiberboard. It was found that lower respiratory tract symptoms – wheeze and asthma – were associated with the presence of such panels. However, only 58 families had laminated panel as wall covering. Further studies are needed to verify this result.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X13480373"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In Northeast Texas, flat roof and pier/beam foundation are the type of constructions related to dampness problems. Living in trailers was related to diagnosed asthma and diagnosed hay fever of children. Central air-conditioning systems were associated with an increment trend of allergic symptoms among children, especially with rhinitis. These findings indicate that housing characteristics and its related problems (e.g. dampness) have substantial impact on children’s health. Housing maintenance and inspections are needed to identify and resolve risk factors in housing environmental exposures.</p></sec></body>
