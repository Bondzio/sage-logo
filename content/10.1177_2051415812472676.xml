<title>Results:</title>
<p>Hellner’s canine studies showed that complete ischaemia of the testis beyond six hours resulted in necrosis and then atrophy. He also showed that the degree of torsion was a key determinant of outcome with organ salvage possible at up to 24 hours when the twist was less than 3600. Recent clinical series support these findings and suggest a success rate of ≥98% when exploration is performed within six hours. Testicular salvage may be as good as 89% when surgery is delayed to 12 hours. Related medico-legal cases may consider whether the operative delay was causative in testicular loss, and where liability may lie for any such delay. Specific literature in this area is sparse.</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Hellner’s work explains the basis of the six hour rule and its application remains valid in today’s clinical practice. Surgical exploration is indicated out to 24 hours, however, given that testes can still be saved and that the degree of torsion cannot be gleaned pre-operatively. Medico-legally, we believe that an operative delay of up to 8 hours is probably safe when considering the causation of testicular loss, but more data are needed. Liability is more complex in that many factors can contribute to the delay and may be beyond the control of the doctor or hospital.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>We aim to explore the basis of the urological rule that for testicular salvage, exploration and fixation within six hours of pain onset is crucial, and to determine its significance in modern-day practice. Perceived delays in fixation leading to subsequent testicular loss prompt medico-legal claims. The authors’ personal experience of writing expert witness reports in such cases has highlighted a lack of clarity in the literature with regard to the window of opportunity for testis salvage. We therefore attempt to ascertain what represents a clinically and legally acceptable delay.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>A focused search of the PubMed database for relevant historical and modern-day studies was performed. Importantly, we translated Hellner’s original 1933 work from German to English. Retrieved papers were also searched by hand to identify any additional pertinent articles.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Testicular torsion classically presents as an acutely painful scrotum, tender on palpation. It is frequently misdiagnosed on the basis of clinical findings alone, with the differential including torsion of testicular appendage, acute epididymo-orchitis, trauma, neoplasm, strangulated inguino-scrotal hernia, hydrocele, spermatocele, and haematocele. There is no reliable diagnostic test, with Doppler ultrasound missing absent intra-testicular blood flow in up to 30% of cases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2051415812472676">1</xref></sup> hence the need for surgical exploration. Testicular torsion is a urological emergency since it reduces blood flow and oxygen supply and, if unrelieved, results in necrosis of the testicle within a few hours. A necrotic testicle found at exploration requires orchidectomy. If deemed to be viable, however, it and the contra-lateral testicle are fixed inside the scrotum with non-absorbable suture material to prevent re-torsion.</p>
<p>Torsion occurs in approximately one in 4000 males under 25.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2051415812472676">2</xref></sup> The age distribution is bimodal with a peak incidence in the second decade and another smaller peak in neonates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415812472676">3</xref></sup> Torsion can occur within or outside the tunica vaginalis. The former typically occurs in adolescents with fully descended testes, often in association with an underlying structural malformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415812472676">4</xref></sup> Such malformations are bilateral in approximately 80%, hence the need for bilateral fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051415812472676">5</xref></sup> Extra-vaginal torsion is usual in neonates, infants and patients with an incompletely descended testis. This is commonly a unilateral finding and therefore the need to fix the contralateral testis remains controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051415812472676">6</xref></sup> Triggers for torsion include cold weather, trauma, sporting activities, and sexual intercourse, and it may occur during sleep, secondary to rotational movement or cremasteric spasm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415812472676">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415812472676">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has become part of urological lore that in order to salvage a torted testis, scrotal exploration and de-torsion must be achieved within six hours from symptom onset. This seems to derive from the work of Hellner (1933), which will be described in detail below.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051415812472676">9</xref></sup> Contemporary surgical series have questioned the validity of this rule. Time from onset of torsion to de-torsion is clearly a key component, but the degree of twist and completeness of the ischemia are also important factors when considering salvage rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051415812472676">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both difficulty in diagnosis and the limited time period for curative surgical intervention can result in sub-optimal management of torsion. As a consequence, it is a common trigger for malpractice allegations against doctor or hospital. Hence our aim to review the relevant literature, including Hellner’s original article, to provide not only improved guidance on the surgical management of this common urological emergency, but also to aid those involved in related legal cases.</p>

<title>Historical milestones</title>
<p>The first published description of testicular torsion is credited to the Englishman John Hunter in 1810: An 18-year-old presented with violent scrotal pain after ice skating; treatment was conservative and the testicle atrophied over the following weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415812472676">8</xref></sup> In 1840, surgical management was reported by Delasiauve: A 15-year-old boy underwent an orchidectomy after torsion of an undescended testis, described as a “black mass”, was diagnosed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415812472676">8</xref></sup> Physicians in the late 19th and early 20th centuries documented diagnostic signs of a torted testis though none proved pathognomonic. Lauenstein highlighted the importance of sudden pain onset, and Brunzel noted the unilateral elevation of the scrotal testis caused by torsion of the spermatic cord.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415812472676">8</xref></sup> Tenckhoff described “pergamentknistern” as a late and poor prognostic sign: a crackling sensation on palpation, similar to surgical emphysema, and in 1934, Prehn coined an eponymous sign to distinguish torsion from epididymo-orchitis, suggesting that scrotal elevation alleviated pain only in the latter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415812472676">8</xref></sup> More recently, it has been postulated that absence of the cremasteric reflex in children may indicate torsion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2051415812472676">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Animal studies have proved vital to our understanding of the pathology involved. In 1823, Cooper noted the importance of both the duration and degree of testicular torsion in the causation of organ atrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051415812472676">12</xref></sup> Testicular damage in dogs after 16 hours of torsion was reported by Enderlen as early as 1896,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415812472676">8</xref></sup> but it was Hellner who described the six-hour operative window before which long-term testicular tissue damage or impaired spermatogenesis should not occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051415812472676">9</xref></sup> This sentinel document was published in German in 1933 and includes a clinical case series of testicular torsion, an historical overview of animal studies performed elsewhere, and details of the author’s own canine experiments in which varying degrees of testicular torsion were recreated using rubber tubing and sutures for varying time periods.</p>
<p>In Hellner’s first set of experiments, complete ischemia was achieved by tying off the cord with a silk suture. The testicles were then analysed histologically for signs of damage to spermatogenic and parenchymal tissues. He concluded that after four to six hours of complete ischemia, haemorrhagic necrosis and ultimately testicular atrophy would result. His next experiments aimed to simulate partial ischemia by tying rubber tubing around the cord. Unfortunately the results were too variable for clear conclusions to be drawn. The third series of studies looked at differing duration and degrees of torsion. He torted the testicle to either 180 or 360 degrees and fixed it with sutures. The testicles were then released at differing time intervals between six and 24 hours and then removed for histological assessment. He concluded that with 180-degree torsion, minimal long-term histological damage or atrophy was found regardless of duration. With 360-degree torsion, when the testis was released within six hours no severe long-term damage was seen. After 12 hours of 360-degree twist, histology revealed a spectrum from minor changes through to complete atrophy, and beyond 12 hours all were atrophic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051415812472676">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although this work was performed in dogs, the findings are broadly in keeping with modern-day retrospective series (discussed below). The conclusion that testicular salvage is possible after 12 hours of torsion may be as important as the six-hour figure for guaranteed preservation. In clinical practice, symptom onset provides a good estimate of the duration of the insult but experimental observations related to the degree of torsion cannot be related to patient management since this can be assessed only once surgery is undertaken.</p>

<title>Current literature</title>
<p>Adult as well as paediatric series reviewed highlight the importance of prompt surgical intervention given the close correlation between symptom duration and testicular salvage rates. The largest published series to date is by Anderson and Williamson, studying 670 patients with torsion presenting over a 25-year period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051415812472676">13</xref></sup> They reported testicular viability in 98% (222/226) with symptom duration of up to six hours at the time of operation, 95% (310/325) when surgery was performed within 12 hours, and 89% (88/99) when operated on between seven and 12 hours. The testis was saved in only 25% when exploration occurred at greater than 12 hours. Overall, the testis was preserved in 386 men, but in 47 of these there was some doubt about testicular viability at operation. All 47 had had pain for more than 10 hours (median 22 hours, range 10–36), and at three-month follow-up 35 (75%) were found to have some degree of testicular atrophy. Of the subset operated on after more than 18 hours, 91% had atrophy at three months. When patients with successfully salvaged testicles were compared to those without, the former had a significantly shorter duration of pain (median five hours, range one to three). In addition, it was noted that whenever the testis was saved after a prolonged period, the degree of torsion documented at operation did not exceed 180 degrees or had resolved completely, in keeping with Hellner’s findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051415812472676">9</xref></sup> Interestingly, an improvement in testicular salvage rates was demonstrated over the 25-year period reviewed (45% 1960–1964; 67% 1980), thought largely due to greater awareness of the condition and speedier referral by general practitioners (GPs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051415812472676">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Watkin and colleagues retrospectively reviewed case notes of 209 emergency scrotal explorations over a seven-year period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051415812472676">14</xref></sup> Testicular torsion was the diagnosis in 82 men (40%), with a consequent orchidectomy rate of 22%. Data on testicular viability in relation to symptom duration were presented for 71/82. When the time from onset to anaesthesia was less than four hours, 100% of testes were saved. This dropped to 90% for the 31 explored at 4.1 to eight hours, and 75% for the 12 explored at 8.1–16 hours. Beyond 16 hours, the salvage rate was only 25%. In three cases the testis was saved after greater than 24 hours of pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051415812472676">14</xref></sup> Unfortunately this study included no follow-up data, precluding comparison with Anderson and Williamson’s paper in terms of atrophy rate following delayed fixation.</p>
<p>Jefferson’s group performed a retrospective analysis of 83 paediatric cases (mean age 14.4) of torsion presenting over a ten-year period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2051415812472676">15</xref></sup> Fifty-one (61%) had a successful salvage procedure, the mean duration of pain being four hours (range 0.67–12). No testes were saved after 12 hours of symptoms. Another paediatric study, principally looking at the degree and direction of torsion, compared patients treated with orchidopexy to those who underwent orchidectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051415812472676">10</xref></sup> Median symptom duration was five hours (range 0.5–144) in the former and 2.2 days (range 2.5 hours to two weeks) in the latter. At exploration, median rotation was 360 degrees in the orchidopexy, and 540 degrees in the orchidectomy group (range 180–1080 for both). At follow-up, testicular atrophy was found in 27% of orchidopexy patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051415812472676">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Medico-legal perspectives</title>
<p>From a medico-legal aspect, two areas must be considered: firstly that of liability (breach of duty), concerning whether any alleged delay was reasonable in the circumstances, and secondly the issue of causation which questions whether such a delay caused the loss of the testis.</p>
<p>Causation is the easier to address, at least in theory. Almost 100% of testes are salvaged with exploration within four to six hours of pain onset,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051415812472676">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051415812472676">14</xref></sup> and so a delay of this magnitude cannot be said to have caused loss of a testis. Determining whether a delay of six to eight hours could result in testicular loss is less easily gleaned from the reviewed data. In Anderson and Williamson’s study, 89% of testes operated on between seven and 12 hours were salvaged, hinting that delays of seven to eight hours might perhaps be as safe as zero to six hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051415812472676">13</xref></sup> Watkin et al.’s series, however, suggests a significant attrition rate at 4.1 to eight hours, since the salvage rate dropped from 100% with exploration within four hours to 90% when explored at 4.1 to eight hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051415812472676">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Liability is the legal question determining whether the surgeon’s actions were “reasonable”. The finding that 98% of testes were salvaged with exploration within six hours, but only 89% with delays of seven to 12 hours seems to reaffirm that exploration within six hours is legally safe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051415812472676">13</xref></sup> But what of delays of six to eight hours? Should we slavishly apply the six-hour rule, based as it is on experimental data in dogs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051415812472676">9</xref></sup> as the benchmark against which a perceived delay in exploration is deemed negligent or not, when there is clinical data showing high rates of salvage in humans may be achievable with <italic>slightly</italic> longer delays? Again the waters are muddied by Watkin et al.’s data suggesting that the salvage rate drops from 100% with surgery within four hours to 90% with delays of 4.1 to eight hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051415812472676">14</xref></sup> Comparison between delays of four to six and six to eight hours was not performed and hence we cannot establish if the delay between six and eight hours is the crucial factor determining the decline in success in the 4.1- to eight-hour group.</p>
<p>Clearly surgeons and hospitals can be held liable only for delays that lie within their control. Determining where such responsibility lies, however, is not always easy. Patients often do not present immediately on the onset of testicular pain, and some contact their general practitioner (GP) rather than proceeding directly to an emergency department (ED). The logistics of operating within six hours can present challenges. Surgeons, anaesthetists and theatres may not be available immediately on a patient’s arrival in ED. Given all these factors, exploration within six hours is not always feasible.</p>
<p>The various series outlined above also emphasise that all is not lost if more than six hours have elapsed since the onset of pain. Some testicles will still be salvaged with timely de-torsion and so every effort should be made to explore such cases urgently. Even beyond 12–16 hours, as many as 25% of testes may be salvaged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051415812472676">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051415812472676">14</xref></sup> Some such cases may be less than 360-degree twists of the spermatic cord, hence rapid exploration is indicated even with prolonged torsion. Lastly, post-operative follow-up appears important, especially on those in whom viability is in any doubt at the time of surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051415812472676">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051415812472676">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Medico-legal outcomes</title>
<p>Mis-management of this condition is a common reason for malpractice litigation although the related medical literature is sparse. Matteson and colleagues reviewed cases of torsion handled by a United States medical insurance company from 1979 to 1997.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2051415812472676">16</xref></sup> Of the 39 cases, misdiagnosis of epididymo-orchitis was the most common scenario (61%). In two of three cases judgement resulted against the surgeon, with payments as out of court settlements in 96%. Significantly, late presentation (&gt; eight hours) did not affect the medico-legal result. The most common reasons for paid claims were error in diagnosis (74%), delay or lack of referral (48%), lack of radiology (19%), failure to operate (13%), error in surgical technique or judgement (13%) and falsified records (10%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2051415812472676">16</xref></sup> The only study of United Kingdom data was reported recently by Osman and Collins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2051415812472676">17</xref></sup> They analysed all urological litigation in the National Health Service (NHS) from 1995 to 2009. In total, 493 claims closed with indemnity payment but surprisingly few related to testicular torsion. Twenty-one of 232 “non- operative” claims were due to failure to diagnose or treat torsion, and one of 168 “post-operative” claims concerned a case of re-torsion.</p>
<p>We have not found any published work examining the medico-legal expert witness reports in cases of torsion nor discussion of how long a delay is acceptable before malpractice is deemed to have occurred. The latter may reflect the greater contribution of late presentation as opposed to clinical delay to this time period.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Both Hellner’s work and clinical series support the six-hour rule. With scrotal exploration within four to six hours in cases of suspected torsion, one can anticipate a testis salvage rate of 98–100%. The question of whether a delay in scrotal exploration of six to eight hours is equally safe remains unanswered. It is clear in the literature that successful outcome correlates inversely with the duration of the insult. Therefore, where the diagnosis is questioned, surgery should be performed as soon as possible. Since there is no pathognomonic clinical sign or non-invasive diagnostic test, this strategy will, however, result in a proportion of unnecessary operations.</p>
<p>The canine experiments of Hellner have undoubtedly increased our understanding of testicular torsion in a manner impossible in human studies. His demonstration that relief of complete ischemia and/or 360-degree torsion within six hours avoided permanent organ damage has given this time-point elevated status in modern-day urology. His work also gives ground for the belief that exploration and fixation up to 24 hours following injury is valid, since some testes were saved. This approach is supported by the results of all the recent patient studies we have reviewed. It must also be remembered that the severity of torsion, as measured by the degree of twist, is another key outcome determinant. Torsion to less than 360 degrees may not cause permanent damage even beyond 24 hours. This can be assessed only intra-operatively, however, and so does not change initial management.</p>
<p>From a medico-legal standpoint, the bulk of litigation in cases of testicular torsion seems to relate to errors in diagnosis or referral to appropriate specialist teams. Reported scenarios concerning the timing of surgery in relation to outcome are sparse. Hence prompt recognition of the condition by GPs and ED staff is as important as pro-active surgical management if malpractice allegations are to be minimised.</p>
