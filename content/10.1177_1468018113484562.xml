<p>This issue addresses some key theoretical issues for global social policy. In their article, Daniel Béland and Mitchell Orenstein are critical of the view that international organizations tend to pursue a particular line – or ‘policy paradigm’ – over long periods. Taking the case of pensions privatization, they argue that, in contrast to ideological think tanks like the Cato Institute, international organizations like the World Bank need to be seen as ‘open systems’ in which competing policy entrepreneurs, responding to and interpreting political and ideological shifts, can succeed in reshaping the organization’s ideational orientation. Tracy Fenwick also examines the role of ideas. She compares the take up of the idea of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) in Argentina and Brazil, arguing that such travelling policy ideas encounter particular political and ideological context, and their impact is contingent on the policy feedbacks to which these local circumstances give rise.</p>
<p>A critical assessment of existing poverty reduction strategies constitutes the focus of several contributions. In different ways, the articles by Fenwick and Anthony Hodges et al. explore the fiscal, administrative and political feasibility of successfully implementing CCT programmes. Fenwick contrasts the feedback effects that enabled the expansion of Brazil’s original <italic>Bolsa Escola</italic> programme to the now well-known <italic>Bolsa Familia</italic> programme that brings together a range of services, versus the administrative and ideational factors limiting its impact in Argentina. Hodges and his colleagues, Geranda Notten, Luca Tiberti and Clare O’Brien, turn the focus to Africa, where donor agencies have actively been promoting the introduction of CCTs. They find that, while middle-income countries like Congo-Brazzaville have the fiscal capacity to introduce such plans, they would pose a significant challenge for low-income countries like Côte d’Ivoire. Moreover, the lack of interest on the part of local political and bureaucratic elites indicates that there are strong political barriers to their introduction. Qin Gao’s article takes us to another part of the world and another form of targeted social assistance – the Minimum Living Standard Assurance system, pioneered in Shanghai, diffused to other major Chinese cities and ultimately scaled up to the national level. Comparing the extremely modest levels of assistance to actual income of many of the poor, Gao argues that such means-tested programmes are inadequate to tackling the growing problem of poverty in contemporary China.</p>
<p>Readers of <italic>Global Social Policy</italic> will note the absence of a Forum section in this issue. Fear not – we have not abandoned the practice. While you can look forward to forums on topical questions in subsequent issues, we have decided to intersperse these with other innovative contributions. The first of these is Sarah Martin’s interview with Robert Cox, one of the leading critical international relations theorists. Cox, who worked for some time at the International Labour Organization, is the author of numerous important works, including <italic>Production, Power and World Order: Social Forces in the Making of History</italic>. In this interview – as in his writing – Cox stresses the importance of a ‘bottom-up’ approach to shifts in the world order, one sensitive to the plurality of histories and cultures.</p>
<p>We have also revived the book review section. In this issue – and much in line with Cox’s admonition to take a ‘bottom-up’ approach to understanding global change – we publish Jasmine Gideon’s review of Merike Blofield’s <italic>Care Work and Class: Domestic Worker’s Struggle for Rights in Latin America</italic>.</p>
