<abstract>
<p>Worker and union responses to mass redundancy announcements are complex. This article explores a mass redundancy announcement with the purpose of shedding light on the way collective responses are shaped at such times. The article focuses on steelworker redundancies in South Wales (United Kingdom) in 2001 and 2002, which occurred at the Corus plc steelworks at Ebbw Vale in Blaenau Gwent and Llanwern, Newport, and argues that management handles such announcements in strategic ways to neutralize collective responses. Further, the article contends that the way trade unions organize and operate can result in union members being demobilized, thereby restricting alternative courses of action. Central to the analysis are understandings of the ways information, in the form of rumour and through more formal channels, flows between management, union and the membership/workforce.</p>

<p>The experience of redundancy in modern capitalist society is experienced in sharp and sobering ways. Not only do individual workers suffer the harshness of redundancy, the community as a whole also lives through the economic and social consequences of such events. Some aspects of this experience are well documented, but often overlooked is a consideration of the immediate impact of the notice of redundancies and closure, and, in particular, the responses of individuals and unions to redundancy announcements (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11425542">Waddington et al., 1994</xref>). For unions and their members, the announcement of redundancy is challenging. Members usually turn to their union for support and ways of dealing with these announcements, whereas for union representatives the question becomes how to meet the challenge of such announcements.</p>
<p>We explore these themes, with reference to redundancy announcements, focusing on management and trade unions. The argument is that management often seeks to destabilize collective responses by unions, while the way trade unions organize and operate can result in union’s struggling to exploit their power resources and strategic capabilities. We suggest that where trade unions organize in hierarchical rather than participative ways and where union leaders operate in disconnected ways from the membership, it becomes difficult to generate collective responses to redundancy events (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray, 2010a</xref>). Principally, our analysis focuses on and questions the absence of a sustained collective response by unions to the announcements of plant closure. Central to this analysis is an examination of the way information, in the form of rumour and through more formal channels, flows between management, the union(s) and the membership/workforce.</p>
<p>In 2001, the steel producer Corus (now part of the Tata group) announced the complete closure and partial closure of two plants in South Wales, United Kingdom. A short time before, a German company, ThyssenKrupp Stahl, announced the partial closure of a steel plant in Terni, Italy. The focus in this article is principally on the events in South Wales, but the events in Terni provide a baseline reference for the overall analysis of South Wales. We draw on these two events to examine the way collective responses are shaped when redundancy announcements are made, drawing attention to the part played by management and the place of trade unions in such processes. The data come from research conducted over a seven-year period from the 2001 announcement until 2008.</p>
<sec id="section1-0143831X11425542">
<title>Debates</title>
<p>There is a significant and diverse array of literature on redundancy, the majority of which contributes to understandings of the post-redundancy period. Much of this literature is concerned with the outcomes of redundancy decisions, particularly in relation to the local economy and labour markets, the specific experiences of those made redundant and the wider implications for communities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11425542">Henderson and Shutt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11425542">Westergaard et al., 1989</xref>). Others address the spatial and longer-term impacts of closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11425542">Chapain and Murie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11425542">Pike, 2005</xref>). There is, however, little consideration of activity prior to and during redundancy events; usually the focus is on the context and process of decision-making that led to redundancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11425542">Cameron, 1994</xref>). A related focus is on the mode and timing of announcements and the management of the redundancy process (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11425542">Donnelly and Scolarios, 1998</xref>), and, in this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11425542">Forde et al. (2009</xref>: 5–7) have recently discussed the possibility of ‘socially responsible restructuring’.</p>
<p>The ‘redundancy’ question this article seeks to address is one of union strategy in response to management decisions on plant closure, with a particular emphasis on the way unions organize and operate. The precise focus is on the union’s organizational form and, more specifically, the structure of its internal relationships to build collective organization and advance member interests. We explore the development and promotion of mutual support between different levels of union members and leaders as they attempt to tackle events within and beyond the workplace (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11425542">Fairbrother, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X11425542">Heery, 2002</xref>). When a redundancy decision is made a union might challenge corporate decisions (via campaigns, lobbying, rallies, demonstrations and other substantive and symbolic acts), or it might ensure a beneficial settlement for workers and an orderly departure of the workforce from the plant. Of course, in practice, matters play out in more nuanced ways, but our claim is that central to this process is the way unions locally, and beyond the plant, organize in an integrated or disaggregated way and operate participatively or more hierarchically (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11425542">Batstone et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11425542">Fairbrother et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref> on these themes).</p>
<p>Redundancy announcements take place against a background of qualified collective forms of employment relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X11425542">Brown et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11425542">Smith and Morton, 2006</xref>), which has implications for the way unions respond to such events. For example, over the past 25 years, legislation in the UK has clearly shifted towards neutralizing collective responses and limiting the scope for unions to develop repertories of collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11425542">Hall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray, 2010a</xref>), particularly when compared with other European Union (EU) member states (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11425542">Hall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11425542">Hall and Edwards, 1999</xref>). Indeed, the ‘newly global character of production and consumption’, which is premised on neoliberal discourses of competition and free markets, means that nation-states and supranational organizations seek to insulate employers from domestic political pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref>: 39–42). The outcome is that after decades of consolidation and expansion, many trade unions face declining memberships, increasingly resistant if not hostile employers and a difficult (global) organizing terrain (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11425542">Hyman, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11425542">2007</xref>). It is against this background that our analysis develops understandings of the place of trade unions in relation to redundancy events; particularly the way they organize and operate, and develop their capacities to deal with these situations (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11425542">Fairbrother et al., 2007</xref>: 43–7).</p>
<p>The overarching proposition is that an explanation of these processes requires an assessment of union power resources and the strategic capabilities that are central to capacity building in the context of the current global economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray, 2010a</xref>: 333; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref>). This type of analysis rests on three levers of power: agenda (or ‘proactivity’ and the ability of unions to shape and/or frame an agenda to defend workers and challenge employers), internal solidarity (the level of democracy and cohesion in the local union) and external solidarity (the level to which alliances and articulation can be formed within the larger union, between unions and with the community). Union responses to major events such as closure announcements or redundancies provide an opportunity for a more general reflection on trade union ‘power resources and [their] strategic capabilities [which are] central to union capacity building’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray, 2010a</xref>: 333). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray (2010a</xref>: 333) suggest that the strategic capabilities of ‘intermediating between contending interests to foster collaborative action and to activate networks; framing; articulating actions over time and space; and learning’ are important in such considerations.</p>
<p>In developing our analysis we focus on the interrelationship between managerial strategies and union capacities. Clearly, in redundancy situations, managements attempt to set the scene for union responses to redundancy by deliberately framing the surrounding events as inevitable, controlling information and implementing decisions with an emphasis and focus on individualized work relations and employment outcomes (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11425542">Forde et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11425542">Hopkins and Hopkins, 1999</xref>). Such ‘inevitability’ is reinforced by the globalization of (steel) markets and integration of ownership, which has the potential to render collective action (through the union and local community) as seemingly futile. Complementing this aspect, union leaderships and their memberships attempt to address such events by focusing on and shaping (and framing) union responses. First, it is necessary to consider the utilization of power resources, i.e. how strategic capabilities might challenge such processes (and, indeed, to consider what the union form means for strategic capabilities). A second, related, and more specific consideration is that union organization may be multi-layered, with mediated links from one level of organization to another or they may be participative and engaged (formulating alternative plans and actively campaigning against closure, via rallies and boycotts). Organizational structures that connect directly with the membership and also facilitate the flow of information may become decisive. Misinformation and rumour-mongering can counteract the ability of unions to engage members in collective action, particularly where managers play on worker insecurities and the apparent hopelessness of the corporate situation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11425542">Forde et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11425542">Hopkins and Hopkins, 1999</xref>). The question is what are the processes at work in these types of situations?</p>
<p>Our analysis is set out and discussed across five sections. First, we detail the closure decisions made by Corus plc in relation to steel plants across the UK in 2001. We also outline union responses and approaches in Italy to the steel producer ThyssenKrupp Stahl’s efforts to partially close the Terni plant in 2005. The aim is not to provide a detailed national comparative framework, but to provide a contemporaneous and sector-specific point of comparison so as to analyse the particular strategies that might be deployed. Second, we outline the research programme. We then discuss the data focusing on the redundancy announcements, the trade union responses and the effects of rumour. Here we lay the foundations to the argument that unless unions revisit their capacities and capabilities across the various levels of organization, the likely outcome is an individualized and relatively acquiescent response to redundancy announcements. The article closes with a discussion and conclusion.</p>

<title>Events</title>
<p>The European steel industry has a long history of restructuring and reorganization. One outcome is a much reduced steel workforce, which has resulted, in part, from a series of plant closures and mass redundancies. The European steel unions have dealt with successive rounds of managerial announcements, particularly from the early 1980s onwards, about company reorganization, often involving redundancy announcements. Unions respond to such announcements in different ways, but the question is, what shapes their choices? Mergers often provide the occasion for company reorganization, which may lead to redundancy programmes, as companies reposition parts of their organization. In 1997, a German company, ThyssenKrupp Stahl (TKS) was formed following a merger of the German companies Krupp-Hoesch AG and Thyssen Stahl AG. Before this merger, in 1994, Krupp-Hoesch AG acquired a large steel plant in Terni, Umbria, in Italy, until then owned by Acciai Speciali Terni (AST). With the subsequent merger, creating ThyssenKrupp AG, the plant became part of this major German steel company. Two years later, in 1999, British Steel plc and the Dutch steel producer Koninklijke Hoogovens merged to form Corus plc. While the Dutch company had one principal steel manufacturing site, British Steel plc had a large number including the Ebbw Vale plant and Llanwern, both in South Wales. Subsequent to the mergers, these two multinational steel companies implemented redundancy programmes, addressed by unions in each company in different ways.</p>
<p>In Italy, when AST was acquired by Krupp-Hoesch AG the parent company embarked on a 10-year investment programme, which initially was continued by TKS. This programme was, however, modified when TKS began a Europe-wide reorganization of its establishments, creating a divisional structure, focused on products and process. Over 4000 employees worked at the Terni plant in 2002, with an average age of 48 years. Up until the early 2000s there had been little recruitment into the plant, but an increasing number of older workers began to leave following the implementation of legislation relating to workers’ exposure to asbestos. One outcome was that by 2004, 650 young replacement workers were employed on fixed-term contracts. Three main union confederations, Federazione impiegati operai metallurgica (FIOM), Federazione Italiana Metalmeccanici (FIM) and Unione Italiana Lavaratori Metal meccanici (UILM), represented the steel plant workforce, in three local branches. A joint union committee, with close links with local political organizations at a city and regional level, represented the workforce and dealt with the plant management. In turn, the committee was represented by regional union officials on the company Supervisory Board in Germany at the company head office. With the changing age composition in the plant, by 2004, young staff led two of the three plant unions, with the two senior representatives both 31 years of age. These young leaders questioned past practices, and expressed concern about the relative insecurity of the 650 young recruits into the plant, on fixed-term contracts.</p>
<p>In 2003, as part of the divisional review, TKS proposed transferring the production of 150,000 tons per year of low-grade electrical steel from Terni to other steelworks, as well as ending the production of specified high-grade steels. Following the formal announcement of this decision on 24 January 2004, the plant unions, organized and coordinated by the joint union works committee, initiated a strike, accompanied by road blockades, demonstrations and rallies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11425542">Fairbrother et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11425542">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2009</xref>). These strikes, blockades and rallies led to a partial success in relation to the number of redundancies, the movement of the 650 fixed-term workers to permanent contracts and a revitalization of the union at the local level (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11425542">Fairbrother et al., 2007</xref>: 43–7; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11425542">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2009</xref>). This local activity was accompanied by multi-level lobbying, negotiation and petitioning at a national level and internationally, with the parent company. Of note, the local Italian leadership was able to draw common cause with the local population of Terni. The unions were able to draw on their capacities internally by building an effective representative structure in the form of a works committee, while reaching out to the local residents and municipal leaders and thereby exercising leverage via external relationships in the political arena.</p>
<p>Complicating this process was the way unions in this industry tend to organize hierarchically, often with regional, national and international union representatives acting in relatively autonomous ways. In this case, the union form of representation beyond the plant was weakened by a structural fragmentation, which meant the plant union membership had no direct and accountable voice at the corporate level. The Terni plant had one workers’ representative from Italy on the Supervisory Board located in Duisberg, Germany, drawn from the municipal union leadership rather than the plant itself. Thus, this representative spoke on behalf of the plant membership, with no direct accountability to that membership. Second, initially, the European Metalworkers Federation (EMF) and the German steel union, Industriegewerkschaft Metall (IG Metall), did not oppose the company decision. However, after a key local union member and leading expert on the steel industry intervened and made the case for opposition, these two union bodies supported and responded to the joint union committee (interviews: expert advisor to the union committee, 11 May 2005 and senior leader, EMF, 9 November 2005).</p>
<p>This local union committee had the capacity to counter these setbacks by embedding the dispute as a locality-based and focused dispute. The outcome was that Terni remained operational and continued to produce high quality grain oriented electrical (stainless) steel products, employing in the region of 3000 workers. These locally based and focused unions demonstrated the capacity and organizational focus to develop an interventionist response, capitalizing on a sense of injustice and concern about jobs and future employment. But, such a sequence of events rests on the capacities that are exercised by unions. The aim in what follows is to explore union responses to similar events in the UK at the Corus plants of Ebbw Vale and Llanwern.</p>
<p>After the merger that created Corus plc, in 2001, the company announced a series of redundancies in February 2001. This decision was part of a company review aimed at securing new synergies between the UK and the Netherlands; it resulted in a broad reconfiguration of the company and a wide range of closures and staff reductions. At that time, the company had 64,900 employees across the world, including 32,800 in the UK and 12,900 in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11425542">Corus, 2000</xref>). Relatively soon after the merger, the company announced that the number of UK employees would be reduced to 22,000 by 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X11425542">Corus, 2001</xref>: 5). Corus has since been acquired by the Indian conglomerate Tata (in 2007), and further job losses have followed (in South Wales, e.g. Trostre and Shotton, and other parts of the UK, e.g. Teeside).</p>
<p>Following a first wave of 1561 job losses during 2000 at Corus plants in Port Talbot, Llanwern and Ebbw Vale, on 1 February 2001 the company announced that further restructuring would occur, involving the loss of 6000 jobs in the UK. Approximately 3000 jobs were to end in Wales with the cessation of steel-making at Llanwern (despite a long anticipated announcement to reline a blast furnace), the closure of the Bryngwyn and Ebbw Vale sites and reduced activity at the Shotton Works. Ebbw Vale and Llanwern took the brunt of redundancies. Both plants had long histories, with Ebbw Vale effectively dating from the mid-1930s and Llanwern from the 1960s, and had experienced significant processes of restructuring. In the 1990s, teamwork and related work arrangements were introduced in both plants, qualifying the hierarchical and traditional forms of work organization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11425542">Bacon and Blyton, 2000</xref>). Each workforce was highly unionized, although as with many unions in the 1980s and 1990s, these unions had shifted towards more localized forms of bargaining (away from national bargaining); national corporate policies were implemented plant by plant, accompanied by the promotion of inter-plant comparison, if not competition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11425542">Blyton and Turnbull, 2004</xref>). With no less profound consequences, the company had moved towards individualized forms of corporate communication and announcement, via local managers and team leaders.</p>
<p>Ebbw Vale is the main town in the county of Blaenau Gwent, situated in the South Wales Valleys region and displays all the characteristics of a depressed local economy. Indeed, the South Wales Valleys region receives Objective One funding (EU funding) and has been the focus for numerous regeneration activities following the contraction of the coal industry. Of note, is the mineworkers’ strike of 1984–5, which had huge repercussions for the area and contextualizes further the actions of the community and unions in response to the Corus announcements. The actual closure of the Ebbw Vale plant was in two stages, with half the near 900 workforce leaving just a few weeks after confirmation of the closure, in July 2001. The remainder departed when the plant finally closed in July 2002. A small section of the workforce remained on site between July 2002 and February 2003 to organize and carry out its decommissioning. Llanwern is located in Newport, the third largest city in Wales and the hub of a much larger area with a relatively buoyant economy. Steel-making at Llanwern ended with the closure of the ‘heavy end’ (i.e. steel-making) on the 30 June 2001, with an estimated 1300 jobs going in July 2001 and others following as the close-down proceeded. The hot and cold rolling mills remain in operation employing approximately 1600 people, despite a brief period of ‘mothballing’ (i.e. where a production facility is retained although not used) in 2009.</p>
<p>The puzzle is why the response to these announcements was relatively muted in South Wales. To explore this conundrum, our approach is a detailed study of the two plants, focusing on the management approach in the plants as well as a close examination of the unions in both plants, and beyond.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0143831X11425542">
<title>The research</title>
<p>Following the announcement of the closures, the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG) requested that the decision be investigated and research undertaken on the impact of the redundancies. The data from that programme of research inform our main arguments and analysis. The data-set is small, but is indicative and captures in decisive ways the reactions, responses and frustrations of those caught up in the redundancy process – painting a picture of one particular dispute and the forms of engagement between management, union and the membership. This data-set is complemented by further sets of interviews conducted with workers between 2004 and 2008. The result is a focused longitudinal study of mass redundancy.</p>
<p>The first part of the research was conducted in two stages. First, the process of corporate announcement and the implementation of these policies in the South Wales steel industry was analysed, focusing on the possible impacts for Wales. One of the principal investigators presented the findings to a WAG working party and attended two meetings of the All-Wales Steel Task Force on the decisions by Corus plc, which focused on the crisis in the industry and looked at key measures to aid the worst affected communities. This stage was followed by a detailed study of the occupational structure of the steel industry in the two steel plants, and a small interview-based study in 2002 and 2003 of 20 ex-steelworkers from each plant. These were complemented by a total of eight interviews with union officers and leaders. Forty-eight interviews were conducted in total. The majority of steelworker interviewees were identified through Job Centre Plus (the leading public support agency) and contacted by letter requesting permission to interview. Eight in Ebbw Vale were identified through a local resource centre. Interviews were semi-structured and based around a set of themes designed to explore the processes and experiences of redundancy.</p>
<p>The second data-set is drawn from a focused study of the post-redundancy situation, focusing specifically on Ebbw Vale. The project investigated how a close-knit community deals with the closure of the main employer and how workers who had secure ‘jobs for life’ reposition themselves. It involved re-interviewing 11 (male) workers from the project outlined above, and another nine (male) interviewed for the first time. Also interviewed for the first time were 10 women who were either partners of the workers interviewed or single mature women living in the area. Ten young people (five male and five female) were also interviewed. A total of 40 interviews were carried out to a similar format as above. Here we only report on the workers’ interviews, thereby developing a longitudinal continuity.</p>
<p>The workers interviewed were ‘traditional’ steelworkers. They were all male, specifically skilled and drawn from generations of families living local to the plant. Most workers entered employment in the steel plants as young recruits, usually straight from school. They received some training, but in many cases did not have transferable qualifications and were skilled by experience. Union membership was high (over 90 percent) and all but two of the ex-steelworkers interviewed in the first project were members of trade unions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11425542">Table 1</xref>). Around a third of the workforce at each plant was under 36 years of age and nearly a third over 45, with the remaining third in the 36–45 age-band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X11425542">Corus, 2001</xref>).

<title>Responding to redundancy</title>
<p>The redundancy announcements were greeted with much anger by the main unions: the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation (ISTC, now Community), as well as the Transport and General Workers’ Union (TGWU) and AMICUS (both now comprising Unite, the union). With the backing of the Wales and UK governments, these unions secured a moratorium so that alternative plans could be explored, including the possible sale of the closed plants. However, on 3 May 2001, with the rejection of these proposals, the company confirmed the closures and redundancies.</p>
<p>In what follows we discuss the redundancy announcements, the union response, critical to which is an understanding of the union form of organization and representation, and provide an account of the way information (and the way it flows) shapes worker and union responses to such events. In particular, we discuss the way rumour underwrote a decollectivization of the workforce, transforming it from a cohesive and collectivized set of workers to an anxious workforce, fearful that ‘the axe was going to fall’ (team leader, Ebbw Vale, 2002). We suggest that corporate management did not act to dispel rumours and the unions were seemingly unable to facilitate flows of information and counter rumour because of the way they organized and operated.</p>
<sec id="section5-0143831X11425542">
<title>The announcement</title>
<p>At Ebbw Vale, the announcement of closure came in two steps. First, on the morning of the announcement, the Works Council trade union side was called in to meet with both the plant management and senior managers from the head office, although no mention was made of the forthcoming announcement when notice of the meeting was given. At this meeting, management made the announcement of total closure to the union representatives. It was explained that the redundancies would be staggered and that managers would inform the workforce at the general meeting, scheduled to take place immediately after the Works Council. Further, management tried to insist that trade union representatives remain behind ‘to clarify points’ and not attend the general meeting. While the representatives refused to agree to this ‘demand’, they had no chance to discuss, plan and thus lead discussion and counter the announcements at the general meeting.</p>
<p>The second step was the general meeting. Here, the management sat on a podium and the senior national management made a formal announcement of the closure. The management approach to the announcement gave the workforce little time to take it all in:
<disp-quote>
<p>A lot of people were totally gutted and they asked a few questions but they [the company] didn’t take a lot of questions. . . . He [the senior management representative] said ‘I am shutting you’, and he finished. (Ex-union convenor, Ebbw Vale, 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As the manager turned away, he was spoken to by another manager and turned back to state:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Oh, I forgot to tell you that by the way we are taking one of your units away to put in another plant’ which sort of kicks you in the balls. (Ex-union convenor, Ebbw Vale, 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The particular production line in question was regarded by the workforce as the core of the plant, and the nature of the announcement of its removal to another plant was seen as a further illustration of the careless way the managers dealt with workers.</p>
<p>At Llanwern, this process of disaggregation was furthered by the method of announcement, made by managers in different parts of the plant:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . an announcement came out then, following the rumours, internally, by email and the manager for the two departments . . . gave the official version, gave his interpretation of it . . . (Technologist, Llanwern, 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As with Ebbw Vale, management from outside the area made the formal announcements. This contributed to the belief that while plant management may have known of the decision at an earlier date, it was still the case that the decision was taken outside the plant and any hostile reaction was at first aimed at those having ‘made’ the decision. This process of announcement deflected attention away from the local plant management, and those who would work closely with the redundant workers during the closure process.</p>
<p>There is no question that the announcements at both plants were coordinated by management, and that they took place within a wider context of rumour and speculation as to the future of each plant. Further, the unions struggled to challenge the rumours, which we argue in the following sections resulted from fragmented and hierarchical forms of union organization within these plants and beyond. It would also seem that the manner of the announcements neutralized immediate union leadership responses within each plant, perhaps with the intention of undermining the union in front of its membership and forcing it onto the back-foot as it attempted to organize a response. The trade unions at each plant learnt of the closures just before the workforce, although some did not learn of the announcements via formal contact with the company:
<disp-quote>
<p>On the radio . . . Corus made it crafty the way that they dealt with all these redundancies because the year before we had also had another round of redundancies . . . in exactly the same way. They literally [announced it at] 8.00 one morning. Then announce it to the city on a Friday, always on a Friday: Eight o’clock Friday morning. Turn the radio on: Corus have announced 6000 job cuts. (Regional union official 1, ISTC [Community], 2003)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Claims of ‘wrong-footing’ the unions would of course be disputed by management, and we have no direct evidence that this was their aim. However, as it was, the manner of the announcements made it difficult for the unions on site to develop a coordinated response (locally, regionally or nationally), such as a walk-out, a demonstrative rally or other such symbolic act.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0143831X11425542">
<title>Union responses and initiatives</title>
<p>The way unions address the announcement and implementation of redundancy proposals is critical for the outcome. In this case, we argue that the union responses were fragmented, which seemingly facilitated the redundancy process; that is to say that the response was uncoordinated and played out at each level of the union hierarchy, rather than in more structured and coherent ways. Principally, the unions became involved in three main levels of activity:</p>
<list id="list1-0143831X11425542" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>At a national level, via the National Steel Co-ordinating Committee (NSCC);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At a plant/local level; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A more discursive involvement by national and regional officers and, on occasion, local leaders in the All-Wales Steel Task Force.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Union representatives at each level dealt with one aspect of the redundancy proposal and programme and not with the event as a whole, and each plant ‘union’ operated independently of each other and maintained a site-wide and local coherence of response. Local representatives sought agreements on the orderly departure of redundant workers, while the regional representatives tried to coordinate the responses of the different plants, playing their part in the All-Wales Steel Task Force and petitioning the WAG. The national leadership, meanwhile, dealt with the corporate management and the government. The NSCC pushed for and secured a moratorium on the implementation of the proposals so that it could draw up alternative plans, nationally and plant by plant. These plans comprised detailed proposals for continuing production and proposals to delay the closure in the expectation that the market would begin to improve.</p>
<p>The divisions of responsibility that had become a key part of the way the steel unions organized and operated meant that different layers of union leadership dealt with different parts of the campaign in relation to the redundancy programme, undermining organizational and strategy questions, and, as such, the wider realization of their capacities in relation to internal solidarity, external solidarity and proactive initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11425542">2010a</xref>). The overall response was fragmented organizationally, at the plant, regionally and nationally. This layered response involved increasingly uneasy relations between members and their union leaders, at each level. There was little opportunity for the members to influence their leaderships and mould a collective response, involving both members and leaders. Clearly, at the base, members expressed sceptical views of their union leaders, whether at local, regional or national levels. In some cases workers’ views of the union were openly hostile:
<disp-quote>
<p>Not at all helpful, I am afraid our official, our [local] trade union official, she is there for the glorification of herself . . . I think that it [the union locally] is a waste of space. (Manager accounts, Llanwern, 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>More generally, members became disengaged. There was little prospect of generating alternative forms of collective action other than those proposed by the trade union. The union form undermined the possibility of aggressive and focused collective responses. Indeed, there was a general sense of resignation. Over time, union members at both plants developed a view that union leaders were supportive, but not particularly active:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . over the years, . . . they [the local union leaders] lost their way. . . . Well not lost their way . . . they are supportive, but I think that when everything was going so well they were working more together with management. . . . Yes I think that they worked more to keep everything together and keep it all going rather than being objectionable as they had been previously. Then in recent years they got a lot quieter and I think that a lot of us were brainwashed into thinking that something was going to close anyway and there was nothing that nobody could do about it. (Team member, Llanwern, 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While not blaming the union for the redundancies there was disappointment in the trade unions’ seeming inability to tackle the situation more convincingly. Members at both plants stressed the importance of developing alternatives to closure and redundancy, but the steps taken by the union leaderships did not reassure the membership as a whole – although local leaders were supportive of individual workers.</p>
<p>At the local level, the leaders sought to promote an orderly response, first of all developing local plans to counter the redundancy proposals and then to facilitate the closures. In the initial stages following the announcement, each of these local leaderships took steps to develop a plan to rescue the plant in Ebbw Vale, as well as counter the proposals to close the heavy end at Llanwern. While this was part of a concerted national effort (led by the NSCC) involving all the unions, it was played out in particular ways at the two sites. The Ebbw Vale plant union leadership, for example, developed a rescue plan, met with national leaders, met the then prime minister and presented the Ebbw Vale proposals to the Corus chief executive. The three senior Ebbw Vale leaders went to one of the union head offices to review the plans:
<disp-quote>
<p>So we met up there [London], expecting to see this lovely impressive booklet for presentation. But all we found is that they just stapled everybody’s side of the plan together, they hadn’t even changed the pages! (Senior union representative, Ebbw Vale, February 2003)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>They realized that the time preparing their part of the alternative plan, while dealt with at some length by Corus management, was a non-starter:
<disp-quote>
<p>There was no demonstration. There was no objection. . . . Although we put alternative plans together we knew . . . [that] you cannot consult after the event. They [the company] told us we were closed. They [the union] told us to go away and fight it. Well you can’t. We knew that was the case. So whereas if you had a strike or where you had a Longbridge situation where the whole community is out in one . . . (Ex-senior union representative, Ebbw Vale, September 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, while told to ‘fight’ the decision by the union leadership, for many trade unionists and members it would seem alternative forms of action were effectively closed off. In managing the closure, there were none of the activities that could begin to draw union members into a collective response together with others in the community.</p>
<p>This is not to say that local leaderships failed to promote and engage in collective action, but to say they did so in particular ways. Indeed, rather than challenge the corporate decision, the leaders’ reactions to events generated a fairly passive set of union responses. This became evident, for example, from our observations of (local and national) union engagement in the All-Wales Steel Task Force. Within this forum the unions debated the redundancy proposals and discussed policy development with the employers and WAG. It became clear, however, that the meetings became a way of securing union compliance towards promoting an orderly departure of workers (observation of All-Wales Steel Task Force meetings, 2001). While individual union leaders, and particularly those national leaders who had frequent engagement with plant union activists via education programmes, challenged the corporate decision, other participants, from government and public agencies, appeared concerned with an orderly and regulated departure from the two sites. In such circumstances, it would seem that while local leaderships worked to develop an alternative plan to closure, there was little wider support. All that was left for the local leaderships to do was to participate in negotiations with the local management about the detail and approach to local redundancies, help organize retraining for many of the ‘redundant’ staff and provide informal support to members.</p>
<p>On a number of occasions local leaders and their members met to discuss the developments, to receive company reports and announcements, and in the case of Ebbw Vale to celebrate the plant, and its demise. In Ebbw Vale, more so than Llanwern, there were frequent meetings between the local union leaders and the leaders of the local authority, but these focused simply on exchanges of information. Unions also engaged in intense face-to-face support of redundant workers and their families:
<disp-quote>
<p>[We would] walk the streets, [have] question and answer sessions. We stood in front of groups of people and ran question and answer sessions in the room, and at every question and answer session at the start and at the end we would reiterate, ‘if you are an individual that’s got a problem, knock on the door’. (Senior union representative, Ebbw Vale, February 2003)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such community union practice involved all six senior representatives on site at the Ebbw Vale plant and their counterparts at the Llanwern site. At Ebbw Vale, in the context of closure, the representatives claimed that they saw every one of the 400 staff scheduled for departure in the second phase of the redundancy. These collective acts focused and shaped the union responses to the announcements and, in this respect, the union campaign might be viewed as ‘constitutional’, as opposed to ‘community based’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11425542">Danford et al., 2003</xref>: 78–9). These trade unions confined themselves to working largely within the official union machinery and parliamentary lobbying (through sponsored MPs, etc.), rather than develop a community-based campaign that included extra-parliamentary activity, local demonstrations and anti-corporate campaigning.</p>

<title>The ‘rumour mill’</title>
<p>What foreshadowed the announcement and the union response that followed was a great deal of speculation, uncertainty and anxiety with mixed messages given out by the senior local managers, as well as by section managers. This process trapped the local trade union leaders in specific ways, and stemmed, in part, from the organization of worker representation. The member–representative ratio in both plants was above the national average of 53:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11425542">Cully et al., 1999</xref>) and each plant was organized via a Works Union Committee (WUC), made up of the recognized unions. Representation was, however, hierarchically organized, with the committee taking precedence over steward-based forms of representation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11425542">Danford et al., 2003</xref>: 50–1). The point to note is that hierarchy, as indicated in the earlier section, with its implicit delegation of responsibilities, meant that information did not flow easily up or down; particularly the detailed briefings that would allow union representatives within the plant or in the London headquarters to respond in cogent ways to counter what had become situated and particular rumours. While local leaders (convenors and senior representatives) received information from the regional and national union leaders, they were not in a position to counter localized rumours with informed accounts of corporate plans. Although a number of union leaders were members of the Works Council for each plant, they lacked hard evidence of the impending announcements. As with the workforce at large, they could only ‘speculate’, thereby adding to the ‘rumour mill’.</p>
<p>Information, and the timing and methods of its dissemination, is frequently subject to a series of filters that both differentiate the relevance of information and help shape expectations. Whether this is through internal processes or by other means (for example, unions, local or national media), it is the management that chooses what information to disclose, when and to whom (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11425542">Forde et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11425542">Hopkins and Hopkins, 1999</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t really think we had an indication to be honest [of the plant closure], I mean, you all know that, I mean, you listen on the television, your bosses, your immediate bosses tell you things that aren’t looking good, your outlook is not as good as it was, I think, I think, the people . . . expected some sort of announcement about it . . . I mean, even chopping little bits of it off [the plant], which is obviously what they’ve done over the years . . . (Electrician, Ebbw Vale, 2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This ex-steelworker went on to illustrate how a more comprehensive understanding is developed via rumour:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, when, they keep chipping away, then at the time, you realize that something, something’s going to happen at the end of the day and err, they were all, there were lots of rumours and that Trostre [another steel plant] was going to be the place to work because it was near the coast and all, and it was an awkward place where we were situated, the transport costs and all this. So in the end, the rumours came through. We had a big meeting with the managers and the director at the time. I can’t remember what his name was now, but he said the worst news you could imagine, that we were closing in 2002 . . . (Electrician, Ebbw Vale, 2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At Llanwern, it was accepted that ‘redundancy’ could happen, but there was still a sense that ‘it wouldn’t happen to me’. The rumour mill fed a false hope that Llanwern was secure. In particular, this speculation was built around the Corus announcement that the blast furnace at Llanwern was to be refurbished. It was alleged that the company never intended to reline the blast furnace, but maintained the pretence and ‘misled everyone because skilled workers would have just left’ (mechanical engineer, Llanwern, 2002). Others believed the whole plant would close, indicating the uncertainty about what was really going to happen:
<disp-quote>
<p>I thought yes, it was a shock because I thought they’d be cutting us back again. Because the thing about it is it all runs on rumours . . . I think you hear rumours that all Llanwern was going and . . . but it didn’t. (Fitter, Llanwern, 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, at Ebbw Vale, the announcement was also preceded by speculation and rumour about the options for the plant. Ebbw Vale had long suffered the consequences of coal closures and steel cut-backs, which contributed much uncertainty about the future:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . we were punch drunk in Ebbw Vale for years and years because we never knew when the axe was going to fall. (Team leader, Ebbw Vale, 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite this period, few appeared to have anticipated total closure. With each announcement those remaining ‘sighed with relief and thought “thank god it wasn’t me”’ (team leader, Ebbw Vale, 2002). Clearly evident from these statements is that among the respective workforces there was much speculation about the future of the plants. More particularly, the information (or rumours) circulating kept ‘chipping away’ seemingly eroding workers’ confidence.</p>
<p>The problem for the workforces was that the unions seemed unable to counteract or deal directly with the rumours and dispel them. Indeed, our contention is that the organization of the union within both plants <italic>contributed</italic> to the disaggregated way that employees anticipated the announcements. For example, the main union at the Llanwern site, the ISTC, had a fragmented form of representation, with each area having its own branch. These branches were organized under the remit of a joint branch union committee, which in turn had representation on the WUC, the site-wide committee. The WUC spoke on behalf of the workforce, via meetings and report-backs, but this fragmented and hierarchical form of union organization and representation seemingly struggled to challenge the rumours (on these organizational questions and dilemmas, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11425542">Hyman, 1979</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0143831X11425542">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Two strands of analysis enable us to explain the processes at work. First, local steel managers were in a position to frame the redundancy prospect in terms of inevitability and the needs of the global company operating in an international market. Second, the unions were characterized by particular conceptions of leadership and workplace representation, which meant they were unable to exercise the degree of autonomy and independence of action that has been evident elsewhere (in Terni, Italy, for example, in 2003–4). In theory, the union form of organization and representation allows unions to act in multi-level relationships, articulating concerns and challenging corporate decisions, but in practice the different levels of union organization failed to work in tandem to effectively challenge management decisions. The different components of the union leadership were unable to build either an internal solidarity between local and national leaders or an external solidarity between the local membership and the residents and others in the locality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11425542">2010a</xref>). The outcome was that the local leaders had few resources to deploy in opposition to the announcements.</p>
<p>Thus, the first analytic point is that employers can set the agenda for workforce participation and involvement with unions in seemingly determinate ways. In this situation, employees, and by definition workers, are collectively organized by employers and unions often find themselves in situations where they respond to events, rather than shape them in proactive ways (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11425542">Müller-Jentsch, 1985</xref>). Certainly, it was difficult for the unions to organize and focus their response to the redundancy events detailed here, especially since robust information was difficult to obtain. The question remains however, why do some unions mobilize in active ways, via, for example, more militant forms of engagement and action (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11425542">Fairbrother et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143831X11425542">Turnbull, 2009</xref>), and others struggle to respond in meaningful ways to the worst excesses of management decisions? It would seem that the answer to the question lies in the degree to which the union can establish itself as an independent and autonomous organization, based on the employment relation but not determined by it.</p>
<p>Work and employment in the steel industry has a strong collective dimension to it, reflected through work organization, the construction of managerial hierarchies, the regulation of employment procedures, and grounded in the histories of many in the locality. The European steel industry, and the Corus plants in particular, had qualified previous forms of work organization, via the introduction of teamwork and related group forms of organization. Such collective forms of work organization lay the foundations for collective experiences, complemented by the traditions of community life in an area, where most steelworkers grow up together and are employed at plants for most of their working lives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11425542">Hudson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143831X11425542">MacKenzie et al., 2006</xref>). It could be argued that local union leaderships in Ebbw Vale and Llanwern should have exploited such capacity, to focus these experiences in more robust and challenging ways (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11425542">Danford et al., 2003</xref>: 43–69; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11425542">Fairbrother et al., 2007</xref>: 43–7). Clearly, this did not happen, but why? We suggest that the weakness of response was shaped in two ways: first, rumour, speculation and management’s framing of events made them seem inevitable; and, second, and relatedly, through the ways union leaderships and their memberships organized and operated. Together, these two aspects undermined the ‘deliberative vitality’ of the union, involving debate, engagement and confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>For many workers the key mechanism for learning of management plans and their prospects is the workplace ‘grapevine’. In the micro-politics of power, the grapevine and rumour is a form of information that establishes distance from fact, situating it within the ‘compass of falsehood or of political propaganda’, but which nonetheless operates as a ‘political resource within the interactions, the discourse, the conversations of a social group within limited boundaries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143831X11425542">Taïeb, 2007</xref>: 110–16; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11425542">Fine, 2005</xref>). In this sense there is a ‘political’ purpose to rumour, or rumour with political purpose, which can be used to particular effect and which companies/management might exploit in particular ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11425542">Hopkins and Hopkins (1999)</xref> cite numerous examples where rumour has been employed for strategic advantage by employers during downsizing situations. There is, however, no direct evidence that ‘rumour’ was deliberately employed by management in this case to disorientate the union. Nonetheless, intentionally or not, managers clearly framed the events so that redundancy was expected and seen as unavoidable by the workforce (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11425542">Forde et al., 2009</xref>, who comment in similar terms on these same events). The company did little to dispel the rumour mill that developed out of the merger and the review of corporate strategy that followed.</p>
<p>Of course, an effective and relatively independent local leadership can counter such framing of corporate decisions, especially when supported by regional and national leaderships. Indeed, the Terni case demonstrates this process very clearly, and reinforces an analysis that emphasizes the centrality of local activism for union effectiveness. In this case the local leaders in 2004 had been in office a short time, having replaced an older generation of leaders. They worked hard to build an engaged form of unionism in the plant that brought younger and more recent workers into the collective forums that defined the union. These leaders dealt with worker grievances and built an outward looking and active internal solidarity within the union. From this relative position of strength the local leadership was able to frame the redundancy announcements as arbitrary, vindictive and without just foundation. The leadership was thus able to reach out to local residents and their municipal leaders as well as secure the support of the national Italian union leaderships. Crucially, however, this local leadership remained in the lead position in relation to the way they organized the response to the announcements. This arrangement was critical in relation to the head office of TKS, so that this active local leadership was successful in ensuring that decisions were made with them and not at the behest of more remote and disengaged regional or national union leaderships. A platform was thus provided to secure the intervention of the EMF in the dispute. All this was made possible because the local leadership promoted a collective form of grounded leadership that was able to frame the issue in ways that resonated with other actors, within the union and beyond.</p>
<p>To achieve the autonomy and independence of action required necessitates both an active and outward looking leadership and a membership that is defined by solidaristic concerns rather than individualistic ones. The second analytical point thus concerns the ability and potential of union memberships to exploit their collective capacities. In South Wales the union responses were limited by the hierarchical and fragmented ways in which they were organized. While acknowledging that hierarchy does not necessarily preclude the effective controlling and channelling of information, the result here was that the flow of information was hindered and the ability to respond to the announcements with high-profile and militant expressions of dissatisfaction with corporate decisions was heavily circumscribed. In this respect, the analysis is concerned with ineffective multi-level forms of union organization and representation and the way it can be capitalized on by managements, at a local and national level. While we cannot be certain that a response similar to that engineered in Terni would have had similar outcomes in South Wales (particularly given differences in national legislative and political frameworks), the union and membership response in South Wales was rather limited. Indeed, events at the UK Corus plant in Teeside in 2009 and 2010 seemingly confirm the inability of the steel unions to mobilize their membership in meaningful ways. This plant was mothballed in 2010 (but has since been sold), and while expressions of solidarity were made throughout the community, there was little impact made on the management’s decision. The GMB union and Community aired the possibility of a strike ballot, including at Corus sites in Port Talbot, Scunthorpe and Rotherham, but nothing transpired.</p>
<p>To address redundancy collectively requires an active form of union organization, where members and their leaders actively attempt to address corporate decisions (for discussion of the difficulties associated with such approaches, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X11425542">Bronfenbrenner, 2007</xref>). At a time when union power and influence is diminishing, unions need to draw on power resources and employ strategic capabilities to build capacity in ways that challenge the new global context of management decisions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11425542">2010a</xref>) – including the development of transnational/cross-border strategies that put into place capacities that anticipate corporate decision-making (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11425542">Kelly, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X11425542">Tarrow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143831X11425542">Turnbull, 2009</xref>). Clearly, at a local level the unions failed to exploit the resources of internal and external solidarity in ways outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11425542">2010b</xref>) on activating local union power, nor were they able to shape the agenda to defend workers and challenge employers. The Terni case highlights how important locality-based activism and the leverage it can provide over local management can be, which then provides the basis for accountable and responsive representation at all levels of the union. Of course, these are contested and often fragile relations, which can be undermined by effective managerial rumour-mongering and bleak prognoses about corporate prospects, and occasionally those of the industry – as was the case in South Wales. Thus, an active and engaged leadership at a local level as well as beyond the locality is critical to counter these prospects (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11425542">Kelly, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The problem for the unions was that their organizational form made it difficult to mobilize the potentially significant resources of power at their disposal and for the leaders of these unions to engage fully their strategic capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray, 2010a</xref>: 341–5). We identify, in particular, weakness in framing capabilities and the ‘ability to define a proactive and autonomous agenda’, rather than wait for and respond to management decisions. Clearly, as one worker commented above, the unions had ‘lost their way’ and questions are clearly raised about leadership. As more recent events at Teeside (and elsewhere) attest, the leadership has not learned from experience and union leaders: ‘tend familiar ground, mobilizing well worn tactics and actions that flow from existing repertories of action, even when these approaches are not necessarily suited to changing circumstances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11425542">Lévesque and Murray, 2010a</xref>: 344). The ‘changing circumstances’ for these unions is the increasing consolidation of a globalizing industry. As illustrated here, locality-based unions may face considerable difficulty in influencing the decisions made by multinationals.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The overall analysis points to a necessary rethinking of the prevailing analyses of union responses to mass redundancy. In the main, the focus to date has been on the process of corporate decision-making and unions’ responses, the impact of redundancy and the associated actions by workers in the post-redundancy situation. To further these studies, the focus in this analysis has been on the ways in which managements may seek to demobilize collective responses to redundancy announcements and the active involvement of unions in these processes. It suggests that an adequate account of these events requires an analysis of those actively involved in the process of presenting the announcements and responding to them. Such an account, encompassing the complex processes whereby the events are constructed and played out, suggests interplay between management, union leadership, workforces and their place in the workplace and their localities. In this study, this interplay centred on the content of corporate information which both enabled and restricted worker responses to the announcements. In the longer run, these engagements laid the ground for the longer-term impacts and consequences of redundancy on these workplaces and in the localities where the workers lived.</p>
<p>Further, our analysis draws attention to two particular dimensions of union organization and representation. First, leaders play a decisive role in the development of collective capacity to meet the changing circumstances of work and employment, particularly in transnational sectors, such as steel. Second, in developing this capacity union leaders must give attention to the multi-layered forms of organization and representation that now characterize the modern union, operating in cross-border situations and circumstances. In the context of the steel industry, against a background of EU policy largely framed by neoliberal economic imperatives, it is evident that unions may struggle to meet the challenge of comprehensive and widespread restructuring and change. The way forward for unions in these circumstances is to prioritize the development of organizational and strategic capacities. Such a development requires a close integration between levels of organization and representation, as well as integrated forms of activism at a local level.</p>
