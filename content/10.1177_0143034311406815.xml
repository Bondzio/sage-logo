<abstract>
<p>This study investigated the contribution of student perceptions of school climate to racial differences in school discipline. Four hundred middle school students completed a school climate survey. Compared to Caucasian students, African-American students were referred to the office for discipline three times as frequently and received five times as many suspensions. Regression analyses examined the extent to which differences in school punishment could be attributed to racial differences in experiences of school climate. African-American students were more likely than Caucasian students to report that their peers supported aggressive behavior and less likely to express willingness to seek help from their teachers for bullying and threats of violence. School climate differences explained 8% of the variance in discipline referrals. Race remained a significant predictor (<italic>β = </italic>−0.29, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001) but was reduced from 11% to 8% after accounting for school climate.</p>

<p>The over-representation of minority students as the recipients of discipline referrals in schools is a well-documented problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311406815">Costenbader &amp; Markson, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311406815">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311406815">Gregory, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311406815">McFadden, Marsh, Price, &amp; Hwang, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143034311406815">Nichols, Ludwin and Iadicola, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143034311406815">Skiba, Peterson &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0143034311406815">Townsend, 2000</xref>). In the United States, the rate of suspension among African-American students (15%) was approximately three times greater than the risk for White students (4.8%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0143034311406815">United States Department of Education, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The disproportionate punishment of minority students is an international concern. In England, students of African and Caribbean descent are consistently over- represented in school suspensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311406815">Gordon, 2001</xref>). The National Exclusion Reporting System (NERS) in England reported that Black students comprise over 8% of the students suspended from school while only representing 2% of the national student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034311406815">Hyams-Parish, 1995</xref>). In France, African and Caribbean students are also more vulnerable to disciplinary exclusion than their Caucasian peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311406815">Hayden, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0143034311406815">Ruck and Wortley (2002)</xref> surveyed high school students in Toronto, Canada and found that Black students were significantly more likely than White and other minority students to report being suspended from school.</p>
<p>Frequent discipline referrals and suspensions do not appear to result in improved student behavior. Studies show that repeatedly disciplined students continue to engage in misbehavior such as truancy, vandalism, and aggression towards peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311406815">Bowditch, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034311406815">DeRidder, 1991</xref>). Some authors hypothesize that suspension policies actually worsen student behavior because they engender frustration, resentment, and disengagement from school (Bowditch, 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034311406815">Eckstrom, Goertz, Pollack, &amp; Rock, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311406815">Felice, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034311406815">Hernandez &amp; Nesman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0143034311406815">Velez, 1989</xref>). In a nationally representative high school student sample in the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034311406815">Eckstrom et al. (1986</xref>) found that 10% of the dropouts reported school suspension as a major reason for dropping out.</p>
<p>Although many studies have identified disproportionate outcomes, few studies have attempted to identify factors that might explain why African-American students receive high rates of discipline referrals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034311406815">Gottfredson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143034311406815">Skiba, Michael, Nardo, &amp; Peterson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0143034311406815">Stewart, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0143034311406815">Wilcox &amp; Clayton, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311406815">Marsh and Cornell (2001)</xref> found that student experiences in school help explain ethnic differences in high-risk behaviors such as fighting and carrying a weapon at school. In a survey of 7,848 students in grades 7, 9, and 11, the authors found that school experiences such as lack of adult and peer support and being threatened with violence at school were associated with higher rates of engaging in high-risk behavior. African-American students were more likely to have had these negative experiences than Caucasian students. After statistically controlling for these experiences, the effect of race on high-risk behaviors such as fighting with another student was reduced and no longer statistically significant. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311406815">Gregory and Weinstein (2008)</xref> found that African-American high school students exhibited more defiance and less cooperation with teachers whom they perceived as unfair and untrustworthy in their use of authority. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034311406815">Hinojosa (2008)</xref> found that African-American students who believed that their teachers were caring, listened, and could be trusted were less likely to receive in-school suspensions.</p>
<p>Explanations for disproportionate punishment continue to be the focus of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143034311406815">Eitle &amp; Eitle, 2004</xref>). Previous studies have pointed to socio-economic factors, racial biases, and cultural differences that might contribute to what has been termed the ‘discipline gap’ between minority and Caucasian students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311406815">Gregory, Skiba, &amp; Noguera, 2010</xref>). A key question remains whether differential school conditions and student experiences contribute to the differences in discipline referral rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311406815">Costenbader &amp; Markson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311406815">Gregory, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143034311406815">Mendez, Howard, Knoff, &amp; Ferron, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143034311406815">Morrison, Anthony, Storine, &amp; Dillon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143034311406815">Nichols et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143034311406815">Skiba et al., 1997</xref>). School conditions are especially important to investigate because they offer the potential for intervention on a schoolwide level, whereas factors such as socio-economic status are not readily modified. In this context, the present study examined the role of student perceptions of school climate in understanding the high rate of disciplinary referrals for African American students.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0143034311406815"><title>School climate</title>
<p>There is no single agreed-upon definition, but school climate refers to the quality and character of school life, typically as reflected in the nature of interactions among adults and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311406815">Cohen, McCabe, Michelli, &amp; Pickeral, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311406815">Emmons, 1993</xref>). A positive school climate generates norms, values, and expectations that make students feel safe, emotionally secure, and motivated to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311406815">Cohen, McCabe, Michelli, &amp; Pickeral, 2009</xref>). Recent research has emphasized the connection between school climate and student adjustment in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311406815">Brand, Felner, Seitsinger, Burns, &amp; Bolton, 2008</xref>). In a longitudinal study of 188 middle schools, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311406815">Brand, Felner, Shim, Seitsinger, and Dumas (2003)</xref> found that students exhibited better socio-emotional adjustment when they perceived a positive school climate as indicated by peer commitment to prosocial behaviors and greater support from teachers. From an international perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034311406815">Chen and Astor (2010)</xref> found that Western risk factors, including attitudes toward aggression and the quality of student-teacher relationships, were predictive of school violence in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311406815">Bandyopadhyay, Konold, and Cornell (2009)</xref> provided evidence for the validity of three school climate factors deemed important to overall school safety: The perception that teachers and staff members are responsive to student requests for help with bullying and threats of violence (willingness to seek help), the perception that peers regard aggressive behavior favorably (aggressive attitudes), and the perception that teasing and bullying are widespread at school (prevalence of teasing and bullying). These three factors were predictive of a series of measures of school safety conditions, including both short- and long-term school suspensions as well as teacher reports of the extent of bullying, teasing, and gang related violence at school. These factors may be particularly meaningful in explaining the disproportionate discipline among African-American students. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311406815">Marsh and Cornell (2001)</xref> observed, African-American students may feel less supported at school and experience the school environment as more threatening and aggressive than Caucasian students. Therefore, the present study assessed how differential student experiences of these school climate factors could explain the racial disproportion in discipline referrals and suspensions in middle school.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0143034311406815"><title>Help-seeking</title>
<p>Help seeking is an important aspect of a supportive climate. Middle school students in grades 6 through 8 who described their school climate as supportive were more likely to report having adults in the building whom they could approach about academic, personal, or family problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311406815">Lisi, 2004</xref>). In a study of 7,318 9th grade students sampled from 291 schools, Eliot, Cornell, Gregory, and Fan (in press) found that a supportive school climate was consistently associated with student willingness to seek help for bullying and threats of violence. Studies have also found that students who feel unsupported by teachers and classmates are more likely to engage in misbehavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311406815">Demaray &amp; Malecki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311406815">Malecki &amp; Demaray, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034311406815">Demaray, Malecki, Davidson, Hodgson, and Rebus (2005)</xref> contended that social support in school may be especially important for minority students. Studies suggest that the relationships which African-American students have with their teachers are especially important in promoting positive school adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311406815">Jussim, Eccles, &amp; Madon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143034311406815">McKown &amp; Weinstein, 2002</xref>). However, studies have shown that African-American students report greater conflict in teacher relationships than Caucasian students, especially when the teacher is from another ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311406815">Hughes, Gleason, &amp; Zhang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0143034311406815">Saft &amp; Pianta 2001</xref>). Though most of the research on teacher-student relationships and support among African-American students relates to academic achievement, social support from school may also be related to misconduct in school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0143034311406815"><title>Bullying</title>
<p>In addition to perceptions of teacher and school support, experiences of bullying have also been linked to problem behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311406815">Brody et al., 2006</xref>). Specifically, racial/ethnic bullying is defined as repeated hostile behaviors that range from verbal insults to more serious forms of abuse explicitly based on race or ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311406815">Fox &amp; Stallworth, 2005</xref>). Research suggests that many children are aware of and perceive racial and ethnic discrimination beginning in middle childhood and increasing through adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034311406815">Brown &amp; Krishnakumar, 2007</xref>). Researchers indicate that peer discrimination appears to be the most common form of discrimination reported by children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034311406815">Fisher, Wallace, &amp; Fenton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0143034311406815">Szalacha et al., 2003</xref>). Research with African-American adolescents found that the majority of the group reported experiencing racial/ethnic bullying from a peer including verbal insults and racial slurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034311406815">Fisher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0143034311406815">Simmons et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311406815">Larochette, Murphy, and Craig (2010)</xref> found that within a nationally representative sample, African-Canadian students were more likely to report being bullied due to their race or color than European-Canadian students.</p>
<p>Harassment from one’s peers based on race affects students’ overall socio-emotional adjustment and predicts problem behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311406815">Brody et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0143034311406815">Phelan, Yu, &amp; Davidson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0143034311406815">Wong, Eccles, &amp; Sameroff, 2003</xref>). For example, adolescents who reported more negative treatment at school because of their race were more likely to report engaging in problem behaviors such as skipping classes, cheating, and being sent to the principal’s office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0143034311406815">Wong et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311406815">Brody et al. (2006)</xref> found that African-American adolescents who reported racial/ethnic bullying such as racially based slurs and insults were more likely to engage in misconduct such as lying and vandalism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311406815">Larochette et al. (2010)</xref> discovered that racial bullying was less prevalent in Canadian schools where students reported more help and support from teachers. Less is known about the prevalence of general forms of bullying among African-American students and the potential links to misbehavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143034311406815">Nansel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311406815">Peskin, Tortolero, &amp; Markham, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0143034311406815"><title>Aggressive attitudes</title>
<p>Attitudes towards peer aggression is another school climate factor that is related to student misconduct. Studies have found that students who perceive that their peers favor and support aggressive behavior are more likely to engage in antisocial behavior, school rule breaking, and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311406815">Cornell &amp; Loper, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311406815">McConville &amp; Cornell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0143034311406815">Slaby &amp; Guerra, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311406815">McConville and Cornell (2003)</xref> found that middle school students who endorsed aggressive attitudes were more likely to receive office referrals for discipline infractions. Many African-American students are referred for discipline and suspensions due to school staff perceptions of excessive verbal and physical aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0143034311406815">Reed, 1988</xref>). Certain environmental factors, such as living in single-parent family homes and impoverished neighborhoods, are commonly linked to aggressive attitudes and behaviors. In their examination of risk factors associated with violent behavior among African-American, Haitian, and other Caribbean adolescent boys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311406815">Kingery, Zimmerman, and Biaora (1996)</xref> assert that situational factors may be more important than race or culture in predicting adolescent male aggression. Living in deprived educational, legal, social, and economic systems and subsequent feelings of vulnerability may underlie interpersonal violence. The high prevalence of these situational factors among African-American youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034311406815">Jaynes &amp; Williams, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0143034311406815">Patterson &amp; Dishion, 1985</xref>) may predispose African-American students to misbehave in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0143034311406815">Reed, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Past research has consistently found that the largest disparity in discipline is between African-American or Black and Caucasian or White students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034311406815">Brookes, Schiraldi, &amp; Ziedenberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311406815">Gordon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0143034311406815">Ruck &amp; Wortley, 2002</xref>; United States Department of Education, 2001). There is limited literature to date that has attempted to explain the racial disparity in student punishment by investigating school climate factors. Although some research has focused on aspects of teacher-student relationships, there has been little attention given to aggressive attitudes and perceptions of bullying in explaining racial disparity. The present study examined whether race differences between African-American and Caucasian students in discipline referrals and suspensions could be explained in part by underlying differences in student perceptions of the availability of help at school, the prevalence of teasing and bullying, and student attitudes toward aggression.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0143034311406815" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 400 students from a suburban public middle school in the state of Virginia in the United States. Approximately 60.5% of students identified themselves as Caucasian, 20.2% as African-American, 9.5% as Hispanic, 3.6% as Asian, and 6.3% as Other. The principal of the school was African-American and the Assistant principal was Caucasian. The majority of the teaching staff was Caucasian. The study participants consisted of 192 boys and 208 girls including 129 6th graders, 135 7th graders, and 136 8th graders. The mean age of the participants was 12.7 years (SD = 0.98) with a range of 11- to 15-years-old. School records indicated that 27% of the students received free and reduced price meals. It is known that disproportionately more African American students (approximately 59%) are eligible for this program than are Caucasian students (approximately 21%), but data for individual students were not available. As a result, socio-economic status could not be analysed in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0143034311406815" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>Students completed the School Climate Bullying Survey (SCBS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311406815">Cornell &amp; Sheras, 2003</xref>) as part of a school-wide bullying prevention effort using the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program (OBPP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143034311406815">Olweus &amp; Limber, 2000</xref>). The school’s bullying prevention program began with a fall student assembly on bullying and peer relations, followed by classroom discussions and review of school rules regarding bullying. Surveys were administered on a confidential basis that would protect student identity, yet permit linkage to external sources of information (student discipline records) through a code number. For the present study, each student was assigned a code number known only to a single code officer who did not have access to the completed surveys. The Olweus program and survey was conducted as part of the regular school curriculum and did not require affirmative parental consent. Teachers administered the confidential survey in classrooms during the spring of the school year. All middle school students in attendance on the day of the survey were eligible for the study. Students were told the survey was part of an effort to assess the opinions of students about school climate and the extent of bullying at the school. Absent students were given the survey by their teachers one week later.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0143034311406815"><title>Measures</title>
<sec id="sec9-0143034311406815"><title>School climate survey</title>
<p>The School Climate Bullying Survey (SCBS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311406815">Cornell &amp; Sheras, 2003</xref>) is a self-report measure designed to assess the incidence of bullying as well as school climate characteristics that are important in reducing bullying. The school climate items are answered on a four-point Likert scale: 1 = Strongly disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Agree; 4 = Strongly agree. Factor analysis of these items supported identification of three factors that were labeled willingness to seek help, prevalence of teasing and bullying, and aggressive attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311406815">Bandyopadhay et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The willingness to seek help scale measures student willingness to seek help from an adult in response to different kinds of threats and concerns by students. The scale is comprised of nine questions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034311406815">Table 1</xref>) which ask students whether they would agree or disagree with statements such as ‘There are adults at this school I could turn to if I had a personal problem’, and ‘If I tell a teacher that someone is bullying me, the teacher will do something to help’. Higher scores indicate greater willingness to seek help. The standardized alpha coefficient for the help-seeking scale in this sample was 0.81.

<p>The aggressive attitudes scale is a seven-item scale (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034311406815">Table 1</xref>) that measures student attitudes toward peer aggression (Bandyopadhay et al., 2009). The scale is a shortened version of a scale used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311406815">McConville and Cornell (2003)</xref> to measure perceptions of peer support of aggression. Students were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with items such as ‘If you are afraid to fight, you won’t have many friends’, and ‘Sometimes you only have two choices—get punched or punch the other person first’. Higher scores indicate more aggressive attitudes. The standardized alpha coefficient for attitudes toward aggression was 0.80.</p>
<p>The prevalence of teasing and bullying scale includes four items that measure the prevalence of teasing and harassment at school. Students were asked whether they would agree or disagree with statements such as ‘Students here often get teased about their clothing or physical appearance’, and ‘Students here often get put down because of their race or ethnicity’. Higher scores indicate that students perceive more teasing and bullying at school. The standardized alpha coefficient for this scale was 0.69.</p>
<p>The factor structure of these scales was supported in exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses with a group of 2,111 middle school students and then replicated in a confirmatory factor analyses using an independent sample of 7,318 9th grade students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311406815">Bandyopadhyah et al., 2009</xref>). Multigroup confirmatory factor analyses found evidence of full metric invariance across gender and race groups, suggesting that the scales can be used to assess school climate without appreciable bias associated with gender or race. In addition, regression analyses conducted with 291 high schools in this study showed that school-level measures of these school climate scales were predictive of independent measures of school disciplinary actions (school records of short-term suspensions and long-term suspensions) as well as teacher reports of the extent of bullying and gang-related violence at school. In addition to total scale scores, we also examined each individual item because we were interested in whether the race/ethnicity item generated different results than the other items.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0143034311406815"><title>Discipline records</title>
<p>The total numbers of discipline referrals and out-of-school suspensions for each student were obtained from school records. Discipline referrals were based on a statewide standard list of discipline violations and reporting requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0143034311406815">Virginia Department of Education, 2010</xref>). Referrals and suspensions were recorded on an ongoing basis by school administrators (principal and assistant principal).</p>

<sec id="sec11-0143034311406815"><title>Analyses</title>
<p>The first research question was whether or not there were racial differences in discipline referrals and suspensions. Chi-square tests of association were conducted to demonstrate that African-American students were more likely to receive discipline referrals and suspensions than Caucasian students. The second question was whether there were racial group differences in student perceptions of school climate, which was determined by comparing the two groups on willingness to seek help, prevalence of teasing and bullying, and aggressive attitudes in separate <italic>t</italic>-tests. The third question was whether race was predictive of school punishment after considering the influence of school climate. A series of hierarchical regression analyses was used to determine whether race predicted discipline referrals and suspensions after controlling for the three school climate factors. The analyses were limited to comparisons of African American and Caucasian students because there were insufficient numbers of other minority students.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0143034311406815" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Chi-square tests of association indicated that African-American students were more likely to receive a discipline referral than Caucasian students, χ<sup>2 </sup>(1, <italic>n </italic>= 400) = 44.98, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.01, C = 0.32. Sixty-three percent of African-American students received referrals versus 26% of Caucasian students. In addition, African-American students were more likely to receive suspensions than Caucasian students, χ<sup>2 </sup>(1, <italic>n </italic>= 400) = 33.13, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.01, C = 0.28. Twenty-seven percent of African-American students received suspensions versus 6% of Caucasian students.</p>
<p>There were racial group differences on the willingness to seek help scale and the aggressive attitudes scale. African-American students were less willing to seek help from teachers and adults in school than Caucasian students, <italic>t</italic> (396) = −2.28, <italic>p </italic>= 0.02.</p>
<p>African-American students were more likely to endorse aggressive attitudes toward peers than Caucasian students, <italic>t</italic> (396) = 5.51, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.01. There were no statistically significant racial differences on the prevalence of teasing and bullying scale, so it was not included in subsequent analyses. Each individual item on the scale was then analysed to investigate whether there were racial group differences in student perceptions. African-American students were more likely to report that students were teased about clothing and physical appearance than Caucasian students, (<italic>t</italic> (394) = 2.61, <italic>p </italic>= 0.009). However, there were no racial group differences found on other items within the scale (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143034311406815">Table 2</xref>).

<p>The next set of analyses determined whether race and school climate factors significantly predicted school punishment. The discipline referral and suspension variables were only moderately correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.56, <italic>p </italic>= 0.01); thus a separate set of regressions was conducted for each.</p>
<p>A simple regression indicated that race was a significant predictor (<italic>ß</italic> = −0.34, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001), accounting for 11% of the variance in school discipline referrals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0143034311406815">Table 4</xref>). Next, a hierarchical regression was conducted with two school climate factors, willingness to seek help and aggressive attitudes, entered at the first step. At step 1, the aggressive attitudes scale (<italic>ß</italic> = 0.14, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001) and the willingness to seek help scale (<italic>ß</italic> = 0.11, <italic>p = 0</italic>.05) were significantly related to whether students were referred for discipline. Students who reported more aggressive attitudes were more likely to be referred for discipline. In addition, students who were more willing to seek help from teachers and adults in school were less likely to be referred for discipline. The total variance accounted for by aggressive attitudes and willingness to seek help was 8%, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001.

<p>In the second step, race was entered to investigate whether it remained a significant predictor of being referred for discipline after school climate factors were taken into account. At step two, race remained a significant predictor of whether a student was referred for discipline (<italic>ß</italic> = −0.29, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001). African-American students were more likely to be referred for discipline than Caucasian students. However, after accounting for school climate variables in step one, the total variance accounted for by race was reduced from 11% in the first regression to 8%, <italic>F</italic> (1, 391), <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001.</p>
<p>Next, we conducted a parallel set of analyses for school suspension.

<p>There was a large race disparity in whether students were referred for discipline violations and received suspensions from school. African-American students were three times more likely to be referred for discipline and five times more likely to be suspended than Caucasian students. African-American students made up 20.2% of the school’s student population yet, 60.3% of African-American students were referred for discipline as compared to 27% of Caucasian students, who made up 60.5% of the student population. In addition, 20.7% of African-American students were suspended from school as compared to 6% of Caucasian students. These findings for middle school students are consistent with previous research in other grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311406815">Costenbader &amp; Markson, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311406815">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311406815">Gregory, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311406815">McFadden et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143034311406815">Nichols et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143034311406815">Skiba et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0143034311406815">Townsend, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034311406815">Hinojosa (2008)</xref> found similar results in a study investigating race differences in suspension rates among a middle school sample. African-American 6th and 8th graders were almost four times more likely than Caucasian students to be suspended out of school and almost three times more likely to be suspended in school.</p>
<p>The next set of analysis attempted to explain this disparity based on differences in student experiences of their school environment. African-American students were less likely than Caucasian students to report a willingness to seek help from adults and teachers at school for problems such as bullying and personal problems. Students who do not believe that teachers will help them may be more likely to misbehave for a variety of reasons. Such students may be more resentful and less respectful of their teachers, and as a result more prone to behave defiantly or inappropriately. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311406815">Gregory and Weinstein (2008)</xref> found that African-American students were more obedient and accepting of authority of teachers they respected. In addition, when these students do experience peer conflicts, teasing, or bullying, they may be more likely to take matters into their own hands and receive a disciplinary violation for fighting. Student perceptions of teacher and school support overall have been linked to student adjustment factors among African-American students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311406815">Demaray &amp; Malecki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311406815">Malecki &amp; Demaray, 2003</xref>). This study found that students who felt less supported, as measured by their willingness to seek help, were more likely to engage in misbehavior.</p>
<p>Results indicated that there were no significant differences between African-American and Caucasian students in their overall perceptions of bullying and teasing in the school. Notably, there were no group differences on the item that inquired about being put down for race or ethnicity. Previous studies have found that the majority of African-American adolescents in several school samples reported experiencing forms of ‘racial/ethnic bullying’ from a peer including verbal insults and racial slurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034311406815">Fisher et al., 2000</xref>; Simmons et al., 2002). However, African-American students were more likely to report that students were teased for clothing and physical appearance. African-American students were also more likely than Caucasian students to report that their peers support and encourage aggression. For example, African American students were more likely to agree that ‘if someone threatens you it is okay to hit that person’. Most of the student population disagreed with these statements, but more African-American students (23%) than Caucasian students (12%) did endorse these ideas. Studies suggest that certain influences such as a large number of single-parent family homes and impoverished neighborhoods are more prevalent among African-American youth and commonly linked to aggressive attitudes and behaviors (Smith &amp; Hasbrouk, 2005). Less is known about ethnic differences in aggressive attitudes based on perceived levels of support and minority status in school.</p>
<p>In attempting to explain the racial disparity in discipline referrals, attitudes towards aggression, and willingness to seek help predicted whether a student received a discipline referral or suspension. Students who endorsed higher levels of aggressive attitudes were more likely to receive a discipline referral. This finding is consistent with other research which found that students with aggressive attitudes were more likely to engage in rule-breaking behavior that leads to discipline referrals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311406815">Cornell &amp; Loper, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311406815">McConville &amp; Cornell, 2003</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311406815">Huesmann and Guerra (1997)</xref>, children who possess normative beliefs that favor aggression are likely to behave aggressively in response to problems. Research suggests that children with aggressive attitudes are biased toward attributing hostility to the behaviors and intentions of others, leading them to respond aggressively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034311406815">Crick &amp; Grotpeter, 1995</xref>). School-based violence prevention programs have proven to be effective in reducing aggressive behaviors and attitudes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0143034311406815">Wilson, Lipsey, and Derzon (2003)</xref> conducted a meta-analysis of 221 controlled studies. The authors found that programs that included counseling components and social competence training were most effective in reducing aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>Students who were less willing to seek help from teachers and adults in school were more likely to be referred for discipline. This finding suggests that students who feel less supported in school, as measured by their willingness to seek help, may be more likely to violate school rules. Past research has found that perceived teacher support among middle school students served as a protective factor in preventing problem behaviors including vandalism and overall delinquency in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311406815">Jessor et al., 2003</xref>). Perhaps when students perceive their teachers as trustworthy and caring, they are more likely to respond positively to their teachers and the school rules overall. Interventions designed to improve the quality of relationships between teachers and students may be helpful in reducing school misconduct. In one study, teachers who reported using a relational approach to classroom management that included getting to know students personally were more likely to engender a sense of trust from their students and experienced fewer classroom behavior problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311406815">Gregory &amp; Ripski, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>After controlling for school climate factors, race remained predictive of whether a student was referred for discipline and suspended. It is possible that this race effect was in part associated with lower socio-economic status of the minority students. Information on family income (typically eligibility for free or reduced price meals in the United States) was not available for this study, so this remained an uncontrolled variable that should be considered in future studies.</p>
<p>Some scholars have suggested racial bias and cultural misunderstanding among teachers may increase the likelihood that African-American students are referred for discipline. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143034311406815">Skiba et al. (2002)</xref> proposed that teachers who are prone to accepting stereotypes that African-American adolescents are dangerous or threatening may overreact to minor threats to authority. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0143034311406815">Townsend (2000)</xref> suggested that teachers who are not African-American may misinterpret certain behaviors as combative or argumentative due to cultural differences in communication. Interventions that promote awareness of racial biases and cultural competence in disciplinary practices may help in reducing the racial disparity in office referrals and suspensions.</p>
<p>Though willingness to seek help, aggressive attitudes, and race explained some of the variance in discipline referrals and suspensions, there may be other factors contributing to the higher number of African-American students being referred for discipline. Disengagement from school, limited commitment to school, and increased frustration with school overall may also be factors linked to misconduct.</p>
<sec id="sec14-0143034311406815"><title>Study limitations and directions for future research</title>
<p>There are several limitations to this study that could be addressed in future studies. First, these results require replication in other samples and disadvantaged minority groups in different countries. It is conceivable that disadvantaged minority students in any nation might have a negative perception of the school climate that renders them at greater risk for misbehavior and disciplinary consequences. This difference in perception of the school climate is likely contingent on the degree to which the minority group experiences other disadvantages in the larger society, such as lower income, higher unemployment, and social discrimination.</p>
<p>This study was not able to test a complete theoretical model of disproportionate school discipline. Undoubtedly, there are complex causal relations among a variety of variables, and it would be simplistic to assert that school climate alone could explain the high rates of disciplinary referrals and suspensions observed among African-American students (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311406815">Gregory et al., 2010</xref>). Our goal is to demonstrate the potential value of school climate as part of a larger, as yet not fully articulated, model. It seems especially important to recognize that African-American students, and likely other disadvantaged minority students, perceive the school with a different lens and from a different perspective than other students.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that this study relied on student self-report to measure school climate. The limitations and sources of measurement error in self-report are well-known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0143034311406815">Solberg &amp; Olweus, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0143034311406815">Stone et al., 2000</xref>). Future studies could also include additional factors such as teacher perceptions of school climate and how teachers approach discipline at the classroom level. A more comprehensive assessment of school climate may be needed.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be recognized that this study examined differences in disciplinary referrals and suspensions from school. This examination does not distinguish whether African-American students engaged in higher rates of misbehavior than Caucasian students or whether school staff responded differentially to similar behavior by the two groups. There is evidence to support both possibilities and they are not mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311406815">Gregory et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143034311406815">Skiba et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Although a correlational study like this one cannot establish the existence of a causal relationship, there is considerable evidence that aggressive attitudes are associated with increased propensity to engage in aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311406815">McConville &amp; Cornell, 2003</xref>). There is also a large literature demonstrating the effectiveness of intervention programs that aim to reduce aggressive behavior in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0143034311406815">Wilson et al., 2003</xref>). There does not appear to be a single best approach, but rather a variety of evidence-based programs that yield similar results. The most common and most effective programs were universal programs delivered to all students in a classroom or targeted programs for students with conduct problems who were pulled out of their classroom for individual or small group counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0143034311406815">Wilson &amp; Lipsey 2007</xref>). Some of the most commonly identified features of successful programs included counseling students about their aggressive beliefs and attitudes, and teaching them more constructive ways to resolve conflicts and address interpersonal difficulties. Programs with behavioral, cognitive, or social skills orientations produced similar effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0143034311406815">Wilson &amp; Lipsey, 2007</xref>). This literature along with these findings suggest that interventions focused on changing student attitudes toward aggression and helping them to feel more supported in school may help reduce the racial discipline gap so common in American schools and other nations.</p>
