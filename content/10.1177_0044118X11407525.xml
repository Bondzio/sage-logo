<abstract>
<p>Online harassment can consist of threatening, worrisome, emotionally hurtful, or sexual messages delivered via an electronic medium that can lead victims to feel fear or distress much like real-world harassment and stalking. This activity is especially prevalent among middle and high school populations who frequently use technology as a means to communicate with others. Little is known, however, whether factors linked to computer crime victimization in college samples have the same influence in juvenile populations. The article discusses a study conducted utilizing a routine-activities framework that explored the online harassment experiences among middle and high school students and recruited 434 students in a Kentucky middle and high school to complete a survey uploaded on the district server during school hours. Multiple binary logistic regression models indicate that online harassment victimization increased when juveniles maintain social network sites, associate with peers who harass online, and post sensitive information online. The implications of these findings for theorists, practitioners, and policy makers are also explored.</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, computer technology and the Internet have changed the way that people communicate and seek entertainment. Young people have quickly adopted this technology and regularly use it to communicate with others through instant messaging technologies and e-mail as well as social networking sites like <italic>Facebook</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0044118X11407525">Lenhart &amp; Madden, 2007</xref>). Recent nationally representative studies suggest 75% of youth own either a laptop or desktop computer and 15% own both devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0044118X11407525">Lenhart, Madden, &amp; Hitlin, 2005</xref>). In addition, 93% of American youth between the ages of 12 and 17 use the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0044118X11407525">Lenhart &amp; Madden, 2007</xref>). A similar national study found that 49% of children are online for 5 to 7 days each week on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X11407525">Wolack, Mitchell, &amp; Finkelhor, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As youth regularly go online to share information and connect with their peers and the larger world, research has begun to consider how these technologies have been subverted for deviant or harmful applications. In particular, e-mail and other Internet-based resources have been used to inflict emotional harm among juveniles through sexual solicitations, harassment, or stalking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0044118X11407525">Bocij, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0044118X11407525">Finn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0044118X11407525">Wall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X11407525">Wolack et al., 2006</xref>). Although these behaviors have not been legally defined as criminal or delinquent consistently across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>), these behaviors are a significant public health concern due to the deleterious consequences they have for the individuals who are inappropriately contacted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0044118X11407525">Nansel et al., 2001</xref>). To that end, recent research suggests that 1 in 7 youth between the ages of 10 and 17 received an unwanted sexual solicitation while online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X11407525">Wolack et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, online harassment among youth has increased from between 1.1 and 1.7 million youth in 2000 to between 1.7 and 2.4 million in 2005. Evidence suggests that 1 in 4 young people made rude or nasty comments to another person while online, and 1 in 10 admitted to harassing someone who had angered him or her (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X11407525">Wolack et al., 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, few youth report these negative experiences to law enforcement or their parents, making it difficult to actively deal with this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X11407525">Wolack et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although research on online victimization among juveniles has increased, most studies focus on risk factors rather than theoretically driven causes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>; Ybarra, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X11407525">Mitchell, Finkelhor, &amp; Wolak, 2007</xref>). Preliminary evidence suggests that routine activities theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0044118X11407525">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>) is helpful in understanding online victimization among college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0044118X11407525">Bossler &amp; Holt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0044118X11407525">Choi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X11407525">Marcum, 2008</xref>). This theory argues that in order for crime to occur, a motivated offender and suitable target with inadequate guardianship must converge in time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0044118X11407525">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering the empirical support that routine activities theory has received for explaining cybercrime in college samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0044118X11407525">Bossler &amp; Holt, 2009</xref>), as well as its ability to explain traditional crime in a wide variety of populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0044118X11407525">Tewksbury &amp; Mustaine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0044118X11407525">Wang, 2002</xref>), it is theoretically plausible that routine activities would be fruitful to explain online harassment victimization in a juvenile sample. Thus, this study examined the problem of online harassment among juveniles by applying measures of routine activities theory to a sample of middle and high school students. Specifically, this research considered predictors of both public and private online harassment victimization through proximity to motivated offenders (i.e., computer use, computer deviance, etc.), physical guardianship (i.e., filtering software), social guardianship (i.e., computer location, online peer deviance), personal guardianship (i.e., skill level, risky info sharing), and target suitability (e.g., being female). The findings benefit the literature on both juvenile harassment in virtual settings and research on routine activities theory. In addition, the findings indicate specific safeguards youth, parents, and administrators need to take in order to decrease online harassment victimization for juveniles.</p>

<title>Research on Harassment and Bullying</title>
<p>Online harassment is a form of cyberviolence and can be perceived as a type of interpersonal victimization that can lead victims to feel fear or distress in much the same manner as real-world stalking and harassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0044118X11407525">Bocij, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0044118X11407525">Finn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0044118X11407525">Wall, 2001</xref>). Harassment most often involves threatening or sexual messages delivered via e-mail, instant messaging services, or posts in chatrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0044118X11407525">Bocij, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0044118X11407525">Finn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0044118X11407525">Fisher, Cullen, &amp; Turner, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0044118X11407525">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0044118X11407525">Wall, 2001</xref>). The popularity of social networking sites like <italic>Facebook</italic> among youth allows them to post mean or cruel messages about other people for the public to see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X11407525">2009</xref>). The impact of experiencing online harassment varies, as some victims may view such communications to be nothing more than a nuisance, though some report physical or emotional stress as a consequence of their experiences with victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0044118X11407525">Finkelhor, Mitchell, &amp; Wolak, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0044118X11407525">Finn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X11407525">2009</xref>). Bullying and harassment experiences among juvenile populations in virtual environments are also correlated with victimization in the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2009</xref>). Bullies appear to recognize the ease with which a victim can be targeted in both environments, thereby leading some to be victimized on-and off-line.</p>
<p>In light of the common relationships between harassment and bullying on- and off-line, scholars have argued that the predictors identified in previous research regarding real-world victimization should be applicable to virtual environments as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X11407525">Marcum, 2008</xref>). Specifically, there may be some utility in applying routine activities theory to account for online harassment among juveniles. Routine activities theory suggests that victimization is most likely when individuals are placed in high-risk situations, in close proximity to motivated offenders, appear to be attractive targets, and lack a capable guardian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0044118X11407525">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>). In addition, individuals who engage in criminal and deviant behavior are at an increased risk of victimization as they increase both their proximity to motivated offenders and the probability of retaliation, while also decreasing social guardianship by associating with delinquent others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0044118X11407525">Jensen &amp; Brownfield, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0044118X11407525">Lauritsen, Laub, &amp; Sampson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0044118X11407525">Zhang, Welte, &amp; Wiecxorek, 2001</xref>). Thus, routine activities theory can account for both victimization and crime since victims often report higher levels of deviant behavior than nonvictims and share demographic characteristics with offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0044118X11407525">Jensen &amp; Brownfield, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>In applying routine activities theory to virtual environments, particularly online harassment, it is necessary to consider each proposition in turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0044118X11407525">Yar, 2005</xref>). Routine behaviors in online environments may theoretically increase exposure to offenders, thereby increasing the likelihood of victimization in much the same way as victimization in the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0044118X11407525">Fisher et al., 2002</xref>). However, simply owning a computer, having faster Internet access, and spending more time online do not appear to be related to online harassment victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>). Instead, individuals who participate in specific activities that focus on information sharing, such as communicating in chatrooms, instant messaging, e-mailing, using social network sites, and downloading images via file-sharing programs, affect online interpersonal victimization as they increase exposure to motivated harassers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X11407525">Marcum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11407525">Marcum, Higgins, &amp; Ricketts, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0044118X11407525">Ybarra et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Associating with peers who harass others online also increases exposure to motivated offenders. The anonymity afforded by virtual environments may increase the likelihood that individuals will harass their friends online without fear of reprisal. In fact, it appears that most online harassment comes from friends or acquaintances. Most online offenders (84%) knew their victims, and less than a third (31%) of the victims knew their harasserâs identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>). Thus, relationships with peers who engage in harassment may significantly increase individual risk of interpersonal victimization.</p>
<p>Involvement in online deviance also influences the likelihood of online victimization since participating in deviance exposes individuals to a larger population of offenders. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt and Bossler (2009)</xref> found that individuals involved in online deviance, particularly computer hacking, were at an increased risk of harassment victimization. Hackers often learn new skills by interacting with more experienced individuals in a hostile online environment, thus increasing their proximity to motivated offenders while also demonstrating their inability to protect themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0044118X11407525">Holt, 2007</xref>). In addition, individuals who harass others online may also increase their own risk of being harassed due to retaliatory attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0044118X11407525">Ybarra et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, involvement in computer crime and deviance, especially online harassment, may increase the likelihood of victimization.</p>
<p>In addition, routine activities theory argues that crime can only occur when there is an absence of guardianship. Guardianship can take several forms, including physical, social, and personal components, in physical and virtual space. Physical guardians act to protect and harden a target from being victimized, such as burglar alarms, deadbolts, or dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0044118X11407525">Spano &amp; Nagy, 2005</xref>). In cyberspace, a range of computer programs have been designed to act as physical guardians for computer systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0044118X11407525">Yar, 2005</xref>). In particular, filtering software programs exist that allow parents to limit what websites and materials children can access while online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0044118X11407525">Bocij, 2004</xref>). Some programs even allow parents to limit the amount of time that kids can spend online. Research examining physical guardianship online indicates that current software programs have little effect on reducing interpersonal victimization. Most studies of college students and youth have found computer physical guardians to have minimal effects on harassment victimization and the presentation of inappropriate material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0044118X11407525">Fleming, Greentree, Cocotti-Muller, Elias, &amp; Morrison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X11407525">Marcum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11407525">Marcum et al., 2010</xref>). This software can be easily subverted and may not keep kids from receiving threatening e-mails or instant messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X11407525">Wolack et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, ownership and regular updating of protective software may have minimal impact on the likelihood of online harassment for juveniles.</p>
<p>Another form of guardianship that must be considered are social guardians, which ârefers to the availability of others who may prevent personal crimes by their mere presence or by offering assistance to ward off an attackâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0044118X11407525">Spano &amp; Nagy, 2005</xref>, p. 418). One potential social guardian related to online harassment is the location of a computer in a home. A computer situated in a regularly occupied or heavily trafficked room, such as a family room or kitchen, enables parents to observe the ways that the computer is being used and intervene when they feel inappropriate actions are occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0044118X11407525">Bocij, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11407525">Marcum et al., 2010</xref>). When computers are located in childrenâs bedrooms or less occupied places, it is more difficult to monitor their activities online. Thus, locating the computer in common areas of a house may help to reduce the likelihood of victimization.</p>
<p>In addition, social guardianship may also play a role in online harassment if a personâs peers are involved in computer crime and deviance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>). Spending more time with delinquents increases the risk of victimization in the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0044118X11407525">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>) and online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>) by increasing exposure to motivated offenders and decreasing social guardianship because peers are less likely to intervene. If a respondent does not perceive that his or her friends will take their victimization seriously enough because of their friends participating in similar behaviors, these youth will be less likely to talk to their friends about their victimization and miss out on an important emotional and protective resource.</p>
<p>Finally, personal guardianship can play a role in virtual environments based on computer skill and the judicious sharing of personal information. Knowledge of computer systems can serve a protective role because skilled computer users may be better prepared to deal with threats and risks while online. In particular, a person who understands how e-mail and instant messaging programs work may be better able to respond to harassment by immediately blocking a personâs messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0044118X11407525">Bocij, 2004</xref>). Recent research, however, suggests that significant computer skills did not reduce individual risk of online harassment victimization in college samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>). It is not clear whether these findings would generalize to younger samples with lower levels of computer knowledge.</p>
<p>The methods by which individuals share information in online environments are also related to personal guardianship. Individuals who provide sensitive information about themselves in public places, like a social network profile, can significantly increase their risk of harassment and bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X11407525">Marcum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11407525">Marcum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X11407525">Mitchell, Finkelhor, &amp; Wolak, 2007</xref>). Posting school schedules, home addresses, or images and stories of themselves in compromising situations gives offenders fodder for attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11407525">Marcum et al., 2010</xref>). As a consequence, individuals who do not carefully manage personal or sensitive information may increase their risk of victimization.</p>
<p>Routine activities theory also argues that some individuals are more likely to be victimized because they have qualities that make them suitable targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0044118X11407525">Jensen &amp; Brownfield, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0044118X11407525">Lauritsen et al., 1992</xref>). The literature on cyberbullying and harassment provides insight into whether demographics such as sex, race, age, and academic success are correlated with online interpersonal victimization. Consistent with the traditional literature, women are more likely than men to be victims of harassment and cyberbullying even after controlling for routine activities on the computer and guardianship measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11407525">Marcum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X11407525">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>). This suggests that being female increases victimization in and of itself, not gender differences in behavior. There do not appear to be racial differences, however, in online harassment victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>). College students and the very young also appear less likely to be victimized than those in middle adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X11407525">2009</xref>). This may be a consequence of these individuals being given greater access to technology as they age, but still being seen as being less able to protect themselves than young adults. There is strong evidence suggesting that poor educational performance is related to traditional bullying offending and victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0044118X11407525">Glew, Fan, Katon, Rivara, &amp; Kernic, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0044118X11407525">Nansel et al., 2001</xref>), though it is unclear how educational performance may influence the likelihood of online harassment victimization. Thus, these correlates suggest that within a youth sample being female and older are related with higher levels of online harassment victimization.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The above review illustrates that routine activities theory theoretically applies to online harassment for youth, though it is empirically unknown whether previous findings from college samples apply to younger populations. This study provided an analysis of hypotheses derived from routine activities theory to examine its capacity to explain both public and private forms of online harassment victimization within a youth sample. Specifically, we examined whether routine computer activities, including the respondentsâ use of computers for deviant purposes, increased the risk of victimization by placing respondents in closer proximity to motivated offenders. This study also examined the roles of (a) physical guardianship through the use of protective software, (b) social guardianship via computer location and peer involvement in computer crime, and (c) personal guardianship, as indicated by the respondentsâ knowledge of computers and their willingness to post personal information online for others to view. The effect of target suitability was assessed using demographic characteristics such as sex and age.</p>
<sec id="section3-0044118X11407525">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>In the spring of 2008, administrators from a school district adjacent to a large metropolitan area in Kentucky approached one of the researchers who had previously worked within the school to better understand the ways that their students utilize computers in and out of the institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0044118X11407525">May, Johnson, Chen, Hutchison, &amp; Ricketts, 2010</xref>). At one middle and high school, the research team worked with the administration to develop a data collection strategy that provided meaningful data on student computer use and was minimally disruptive to the school schedule. Thus, questions were added to the annual educational and psychological assessment that the school district administers to its students. At the beginning of each school year, parents and/or guardians are informed that their student(s) will be asked to participate in a number of educational and psychological assessments during the school year. Those who are willing to allow their child to participate are required to sign a consent form.</p>
<p>Using items derived from the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0044118X11407525">Rogers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X11407525">Wolack et al., 2006</xref>), an online survey instrument was created to assess online victimization and general computer use. Although these items were valid in previous research, we pretested the questions with a small group of 15 high school students. No major issues were identified or changes made. The online survey was then uploaded on the district server, and students who had access to computers at school were asked to complete the instrument. All eighth graders at the middle school and freshmen at the high school completed the survey because they were enrolled in classes that either visited the library where computers were available for student use or had computer access in classes during the data collection period. For the rest of the high school, only those students in business and technology classes completed the survey since they used computers in at least one course during the day.</p>
<p>At both schools, one of the research team members went to the library, computer lab, or technology classroom where the students were gathered, explained the purpose of the survey, and asked whether there were any questions. Students whose parents did not give consent or those students who wished not to participate left at the end of the explanation. Only 4 students across both schools refused to participate.</p>
<p>Students were then asked to log in to the survey using their student identification number, though this information was not maintained in the database file on the server. Instead, each response received a unique identifying number in the data file, which was sent to the research team at the end of each day. The research team then acknowledged receipt of that data that were then deleted from the district server. Thus, no school personnel or member of the research team was able to identify any individual student. In addition, data were not collected regarding the type of class the student participated in during the data collection period to further maintain student anonymity.</p>
<p>A total of 518 middle and high school students in Kentucky participated in the study. Due to missing data and the use of listwise regression, 434 cases were analyzed. The final sample was 51.2% female and 79.3% White, in keeping with the general composition of the schools. The breakdown for academic grade for the sample was as follows: 42.9% eighth graders, 27.0% freshmen, 12.9% sophomores, 9.2% juniors, and 8.1% seniors. The samples represented approximately 25% of the high school population and 35% of the middle school. Finally, a majority of the students could be considered A and B students (mostly As = 36.4%, mostly Bs = 39.9%, mostly Cs = 18.2%, mostly Ds = 3.9%, mostly Fs = 1.6%).</p>

<title>Dependent Variable: Online Harassment Victimization</title>
<p>In order to measure behaviors consistent with existing definitions of online harassment, we used the same measures from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X11407525">Wolack et al.âs (2006)</xref> two-wave nationally representative sample of Internet-using U.S. youth.

<title>Guardianship</title>
<p>We included guardianship measures that can be categorized as physical, social, and personal.</p>
<sec id="section13-0044118X11407525">
<title>Physical guardianship</title>
<p>Respondents were asked whether or not (0 = <italic>no</italic>,1 = <italic>yes</italic>) their parents âhave any sort of software that keeps you from looking at certain websites or content online?â This item provided a more accurate representation of a physical guardian than antivirus tools and other protective software because a blocking or filtering program can keep individuals from accessing websites and content, such as social networking pages and instant messaging protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X11407525">Wolack et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0044118X11407525">
<title>Social guardianship</title>
<p>Social guardianship was examined via two proxy items. The first item (<italic>computer location)</italic> asked whether the computer primarily used by the student was in a private (e.g., bedroom, laptop) or public (e.g., family room, kitchen, classroom) setting (0 = <italic>public</italic>,1 = <italic>private</italic>). Parents are better able to monitor their childâs online behavior if the computer they use is in a public setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0044118X11407525">Bocij, 2004</xref>). The variation in home construction and parentâchild interaction strategies may, however, diminish the efficacy of public computer use. At the same time, limited evidence suggests that public computer use generally decreases the risk of victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11407525">Marcum et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Social guardianship was also assessed by examining how many of the respondentsâ friends committed various forms of computer deviance (<italic>peer computer deviance</italic>). Research indicates that delinquent peer associations reduce the likelihood of intervention by associates when one is being victimized, decreasing social guardianship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0044118X11407525">Bossler &amp; Holt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0044118X11407525">Spano &amp; Nagy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0044118X11407525">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). At the same time, associating with delinquent friends may increase a prospective victimâs exposure to motivated offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0044118X11407525">Jensen &amp; Brownfield, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0044118X11407525">Lauritsen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0044118X11407525">Sampson &amp; Lauritsen, 1990</xref>). Although we recognize the complexity and potential overlap that peer deviance has in routine activities theory, we have categorized <italic>peer harassment</italic> as a measure of proximity to motivated harassers and <italic>peer computer deviance</italic> as a proxy measure of social guardianship. <italic>Peer computer deviance</italic> is the average standardized score for four items asking respondents how many of their friends participated in the following activities during the previous 12 months: (a) âknowingly used, made, or gave to another person a âpiratedâ copy of commercially sold computer softwareâ; (b) âknowingly used, made, or gave to another person âpiratedâ media (music, television show, or movie)â; (c) âlooked at pornographic, obscene, or offensive materials onlineâ; and (d) âaccessed anotherâs computer account or files without his or her knowledge or permission just to at the information or filesâ (options: <italic>none of them, very few, about half of them, more than half</italic>; alpha = .725). To address skewness, 0.73 was added to all scores and the square root was taken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0044118X11407525">
<title>Personal guardianship</title>
<p>Respondentsâ personal guardianship was assessed via their skill with computers and proclivity to share or post personal information in public settings. <italic>Skill level</italic> was a 3-point ordinal measure based on general categories of computer proficiency: (a) âI can surf the net, use common software, but not fix my own computerâ (normal); (b) âI can use a variety of software and fix some computer problems I haveâ (intermediate); and (c) âI can use Linux, most software, and fix most computer problems I haveâ (advanced; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0044118X11407525">Rogers, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0044118X11407525">
<title>Risky info sharing was assessed</title> <p>by examining whether respondents communicated with individuals they did not know while online and whether they posted or sent personal information for others to see that they might know only online. Respondents were asked two questions concerning how often they engaged in electronic communications with (a) people they did not know at all, and (b) people they only knew from online meetings (options: <italic>never, rarely, sometimes, often</italic>, and <italic>very often</italic>). In addition, respondents were asked how many times in the past 12 months they (a) âposted a picture of themselves in a public place online,â (b) âsent a picture of themselves to someone that they met online,â and (c) âposted personal information in a public place onlineâ (options: <italic>never, once or twice, once every 2 to 3 months, once a month, once every 2 to 3 weeks, once a week, 2 to 3 times per week, once per day, 2 to 3 times per day</italic>). Principle components analysis with a varimax rotation indicated a one-factor solution based on the eigenvalues and a scree discontinuity test. <italic>Risky info sharing</italic> was computed by summing the five itemsâ <italic>z</italic> scores weighted by their factor scores. Due to the skewness of the measure, we added 0.179 to all respondentsâ scores and took the square root. Thus, the measure is the square root of the weighted summed z-scores.</p>

<sec id="section17-0044118X11407525">
<title>Suitable Target</title>
<p>Finally, we examined several demographic characteristics to understand their relationship to online harassment victimization in an attempt to clarify the primary correlates identified in existing research. <italic>Sex</italic> (0 = <italic>male</italic>,1 = <italic>female</italic>) and <italic>race</italic> (0 = <italic>white</italic>,1 = <italic>non-White</italic>) were dichotomous, whereas <italic>academic standing</italic> (8th to 12th grade) and <italic>report card grades</italic> (0 = <italic>mostly Fs</italic>, 1 = <italic>mostly Ds</italic>, 2 = <italic>mostly Cs</italic>, 3 = <italic>mostly Bs</italic>, 4 = <italic>mostly As</italic>) were ordinal.</p>

<p>The correlation matrix (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0044118X11407525">Table 3</xref>) illustrated that many of the items derived from routine activities theory constructs were correlated with online harassment victimization. In fact, the correlated risk factors for public and private online harassment victimization were similar. All measures capturing proximity to motivated offenders were positively correlated with online harassment victimization. Only two measures of guardianship were correlated. Having a larger percentage of friends who commit computer deviance and sharing personal information online in risky ways were both positively correlated with victimization. Finally, women and students with lower grades were both seen as more suitable targets for online harassment victimization. The findings from the correlation matrix justified further regression analyses. Although <italic>respondent computer deviance</italic> and <italic>peer computer deviance</italic> were moderately related (<italic>r</italic> = .665), multicollinearity was not a problem in the regression models. No VIF exceeded 10, and no tolerance level was below 0.2. <italic>Respondent computer deviance</italic> had the highest VIF at 2.417 and the lowest tolerance level of 0.414.</p>

<p>The results from the full logistic regression model indicated that five measures were significant predictors of online harassment victimization (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0044118X11407525">Table 4</xref>). Students who maintained social network sites and associated with peers who harassed others online increased their odds of victimization through their proximity to motivated offenders. Parental protective software also increased the odds of harassment. In addition, students decreased their personal guardianship by sharing personal information online in risky ways. Finally, the only significant suitable target measure for predicting online harassment victimization was poor academic performance.</p>

<p>In order to explore whether the risk factors differed across public or private venues, we ran separate models for each form of victimization (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0044118X11407525">Table 4</xref>). The findings suggested that there were some potential differences in the risk factors associated with each form of victimization. Maintaining a social networking site, associating with peers who harass online, and engaging in risky information sharing appeared to make harassment via public venues more likely than through e-mail or instant messaging. By contrast, harassing others, associating with peers who engage in computer deviance, and having lower levels of computer skill and low academic success increased the risk of private harassment more than public harassment. <italic>Z</italic> tests comparing the regression coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0044118X11407525">Paternoster, Brame, Mazerolle, &amp; Piquero, 1998</xref>), however, indicated there were no significant differences between the two models. Thus, these results partitioned by victimization type must be interpreted with extreme caution.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined risk factors that place youth at greater risk for online harassment victimization. The findings suggested that there is significant utility for routine activities theory in explaining online harassment victimization since many of the measures were correlated with the likelihood of victimization. Measures assessing proximity to motivated offenders were more significant correlates of online victimization than guardianship and target suitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0044118X11407525">Bossler &amp; Holt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X11407525">Marcum, 2008</xref>). Maintaining a social networking account and associating with peers who harass others were significant when controlling for other variables. This is sensible given that social network profiles directly expose individuals to the general public which increases the capacity for bullies to target a victim. In addition, the significance of peer harassment suggests that juveniles were directly targeted by their friends for victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, respondent participation in harassment and computer deviance were not directly related to victimization when controlling for peer deviance. This departs from other studies of online harassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0044118X11407525">Bossler &amp; Holt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>) and suggests that individual participation in deviance may be indirectly linked to victimization via peer offending.</p>
<p>The evidence on the importance of guardianship is mixed. Those who post personal information online are at a higher risk of experiencing online harassment victimization because this act gives prospective harassers information about their target. In addition, individuals who willingly provide such information may appear unable to protect themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X11407525">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11407525">Marcum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X11407525">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>). Protective software, however, appeared to increase the likelihood of harassment victimization, incongruent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X11407525">Marcum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11407525">Marcum et al., 2010</xref>). This may be a consequence of parents adopting and implementing this software after victimization has occurred to decrease future harassment, though this cannot be discerned from cross-sectional analyses. Alternatively, this software may create a false sense of security in parents, making them less cognizant of their childâs computer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X11407525">Wolack et al., 2006</xref>). Further research is needed to disentangle the relationship between protective software and victimization.</p>
<p>Finally, the correlation matrix (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0044118X11407525">Table 3</xref>) indicated that women and students with less academic success were more likely to be targets of online harassment. Poor school performance was significant in the regression models when controlling for other factors, congruent with research on bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0044118X11407525">Glew et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0044118X11407525">Nansel et al., 2001</xref>). Students who do not do well in school may be perceived as being less able to defend themselves in a virtual environment. On the other hand, school failure may be a result of experiencing harassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>), which cannot be detected in this cross-sectional analysis.</p>
<p>The finding that being female was significantly correlated with victimization is consistent with the larger literature on harassment and stalking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0044118X11407525">Bocij, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0044118X11407525">Finn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0044118X11407525">Fisher et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0044118X11407525">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407525">Holt &amp; Bossler, 2009</xref>). In fact, 43.7% of the women were victims of online harassment in the previous 12 months, compared with 26.4% of male respondents. The regression models, however, did not find that being female was a significant factor in and of itself. Although the Internet does provide some degree of anonymity, women were more likely to maintain social network sites (<italic>r</italic> = .110*) which facilitates gender identification through screen names and e-mail addresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>). Although women were less likely to commit computer deviance (<italic>r</italic> = â.335*) and associate with those that commit computer deviance in general (<italic>r</italic> = â.189**), neither of these were significant predictors of victimization in the models. On the other hand, women reported having more friends who harassed others online (<italic>r</italic> = .175**), which was a strong predictor of victimization. In fact, when the model was run without <italic>peer harassment</italic>, gender significantly predicted victimization (results not shown). Thus, the unequal distribution of victimization by gender can primarily be explained by their higher usage of social network sites and their association with more friends who use computers to inflict emotional damage to others.</p>
<p>The risk factors found in this study have practical policy implications that may help to reduce the likelihood of online harassment victimization among youth. Increasing recognition of online harassment victimization may help to reduce further victimization by acting on risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X11407525">Marcum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11407525">Marcum et al., 2010</xref>). This has particular importance for parents or guardians since they may be better able to identify when a child is being victimized. The significant challenge for schools regulating behavior that takes place off campus grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X11407525">Wolack et al., 2006</xref>) suggests that alternative strategies may need to be developed. Creating campaigns aimed at educating youth about the risks of associating with online deviant peers, especially those who harass others, or even committing online deviance oneself, could prove to be a more effective deterrent in reducing online victimization than harsh sanctions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0044118X11407525">Bossler &amp; Holt, 2009</xref>, for similar argument regarding education campaigns to decrease malware victimization). Educational programs are also needed to address the ways that youth participate in social networking groups and share and manage personal information in online environments. The popularity of social networking sites among youth makes it easy for rapid dissemination of information with those who the individual may or may not know. As a consequence, educating young people on the ways that risky information sharing increases their risk of victimization may help to reduce the likelihood of person-based cybercrime victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X11407525">Marcum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0044118X11407525">Ybarra et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As with any study, it is important to note and discuss possible limitations. First, this study utilized a cross-sectional study of youth at two schools in one school district in Kentucky. This purposive sample of students are within the age range that regularly utilize technology and face an increased risk of online victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X11407525">Wolack et al., 2006</xref>), though they may not be representative of middle and high school students across the country. Such studies are necessary, however, to begin to identify the prospective risk factors affecting juvenile victimization. The cross-sectional data precluded causal arguments due to a lack of temporal ordering. This is particularly salient in light of the relationships identified between respondent and peer offending, parental protective software, and school performance. Thus, the collection of longitudinal national data is necessary to examine the generalizability of these results and to disentangle these effects.</p>
<p>Second, the dependent variables were dichotomized due to limited variation, reducing the degree to which the distinctive nature of harassment can be assessed. This was, however, necessary to identify which risk factors increase the likelihood that a juvenile may be harassed online, in keeping with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407525">Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0044118X11407525">Ybarra &amp; Mitchell, 2004</xref>). In addition, the dependent measures focused on the frequency of harassment rather than the seriousness or intensity of harassment victimization. Further research is needed to examine whether the risk factors identified in this study are similar for seriousness and length of harassment victimization.</p>
<p>Third, we could not exhaustively measure every possible risk factor within each of the main constructs and had to utilize proxy measures based on risk factors identified in the extant literature on routine activities. For example, one proxy measure of parental supervision was used focusing on computer location. The significance of situating computers in public locations requires further investigation since the measures do not allow for consideration of home design or the presence of a parent or other family member in the room where a computer is used most often. Thus, more distinctive measures may improve our understanding of the impact of computer locations on both victimization and offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11407525">Marcum et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, respondents in this sample utilized student numbers to log in to complete the survey. Though they received significant notice that their student information could not be connected to their responses, this may have led some students to provide more socially acceptable responses to survey questions. The use of an electronic survey in this study, however, was probably more effective in reducing socially desirable responses than if a paper survey instrument had been used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0044118X11407525">Dillman, 2007</xref>). Future research must continue to carefully consider how to appropriately collect data within ethical and cost effective guidelines to examine the problem of computer deviance and victimization.</p>
<p>In conclusion, online harassment victimization among youth is a serious problem. Most studies examining online harassment victimization, however, have primarily examined risk factors rather than theoretically driven correlates and/or have only utilized college samples. This study contributed to our knowledge by examining the linkages between measures derived from routine activities theory constructs and both private and public online harassment victimization among a sample of youth. The findings indicated that routine activities theory is a fruitful theory to help partially explain why some youth are more likely to be harassed online than others. In addition, this study provided practical policies for schools and parents to implement while also providing research directions that will help us better understand the causes of online harassment victimization and what to do about it.</p>
