<abstract>
<p>The effect of zinc oxide and testing rate on shear strength of natural rubber-based pressure-sensitive adhesives was studied using coumarone-indene resin and toluene as the tackifier resin and solvent, respectively. The range of zinc oxide concentration varied from 0 to 60 parts per hundred parts (phr) of rubber, whereas the testing rate was from 10 to 50 cm/min. Viscosity and shear strength of adhesive were determined using a Brookfield viscometer and a Lloyd Adhesion Tester, respectively. Results show that the viscosity of adhesive increases gradually with the increase in zinc oxide concentration. For a fixed coating thickness, shear strength increases with zinc oxide loading up to 20 phr, after which it drops with further addition of zinc oxide, an observation that is attributed to varying degree of cohesive strength of adhesive. Shear strength increases with coating thickness and testing rate, suggesting that the shear strength is both thickness- and rate-dependent.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fujita et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095244312445524">1</xref>
</sup> have reported the effects of miscibility and viscoelasticity on shear creep resistance of natural rubber (NR)-based pressure-sensitive adhesives. Results show that the holding time of miscible pressure-sensitive adhesive tended to decrease as the tackifier content increased, an observation which is attributed to the decrease in plateau modulus of the adhesive with increasing tackifier content. However, the holding time of an immiscible adhesive system varies with the tackifier system which depends on the extent of phase separation. Recently, we have carried out several studies on the shear properties of filled and unfilled pressure-sensitive adhesives prepared from NR and epoxidized natural rubber (ENR). Studies on unfilled NR- and ENR-based adhesives indicated that for a fixed coating thickness, the shear strength decreases with increasing resin concentration, an observation which is attributed to the decreasing cohesive strength of adhesive as resin loading is increased due to the diluting effect of resin, which, in turn, weakens the adhesive to resist flow during shearing action.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095244312445524">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095244312445524">3</xref>
</sup> Shear strength increases with the coating thickness. The effect of molecular weight of NR and ENR of unfilled adhesives was also investigated systematically.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095244312445524">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095244312445524">5</xref>
</sup> Results show that shear strength passes through an optimum molecular weight of 8.50 × 10<sup>4</sup>, 6.63 × 10<sup>4</sup> and 4.14 × 10<sup>4</sup> for NR, ENR 25 and ENR 50, respectively. As epoxidation increases, the intermolecular interaction between rubber and resin is enhanced resulting in better compatibility as indicated by the lower optimum molecular weight as the degree of epoxidation in NR is increased. We have also carried out a few investigations on the shear properties of NR-based adhesives filled with barium chloride, silica and magnesium oxide.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095244312445524">6</xref>

</sup> It is observed that shear strength exhibits a maximum value at 10 and 40 phr of barium chloride and silica loadings, respectively. However, the shear strength decreases continuously with magnesium oxide loading where a significant drop is observed after 30 phr filler content. With regard to the effect of zinc oxide and testing rate on the shear property of filled NR adhesive, no research work has been reported so far. Thus, it is the aim of this article to report some of our findings in this area of interest.</p>

<title>Experimental</title>
<sec id="section3-0095244312445524">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>One grade of Standard Malaysian Rubber (SMR L) was used as the elastomer to prepare the pressure-sensitive adhesive. Coumarone-indene resin, toluene and zinc oxide were used as the tackifier, solvent and filler, respectively, in this study. The chemicals were freshly supplied, of commercial grades and used as received without further purification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0095244312445524">
<title>Preparation of adhesive</title>
<p>SMR L was masticated on a two-roll mill for 10 min to facilitate easy dissolution in solvent. Five grams of the milled rubber sheet were shredded into smaller strips and dissolved in 30 ml of toluene. The rubber solution was tightly closed and kept in a conditioned room for 24 h to ensure complete dissolution. This was followed by the addition of 2 g of pulverized coumarone-indene resin which corresponded to 40 phr of resin. Six different weights of zinc oxide, that is 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 g corresponding to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 phr of filler were then added slowly to the rubber solution with constant stirring to prepare the pressure-sensitive adhesives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0095244312445524">
<title>Viscosity testing</title>
<p>Viscosity of adhesive was measured by a Brookfield Viscometer (model DV-II + Pro). The spindle (CPE-51) and metal cup (CPE-44Y) were used in this testing. The speed of the viscometer was set at 1 r/min. The spindle and metal cup were cleaned with isopropyl alcohol to eliminate any impurities. A little amount of adhesive—sufficient to coat the spindle surface—was placed on the metal cup which was then locked on to the viscometer. The average viscosity was computed from at least five readings recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0095244312445524">
<title>Shear testing</title>
<p>The dimension of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate for shear test was 20 cm × 4 cm. A SHEEN Hand Coater (SHEEN Instruments Ltd. Teddington, MIDDX, UK) was used to coat the center of the substrate with a coating area of 10 cm × 4 cm dimension. Then, the coated area was covered with another strip of uncoated PET film to form a test specimen. For each formulation, triplicate specimens were prepared. Four different coating thicknesses, that is 30, 60, 90 and 120 µm were used in this study. The coated sample was then conditioned at room temperature for 24 h before testing. Shear force was measured by a Lloyd Adhesion Tester (Lloyd Instruments Ltd. Hampshire, UK) operating at 5 different testing speeds, that is 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 cm/min. The testing distance was set at 10 cm which corresponded to the length of coated area of specimen. The peak force of a plot of force against time was taken as the shear force. Shear strength was defined as the shear force per unit area of testing (N/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>Results obtained from this study are discussed with respect to the effect of zinc oxide loading and rate of testing on the viscosity and shear strength of SMR L-based pressure-sensitive adhesives.</p>
<sec id="section8-0095244312445524">
<title>Viscosity</title>
<p>The effect of zinc oxide loading on the viscosity of adhesive is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244312445524">Figure 1</xref>. The plot clearly shows that viscosity increases gradually with increases in zinc oxide loading. This observation is attributed to the thickening effect of the zinc oxide, which acts as the filler in the SMR L-based pressure-sensitive adhesive. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244312445524">Figure 1</xref> also shows that the variation in viscosity with zinc oxide loading is nearly linear in nature. This observation suggests that the apparent interaction between zinc oxide and the adhesive increases linearly with increasing zinc oxide loading within the concentration range of filler investigated in this study, that is the concentration effect of zinc oxide is observed in this study.</p>

<title>Effect of zinc oxide</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095244312445524">Figure 2</xref> indicates the dependence of shear strength on zinc oxide loading at 30 cm/min for various coating thicknesses. Shear strength increases with zinc oxide up to 20 phr loading, after which it decreases with further addition of the filler. This observation is presumably attributed to the increase in cohesive strength as the amount of zinc oxide is increased and a maximum value is reached at 20 phr of the filler. However, further increase in zinc oxide loading decreases the cohesive strength of the adhesive due to the dilution effect of the filler which in turn weakens the adhesive to resist flow during shearing action. The addition of filler reduces the number of entanglements per unit volume and increases the long-term compliance and flow.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095244312445524">9</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the rubber which acts as the binder in the adhesive system will lose its holding power as the zinc oxide content is further increased. In fact, minimal decreases in the shear strength are observed after 40 phr of zinc oxide loading where zinc oxide becomes the dominant component and exhibits greater significant effect on the shear property in the adhesive system. The dependence of shear strength on zinc oxide loading is also reflected by the normalized plot as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0095244312445524">Figure 3</xref>. The graph again indicates that maximum shear strength is observed at 20 phr of zinc oxide loading. It decreases with further loading of the filler due to the decrease in cohesive strength of adhesive.</p>

<title>Effect of coating thickness</title>
<p>The variation in shear strength with coating thickness is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0095244312445524">Figure 4</xref> for various zinc oxide loadings. For a fixed zinc oxide loading, the shear strength increases with coating thickness, an observation that is attributed to the increasing amount of adhesive as the coating thickness is increased. The higher amount of adhesive provides additional shearing resistance, hence increases the cohesive strength of the adhesive. The viscoelastic behavior of the rubber component enhances the shear resistance of the adhesive as the coating thickness is increased. A marked increase in shear strength is observed after 60 µm of coating thickness, an observation similar to that reported in our previous study for unfilled adhesive.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095244312445524">2</xref>
</sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0095244312445524">Figure 4</xref> also shows that for a fixed coating thickness, adhesive with 20 phr zinc oxide consistently indicates higher shear strength compared with the other samples. This observation is ascribed to the optimum zinc oxide loading that gives the maximum cohesive strength as discussed earlier. The lowest shear strength is exhibited by the unfilled adhesive, that is 0 phr zinc oxide. The normalized shear strength which is based on 0 phr zinc oxide is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0095244312445524">Figure 5</xref>. It also shows that 20 phr-filled sample consistently gives the highest shear strength, followed by 40 phr, 60 phr and unfilled samples. However, in this normalized plot, the 60-µm coated sample indicates a maximum value for the filled samples. This finding is attributed to the nonlinear relationship between coating thickness and shear strength.<sup>

<title>Effect of testing rate</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0095244312445524">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0095244312445524">7</xref> shows the dependence of shear strength on the testing rate for 60 and 120 µm coating thickness, respectively. At a fixed zinc oxide loading, the shear strength increases with increasing rate of testing for both the coating thickness investigated. This observation is attributed to the increasing effect of elastic component of the adhesive as the testing rate is increased. The response of pressure-sensitive adhesive to the stress is of a viscoelastic nature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095244312445524">9</xref>
</sup> At lower rate of testing, the shear failure is essentially due to cohesive failure, whereas at higher shear rate the shear strength is primarily governed by the elastic component of rubber, which results in adhesive failure. Adhesive hardens at high strain level to become a tough solid; the adhesive layer itself cannot be easily ruptured.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095244312445524">10</xref>
</sup> From the graphs, it is observed that the rate of increase in shear strength for the 20 phr-filled adhesive is lower than that of the unfilled (0 phr) adhesive. This observation suggests that the optimum zinc oxide loading, that is 20 phr, is less rate dependent due to the existence of maximum cohesiveness between adhesive components and zinc oxide as shown by the maximum shear strength at 20 phr loading. In other words, the effect of viscoelastic response to shear strength is more significant for the unfilled pressure-sensitive adhesives.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>From this study, the following conclusions can be drawn. The viscosity of SMR L-based pressure-sensitive adhesive increases with an increase in zinc oxide loading. This observation is associated with the thickening effect of the zinc oxide in the adhesive. This concentration effect has an apparent linear relationship with the zinc oxide loading within the concentration range investigated. Shear strength shows a maximum value at 20 phr zinc oxide loading, indicating maximum cohesive strength at this optimum filler content. Further addition of zinc oxide shows a decrease in shear strength due to the dilution effect of the filler, which in turn weakens the shearing resistance of the adhesive. Shear strength also increases with coating thickness as a result of increasing amount of adhesive as coating thickness is increased. Increasing rate of testing would be accompanied by an increase in shear strength, an observation that is ascribed to the increasing effect of elastic component of the adhesive as the testing rate is increased.</p>
