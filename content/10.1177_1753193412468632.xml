<abstract>
<p>Reconstruction of digital defects using the venous flap offer several advantages but remained unpopular owing to levels of venous congestion rates. We performed animal studies to test the hypothesis that an arterio-venous shunt increases pressure for peripheral flap perfusion and decreases venous congestion. Using an abdominal adipofascial flap model in six male Sprague–Dawley rats, microcirculation was modified as follows: type I – arterial flap; type II – flow-through arterio-venous flap (AVF); and type III – shunt-restricted AVF. In type I flaps, blood flow was observed to be unidirectional in both arterioles and venules. In type I flaps, blood flow was observed to be unidirectional in both arterioles and venules. In type II flaps, blood flow oscillated without a dominant direction and came to a standstill. In type III flaps, blood flowed proximally in a reverse direction whereas distally, flow was similar to type I flaps. In a clinical series, 21 patients received a total of 22 shunt-restricted AVFs. All 22 clinical flaps survived; four flaps suffered epidermolysis but recovered without full thickness loss.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Refinements of surgical techniques and increase in knowledge of flap anatomy have contributed to major advances for soft tissue coverage of digital defects. The search continues, however, for the ideal flap that will fit both the functional demands of the hand while limiting donor morbidity. More recent advances, including both local options such as the adipofascial turnover flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412468632">Braga Silva et al., 2012</xref>) and free flap options such as the anterolateral thigh flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412468632">Meky and Safoury, 2011</xref>) represent attempts to meet these criteria but continue to be limited in its applications and versatility.</p>
<p>As a reconstructive option, a venous flap potentially constitutes the ideal flap. By definition, a venous flap is one where the circulation enters and leaves entirely via the venous system, although the commonest modification in clinical practice is that of an arterialized venous flap (AVF) where the afferent vein is supplied by an arterial inflow and the efferent vein drains into a recipient vein. First investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412468632">Nakayama et al. (1981)</xref> using a rat model, the feasibility of AVFs were further supported by other experimental investigators including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412468632">Mundy and Panje (1984)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412468632">Baek et al. (1985)</xref>. Shortly after, the first clinical series of AVFs followed with reports by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753193412468632">Yoshimura et al. (1987)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193412468632">Tsai et al. (1987)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412468632">Chavoin et al. (1987)</xref>, as well as several others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412468632">Chen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412468632">Fukui et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412468632">Galumbeck and Freeman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412468632">Nishi et al., 1989</xref>). Compared with other conventional options, AVFs pose several advantages: they are easy to harvest and obviate the need to sacrifice any major artery. For digital defects, they potentially offer a custom-made, thin and pliable flap that fits easily around joints and allows effective mobilization through the full ranges of motion of digits. But perhaps one of the biggest advantages is the lack of donor site morbidity. With careful planning, venous flaps can be raised from virtually any area of the body that contains subcutaneous veins, with the donor site closed primarily. In addition, they allow for the possibility for simultaneous vascularized tendon grafting with inclusion of the palmaris longus tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412468632">Inoue and Tamura, 1991</xref>) or cutaneous nerves to create a sensate flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193412468632">Woo et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the years, however, AVFs have remained largely unpopular owing to the unpredictability of published survival rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412468632">Chen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412468632">De Lorenzi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412468632">Galumbeck and Freeman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753193412468632">Xiu and Chen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753193412468632">Yan et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753193412468632">Yilmaz et al., 1996</xref>). In a recent systematic review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753193412468632">Yan et al., 2010b</xref>), congestion rates of up to 100% in certain series and a partial necrosis rate and total necrosis rate of 42.5% and 7.5%, respectively, were reported. While it is accepted that a 100% flap success rate cannot be universally achieved for any types of flap, the problem seemed to be worse in venous flaps, as often the reason for flap failure remains unclear, making it difficult or even impossible to reliably prevent future flap failures. One possible explanation could be the ongoing uncertainty regarding exact mechanisms of venous flap perfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412468632">Krishnan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412468632">Moshammer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412468632">Mutaf et al., 1998</xref>), which has prompted several authors to attempt different strategies to improve flap survival rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412468632">Byun et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412468632">Inada et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412468632">Kovacs, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753193412468632">Woo et al., 1998</xref>) with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Since 2009, we have followed a relatively simple approach where all flaps are designed in an antegrade fashion and shunt restriction applied with either liga-clips or suture ligation to achieve two objectives: first, to simulate a ‘complete’ valve thus eliminating the arterio-venous shunting effect and blood ‘bypassing’ the flap; and second, to reduce the intraluminal pressure in the efferent vein allowing blood to re-enter the vein and drain the flap.</p>
<p>Our earlier clinical success with this novel flap design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412468632">Lin et al., 2010</xref>) has encouraged us to investigate further the physiological and microcirculatory basis of shunt-restriction in a venous flap using an experimental rat model. In addition, we report on the outcomes of an expanded clinical series with the use of the shunt-restricted arterio-venous flap in various digital defects.</p>

A total of six adult male Sprague–Dawley (S–D) rats weighing around 250–300 g each were used.

<p>A 4 × 3-cm abdominal skin flap based on the left thoracoepigastric vessels was raised above the abdominal muscle fascia.

To investigate the effects of shunting, perfusion of the flap was subsequently modified three times to simulate three types of flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412468632">Figure 2(a)</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412468632">(c)</xref>).</p>

<p>To facilitate the observation of microcirculation, the vasculature on the peripheral margins of the flap (the thinnest part of the flap) was chosen. C-markers were placed in two zones: proximal and distal flap to ensure that the same areas of vascular networks were observed every time. In a pilot study (unpublished data) we have previously found that the flow pattern following modifications in each of the different flaps was consistent for up to 150 min. We therefore do not expect any further changes to the flow patterns once the modification is made. In this present study, consecutive microcirculatory observations of the same areas on the flap were made following modifications for a period of 30 min. Each experiment started with the creation of an arterial flap (type I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412468632">Figure 2(a)</xref>). After 30 min, the femoral artery was repaired to the inferior epigastric vein, and shunt-restriction created by the placement of a microvascular clamp in the middle of the vein (type III, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412468632">Figure 2(c)</xref>). Finally, the microvascular clamp was removed to recreate a flow-through AVF (type II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412468632">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The reason for creating a type III flap (shunt-restricted AVF) before a type II flap (unrestricted AVF) was because we have found previously that venous congestion and constant oozing from the flap edges in a type II flap makes it difficult for further microcirculatory observation after a few minutes. Creating an unrestricted AVF (type II) first would have made it impossible for us to subsequently observe the microcirculation in a shunt-restricted AVF (type III).</p>
<p>The experiment was repeated for a total of six rats to ensure reproducibility of results. Directions of blood flow were recorded using real-time microscopic observation (100× magnification) that was connected to a video camera (Nikon, Japan) and displayed on a Sony Trinitron video monitor (Sony, Japan).</p>

<title>Clinical series</title>
<p>From May 2009 to September 2011, a total of 22 shunt-restricted venous flaps were performed for digital defects in 21 patients, with an age range of 17–60 years (mean, 37 years). Twenty patients were male and one female. Fifteen AVFs were used for resurfacing of acute traumatic defects, six AVFs for resurfacing of defects following release of scar contractures, and one AVF for reconstruction after extirpation of a malignant tumour. There were two cases where a nerve was incorporated into the flap to create a sensate flap following segmental nerve loss.</p>
<sec id="section6-1753193412468632">
<title>Operative planning</title>
<p>All flaps were harvested from the ipsilateral distal volar forearm. If possible, the flap was designed on the ulnar aspect of the forearm where the skin was relatively hairless, and where the donor site was more concealable. Furthermore, this area of the forearm tends to overlie the territory of the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm in case an innervated flap was needed. A venous tourniquet was first applied to facilitate mapping of veins. Following this, an arterial tourniquet was applied and exploration of the defect(s) commenced. Volar and dorsal incisions were made as appropriate to prepare the recipient arteries and veins, respectively. Once the defect was confirmed, a semi-transparent template was placed over the defect and then transposed onto the forearm donor site. The template was reversed to ensure an antegrade design (blood flow in the natural direction of the veins). Once the flap template and pedicles were confirmed, the flap was raised to contain only skin, subcutaneous vein and just enough subcutaneous fat to avoid damaging the vein(s) and subdermal plexus. Shunt restriction was then performed as according to the different venous configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412468632">Figure 3</xref>). Final flap inset and anastomosis were similar to any other arterial flap. Once anastomosis was complete, the typical appearance of the flap should resemble conventional flaps in terms of colour, turgor, temperature and capillary refill, although in certain cases it may take a few minutes to pink up as the venule-arteriole shunts opened up. Postoperatively, the patients were nursed in a warm environment for up to five days. No antithrombotic agent was administered, even when mild to moderate venous congestion was encountered (see below).</p>

<p>Type I flap: an arterial flap supplied by the femoral artery and drained by the superior epigastric vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412468632">Figure 2(a)</xref>). Macroscopically, the flap remained healthy and pink throughout the entire 30 min. Microscopically, blood flow at both proximal and distal markers was observed to be unidirectional and constant. The direction of blood flow seemed to be away from the main arterioles towards the venules via capillary networks, and then in the direction of the major draining vein. This phenomenon was observed for both the proximal and distal parts of the flap, and recorded as the benchmark for ‘physiological’ blood flow that was required for adequate flap perfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193412468632">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Type III flap: a shunt-restricted AVF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412468632">Figure 2(c)</xref>). As mentioned, a shunt-restricted AVF was created before an unrestricted AVF to facilitate observation of both microscopic and macroscopic circulations. Microscopically, flow at the proximal part of the flap initially followed the same pattern as the arterial flap. Within minutes, however, the flow slowed down and almost came to a standstill in the venules before reversing directions to run contrary to that of the arterial flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753193412468632">Figure 5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753193412468632">(b)</xref>). At the distal end of the flap, both the direction and flowrate in the arterioles and venules were similar to those observed in the arterial flaps. Macroscopically, venous congestion and blood stasis occurred only in the proximal and middle flap, but not in the distal flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753193412468632">Figure 5(c)</xref>).</p>

This phenomenon started in the proximal part of the flap, and then spread to the distal part and eventually all the blood flow in the flap became directionless. At the end of 30 min, there seemed to be almost stasis in all the blood vessels.

<p>Including the case that required re-exploration, there were altogether six flaps (27%) that developed venous congestion to varying degrees. In all cases, the congestion occurred only at the afferent end of the flap, arose on the second or third postoperative day and gradually subsided within seven to 14 days. No intervention was required in any instance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1753193412468632">Figure 8</xref>). Four of the six flaps (including the flap that required re-exploration) developed superficial blistering/epidermolysis. However, re-epithelialization was evident by the time the blisters sloughed, without any flap developing full-thickness necrosis or fibrosis. Of the different venous configurations, epidermolysis and congestion did occur at a substantially higher rate in those with an I-pattern as compared with the other patterns. At an average follow-up of two to three months, all flaps were well healed, including those that had developed mild or moderate congestion postoperatively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The venous flap offers several advantages as a reconstructive option. If harvested from the distal forearm, it is composed entirely of skin and minimal subcutaneous tissues to provide a thin and pliable flap that can effectively wrap around joints and resurface the inside of digits and web spaces, making them potential frontline choices for defects on the radial border of the index finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1753193412468632">Figure 9</xref>), volar defects of the ring and little fingers, combined volar-dorsal defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1753193412468632">Figure 7</xref>) or defects affecting multiple fingers. In comparison, scarring or injury to the surrounding tissues often precludes the use of local options. Regional flaps have a limited arc of motion, and often leave an ugly donor site. Free flaps offer a more versatile reconstruction, but conventional arterial fasciocutaneous free flaps are often too bulky, while thinner flaps would often require super- microsurgery and perforator dissection techniques that are time-consuming and technically challenging.</p>

<p>In 1993, a classification system for venous flaps was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412468632">Thatte and Thatte (1993)</xref> as follows: type I or unipedicled venous flap; type II or bipedicled venous flaps; and type III or arterio-venous flaps (AVFs). Despite early attempts to define the clinical indications for each of these different flap types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412468632">Fukui et al., 1989</xref>) both types I and II venous flaps rapidly became obsolete because of unfavourable outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412468632">Fukui et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193412468632">Nishi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753193412468632">Yan et al., 2010a</xref>). Probably because of the higher oxygen tension and nutrients available within an AVF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753193412468632">Wolff and Dollinger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1753193412468632">Yuen and Leung, 1991</xref>), these enjoyed an initial popularity with their higher success rate, but this was soon curtailed by its continued notoriety as a flap whose inevitable fate continues to be either venous congestion or peripheral ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193412468632">Nishi, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Several strategies have been proposed to improve the survival predictability of AVF, such as anastomosing multiple draining veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412468632">Inada et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753193412468632">Woo et al., 1998</xref>), using a relatively small afferent and relatively large efferent vein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412468632">Kovacs, 1998</xref>), as well as various mechanical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412468632">Byun et al., 1995</xref>) and chemical delay tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412468632">Belousov et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1753193412468632">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Despite these various attempts, a reliable and predictable method of ensuring success in flap survival remains elusive; this is hardly surprising, as the root cause of venous congestion has not been effectively addressed.</p>
<p>We postulate that the root problem of AVFs remain the unresolved issue of unrestricted shunting. Because of the lower resistance in the efferent end of the flap, blood preferentially flows through the arterio-venous shunt instead of into the peripheries, thus bypassing the flap. Furthermore, the pressure within the efferent vein(s) effectively equilibrates with the afferent arterial pressure. If this pressure exceeds that of the peripheral tissue, blood cannot drain from the peripheral tissue with resultant venous congestion.</p>
<p>Our relatively simple approach has been to design a shunt-restricted antegrade flap where the direct arterio-venous shunting is largely eliminated in order to transmit higher pressure to push blood into the peripheries of the flap. At the same time, the pressure in the efferent vein is reduced to an almost physiological venous level to allow blood to return into the draining vein. Our idea of shunt-restriction was originally derived from the concept of the retrograde flap, where the valves act as shunt restrictors to divert blood into the peripheries. First suggested and investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412468632">Moshammer et al. (2003)</xref>, the retrograde flap had initially seemed promising by its convincing demonstration of a significantly better peripheral enhancement of angiographic contrast. The same group reported a clinical series of 13 retrograde venous flaps with reasonable success although congestion remained problematic with epidermolysis in six cases and 7%–15% full-thickness necrosis in two cases necessitating full-thickness skin grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412468632">Koch et al., 2004</xref>). Subsequently, other authors using retrograde flaps reported similar problems with venous congestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412468632">Koch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753193412468632">Yilmaz et al., 1996</xref>). We postulate that a retrograde flap, although initially effective, eventually creates a non-physiological environment where the valves are not built to withstand a sustained high arterial pressure. Within days, the valves may become incompetent, thereby permitting direct arterio-venous shunting. Alternatively, veno-arteriole shunts may open and simply bypass the arterialized vein. Finally, it is worth considering that even if the valves remain competent, they are almost impossible to locate prior to harvest. If the most proximal valve is located immediately after the anastomosis site at the afferent end of the vein, there is always the possibility that little or no blood is able to get into the flap at all with resultant flap ischaemia.</p>
<sec id="section11-1753193412468632">
<title>Proposed hypothesis for microcirculation in a shunt-restricted arteriovenous flap</title>
<p>Our philosophy was therefore to create an antegrade flap where we can avoid the uncertainties of a retrograde flap altogether and place a reliable ‘valve’ at a precise location of our choosing. The idea of artificially creating a valve was first derived from the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193412468632">Suzuki et al. (1994)</xref> who had included a shunt restriction group in their experimental series. Using a rabbit ear chamber method, they observed the following conclusions: First, flap survival depended on a microcirculation that was constant and unidirectional. In our study, the arterial flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412468632">Figure 2(a)</xref>) demonstrated a consistent, unidirectional flow in all vessels viewed under magnification. The direction of blood flow can be presumed to flow from the artery to arteriole, and then to follow a Harvesian pattern of arteriole–capillary–venule and ultimately into the draining vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1753193412468632">Figure 10</xref>). In contrast, blood flow in the unrestricted arterio-venous flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412468632">Figure 2(b)</xref>) initially travelled unidirectionally, then slowed down and started to oscillate according to the heartbeat and finally went into stasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753193412468632">Figure 5(a)</xref>). Macroscopically, the whole flap became congested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753193412468632">Figure 5(b)</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The second conclusion from the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193412468632">Suzuki et al. (1994)</xref> was that ultimate flap survival was not dependent on the direction of the blood flow, i.e. what seemed to be more important was a constant and unidirectional flow rather than the actual direction of flow. In the unrestricted arterio-venous shunt group 12 of their 16 flaps survived, of which four developed a reversal in the direction of flow. In the shunt-restricted group, four of the six flaps that survived developed a reversal in direction. In our experimental study with the shunt-restricted flap, blood flow initially followed a similar physiological pattern to that of the arterial flap in the proximal part of the flap, and then slowed down and ultimately started to flow in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193412468632">Figure 4(b)</xref>). It is likely that the change in direction represented shunts opening between venules and arterioles, or it could represent the higher arterial pressure forcing blood backwards from the vein into the venules, and thence into the capillaries to perfuse the flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1753193412468632">Figure 11(A)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1753193412468632">(B)</xref>). In any case, this ‘reversed’ non-physiological perfusion pattern may represent the key mechanism for venous flap survival and provides evidence that a flap can survive without the classic Harvesian model of circulation (arteriole–capillary–venule) as long as there is a constant flow of blood. In the unrestricted flap, initial arterial pressure also forces blood ‘backwards’ initially in a reversed fashion to perfuse the flap and opened the shunts. However, the high pressure within the arterialized vein prevented the deoxygenated blood from returning into the vein and draining the flap effectively and causing it to oscillate instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1753193412468632">Figure 12</xref>).</p>

<p>Proposed microcirculation of the shunt–restricted arterio-venous flap. In the proximal end of a shunt-restricted AVF blood flow, blood flow initially followed a similar non-physiological ‘reversed’ pattern for flap perfusion (A), and also opened up shunts (B) as similar to the unrestricted AVF. However, owing to the high arterial pressure, venous blood is similarly unable to re-enter the vein following shunting (B(c) and (d)). With the clamp, however, the higher arterial pressure caused by the ‘blockage’ forced more ‘reversed’ perfusion and also more blood into the shunts, causing more blood to be driven further up the arteriole into the distal flap (C). However, unlike the unrestricted AVF, an area of zero or very low physiological pressure distally allows blood to re-enter and effectively drain the flap.</p>

<p>The third conclusion was that the ligation of the arterio-venous fistula (i.e. shunt restriction) did not prevent blood from reaching the distal peripheries of the flap. This phenomenon of distal flap perfusion was commented upon by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193412468632">Suzuki et al. (1994)</xref> but not elaborated. We postulated that because of the clamp, two things happen. First, the higher arterial pressure caused by the ‘blockage’ forced more ‘reversed’ perfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1753193412468632">Figure 11(A)</xref>) and also more blood into the shunts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1753193412468632">Figure 11(B)</xref>) while perfusing the flap, as previously discussed in the design of retrograde flaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412468632">Moshammer et al., 2003</xref>). Second, unlike the unrestricted AVF, the clamp created an area of zero or very low physiological pressure distally in the draining vein for blood to re-enter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1753193412468632">Figure 11(C)</xref>). Proximally, a non-physiological perfusion pattern probably became dominant, with blood flowing from venules–capillaries–arterioles although now there was an avenue for the blood to move further afield and drain into the distal vein. Distally, a physiological pattern of perfusion was probably dominant, with blood coming from arterioles that had originated from proximal shunts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1753193412468632">Figure 11(C)</xref>).</p>
<p>Why does venous congestion still occur proximally in the shunt-restricted AVF? We postulated that blood flow from non-physiological perfusion in the proximal flap needed to compete with blood that was already in the arteriole. The blood in the arteriole originated from the more proximal arterio-venous shunts and created a pressure gradient from proximal to distal. It was interesting to note that congestion did not become apparent until the second or third postoperative day. We postulated that small side branches (non-functioning venules) that were not detectable intra-operatively became dilated over a few days and permitted more shunting with resultant higher pressure in the proximal draining arteriole. Future improvements to the shunt-restricted AVF design should focus on reducing the pressure within the arteriole. In clinical practice, this means ligating the vein of an ‘I-flap’ more proximally at approximately one-third instead of mid-way from the proximal end of the flap, so that a longer segment of vein is available for venous drainage. In this present clinical series, there were almost no cases of venous congestion in flaps with a H or II design; this reinforces the theory that venous congestion can be minimized if the area for venous drainage is maximized. Therefore, our recommendations for flap choice are as follows: II or H-patterns, followed by the Y/λ-patterns, and finally the I-pattern.</p>
<p>Limitations exist in this experimental series. To date, animal models remain widely used for observation of venous flap circulation with the commonest being the rabbit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193412468632">Suzuki et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1753193412468632">Yuen and Leung, 1991</xref>), dog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412468632">Baek et al., 1985</xref>) or rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1753193412468632">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Unless the entire vasculature can be viewed in real time, including capillaries and the opening and closing of all shunts, most animal models allow only the formation of hypotheses. Further studies to delineate the microcirculation of venous flap using three-dimensional computer tomography imaging techniques may be of benefit, but at present the resolution of these imaging technologies remain insufficient to provide more information. To test the robustness of our hypothesis, however, we have conducted experimental studies using standard animal models and observed our findings repeatedly for prolonged periods to ensure the microcirculation remained unchanged following modification. We have also repeatedly correlated our microscopic findings with macroscopic appearances. Finally, we have proved the success of our hypotheses in a clinical series, where we have experienced no long-term failure in any of the flaps.</p>
<p>Our clinical series has convinced us that shunt restriction in arterio-venous flaps has the theoretical advantages of enhancing peripheral perfusion while decreasing venous congestion, and to encourage its continued use as a safe and reliable flap in reconstruction of hand/digit defects.</p>
