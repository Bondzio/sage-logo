<p><bold>Background.</bold> Elevated cavopulmonary pressure early after surgical creation of cavopulmonary connections is an important hemodynamic problem with grave prognostic significance. We examined the effect of administration of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) to patients with elevated cavopulmonary pressure in the early postoperative period. <bold>Methods.</bold> We retrospectively reviewed data pertaining to all 14 patients with superior (n = 6) and total (n = 8) cavopulmonary connections who were treated with iNO in the early postoperative period during an interval of six years. Changes in the cavopulmonary pressure, the transpulmonary gradient, and the oxygen saturation after the institution of iNO were evaluated. The preoperative characteristics of the patients were compared to those of a control group of patients with cavopulmonary operations not treated with iNO postoperatively. <bold>Results.</bold> Twelve hours after the initiation of iNO therapy, significant reduction in the cavopulmonary pressure (16.6 ± 3.5 mm Hg vs 18.1 ± 2.3 mm Hg, <italic>P</italic> = .006), reduction in the cavopulmonary gradient (7.0 ± 3.5 mm Hg vs 9.8 ± 3.7 mm Hg, <italic>P</italic> = .009), and elevation of the arterial oxygen saturation (84.5% ± 6.0% vs 78.7% ± 5.9%, P = .001) were observed. Linear correlation analysis confirmed tendencies for reduction in the cavopulmonary pressure (<italic>P</italic> = .13), reduction in the cavopulmonary gradient (<italic>P</italic> = .02), and elevation of the oxygen saturation (<italic>P</italic> = .10). Compared to the control group, the treated patients tended to have higher preoperative pulmonary arterial pressures (PAPs) 17 (11-30) mm Hg versus 12 (10-25) mm Hg, <italic>P</italic> = .10; higher pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) 2.04 (0.27-6.94) Wood units versus 1.02 (0.49-5.20) Wood units, <italic>P</italic> = .37; and longer bypass times 154 (41-218) versus 91 (15-276) minutes, <italic>P</italic> = .13. <bold>Conclusions.</bold> Administration of iNO was associated with diminuition of cavopulmonary pressure and transpulmonary gradient and increasing oxygen saturation in our small group of patients. In our experience selected patients with preoperatively elevated PAP above 17 mm and PVR above 2 Wood units can undergo cavopulmonary operations with iNO treatment early postoperatively.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The introduction of the staged cavopulmonary connection operations greatly improved the outcome of patients with functionally univentricular hearts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111424294">1</xref></sup> It involves creation of an unobstructed flow from the systemic veins to the lungs without using a subpulmonary pumping chamber. Typically this is achieved at two stages. First the superior vena cava is anastomosed to the pulmonary artery—bidirectional Glenn anastomosis (BDG). After a period of time, the inferior vena cava is also connected to the pulmonary artery—total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC). As blood flows passively to the lungs, this type of circulation is critically dependent on low pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111424294">2</xref></sup> Elevated pulmonary pressure causes significant hemodynamic disturbances and the treatment of such patients can be challenging. There are several reasons for transient elevation of the PVR in the early postoperative period after congenital heart surgery. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) has been proven to be an effective selective pulmonary vasodilator in biventricular circulations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111424294">3</xref></sup> but its role after cavopulmonary operations is not so clear. This study presents our experience with iNO therapy in a group of children after cavopulmonary operations.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>The study included all 14 patients with cavopulmonary connections treated with iNO postoperatively for a six-year period in our center. During the same period 139 cavopulmonary operations were been performed in our institution and the study population represents about 10% of them. A control group of the same number of patients with cavopulmonary operations who were not treated with iNO during the same period of time was randomly chosen. Their preoperative and intraoperative characteristics were compared to those of the treated patients. The age of the treated patients at the time of surgery was 43.8 (range 4.8-108) and of the control group was 39.0 (range 7-131); <italic>P</italic> = .80. The diagnoses of the treated patients and of the control group are presented in<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150135111424294">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Surgery and Intensive Care</title>
<p>Operations in the treated group included six BDGs and eight TCPCs. All TCPCs in the group were performed with an extracardiac conduit between the inferior vena cava and the pulmonary artery, and a fenestration between the conduit and the atrium was created. Concomitant procedures were atrioseptectomy in 3 patients, Damus-Kaye-Stansel operation in one patient, and resection of subaortic stenosis in one. The strategy in the surgical, anesthesiological, and intensive care during the period remained unchanged. The cavopulmonary operations were performed under extracorporeal circulation with beating heart. The aorta was clamped only during atrioseptectomy or if another concomitant intracardiac surgical procedure was needed. Lines in the internal jugular or subclavian veins were routinely introduced to measure the pressure in the cavopulmonary system. Transthoracic lines were placed in the atrium and used to measure the loading pressure of the ventricle. The transpulmonary gradient was calculated as the difference between the cavopulmonary pressure and the pressure in the atrium. Arterial lines were used to monitor arterial pressure and collect blood samples for blood gas analysis. Milrinone (0.5-0.75 µg/kg per min) was administered routinely in the operating room and continued in the intensive care unit. The additional inotropic support was guided by the hemodynamic condition of the patients and included dopamine (3-8 µg/kg per min), epinephrine (0.05-0.15 µg/kg per min), and dobutamine (5-20 µg/kg per min). The total inotropic need of the patients was calculated as an inotropic score:</p>
<p>Dopamine (µg/kg per min) + Dobutamine (µg/kg per min) + 100× Epinephrine (µg/kg per min) + 15× Milrinone (µg/kg per min).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111424294">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Continous infusions of midazolam (120-150 µg/kg per h) and morphine (20 µg/kg per h) were used for sedation and analgesia. All patients were ventilated with volume control ventilation. Normoventilation with partial pressure of carbon dioxide between 35 and 45 mm Hg was aimed. Low levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) were used.</p>

<title>Inhaled NO Indications and Treatment</title>
<p>Therapy with iNO was considered for patients with suboptimal hemodynamics with elevated cavopulmonary pressure (more than 16 mm Hg) and/or low oxygen saturation (&lt;75% for the BDGs and &lt;85% for the TCPCs). Initially standard therapeutic measures were undertaken—optimization of the ventilation parameters and nonspecific vasodilatation with nitroglycerine (1-4 µg/kg per min). If they remained without effect, iNO was administered into the intubation tube with the Pulmonox device (Messer Griesheim Austria, Gumpoldskirchen, Austria). The treatment was initiated at the fifth postoperative hour (range 1st-48th hour) and was continued for 46 hours (range 13-312 hours). Median initial dose was 20 ppm (range 10-20 ppm). After stabilization of the patients, the iNO dose was gradually decreased to 5 ppm. After that the therapy was terminated and extubation was undertaken.</p>
<p>The pressure in the cavopulmonary system, the transpulmonary gradient, and the arterial oxygen saturation were documented at the following time points: before initiation of iNO and at the 1st, 6th, 12th, and 24th hours of treatment.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Data were presented as medians with range or means ± standard deviation. Longitudinal changes in the hemodynamic parameters were studied with the paired samples <italic>t</italic> test and a linear regression model was used to describe these changes. Data between the treated patients and the control group of patients were compared with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test for continuous and the χ<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables. The statistical software SPSS v.16 was used. A significance level of <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05 was chosen.</p>

<p>The cavopulmonary pressure was reduced after initiation of therapy in all patients except in one which was a three-month-old infant with BDG and persisting additional antegrade flow from the ventricle to the pulmonary artery. He had cavopulmonary pressures above 20 mm Hg and severe congestion of the upper body in spite of the volume restriction, systemic vasodilatation, and iNO therapy. He was reoperated and the pulmonary artery was ligated. After that the cavopulmonary pressure normalized and further recovery was uneventful. After excluding this patient, the effects of the iNO therapy on the hemodynamic parameters were separately analyzed in the patients with BDGs.

<p>There were 2 early deaths in the group. One patient with fenestrated TCPC had thrombosis of the extracardiac conduit confirmed with angiography on the eighth postoperative day. He died in the operating room during reoperation for replacement of the conduit. The other patient had complex transposition of the great arteries and was judged to be unsuitable for biventricular correction. After a late systemic pulmonary anastomosis and a BDG, the patient was considered a borderline TCPC candidate. A fenestrated TCPC operation was performed. The postoperative course was very complicated with poor ventricular function, elevated cavopulmonary pressure, and junctional ectopic tachycardia resulting in unstable hemodynamics. The patient died on the 13th postoperative day.</p>

One of the key points during the whole treatment process of patients with functionally univentricular hearts is preserving the pulmonary arteries and keeping the PVR low. Nonetheless there are patients in whom this is not always possible and they represent a group in which the cavopulmonary operations carry higher risk. On the other hand, the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit with the concomitant systemic inflammation response and endothelial dysfunction lead to transient pulmonary dysfunction and elevation of the pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP). The net result is a patient with an inefficient cavopulmonary circulation and severe hypoxemia in the postoperative intensive care unit, whose treatment is very difficult.</p>
<p>If one considers elevation of the PVR responsible for these hemodynamic disturbances, the logical management option would be a selective pulmonary vasodilator. Inhaled NO is well established for the treatment of postoperative pulmonary hypertension in biventricular patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111424294">3</xref></sup> However, the reports about its effects on children after cavopulmonary operations are sparse and equivocal. We observed significant lowering of the cavopulmonary pressures and the transpulmonary gradients, and elevation of the arterial oxygen saturations after administration of iNO. Similar results are reported by Gamillscheg et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111424294">5</xref></sup> Another study involving only patients with fenestrated TCPCs was recently published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111424294">6</xref></sup> The patients were prospectively randomized to receive milrinone, iNO, or a combination of both. Combining both medications had the best effect on the cavopulmonary pressure and the arterial oxygen saturation. The effects of milrinone on the heart and the pulmonary and systemic vasculature seem to be beneficial for the cavopulmonary physiology, and we consider it as part of our routine therapy early postoperatively,with or without combining it with iNO. In another study, also only on fenestrated TCPCs, iNO had more profound effects on these patients, who had lower initial arterial saturations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111424294">7</xref></sup> These patients must have had higher PVRs, causing a larger right-to-left shunt through the fenestration. It is well known that iNO dilates the pulmonary arteries most efficiently when there is pulmonary vasoconstriction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111424294">8</xref></sup> This is an important issue when dealing with patients with cavopulmonary connections. It can be expected to be beneficial especially in those patients with the more pronounced elevation of the PVR and cavopulmonary pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111424294">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Controversy exists about the benefits of iNO in the BDG hemodynamics. Agarwal et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111424294">10</xref></sup> reported good effects on the cavopulmonary pressure and on oxygenation in terms of oxygenation index. In contrast, Adatia et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111424294">11</xref></sup> retrospectively analyzed the effects of iNO in 26 patients with BDGs. They observed significant lowering of the cavopulmonary pressure, indicating good pulmonary vasodilation, but the arterial oxygen saturation remained unchanged. It was concluded that it was the cerebral vascular resistance and not the PVR that was the key factor determining the cavopulmonary blood flow. Indeed in the unique circulation of the BDG, the cerebral and pulmonary circulations are connected in series and it is logical that the higher of the two resistances would determine the net resistance (and hence the blood flow) of the whole circuit. The importance of the cerebral vascular resistance in this situation has been highlighted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111424294">12</xref></sup> and potential strategies to manipulate it have been proposed. Induction of hypercarbia with hypoventilation or adding of CO<sub>2</sub> in the breathing circuit has been shown to improve the pulmonary blood flow and systemic oxygenation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111424294">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111424294">14</xref></sup> On the other hand high pressure in the cavopulmonary system correlates with lower arterial oxygen saturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111424294">15</xref></sup> In our small group of normoventilated BDG patients with elevated cavopulmonary pressures, we also observed a significant drop in the cavopulmonary pressure and a tendency for higher arterial oxygen saturations (though the latter did not reach statistical significance). It seems the effect of iNO on oxygenation in BDG patients is not so straightforward. Indeed in normal or slightly elevated cavopulmonary pressure, the cerebral resistance seems to be more important. But there are still patients in whom the PVR is elevated (and hence the arterial oxygen saturation low). It is exactly this group of patients who may benefit most from iNO therapy; first because the higher pulmonary resistance is more important for limiting the pulmonary blood flow, and second because iNO has more profound effect on PVR when it is higher. Perhaps the optimal strategy in the management of the hypoxemic BDG patient is by combination of hypercarbia with controlled hypoventilation and selective pulmonary vasodilation with iNO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111424294">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111424294">16</xref></sup> Additional studies on this topic are clearly needed.</p>
<p>Inhaled NO is generally considered to be safe, when used in doses less than 20 ppm and for short periods of time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111424294">3</xref></sup> There are however concerns regarding the potential for a rebound effect after withdrawal of therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135111424294">17</xref></sup> Good results were reported when combining the treatment with Sildenafil before termination of iNO therapy in biventricular patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135111424294">18</xref></sup> Growing evidence is gathering about the benefits of Sildenafil in patients after cavopulmonary operations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135111424294">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150135111424294">20</xref></sup> In the recent years, we have used Sildenafil as an adjunctive therapy for patients with postoperative iNO needs after cavopulmonary operations. The effectiveness of this approach needs to be further evaluated.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of the cavopulmonary operations special attention is paid to the indications and contraindications for creating that circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150135111424294">21</xref></sup> Low PVR is thought to be crucial along with reasonable ventricular function, absence of significant atrioventricular valve regurgitation, unobstructed pulmonary venous return, and systemic outflow. Routine cardiac catheterization is performed before indicating such surgery, although the findings are just predictions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111424294">1</xref></sup> The patients in our group were by no means “ideal” candidates—they had higher PAPs, higher ventricular end-diastolic pressures, and higher frequency of significant atrioventricular regurgitation than the control group of patients. Half of the patients in the iNO group may have been considered by some to have contraindications for these operations with preoperative PAPs above 17 mm Hg and PVR above 2.0 Wood units. Cardiopulmonary bypass duration also tended to be longer among them, adding an additional insult on the pulmonary vasculature. They received higher inotropic support, indicating the overall hemodynamic instability early postoperatively. Importantly, the majority of these patients successfully underwent cavopulmonary connections and survived to hospital discharge. The concept of the fenestrated TCPC circuit was developed for high-risk cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150135111424294">22</xref></sup> Inhaled NO seems to be another treatment option early postoperatively for such high-risk patients. Of course, in a subset of functionally univentricular heart patients conversion to a cavopulmonary circulation is impossible, which seems to have been the case in at least one of our nonsurvivors.</p>
<p>Our study has some important limitations. It involves a small group of patients, making the results difficult to interpret and analyze. It suffers from the limitations of all retrospective studies. It is not possible to be sure that the hemodynamic effects are a result of the treatment and would have not appeared without it. Obviously prospective randomized studies on these issues are needed.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Early postoperative administration of iNO following the creation of superior or TCPCs appears to be associated with reduction in cavopulmonary pressure and transpulmonary gradient and increase in arterial oxygen saturation. The most pronounced effects are expected in patients with elevated PVR. Selected patients with preoperatively elevated PAP above 17 mm and PVR above 2 Wood units can successfully undergo univentricular corrections with iNO treatment early postoperatively.</p>
