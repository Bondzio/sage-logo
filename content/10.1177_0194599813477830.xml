<title>Results</title>
<p>During the 4.5-year study period, the microdebrider was used in 4071 adenoidectomies, and 3328 cases were performed with suction coagulation.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Symptomatic regrowth of adenoid tissue occurs infrequently. Both suction coagulation and microdebrider methods are commonly used when performing adenoidectomies due to more consistent ease of use in removal of tissue. The incidence of regrowth likely relates to variables other than the technique used, as there was no difference in the regrowth rate between the 2 groups.</p>

<body>
<p>Adenoidectomy with or without tonsillectomy is one of the most common procedures done by the otolaryngologist. It is estimated that approximately 130,000 adenoidectomies per year are performed in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813477830">1</xref></sup> The main indications for the procedure include adenoid hypertrophy, obstructive sleep apnea, increased upper airway resistance, chronic adenoiditis, and chronic otitis media. There is a roughly 0.5% to 3.0% incidence of adenoid regrowth requiring repeat surgery reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813477830">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813477830">2</xref></sup> The adenoid regrowth rate is likely underestimated because many patients will not seek additional evaluation if regrowth is asymptomatic. For those who demonstrate nasal obstructive symptoms after adenoidectomy, the potential for regrowth is considered. Extent of regrowth can be determined by lateral neck radiographs or fiber-optic assessment of the nasopharynx at follow-up visits. If there is significant regrowth and the child is symptomatic, revision adenoidectomy may be recommended. There are a number of techniques used to remove adenoids available to the otolaryngologist. The choice depends on training, ease of use, physician preference, and potential complications associated with the use of each instrument.</p>
<p>Two techniques for adenoidectomy have become more common over the past 10 years. These are suction coagulator (SC) adenoidectomy and microdebrider (MD) adenoidectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813477830">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813477830"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813477830">5</xref></sup> Each offers potential benefits in terms of ease of use and precise control of adenoid removal, as well as the capacity for direct visualization of the tissue being removed. These techniques have supplanted the older technique of curettage among many otolaryngologists due to the more precise visualization and ease of training resident physicians in their use. Thus far, there are no studies available specifically comparing the SC and MD instruments in terms of eventual symptomatic adenoid regrowth and need for revision surgery. The goal of this study will be to ascertain if there is a significant difference in adenoid regrowth over time between the 2 groups.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599813477830" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A historical cohort study was performed at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, after obtaining appropriate institutional review board approval. Medical records were searched over a 4.5-year period (June 2007 through December 2011) for <italic>Current Procedural Terminology</italic> (<italic>CPT</italic>) codes associated with primary adenoidectomy &lt;12 years of age and &gt;12 years of age, secondary adenoidectomy &lt;12 years of age and &gt;12 years of age, and tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy &lt;12 years of age and &gt;12 years of age. Revision adenoidectomy patients were found using CPT codes for secondary adenoidectomy or 2 occurrences of adenoidectomy codes for the same medical record number on separate dates. Electronic medical records were reviewed for age, sex, indication for initial and revision surgeries, concomitant surgical procedures, technique used for initial adenoidectomy, adenoid size at initial and revision surgery, presence of reflux, and level of training of surgeon performing the surgery. Exclusion criteria include children who had their initial surgery at another institution, who had craniofacial or palatal anomalies, or whose adenoids were removed by a method other than SC or MD at initial surgery.</p>
<p>Adenoid sizing was subjectively graded and stratified into a numerical scale denoting range of percentage obstruction of the nasal choanae (1+ = 0%-25%, 2+ = 26%-50%, 3+ = 51%-75%, and 4+ = 76%-100%). This scale has been previously proposed as a standardized grading scale for adenoid size, which was adopted from the tonsillar hypertrophy grading scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813477830">6</xref></sup> Indications for surgery were categorized as follows: (1) sleep-disordered breathing/obstructive sleep apnea, (2) nasal obstruction (without associated sleep-disordered breathing/obstructive sleep apnea), (3) associated otitis pathology (recurrent otitis media, chronic otitis media with effusion, eustachian tube dysfunction), and (4) infectious (recurrent sinusitis, tonsillitis, adenoiditis). Any patients diagnosed or treated for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) were included in the reflux group.</p>
<p>For the statistical analysis, patient characteristics and surgical information are summarized with percentages for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. Univariate analysis was performed using χ<sup>2</sup> and nonparametric Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> for nonnormal data to assess differences between the 2 groups. Cox proportional hazard regression was conducted using the most significant of the univariate tests to help predict any indicators for higher rates of adenoid regrowth and to assess the rate of revision between the 2 techniques. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported to assist understanding of the multivariate analysis. All analysis was conducted using SPSS 21.0 software (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois), and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the 4.5-year study period, 7399 adenoidectomies or adenotonsillectomies were performed with either the MD or SC technique. The MD technique was used in 4071 primary adenoidectomies, and 3328 cases were performed with SC. A total of 120 revisions were performed during the same period. Of the 120 revisions, 34 were done initially by MD, 50 by SC, and 36 by other techniques (curette, coblator, or undocumented). The incidence rate of revision for the MD technique at initial surgery during the time period was 0.84%. The rate for SC was 1.5%. The difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant on univariate analysis (<italic>P</italic> = .007), although the multivariate analysis did not show a statistical difference between the 2 techniques, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813477830"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>.</p>

<p>We performed a multivariate analysis of the data, with results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813477830"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> summarizing the Cox proportional hazard regression results and listing the variables associated with revision adenoidectomy. The likelihood of having the SC technique at the initial surgery is only slightly lower than that of the MD technique (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-1.54; <italic>P</italic> = .747). When age at initial surgery was entered into this model, it was not shown to be a specific indication for revision surgery (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98-1.0; <italic>P</italic> = .276).</p>
<p>Males comprised 50% (n = 17) of the MD group and 74% (n = 37) of the SC group, whereas females comprised the remaining 50% (n = 17) and 26% (n = 13) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813477830"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The diagnosis of GERD was found in 20.6% (n = 7) of the MD group and 32.0% (n = 37) of the SC group (<italic>P</italic> = .08) at some point in their medical history. This result was not statistically significant, although there was a trend toward more patients with a history of GERD in the SC group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813477830"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Average adenoid size was 3.20 ± 0.96 at initial surgery and 2.06 ± 0.93 at the time of revision, based on the scale of 0 to 4+. The average adenoid size at initial surgery for the MD group was 3.28 ± 0.79 vs 3.22 ± 0.99 for the SC group (<italic>P</italic> = .81). The average adenoid size at revision surgery for the MD group was 1.89 ± 0.96 vs 2.11 ± 0.91 for the SC group (<italic>P</italic> = .41). These data are not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813477830"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The most common indication for initial adenoidectomy was for adenoid hypertrophy contributing to sleep-disordered breathing or obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was an indication in 47.1% (n = 16) of MD and 70.0% (n = 35) of SC initial adenoidectomies (<italic>P</italic> = .03) and in 55.9% (n = 19) of MD and 40.0% (n = 20) of SC revision adenoidectomies (<italic>P</italic> = .70). Nasal obstruction was an indication in 32.4% (n = 11) of MD and 20.0% (n = 10) of SC initial adenoidectomies (<italic>P</italic> = .20) and in 26.5% (n = 9) of MD and 14.0% (n = 7) of SC revision adenoidectomies (<italic>P</italic> = .15). Otologic issues (recurrent otitis media, chronic otitis media) were an indication in 38.2% (n = 13) of MD and 32.0% (n = 16) of SC initial adenoidectomies (<italic>P</italic> = .55) and in 14.7% (n = 5) of MD and 30.0% (n = 15) of SC revision adenoidectomies (<italic>P</italic> = .11).

<p>The multivariate analysis of the indications for initial surgery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813477830"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) did not show any statistically significant difference between the 2 groups, although there was a greater risk of revision in those with otologic issues (HR, 1.55; CI, 0.67-3.62; <italic>P</italic> = .309) compared with the patients with nasal obstruction (NO) (<italic>P</italic> = .546). Those patients with OSA symptoms at their initial surgery had a slight increased risk for revision (HR, 1.13; CI, 0.47-2.72; <italic>P</italic> = .784) compared with those with NO. Those patients who had concurrent procedures at the time of revision, including tympanostomy tubes (HR, .64; CI, 0.28-1.5; <italic>P</italic> = .299) and tonsillectomy (HR, 0.50; CI, 0.22-1.14; <italic>P</italic> = .099), had a lower revision surgery rate compared with those not having concurrent surgery (<italic>P</italic> = .254).</p>
<p>Concurrent procedures done at the time of adenoidectomy were also analyzed by univariate analysis. The most common procedure performed at the time of adenoidectomy was tonsillectomy, and the second most common was tympanostomy tube placement. Tonsillectomy was performed in 44.1% (n = 15) of MD and 52.0% (n = 26) of SC initial adenoidectomies (<italic>P</italic> = .48) and in 50.0% (n = 17) of MD and 40.0% (n = 20) of SC revision adenoidectomies (<italic>P</italic> = .36). Tympanostomy tube placement was performed in 35.3% (n = 12) of MD and 34.0% (n = 17) of SC initial adenoidectomies (<italic>P</italic> = .90) and in 11.8% (n = 4) of MD and 34.0% (n = 17) of SC revision adenoidectomies (<italic>P</italic> = .02). The number of children having tubes placed at the time of revision adenoidectomy in the SC was statistically significant when compared with the MD group. Other procedures (inferior turbinate reduction, direct laryngoscopy, and bronchoscopy) comprised a small portion of the adjunct procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813477830"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>).</p>

Reed et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813477830">3</xref></sup> found that the suction bovie technique decreased intraoperative hemorrhage and operative time when compared with curette adenoidectomy in their meta-analysis of electrocautery adenoidectomy.</p>
<p>The reported adenoidectomy revision rate regardless of technique is a roughly 0.5% to 3.0%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813477830">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813477830">2</xref></sup> Grindle et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813477830">1</xref></sup> found the cause of regrowth and the indications for revision surgery to be similar, including adenoid hypertrophy, chronic adenoiditis, obstructive sleep apnea, sinusitis, and otitis media. Over our study period, we found that the MD group had a revision rate of 0.84%, whereas the SC group had a 1.50% revision rate. The revision rates between our 2 groups were consistent with previously reported rates and were not shown to be statistically different on multivariate analysis of our data. Possible variables that may have led to a higher incidence of regrowth in the SC group in the univariate data include younger overall average age at initial surgery and a trend toward more patients with underlying GERD in this group noted in our study.</p>
<p>For patients who had revision adenoidectomy, studies have reported a mean age at initial surgery to be 2.8 to 3.7 years, a mean time period between initial and revision surgery to be 1.8 to 4.3 years, and the mean age at revision surgery to be 4.7 to 7.7 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813477830">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813477830">9</xref></sup> In this study, the mean age at initial surgery was 3.8 years for the MD group and 2.5 years for the SC group. This difference was found to be statistically significant on univariate analysis but not on the multivariate assessment of our data. A study by Dearking et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813477830">2</xref></sup> looking at factors associated with revision adenoidectomy, found age at initial surgery to be a significant risk factor for revision. Their study showed younger age was associated with an increased risk of revision, and for each increasing year of age, the risk of revision surgery decreased by almost 30%. Given this finding, the younger overall age of our patients in the SC group may have been a large part of the reason why there appeared to be a higher regrowth rate on the initial univariate analysis of our data, rather than the technique itself. Most physicians at our institution were consistent with their technique choice, regardless of age, and the multivariate analysis of the data did not reflect a significant difference in age at revision adenoidectomy.</p>
<p>Another difference noted in our study was the slight trend in between the groups when comparing the adenoid size at initial and revision surgery. Size at initial adenoidectomy was comparable between the groups. At the time of revision, the adenoids were generally smaller in the MD group (1.89+) vs the SC group (2.11+), although these amounts were not statistically significant. This raises the question as to whether one technique is superior to the other in allowing complete removal of adenoid tissue and, if indeed, the proportion of residual tissue leads to a higher regrowth rate. Technically, SC adenoidectomy technique may be performed differently among surgeons. The technique of inserting the tip within the center bulk of the adenoid pad and applying current for several seconds has been recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813477830">5</xref></sup> As the tissue liquefies, the tip is gradually withdrawn. This process is repeated until the adenoid bulk is liquefied throughout and thought to remove adenoid tissue more adequately. Some surgeons will work from the top down cauterizing the adenoid tissue. This method has raised concern about excessive heat, smoke, crusting, and cauterization of surrounding structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813477830">5</xref></sup> About half of the surgeons using the SC in our study worked from top down, and the others liquefied from the center up, although we did not look at the regrowth rate for each of the individual surgeons using these methods to assess differences.</p>
<p>There were cases noted where patients had an adenoidectomy for adenoid hypertrophy first, only to be followed several months later with a tonsillectomy and revision adenoidectomy for upper airway obstructive symptoms. The most common concurrent procedure at the time of revision was tonsillectomy (performed in 50.0% of MD and 40.0% of SC revision adenoidectomies). This may contribute to a smaller mean adenoid size at the time of revision. Residual adenoid tissue may have been removed as a matter of course in these cases. Whether the adenoid regrowth in these instances would have been enough to warrant revision adenoidectomy on its own is uncertain. A study by Buchinsky et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813477830">10</xref></sup> looked at symptomatic regrowth after adenoidectomy in a group of 175 children. Forty-six (26%) of their patients had nasal airway obstructive symptoms (snoring, mouth breathing, hyponasality) at follow-up. Of the 35 patients who underwent nasopharyngoscopy within 2 to 5 years of their initial surgery, none had adenoid tissue occupying more than 40% of the nasopharynx, suggesting another etiology for the obstructive symptoms (allergic rhinitis, upper respiratory infections).</p>
<p>When looking at the indications for the initial adenoidectomy, our study showed a higher number of patients in the SC group having their initial surgery for SDB (70.0% vs 47.1% for the MD group). This difference was found to be statistically significant on univariate analysis, and there was a trend toward more patients having their initial surgery for OSA/SDB than nasal obstruction in the overall multivariate analysis of the data. There were also a higher percentage of children having tympanostomy tubes placed at revision surgery in the SC group. Seventeen children in the SC group had tympanostomy tubes placed at revision, suggestive of a history of otologic issues, compared with 4 patients in the MD group. This difference was statistically significant. Another study showed that those patients who had an indication that was exclusively ear related had about a 20-fold higher risk of needing revision than patients who underwent adenoidectomy for an infectious indication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813477830">2</xref></sup> Their patients in the ear-only indication group tended to be younger, similar to the patients in our study, which may have contributed to the difference noted. Multivariate analysis in our study also suggested an increased trend toward adenoidectomy revision in those with otologic concerns at their initial surgery.</p>
<p>Gastroesophageal reflux disease has been shown to be significantly associated with symptomatic adenoid hypertrophy as well as revision adenoidectomies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813477830">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813477830">11</xref></sup> Refluxed stomach acid can potentially irritate the respiratory mucosa, causing edema and increased secretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813477830">11</xref></sup> In a study by Dearking et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813477830">2</xref></sup> GERD was the only medical diagnosis found to be significantly associated with having a revision adenoidectomy. Having a history of asthma or allergic rhinitis was not associated with adenoid revision. In our study, there was a trend toward a stronger history of GERD in the SC group (32.0%) when compared with the MD group (22%), although this difference was not shown to be statistically significant. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is more commonly diagnosed in younger children, and as described, the SC group in our study was on average younger than the MD group, which might explain this difference. It is unclear whether GERD contributed to the adenoid regrowth in these children or their overall younger age led to a higher predisposition to GERD in our SC patients.</p>
<p>When applying advanced biostatistics to our data, the Cox regression analysis did not show a significant difference in adenoidectomy revision between the 2 techniques. This may reflect the small sample size of our revision patients and the missing data points for some of the variables analyzed. A study designed to look at a larger number of patients over time with or without need for revision surgery and patient characteristics associated with adenoid revision would likely clarify any advantages to either of the 2 techniques.</p>
<p>Another consideration is cost of these instruments. The SC unit costs $6.11. The MD unit costs $200 ($161.60 for the adenoid blade and $38.40 for the suction tubing). Two of the faculty who are using the SC at our institution cite the cost as being one of the reasons for choosing this technique over the MD. Another 2 surgeons cite the perceived higher incidence of adenoid regrowth with the SC as a reason for choosing the MD. All surgeons felt that either technique is superior to curettage for adenoid removal. With escalating health care costs, surgeons should be aware of these cost differentials, though. The cost of the MD is over 30 times that of the SC, and our study did not show a statistically significant revision rate between the 2 techniques. Further prospective study of variables associated with adenoidectomy revision rates, including the technique used, would be useful to our understanding of this issue. This may help guide an otolaryngologist’s choice in choosing instrumentation that is precise, comfortable to use routinely, safe, and cost-effective.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The incidence rate of revision adenoidectomy is low for both SC and MD techniques. Precise removal of tissue with these techniques at the initial surgery likely helps keep the regrowth rate low. Adenoid regrowth rates did not differ between the techniques studied, suggesting that regrowth likely relates to other variables.</p>
