<abstract>
<p>In recent decades, representative bureaucracy has been a core area of interest, both in theory and in practice, in public administration. The focus on representative bureaucracy is important because the characteristics of bureaucrats influence the nature, scope, and implementation of public policies. Integrating management literature on men and women in leadership with existing work on representative bureaucracy, this study constructed a new data set examining the distribution of women in leadership in 118 U.S. federal regulatory organizations. We find that women remain underrepresented in federal regulatory agency leadership but not in the same magnitude as in political representation and private organization leadership. Specifically, women are expected to get into leadership positions in organizations working in “feminine” policy areas and where a woman holds the top level of leadership. In addition, the proportion of women in upper-level leadership positions is expected to increase in agencies with a higher likelihood of failure when such agencies are less visible.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Do the characteristics of our bureaucrats resemble the public they serve? How are these characteristics important for the delivery of public services? These are age-old questions in public administration and research on representative bureaucracy has been examining these questions for decades. One area of focus in representative bureaucracy work is on gender, or the representation of women and men in bureaucratic positions. Largely, representative bureaucracy research on gender tends to focus on two areas: the degree to which women and men hold bureaucratic positions and the extent to which the decisions made and policies pursued by these women and men are actually important for the gender they represent.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, less has been written about gender representation in the federal government, particularly in top levels of leadership. In addition, representative bureaucracy research does not integrate the extensive body of work in management literature on women and men in leadership that might inform the ways in which these women and men <italic>get into</italic> leadership positions. To fill these gaps, we construct a new data set to identify the representation of women and men in leadership positions in 118 federal regulatory organizations. We examine the organizational and institutional factors contributing to women and men gaining access to positions of leadership in these organizations. We address the following two research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0275074011420997" list-type="simple">

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: What institutional and organizational factors influence women and men attaining these positions?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To begin our inquiry, we turn first to a review of existing representative bureaucracy work and management literature on women and men in leadership.</p>

<title>Representative Bureaucracy: Women and Men in Leadership</title>
<p>The following review of existing research begins with a summary of representative bureaucracy theory as a means for framing our understanding of the role bureaucrats play in our democracy. Second, we extract three particular threads of gender-oriented research on representative bureaucracy as a way of constructing what we know about women and men in the current representative bureaucracy landscape. Finally, we link representative bureaucracy research with literature on women and men in leadership to illustrate the theoretical framework and hypotheses on which this study is based.</p>

<title>Representative Bureaucracy Theory</title>
<p>Representative bureaucracy, both in practice and in theory, has been a core subject in public administration research for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0275074011420997">Bradbury &amp; Kellough, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074011420997">Cayer &amp; Sigelman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0275074011420997">Grabosky &amp; Rosenbloom, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0275074011420997">Kingsley, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0275074011420997">Krislov, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074011420997">Meier, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0275074011420997">Meier &amp; Nigro, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0275074011420997">Mosher, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0275074011420997">Rehfuss, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0275074011420997">Riccucci, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0275074011420997">Riccucci &amp; Saidel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0275074011420997">Rosenbloom &amp; Featherstonhaugh, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0275074011420997">Saidel &amp; Loscocco, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0275074011420997">Saltzstein, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0275074011420997">Thompson, 1976</xref>). There are two primary tenets of representative bureaucracy theory. First, the theory espouses the principle that the characteristics of those holding bureaucratic positions in government institutions should reflect the characteristics of the public being served. Second, the theory presumes that if the bureaucracy mirrors the characteristics of the public, the preferences of the public will be reflected in the decisions made in these government institutions.</p>
<p>More specifically, the theory of representative bureaucracy includes two types of representation: passive and active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0275074011420997">Mosher, 1982</xref>). Passive representation occurs when the demographic characteristics of the bureaucracy typify the demographic characteristics of the population served. Active representation is when bureaucrats act in ways that benefit those members of the public who have similar characteristics. It is primarily with passive representation that this study is concerned and, in particular, the representation of women in top levels of leadership. Passive representation can symbolize equal opportunity and access to bureaucratic positions as well as the extent to which government is accessible to citizenry from all backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074011420997">Meier, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0275074011420997">Riccucci &amp; Saidel, 1997</xref>). We see bureaucrats who have characteristics akin to our own as perceiving our situation similarly and therefore more inclined and able to address our problems effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0275074011420997">Hale &amp; Kelly, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0275074011420997">Selden, 1997</xref>). Thus, studying the current level of representativeness in our government institutions continues to be important.</p>
<p>One stream of public administration research on representative bureaucracy focuses on “street-level bureaucrats” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0275074011420997">Lipsky, 1980</xref>). Representative bureaucracy at this level is important because it is these individuals who are directly engaged with citizens at the point of service delivery. It is these bureaucrats who exercise a considerable amount of discretion in the character and quality of government services provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0275074011420997">Thompson, 1976</xref>). It is these bureaucrats who influence the nature of the environment in which interactions between the government and individuals take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0275074011420997">Lederman, Loayza, &amp; Soares, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the representativeness of the “street-level” bureaucracy, scholars have also examined the representativeness of top levels of leadership, in particular, appointed positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0275074011420997">Bendix, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0275074011420997">Kingsley, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0275074011420997">Riccucci &amp; Saidel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0275074011420997">Saidel &amp; Loscocco, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0275074011420997">Warner, Van Riper, Martin, &amp; Collins, 1963</xref>). Examining the representativeness of appointed leaders in government agencies is important because, while the overall employee base of a bureaucratic organization may be representative, the upper echelons of leadership may not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074011420997">Aberbach &amp; Rockman, 2000</xref>). These upper echelons of management are an essential part of the policy-making apparatus in government because these individuals exercise considerable discretion in areas such as resource allocation and program decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074011420997">Kingdon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0275074011420997">Rehfuss, 1986</xref>).</p>

<title>Pieces of the Representative Bureaucracy Puzzle</title>
<p>Three recent streams of research construct a story of gender in representative bureaucracy that addresses three questions: Where are the women and men in leadership? Do women and men make decisions favorable to the gender they represent? How do women and men get into leadership positions? This body of literature starts by describing the state of passive representation, builds on this by examining the circumstances under which passive and active representation are linked, and finally adds to our understanding of the representative bureaucracy “puzzle” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0275074011420997">Riccucci &amp; Saidel, 1997</xref>) by investigating the ways in which women and men attain leadership positions in the upper levels of government organizations. Next, we move to a discussion of selected studies in these threads of research and additional supporting studies.</p>
<sec id="section5-0275074011420997">
<title>Where are the women and men in leadership?</title>
<p>Traditionally, the lower ends of the professional ladder contain a higher proportion of women than the upper ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074011420997">Guy &amp; Newman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0275074011420997">Riccucci &amp; Saidel, 1997</xref>). For example, while half of the individuals in the United States who hold advanced degrees are women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0275074011420997">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>), only 18% of the U.S. Congress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0275074011420997">Women in Congress, 2009</xref>) and only 15% of corporate board positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074011420997">Catalyst, 2008</xref>) are held by women. Existing literature refers to this phenomenon as vertical segregation or the glass ceiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074011420997">Guy &amp; Newman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074011420997">Hymowitz &amp; Schellhardt, 1986</xref>). While vertical segregation is recognized in existing literature, horizontal segregation or glass walls are acknowledged as well. Horizontal segregation refers to the distribution of men and women across different types of occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074011420997">Guy &amp; Newman, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Examining passive representation and horizontal segregation in state agencies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0275074011420997">Riccucci and Saidel (1997)</xref> find that women are underrepresented as heads of most state agencies and when women attain some level of representation, it is in organizations usually headed by women such as health, welfare, or labor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0275074011420997">Riccucci and Saidel’s (1997)</xref> study finds agreement among public administration and political science research, showing that women are more likely to be addressing policy issues considered to be “feminine,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0275074011420997">1</xref></sup> such as health care, education, children and families, the aging, women’s rights, civil rights, social security, the environment, and disability. Similarly, men are more likely to deal with “masculine” policies pertaining to issues of defense, crime, the economy, foreign affairs, transportation, budget, taxes and trade, immigration, and agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074011420997">Bowling, Kelleher, Jones, &amp; Wright, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074011420997">Bullard &amp; Wright 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074011420997">Carroll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074011420997">Fox &amp; Oxley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0275074011420997">Huddy &amp; Terkildsen, 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074011420997">1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0275074011420997">Kahn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0275074011420997">Lewis &amp; Nice, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0275074011420997">Reid, Kerr, &amp; Miller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0275074011420997">Rosenwasser, Rogers, Fling, Silvers-Pickens, &amp; Butemeyer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0275074011420997">Sanbonmatsu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0275074011420997">Taylor, Morin, Cohn, Clark, &amp; Wang, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0275074011420997">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Do women and men make decisions favorable to the gender they represent?</title>
<p>Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0275074011420997">Riccucci and Saidel’s (1997)</xref> research on passive representation, others examine the link between passive and active representation. Existing research finds mixed results for the link between the gender of bureaucrats in public organizations and outcomes for the population represented by the bureaucrats. In the context of child support enforcement agencies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0275074011420997">Wilkins and Keiser (2006)</xref> find that when there are more women in supervisory roles, there is a greater level of child support collections. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0275074011420997">Meier and Nicholson-Crotty (2006)</xref> find that more women police officers are associated with an increase in both the reporting of sexual assaults and arrests made for sexual assaults. Yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0275074011420997">Meier, Pennington, and Eller (2005)</xref> find that district offices of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with greater percentages of female employees were no more or less likely to file sexual discrimination suits. Essentially, research suggests that passive and active representation are linked but only under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>One explanation for the inconsistent link between passive and active representation can be found in work examining the relationship between gender and attitudes on policy priorities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0275074011420997">Dolan (2000)</xref> finds that women in leadership positions are more likely to maintain female-friendly attitudes toward policy when they work in organizations that encounter issues predominantly considered women’s issues. Furthering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0275074011420997">Dolan’s (2000)</xref> work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0275074011420997">Saidel and Loscocco (2005)</xref> identify an important institutional factor influencing the link between passive and active representation in government bureaucracies, that is, the concept of a gendered institution. Essentially, gender is present in the “processes, practices, images and ideologies, and distributions of power in the various sectors of social life” (Acker quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074011420997">Kenney, 1996</xref>, p. 446; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0275074011420997">Saidel &amp; Loscocco, 2005</xref>, p. 162). Ultimately, government bureaucracies are heavily gendered and the gendering of the institution influences organizational outcomes as well as the link between passive and active representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074011420997">Keiser, Wilkins, Meier, &amp; Holland, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074011420997">Kelly &amp; Newman, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0275074011420997">
<title>How do women and men get into leadership positions?</title>
<p>Continuing the work on the social construction of gender in passive representation, studies of occupational sex-segregation examine career advancement in public organizations. In a sample of state-level agencies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0275074011420997">Newman (1994)</xref> finds that career advancement opportunities for women differ based on agency type. Specifically, women are more likely to advance into upper-level positions in redistributive agencies where work focuses on redistributing wealth or another good among different social, economic, and demographic classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0275074011420997">Lowi, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0275074011420997">Newman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0275074011420997">Ripley &amp; Franklin, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Studying gender and advancement into leadership in state-level agencies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074011420997">Bowling et al. (2006)</xref> examine organizational factors, but focus primarily on individual attributes. At the individual level, the authors find that women in leadership positions tend to be slightly younger and have more varied career paths than men in leadership positions. At the organizational level, the study finds that women are slightly more likely than men to be appointed by a governor; women are more likely than men to head state agencies in areas like social services, health, and education; and women tend to appear in leadership positions in younger agencies.</p>
<p>While representative bureaucracy literature has, to some extent, considered the organizational characteristics that influence women and men occupying leadership positions, management literature has considered this area to a much larger degree. We now turn to management literature on women and men in leadership to inform this part of the discussion on representative bureaucracy and present the theoretical foundations and hypotheses for this study.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-0275074011420997">
<title>Women and Men in Leadership</title>
<p>Leadership is a central area of research in management literature. One component of this body of work examines differences among women and men in leadership, in particular, the ways in which women and men get into leadership positions. In examining this literature, several organizational-level variables of influence emerge. Among these variables are industry type, risk, organization size, organization age, existing female representation, and path to leadership. Each factor is discussed below. By integrating representative bureaucracy literature and literature on women and men in leadership, we develop a framework that includes institutional- and organization-level variables for examining the factors influencing women gaining entrance into top-level leadership positions.</p>
<sec id="section9-0275074011420997">
<title>Industry type</title>
<p>Like research on representative bureaucracy that finds the degree to which women and men tend to hold leadership positions in agencies depends on the policy area the agency works in, management literature also finds the extent to which women and men hold leadership positions depends on the industry. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074011420997">Blum, Fields, and Goodman (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0275074011420997">Goodman, Fields, and Blum (2003)</xref> find that for firms in which personal interactions between employees and customers are a source for competitive advantage, more women will be placed into management positions.</p>
<p>Because traditional gender stereotypes characterize men as aggressive, independent, decision makers and women as sympathetic, kind, supporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0275074011420997">Heilman, 2001</xref>), rather than matching individuals with work activities, we are often matching gender with work activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0275074011420997">Martin, 1992</xref>). Thus, we expect that, when women do rise into leadership positions, they will rise in organizations that are congruent with the socially constructed meaning of gender. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list2-0275074011420997" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1 (H1)</italic>: Agencies working in “feminine” policy areas are more likely to have women in upper-level management positions.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0275074011420997">
<title>Risk</title>
<p>While there is evidence that being a woman may hinder career advancement, when women do advance, they are more likely to be offered positions where the risk of failure is higher than in the positions offered to their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0275074011420997">Ryan &amp; Haslam, 2007</xref>). This is known as the “glass cliff” effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0275074011420997">Ryan &amp; Haslam, 2005</xref>, p. 83). The logic here, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0275074011420997">Ryan and Haslam (2007)</xref> suggest, is when organizational failure occurs, it is women, rather than men that that are held liable. For example, evidence suggests that female lawyers are more likely than male lawyers to be appointed to high-risk legal cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074011420997">Ashby, Ryan, &amp; Haslam, 2007</xref>) and females are more likely to be appointed to a leadership position in a company facing difficult financial or organizational conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0275074011420997">Ryan &amp; Haslam, 2005</xref>). Alternatively, however, the appointment of women into leadership positions in poorly performing organizations may actually be an act of impression management to signal to outsiders a move toward gender equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0275074011420997">Kaplan &amp; Minton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0275074011420997">Ryan &amp; Haslam, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether a woman is appointed to a top-level leadership position to bear the brunt of the blame for failure or to signal gender equality to outsiders, we expect that when the risk of failure is high, women are more likely to be positioned in a top-level leadership position. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list3-0275074011420997" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2 (H2)</italic>: Risk is positively associated with women holding top-level leadership positions.</p></list-item></list>

<sec id="section11-0275074011420997">
<title>Organization size</title>
<p>Generally speaking, the larger an organization is, the more visible the organization is to the public and to watchdog groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0275074011420997">Salancik, 1979</xref>). Because large organizations are more visible, they are also more susceptible to pressure to conform to societal expectations. Societal expectations could include pressure to increase women in leadership positions. For example, in a corporate context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0275074011420997">Hillman, Shropshire, and Cannella (2007)</xref> find that larger organizations are more likely to have women on their boards of directors.</p>
<p>Societal expectations to increase women in leadership positions are reflected in the work of organizations like Catalyst, which uses data from large organizations, typically those in the Fortune 500, to analyze women’s representation on corporate boards, women’s representation in corporate officer positions, and women’s earnings among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074011420997">Catalyst, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074011420997">2008</xref>). Given such societal pressures and the visibility of large organizations, we expect large organizations to have more women in leadership positions. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list4-0275074011420997" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3 (H3)</italic>: Organizational size is positively associated with women holding top-level leadership positions.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Organizational age</title>
<p>The longer an organization has been in existence, the more likely the organization is to resist institutional pressures for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074011420997">Kelly &amp; Amburgey, 1991</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074011420997">Baron, Mittman, and Newman (1991)</xref> find that older state agencies in California are less likely than younger state agencies to hire and promote women into management positions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074011420997">Bowling et al. (2006)</xref> find similar results in an examination of women and men in state agency leadership. However, the relationship between organizational age and women in management is not unequivocal. In a corporate context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074011420997">Blum et al. (1994)</xref> find a positive relationship between organizational age and the percentage of management positions held by women.</p>
<p>For government organizations, constraints in the allocation of personnel tend to be more restricting than one would find in a private sector organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0275074011420997">Wilson, 1989</xref>). In addition, as public organizations grow in age, the institutionalization of employment constraints tends to grow. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list5-0275074011420997" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4 (H4)</italic>: Organizational age is negatively associated with women holding top-level leadership positions.</p></list-item></list>

For example, if women employees are necessary for the performance of the organization, women will be placed in management positions to improve the organization’s ability to attract women into lower-level positions.</p>
<p>More specifically, the advocacy model suggests that women in upper-level positions will actively seek to hire more women into lower level positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0275074011420997">Hindera, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0275074011420997">Saltzstein (1986)</xref> discovers evidence for this type of advocacy (or active representation) in her study concluding that women mayors are more likely to appoint women into higher-level positions in municipalities.

<title>Path to leadership</title>
<p>Research suggests that women and men advance into management positions in different ways. Even when women enter professions at the same rate as men, with the same education and experience credentials, women still do not advance to management, and particularly, upper management positions in the same way as men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074011420997">Carter &amp; Silva, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0275074011420997">Catalyst, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074011420997">2007</xref>). Even in female-dominated professions, men more than women, are encouraged to move up the professional ladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0275074011420997">Williams, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>One explanation for this is that we subconsciously associate what we consider to be leadership characteristics with men. This stereotyping has been described as “think leader, think male” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074011420997">Hoobler, Wayne, &amp; Lemmon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0275074011420997">Schein, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0275074011420997">1975</xref>). Thus, for women to enter upper-level management positions, it may be easier to circumvent rather than break the glass ceiling. For instance, evidence suggests that men are more likely to move into management positions from within an organization or through professional appointments, while women are more likely to move into management positions from outside the organization or through policy appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074011420997">Bowling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074011420997">Bullard &amp; Wright, 1993</xref>).

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 6 (H6)</italic>: Women are more likely to hold top-level positions that are appointed by the president of the United States.</p></list-item></list>
<p>In sum, we conceptualize the representation of women in leadership positions in public organizations as a function of the gender of the policy area, risk, organizational size, organizational age, existing female representation, and path to leadership. We now turn to a description of the context in which this study takes place, that is, federal government regulation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0275074011420997">
<title>Study Context: Federal Government Regulation</title>
<p>Government regulation is a particularly important context in which to study representative bureaucracy for three primary reasons. First, government regulation by nature is a complex endeavor—often involving federal, state, local, and private organizations—that touches almost all aspects of our lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074011420997">Dudley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0275074011420997">McCaffrey, Smith, &amp; Martinez-Moyano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0275074011420997">Segers, Boney, &amp; Gossett, 2007</xref>). The food we eat, the clothing we wear, the highways we drive on, the music we listen to on the radio, and the money we borrow to buy homes are among the vast number of means by which the decisions made in regulatory organizations touch our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Second, along with the complex and far-reaching role of government regulation, the rulemaking powers bestowed on Federal regulatory organizations also arm bureaucratic personnel with each of the powers reserved for the three branches of government—executive, judicial, and legislative powers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011420997">Kerwin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074011420997">Kerwin &amp; Furlong, 2011</xref>). Agencies promulgate rules that provide instructions for administrators but do not add any significant directions to the legislation (execution). Agencies promulgate rules that add or modify direction provided in legislation (interpretation). Agencies promulgate rules detailing how the goals of legislation are to be achieved (prescription).</p>
<p>Finally, in recent years, the performance of the United States and indeed the global economy has been tumultuous, and financial resources are shrinking. Crises in housing and financial markets have increased citizens’ desire for regulatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0275074011420997">Teixeira, 2009</xref>). While regulation has always been a policy tool, the decrease in available financial resources makes regulation a more feasible as well as desirable avenue for influencing public policy.</p>
<p>If regulatory agencies influence much of life, have powers in all three areas of our democracy, and are a preferable tool for influencing public policy, this heightens concern for representative bureaucracy in government regulatory institutions. If those who hold leadership positions in regulatory institutions play a role in the execution, interpretation, and prescription of public policies, the characteristics of those who hold leadership positions is worth investigating. We now turn to an explanation of the data and methods used to address our research questions.</p>

For example, literature categorizes policy areas such as finance and banking or crime as masculine and areas such as education or health and human services as feminine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074011420997">Carroll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074011420997">Fox &amp; Oxley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0275074011420997">Huddy &amp; Terkildsen, 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074011420997">1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0275074011420997">Kahn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0275074011420997">Rosenwasser et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0275074011420997">Sanbonmatsu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0275074011420997">Taylor et al., 2008</xref>).

<p>Second, to ensure the validity of the policy gender assigned to each of the 118 agencies, two raters independently assigned each agency in our sample up to two policy areas.

<title>Risk</title>
<p>Risk can be conceptualized as a function of the consequences of failure and the likelihood of failure. If the likelihood of failure is very small, even if the consequences of failure are large, risk may be considered low. Alternatively, when the likelihood of failure is high, even if the consequences of failure are not large, risk may be considered high. We measure the consequences of failure via the visibility of an agency and the likelihood of failure via the legislative complexity of the environment the agency works in. We then interact visibility and legislative complexity to capture the effect of both consequences of failure and the likelihood of failure as a measure of risk.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0275074011420997">3</xref></sup> Details on these measurements are discussed below.</p>
<p>Our measure of visibility is a combination of the visibility an agency has within the government sector and the visibility an agency has within popular media. Visibility within the government sector is measured by rulemaking activity in the Federal Register. Actions surrounding proposed and final rulemaking activity were recorded. For each agency, only substantive rulemaking activities were included and only when the agency was the initiator of the activity. Corrections, extensions of comment periods, delays in effective dates, cancellations of public meetings, and withdrawals of rulemaking were not included in these measures.</p>
<p>Popular visibility is measured by how frequently each agency appears in five popular press sources, the <italic>New York Times</italic> newspaper, the <italic>Washington Post</italic> newspaper, the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> newspaper, <italic>Business Week</italic> magazine and the <italic>Economist</italic> magazine. The higher the visibility of the agency, the more public failure will be and thus, the larger the consequences for agency leadership.</p>
<p>Complexity of the environment the agency works in is measured by the number of pieces of legislation from which the agency derives is operating authority. We collected this measure from the <italic>Federal Regulatory Directory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074011420997">Congressional Quarterly, 2010</xref>). The more pieces of legislation an agency must promulgate rules under, the more complex its task. The more complex the agency’s task, the more likely there will be various constituencies in disagreement over agency rules. Thus, the likelihood of failure is higher for agencies with more legislative complexity.</p>

<sec id="section23-0275074011420997">
<title>Organizational size</title>
<p>We collected two measures of agency size. Using organization web sites, annual performance and accountability reports, the official White House budget document, and freedom of information requests filed with the individual agency, we recorded the number of employees and annual budget for each of the 118 agencies. While literature suggests that larger organizations may face more social pressure to include women in leadership positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0275074011420997">Hillman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0275074011420997">Salancik, 1979</xref>), it is also possible that organizations must reach a certain size before the organization attracts enough attention for social pressure to have some effect on women in leadership. Thus, in addition to examing the effect of organizational size on gender in leadership, we also test for a threshold effect of organizational size on gender in leadership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0275074011420997">
<title>Organizational age</title>
<p>We determined agency age in years and gathered this measure from agency web sites or the <italic>Federal Regulatory Directory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074011420997">Congressional Quarterly, 2010</xref>). Existing research finds mixed results on the effect of age on gender in leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074011420997">Baron et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074011420997">Bowling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074011420997">Kelly &amp; Amburgey, 1991</xref>). The mixed results may be due to a threshold effect. In other words, it is possible that organizational age only begins to influence gender in leadership once the organization has reached a certain age. Thus, in addition to examining the effect of age on gender in leadership, we also test for a threshold effect for age on gender in leadership.</p>

<title>Path to leadership</title>
<p>For each agency in our sample, we identified who appointed the individuals in the top position and the individuals occupying the second level of leadership. Data from three sources were used to construct this information. The first source is a publicly available White House data set that lists presidential nominations and appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0275074011420997">The White House, 2010</xref>). Included in the data set is the nominee’s name, agency for which the individual is being nominated, position for which the individual is being nominated, nomination date, date of confirmation vote, whether or not the individual was confirmed, and whether or not the nominated individual is a holdover from a previous administration. Nominations and appointments recorded in this data set begin for nominations and appointments in January 2009 and are currently up to date through April 2011.</p>
<p>The second source used to identify the appointment source of individuals in the top two levels of leadership in federal regulatory agencies was the Head Count, published online by the <italic>Washington Post</italic>. This database was used to confirm appointments and nominations listed in the White House data set and fill in missing information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0275074011420997"><italic>The Washington Post</italic>, 2010</xref>). Head Count includes the name of the individual nominated, whether or not the nomination has been confirmed, the confirmation date, as well as brief biography of the individual nominated. Head Count tracks full-time positions and does not include ambassadors, marshalls, or U.S. attorneys.</p>
<p>The third source used to identify the appointment source for individuals in the first and second levels of leadership in federal regulatory agencies was the book, <italic>Who’s Who and What’s What on Wall Street</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0275074011420997">Sease et al., 1998</xref>). This 1998 book, published by the editors of the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic>, provides biographies for individuals in leadership positions at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While the individuals listed in this book are no longer in these leadership positions, the book indicates the appointment source for these positions.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>Defining the term regulation is challenging because of the various ways regulatory activity actually manifests itself. Thus, identifying a comprehensive list of regulatory agencies is also a challenge. For our purposes, we follow Meier’s definition of regulation as “any attempt by the government to control the behavior of citizens, corporations, or subgovernments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074011420997">Meier, 1985</xref>, p. 1). We define a federal regulatory agency to be a federal organization with authority to promulgate rules under legislation and executive orders. We selected the 118 federal regulatory agencies listed in the most recent <italic>Federal Regulatory Directory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074011420997">Congressional Quarterly, 2010</xref>) as our sample. Organizations listed in the <italic>Federal Regulatory Directory</italic> carry out their operations under the authority of various federal legislation and executive orders and publish their rulemaking activity in the <italic>Federal Register</italic>. Federal regulators in this directory range from well-known agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to less well-known agencies such as the Office of Thrift Supervision. However, the <italic>Federal Regulatory Directory</italic> does not comprise the universe of federal agencies with regulatory responsibilities. For example, the Office of Energy Policy and New Uses within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the National Protection and Programs Directorate within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also have authority under legislation and executive orders and carry out rulemaking activities published in the <italic>Federal Register</italic>. In addition, organizations like the USDA and DHS also issue regulations on their own, rather than through one of the divisions within the organizations. However, the Office of Energy Policy and New Uses, the National Protection and Programs Directorate, the USDA, and DHS are not listed in the <italic>Federal Regulatory Directory</italic> and are thus not included in our sample.</p>
<p>In 39% of the 118 agencies in the sample, the top leader was a woman and in 86% of the agencies, the top leader was appointed by the president of the United States. In 29% of the 118 agencies, some or all of the second-level leaders were appointed by the president of the United States. Based on organizational charts, 50% of the agencies in the sample had between 6 and 16 individuals in their top two levels of leadership. On average, 36% of the top two levels of leadership positions in an agency were held by women. The oldest agency in the sample is 231 years old and the youngest agency in the sample is 2 years old. On average, agencies are approximately 47 years old and carry out their activities under the authority of approximately 15 pieces of federal legislation. Measured in two ways, by total number of employees and alternatively by annual budget, the size of the federal regulatory organizations in the sample ranged from very small to very large. The median number of employees among this sample of agencies was approximately 1,100. The median annual budget among this sample of agencies was almost 600 million dollars. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074011420997">Table 3</xref> summarizes characteristics of the sample of regulatory organizations.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We began our analysis with two preliminary tests examining the association between policy area gender and the representation of women and men in top levels of leadership. We conducted a chi-square analysis to test for an association between gender of the top leader and gender of the agency policy area. We conducted an ANOVA test for means to compare the mean percentage of women in leadership positions in agencies engaged in feminine policy areas and agency engaged in masculine and neutral policy areas.</p>
<p>Following the preliminary tests, we utilized logistic, ordinary least squares (OLS), and Tobit regression techniques to test our hypotheses. We used logit regression for the categorical dependent variable gender of the top leader (1 = <italic>female</italic>, 0 = <italic>male</italic>). Because the continuous dependent variable percentage of the second level of leadership positions held by women has a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 1, we employed Tobit regression. However, as noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074011420997">Table 4</xref>, OLS regression results are similar to those of the Tobit regression. We log transformed variables not normally distributed.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>There is a statistically significant association between gender in leadership and the gender of the policy area an agency engages in. Of the 48 agencies working in a feminine policy area, 25 agencies had a female top leader. In contrast, of the 67 agencies working in a masculine policy area, only 19 had a female leader. A chi-square analysis examining the relationship between the gender of the top leader in an agency and the gender of the policy area the agency engages in resulted in a χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.6095 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In agencies engaged in feminine, masculine, and neutral policy areas, the average percentage of top positions held by women is 45%, 29%, and 49% respectively. An ANOVA test for means is statistically significant at the .001 level. Together, the chi-square and ANOVA findings offer preliminary support for Hypothesis 1 and suggest that there is an association between policy gender and the gender of the top leader in an agency.</p>
<p>Overall, regression results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074011420997">Table 4</xref> find support for Hypotheses 1 and 5 and partial support for Hypothesis 2. More specifically, results suggest that women are more likely to hold leadership positions in agencies that engage in feminine policy areas (H1). The logistic model suggests that in agencies engaged in feminine policy areas the odds of having women in top leadership positions are 2.77 times greater than other agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0275074011420997">4</xref></sup> In addition, the Tobit model suggests that agencies engaged in feminine policy areas are expected to have 13% more women in the second level of leadership than agencies engaged in masculine or neutral policy areas (H1) and when the top leader in an agency is a woman, we expect the percentage of women in the second level of leadership to be 9% greater than when the top leader in an agency is a man (H5).</p>
<p>In addition, risk, as measured by the interaction between visibility and legislative complexity, has a statistically significant effect on the proportion of the second-level leadership positions held by women (H2). However, the effect is not the same for all agencies. Specifically, the Tobit regression results suggest that at low and moderate levels of agency visibility, as the legislative complexity of an agency increases, the percentage of second-level leadership positions held by women is expected to increase. However, as agency visibility increases, the positive effect of complexity on the percentage of second-level leadership position decreases.</p>
<p>The effect of legislative complexity on the proportion of second-level leadership positions held by women is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0275074011420997">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0275074011420997">2</xref> below. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0275074011420997">Figure 1</xref> depicts the nature of the interaction effect of agency visibility and agency complexity on the expected percentage of women in second-level leadership positions. As we move from the low level of agency visibility (solid line) to the high level of agency visibility dotted line), we see the relationship between complexity and the expected percentage of women in second-level leadership positions move from positive to negative. Ultimately, we expect women to hold a larger proportion of leadership positions in agencies that are at a higher risk of failure, when those agencies are less visible. Yet we expect women to hold a smaller proportion of leadership positions in agencies that are at a higher risk of failure, when those agencies are highly visible.</p>

The solid line in this graph indicates that the magnitude of the marginal effect of complexity on the expected percentage of women in second-level leadership positions diminishes as agency visibility increases. The confidence interval (dotted lines) indicates that the marginal effect of complexity on the expected percentage of women in second-level leadership positions is statistically significant for average and below average values of agency visibility, but not statistically significant for above average values of agency visibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0275074011420997">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>We do not find statistically significant evidence in our data to support Hypotheses 3, 4, and 6. Consistent with the mixed results in existing research, we do not find organizational age or organizational size to be statistically significant factors in determining gender in leadership. In addition, threshold effects for organizational age and organizational size were not statistically significant. Because there are no theoretical foundations for selecting a threshold for organizational size or age, we tested for effects at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. Finally, we do not find statistically significant evidence to suggest that women are more likely to hold top-level leadership positions that are appointed by the president of the United States.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our examination of gender and representative bureaucracy in federal regulatory organizations, we find that agencies working in “feminine” policy areas are more likely to have women in upper-level management positions (H1); agencies facing higher risk of failure are expected to have more women in leadership when these agencies have low to moderate levels of visibility (H2); and agencies with a woman in the top-level position are expected to have more women in the second-level of leadership (H5). Yet we do not find statistically significant associations between gender of leadership and either organizational size (H3), organizational age (H4), or presidential appointment (H6). In sum, the gender of the policy area, risk associated with the agency under certain circumstances, and the existence of other women are the primary determinants of women in leadership in federal regulatory organizations.</p>
<p>Considering these findings, five points emerge. First, women have greater representation in leadership in federal government regulatory organizations than in other areas. Compared to the representation of women in public policy-making positions and private corporate boards, women have a larger representation in bureaucratic leadership. As indicated in the literature review, only 18% of the U.S. Congress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0275074011420997">Women in Congress, 2009</xref>) and 15% of corporate board positions were held by women in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074011420997">Catalyst, 2008</xref>). However, 39% of top positions in federal regulatory organizations were women and 36% of the top two levels of leadership were women.</p>
<p>While we find a higher level of bureaucratic representation of women than exists for the legislative representation of women, there may be a positive implication to this disparity. Other studies have found that, for minorities, bureaucratic representation can provide a base for more legislative representation of minorities and in turn, legislative representation of minorities increases bureaucratic representation of minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0275074011420997">Meier &amp; Smith, 1994</xref>). Thus, the level of representation of women in high levels of leadership in federal regulatory organizations found in this study may be part of a positive reinforcing cycle leading to more women in both the bureaucracy and the legislature.</p>
<p>Second, while women are better represented in leadership in federal regulatory organizations than other areas, gender gaps persist. While women make up half (50%) of those individuals holding advanced degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0275074011420997">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>), women make up less than half of those in upper-level (39% of top level of leaders and 36% of top two levels of leaders) leadership positions in federal regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>Third, the social construction of gender continues to be a factor in determining who sits in leadership positions. So, even though gender gaps in leadership in federal regulatory organizations may be smaller than in other sectors, the gendered nature of institutions still influences how we view women or men as suitable leaders in different policy areas.</p>
<p>Fourth, some support exists for the glass cliff effect, but the evidence is not unequivocal. Rather, risk is multidimensional and the extent to which women will hold upper-level leadership positions depends not only on the consequences of agency failure but also on the likelihood of agency failure. As the glass cliff effect suggests, women are expected to be in leadership positions in agencies facing higher risk of failure, but only when the agencies do not have a high level of visibility.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps one of the most interesting outcomes of this study, is that even though women tend to serve in leadership in agencies engaged in feminine policy areas, there are women in leadership in masculine policy areas. For example, at the time of data collection, the top positions in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC), the Minerals Management Service (MMS), and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice were held by women. In addition, there are agencies engaged in feminine policy areas with masculine leadership. For example, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are considered to be engaged in feminine policy areas, yet, at the time of data collection, these organizations had men in the top leadership position.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0275074011420997">6</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section31-0275074011420997">
<title>Contributions and Limitations</title>
<p>This study makes three contributions to existing research. First, this study focuses on gender in government bureaucracies at the federal level, specifically agencies with regulatory responsibilities. This builds on existing research focusing on gender in top levels of leadership primarily at the state level. Second, this study integrates representative bureaucracy theory with management literature on women and men in leadership to construct a model that includes institutional- and organizational-level variables predicting the distribution of women and men in leadership in federal regulatory organizations. Third, this study suggests that risk may be a multidimensional factor influencing the representation of women in leadership in different ways.</p>
<p>As with any research, this study has limitations. We consider only institutional and organizational-level variables as predictors, so individual factors such as social network ties, and education, are not included in the model. In addition, we do not address the choice factor, that is, we do not examine the extent to which women choose careers paths that track them into feminine policy areas. Of course, one could also suggest that women are socialized from an early age to focus their interests on feminine issues. This, however, cannot be addressed with this data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0275074011420997">
<title>Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>Several questions emerge regarding both passive and active representation from the findings in this study. First, does the gender distribution in leadership and the factors influencing this distribution look similar in state-level agencies? Second, if women are more likely to serve in leadership positions in feminine policy areas, what explains the outliers? In other words, why are some masculine agencies led by women and how does this influence agency dynamics? Following this line of questioning, does the gender of top management affect the relationship between the regulator and the regulated? Third, to what extent do women choose career paths in feminine policy areas and at what point in their careers does this choice become clear? Fourth, to what extent does the political time frame influence the distribution of women in leadership? Replicating this study for past and future time frames, particularly under different presidential administrations, would help address this question. Fifth, to what extent are these results generalizable to other types of federal organizations as well as state- and local-level government organizations? Replicating this study with a sample of state-level regulatory agencies might be a good first step toward addressing this question. Finally, how does gender of leadership in regulatory bodies affect relations with international institutions? This becomes particularly interesting when international organizations are situated in countries where the socially constructed roles of gender have a different meaning than they do in the United States.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, the data suggest that women tend to be leaders in federal regulatory agencies engaged in feminine policy areas, where the top leader of the agency is a woman, and in agencies that carry a higher risk of failure under certain circumstances. While women do tend to lead certain kinds of agencies and not others, the fact remains that in 39% of these agencies, a woman was the top leader and on average, the top two levels of leadership are 36% women.</p>
<p>While the data suggest that women hold leadership positions more often in feminine policy areas, this is not always the case. In fact, there are several masculine agencies headed by women, with additional women in the second level of leadership. This is particularly interesting in cases where the industry regulated is male dominated. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission not only has a woman in the top level of leadership but also includes women in the second level of leadership. Yet, the leadership in the regulated industry, the financial markets, is primarily male dominated.</p>
<p>Federal government regulation touches many aspects of our lives and is used as a policy tool, particularly in financially strict times when budgetary allocations are a less viable option for influencing policy. In addition, those organizations that implement federal public policy do include women in leadership. However, evidence suggests that women still tend to lead agencies engaged in feminine policy areas, but the outliers indicate that this trend may be changing and that we are moving toward a more representative federal regulatory bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0275074011420997">Huddy and Terkildsen (1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074011420997">1993b</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074011420997">Fox and Oxley (2003)</xref>, we use the terms, “feminine” and “masculine” when discussing the policy areas that are associated with what society, in general, sees as the gender traits of women and men. As these stereotypes are socially constructed, we believe that the terms “feminine” and “masculine” provide the appropriate connotation. However, it is important to note that existing research also uses “women’s” and “men’s” or “female” and “male” when referring to gender. While the dominant sex of individuals employed in these policy areas may coincide with the gender traits associated with the policy area, we focus on the social construction of gendered traits and not whether the policy area is female- or male-dominated in employment.</p>

<p>Foundations for this argument can be found in public administration literature examining the role of men and women in government reform efforts. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0275074011420997">Stivers (1995)</xref> presents a discussion using historical evidence that argues women have traditionally pursued government reform efforts in support of social welfare issues while men have traditionally pursued government reforms that focused on efficiency of the administrative state.</p>

<p>Prior to constructing the interaction between visibility and legislative complexity, we mean-centered the visibility and legislative complexity variables to limit multicollinearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074011420997">Cronbach, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0275074011420997">Jaccard, Turrisi, &amp; Wan, 1990</xref>).</p>

<p>Because the agency visibility variable was mean centered, a value of 0 here indicates an average value of visibility. Statistical significance of the marginal effect of complexity is indicated when the dotted lines representing the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval both fall either above or below the zero line.

<p>It is important to note here, that while one can consider issues of civil rights and health and safety to be “feminine” policy areas, an argument can be made that the EEOC and OSHA are really more “masculine.” Supporting this note are the historical activities of the EEOC that focused on race to the detriment of issues of gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0275074011420997">National Organization for Women, 2011</xref>) and male-dominated nature of the industrial hygienist profession at OSHA.</p>
