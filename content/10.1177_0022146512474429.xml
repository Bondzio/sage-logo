<p>The 2012 U.S. presidential election saw, for the first time, the election of a major party candidate who publicly supported same-sex couples’ right to marry. Exit polling from that election found that 49 percent of voters supported legal marriage for same-sex couples in their states, compared with 46 percent who opposed. Furthermore, voters for the first time explicitly endorsed marriage rights for same-sex couples by solid majorities in three states. Contrast this emerging support for same-sex couples with the fact that, since 1998, 30 states have enacted constitutional amendments to limit marriage to different-sex couples. The topic of same-sex couples and their status in U.S. society remains a highly visible and contentious policy debate.</p>
<p>The recent controversy surrounding the publication of two articles critical of academic literature focused on same-sex parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022146512474429">Gates et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022146512474429">Marks 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022146512474429">Regnerus 2012</xref>) suggests that these debates are hardly confined to the public arena and have import within the academy. Citations of substantial amounts of social science literature in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)–related litigation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022146512474429"><italic>Perry v. Schwarzenegger</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022146512474429"><italic>In re Golinski</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022146512474429"><italic>Windsor v. United States</italic> 2012</xref>) demonstrate that these academic debates matter in forming public policy. It is also important to understand how public policy changes that can either support or further stigmatize sexual minorities might affect LGBT health and well-being.</p>
<p>The two articles featured in this issue by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022146512474429">Liu, Reczek, and Brown (2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022146512474429">Denney, Gorman, and Barrera (2013)</xref> make much-needed contributions to our understanding of how same-sex couples and families fare in a society marked by rapid social and legal change. Notably, both articles document health disadvantages for same-sex couples compared with different-sex married couples, disadvantages that cannot be fully explained by differences in socioeconomic status. Same-sex couples in the National Health Interview Survey provide a rare example of a large population-based data source that includes at least a subset of the LGBT population. Because of the relatively large samples, both studies are able to analyze subgroups within same-sex couples and document that gender and race-ethnicity may be factors that are important to consider with regard to LGBT health.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to get sufficiently large samples, the authors are forced to pool data over a decade of surveys. This type of pooling is an unfortunate necessity in the face of small samples and not uncommon in LGBT research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022146512474429">Badgett 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022146512474429">Berg and Lien 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022146512474429">Black et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022146512474429">Blandford 2003</xref>). A challenge with such pooling is that it potentially masks changes over time in the demographic composition of LGBT individuals that could be related to changes in social climate. An expansive literature (cited in both articles) documents evidence that social stigma toward the LGBT population and same-sex couples likely contributes to poorer health outcomes, especially mental health outcomes. Both groups of authors also acknowledge their inability to empirically consider the effect of social stigma on LGBT health.</p>
<p>The lack of population-based data that permits an assessment of how social stigma interacts with other demographic characteristics to affect LGBT health constitutes a substantial gap in our understanding of LGBT health disparities. But the issue is not just measuring social stigma. It may also be that changes in social stigma are altering the actual composition of LGBT samples by changing who is willing to identify as such in surveys.</p>
<p>Social stigma toward LGBT people and their relationships is clearly declining. In 1998, analyses of the General Social Survey showed that nearly two-thirds of adults (63.1 percent) in the United States thought that same-sex sexual relationships were almost always or always wrong. By 2010, that figure had dropped to less than half (49.4 percent).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022146512474429">1</xref></sup> This substantial change in social attitudes has been accompanied by an increase in how many adults identify as LGBT as well as changes in the demographic composition of those who self-identify.</p>
<p>I analyzed two data sources to consider how the LGBT population has changed in the last two decades. The 1992 National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS), conducted by NORC in 1992, surveyed 3,432 adults in the United States and included a sexual orientation identity question (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022146512474429">Laumann et al. 1994</xref>). The Gallup Daily Tracking Survey added an LGBT-identity question in June 2012 and collected more than 121,000 responses from adults in the United States between June and September of that year (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022146512474429">Gates and Newport 2012</xref>). In 1992, just 1.8 percent of adults identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB; representing just 60 observations). Twenty years later, the Gallup data showed that the portion of adults identifying as LGBT had nearly doubled to 3.5 percent. The LGB-identified sample in the NHSLS and LGBT-identified individuals in the Gallup data were demographically very different. Fewer than 10 percent of LGB respondents in the NHSLS were nonwhite, compared with one-third of those identifying as LGBT in the Gallup data. More than 7 in 10 LGB respondents (71 percent) in the NHSLS were male, compared with fewer than half (47 percent) in the Gallup data. The oldest LGB-identified respondent in the NHSLS was 55 years old. Nearly 22 percent of LGBT-identified adults in the Gallup survey were 55 or older. At the other end of the age spectrum, 35 percent of NHSLS LGB respondents were younger than 30, compared with 39 percent of LGBT individuals in the Gallup data.</p>
<p>In 1992, in the face of very high social stigma, LGBT people willing to identify in surveys may have been those with the greatest resources, both financial and psychological, to withstand the possible stigma associated with that identity. As stigma declines, it appears that more women, racial-ethnic minorities, and both younger and older individuals are willing to identify as LGBT, all factors that also likely contribute to greater diversity of socioeconomic status. Changes in LGBT well-being over time could actually be counterintuitive. Although a reduction of stigma should lead to better health outcomes, it could also mean greater demographic diversity within the LGBT-identified population that correlates with less positive health outcomes.</p>
<p>Of course, identity is not the only way to measure sexual orientation and gender identity. But my own analyses of NHSLS data compared with recent data from the General Social Survey suggest substantial increases in reports of same-sex sexual behaviors and attractions, which are also likely accompanied by differences in the demographic characteristics of those who report such behaviors and attractions.</p>
<p>Attempts to understand LGBT health disparities and how public policy might affect those disparities must take into account the impact of social stigma on sexual minorities. Researchers must also consider the possibility that changes in social stigma may affect the demographic composition of sexual minority populations in ways that do not always predict better health outcomes. If added stigma reduces LGBT demographic diversity and reduced stigma increases it, the causal mechanisms of stigma on LGBT health and well-being could be, at best, complicated.</p>
<p>As a first step, we must collect better data. As directed by the recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022146512474429">Institute of Medicine (2011)</xref> report on LGBT health disparities, federal data collection efforts must move toward greater LGBT inclusion. Social scientists must also develop better and more thoughtful theoretical models that consider how underlying LGBT demographics might be changing over time and how social climates affect those changes. The articles presented in this issue offer a meaningful contribution to our understanding of LGBT health. Unfortunately, they also highlight how the lack of data on sexual minorities offers a substantial barrier to the development of both theoretical and empirical models that can better assess how LGBT-related policies affect the health of LGBT individuals.</p>
