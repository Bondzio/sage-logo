<p>Since the 1980s, the gambling industry has undergone a massive growth worldwide. This has been partly due to the gradual legitimation and legalization of gambling, and the advent of affordable home computers and internet, which have allowed for online gaming. This growth has been particularly noticeable in the area of poker. In a mere decade, this American card game has become a global phenomenon involving millions people and billions of dollars. Ole Bjerg’s <italic>Poker: The Parody of Capitalism</italic> takes a look at this development.</p>
<p>The basic argument of the book is that poker mirrors financial capitalism. This is derived from the general principle that games are fundamentally a “cultural expression” of “a set of existential conditions of life” (p. 1). This principle is based on Baudrillard’s notion of parody, which means that games generally simulate features of the ordinary world without the concomitant ideological baggage to justify those features. This notion, in turn, is a more nuanced version of the old Marxian belief that the ideological superstructure reflects and justifies the economic infrastructure. Thus, parody reflects the economic superstructure but dispenses with its ideological counterparts. For example, Bjerg argues that the circulation of money in poker resembles that of financial capitalism. Similar to financial capitalism, poker is an unfair, inefficient, and unproductive means of distribution of wealth. However, unlike capitalism, it dispenses with any ideological discourse that either asserts the contrary or aims to justify it. Furthermore, poker players are said to display key psychological traits of financial capitalists: a winner/loser attitude toward life expressed in ruthless competitiveness, calculated risk-taking, and feigned imperturbability. In short, “poker simulates core features of contemporary capitalism and displays these in a very pure form. Poker functions as a parody of capitalism” (p. 2). Bjerg also uses the term “structural homologies” (p. 203) to refer to such similarities.</p>
<p>The book is divided into four parts, each containing two or three chapters. Part One, containing Chapters One–Three of the book, provides a philosophical analysis of poker. Chapter One gives an outline of the ontological structure of poker. Bjerg employs Slavoj Zizek’s distinction among three different ontological orders: the symbolic, the real, and the imaginary. This allows Bjerg to capture three dimensions of poker: chance, calculation, and the psychological manipulation of the opponent. The three orders are said not to coagulate into a stable structure. The rhythm of the game is determined by the oscillation between the three dimensions. The players never know if the next hand is determined by calculation of probability, bluffing, or chance. Chapter Two continues along the same lines. Using a single hand played by the poker professional Gus Hanson as an example, it demonstrates how Texas Hold ‘Em, a particular form of poker, is played. Bjerg’s aim is to introduce the basics of strategic reasoning in poker. Chapter Three concludes the philosophical analysis of Texas Hold ‘Em by using Zizek’s ontology to uncover the difficulties of poker strategies.</p>
<p>Part Two contains Chapters Four and Five. Chapter Four describes the global poker network as an economic system for the circulation and distribution of money, where money tends to flow from weaker players (the “fish”) to the richer and stronger ones (the “shark” and the “whale”) (pp. 81-82). This is because the latter can use not only their stronger skills, but also their money to determine the size of the pot and thereby determine the flow of the game. This is said to be comparable to capitalism where the owners can use their resources to accumulate the surplus value produced by workers. Based on data from an online game provider outlining the relative proportions of different categories of winning and losing players and the different styles of playing, Chapter Five identifies five classes of players in order of increasing degree of skills and monetary resources: Leisure, ABC, Serious, Novice, and Professional. Money tends to flow from the first to the last category.</p>
<p>Part Three, containing Chapters Six–Eight, focuses on the players’ different forms of subjectivity. Based on qualitative interviews, Chapter Six discusses the specific skills needed to succeed as a professional poker player. Employing Slavoj Zizek’s analytical triad, Chapter Seven introduces three ideal-typical approaches to poker. Corresponding to each order of the triad respectively, Bjerg introduces “the Sucker,” “the Grinder,” and “the Player.” The first type plays the game as if it were a game of pure chance, the second is aware of the element of probability and is very calculating in their approach, and the third is an apt reader and manipulator of their opponents. Chapter Eight discusses the issue of problem gambling in poker. Using qualitative data, the chapter introduces four different types of problem gamblers in poker.</p>
<p>Part Four, containing Chapters Nine–Eleven and the conclusion to the book, covers the basic theme of the book: the significance of poker in relation to capitalism. Chapter Nine introduces Baudrillard’s view of games, a “parodic simulacrum,” as a way of conceptualizing this relationship. Similar to high finance, poker is presented as an economic activity with players driven purely by profit motives: “Poker without real money is not poker” (p. 200). Chapter Ten shows that the evolution of poker from Flat poker to Texas Hold ‘Em corresponds to the evolution of different paradigms of capitalism. The emergence of poker at the beginning of the nineteenth century in New Orleans represented a particular mentality (cheating and bluffing) corresponding to the expansionist phase of capitalism from the Eastern to the Western United States. New Orleans was the place where the capitalist East met the Western frontier with its vast, untapped resources. Successive innovations in the game of poker between 1830, 1850, and 1875 paralleled key structural features of capitalism. Similar to capitalism’s structural mechanisms that work to distribute wealth in favor of the capitalist class, the strategic introduction of new elements in poker resulted in a decrease in the chance element and an increase in strategic elements that skewed the game in favor of better and richer players. Of key importance here was the move from 20 to 52 cards which allowed richer players with knowledge of probability an advantage. Chapter Eleven shows that the circulation and distribution of value in No-Limit Texas Hold ‘Em simulate the same processes as post-industrial capitalism: increasing fragmentation, fluctuation, and risk.</p>
<p>In general, this book falls squarely within the genre that for the past two decades has been looking at the phenomenon of gambling. However, it dispenses with the usual “gambling-as-a-social-problem” line of argument and, instead, discusses it as a set of social relations shaped by the economic system. As such, it is both refreshing and significant to the field of gambling research. It is methodologically sound, but it could benefit from more historical data (especially Chapter Ten).</p>
<p>Innovations in poker are said to occur, but the innovators remain unexplored. Were these innovations intentional or unintentional? How exactly did capitalism influence these innovators? Overall, this is an engrossing book that in the end makes the case for the points it set out to make. It is a highly accessible and enjoyable read for anybody interested in the world of gambling.</p>
