<abstract>
<p>The article reviews the state of M&amp;E in South Asia, and makes a case for building capacity in the field, without which the discipline will remain underdeveloped, and accountability for government spending not improve. We suggest that almost none of the South Asian countries have yet managed to develop an M&amp;E ‘system’, though all have mechanisms in place. The article discusses the MIS and evaluation systems, tools in use by governments in South Asia, budgets for evaluation, and the role of civil society organizations. It highlights two cases in South Asia (India and Sri Lanka) where the concept of Performance Management has gathered momentum, even though outcome budgeting has barely taken off in any country of the sub-region. It examines plans for improving implementation of evaluation, but finds many areas suffering from capacity weaknesses. The article closes by recommending ways to address the capacity weaknesses.</p>

<body>
<p>A surge in public expenditure driven by economic growth has occurred in South Asia, which in turn has resulted in a growing demand for Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (M&amp;E) and Performance Management (PM), from policy makers, programme implementers, international donor organizations and civil society at large. Our discussions with government officials show evidence that macro-economic policy makers (ministries of finance and planning) are demanding quality public spending and better outcomes from public investments. In the light of these imperatives, initiatives have been taken by South Asian governments to improve the evaluation environment. Today, most development schemes of importance get evaluated from time to time, either because of donor insistence or the intrinsic faith of planners, policy makers and programme implementers in the value of evaluations. In South Asia, not only is public expenditure much more under the scanner, but the slow progress towards the achievement of MDGs has also led to a greater stress on effectiveness of aid through a results-based management approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012471257">Ratnala, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1356389012471257">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, while there is a shift in thinking, the capacities to conduct results-focused evaluations are still limited in the region. The existing capacity-building institutional facilities are also meagre. The efforts in this direction are ad-hoc and sporadic. Also, there is lack of appreciation by planners and programme administrators of the subtle differences between socio-economic research and development evaluation. The general perception among commissioners of evaluation is that any good socio-economic researcher/institute can be trusted to conduct good evaluation. However, evaluation professionals in the region are aware that this assumption is not in order as evaluation theory and practice differ in many respects from methodologies of social-science research. Sensitization of evaluation commissioners, planners and administrators to these differences, while also producing basic course modules on development evaluation theory and practice for practitioners, are first steps in evaluation capacity building and mainstream monitoring and evaluation as a potent tool in governance. A review of the current status of development evaluation in the region and discussions with professionals lead to the inescapable diagnosis that a large number of both demand- and supply-side weaknesses need to be addressed before an evaluation culture can be mainstreamed in development planning and administration. Besides, despite the increase in Management Information Systems (MIS) and evaluation activity, the question remains: are these evaluations utilized in reforming programmes and policy modifications?</p>
<p>This overview of the current performance information and M&amp;E systems in South Asia has been written from within the Institute of Applied Manpower Research (IAMR) – an autonomous ‘think-tank’ within the Indian federal government’s Planning Commission. The Commission is a body responsible for developing India’s’ five-year plans and also acts as a channel for funding plan-related federal programmes. The article is therefore written by an ‘insider’ who, nonetheless, maintains an independent, research-driven perspective. At the same time it brings together arguments about public sector performance and monitoring systems that are based in part on practical experience and active involvement in the policy process. To that extent it is an ‘opinion piece’ – it should certainly not be seen as reflecting the views of the government of India. While it is not based on a formal review of South Asian M&amp;E, it is based on a series of interviews (formal and informal), examination of websites, and discussions (formal and informal) with key stakeholders both inside government and outside (including donors).</p>
<p>This article starts from the conceptual framework that a ‘system’ of M&amp;E requires four pillars: a MIS for every major programme; the institutional and human infrastructure to conduct evaluations; a PM system; and an outcome budgeting system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356389012471257">Mehrotra, forthcoming</xref>). We suggest that almost none of the South Asian countries have yet managed to develop a ‘system’ in this sense, though all of them have an incipient system in place.</p>
<p>Section 1 discusses the MIS and evaluation systems, and tools in use by governments in South Asia, with a brief examination of budgets for evaluation. It also discusses the role of civil society organizations. Section 2 discusses the two cases in South Asia (India and Sri Lanka) where the concept of PM has gathered momentum, even though outcome budgeting has barely taken off in any country of the sub-region. Section 3 discusses plans for improving implementation of evaluation. The article concludes by summarizing the capacity weaknesses that need to be addressed.</p>

<title>Implementation of M&amp;E by government and civil society</title>
<p>This section examines the existing systems of monitoring, evaluation (including impact evaluation) and PM in South Asian countries and gaps therein in order to assess the demand for capacity building. The need and/or demand for M&amp;E and PM services has been partly assessed on the basis of a questionnaire sent out to key informants (in government, independent evaluators/practitioners, including members of an organization that brings together evaluators from South Asia, called the Community of Evaluators [COE]) in all South Asian countries; and follow-up telephone conversations in all South Asian countries, and video conferencing with key informants in government. It has also been assessed on the basis of interactions at various national and international conferences, discussions with experts at the Conclave of COE forums, and available documents.</p>
<sec id="section2-1356389012471257">
<title>Systems and tools</title>
<p>M&amp;E of public sector development interventions exist in almost all South Asian countries, though they vary from country to country in their scale, reach and effectiveness. Most ministries in these countries collect data in a MIS, although the use of that data is minimal. This MIS data collection function is usually decentralized in the large countries’ to the individual line ministries; but in smaller countries this function is centralized, usually in the Planning Ministry. For example, in Bangladesh, Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED), under the Ministry of Planning, monitors all development programmes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imed.gov.bd">http://www.imed.gov.bd</ext-link>). Similarly, in Bhutan the Gross National Happiness Commission – Bhutan‘s apex planning agency – plays a central role in development planning and monitoring through the National Plan Monitoring System. The National Planning Commission, Nepal, Ministry of Plan Implementation, Sri Lanka, and the Ministry of Economy, Afghanistan, are responsible for M&amp;E activities in their respective countries. India has a MIS for each one of the Government of India’s 13 flagship programmes, though they are of varying quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012471257">Mehrotra et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>As regards the Evaluation function, the function derives its legitimacy from the existence of the planning function. Almost all South Asian countries have a planning ministry, usually called the Planning Commission (in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan). The Indian M&amp;E system is not unique in South Asia in having in its Planning Commission a Programme Evaluation Organization (PEO) from the early 1950s – whose function has been in India, through its 15 sub-regional offices, to conduct or facilitate evaluations of government programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1356389012471257">2</xref></sup> South Asian countries have had a tradition of creating, soon after independence from colonial rule, Planning Commissions that incorporated the Evaluation function (e.g. IMED, Bangladesh, Ministry of Plan Implementation, Sri Lanka, Planning Commission, Pakistan, and so on). Five-yearly and annual targets are set for achievement of goals by the national planning bodies and are reviewed periodically (annual/quarterly) by the implementing organizations and the planning bodies.</p>
<p>While ex-ante evaluations are not common, major programmes are subject to mid-term and terminal evaluations. Information on programme beneficiaries’ satisfaction is generally sought through such ex-post evaluations, which are a recent phenomenon. A shift in evaluation thinking is taking place wherein monitoring using Logical Framework Analysis (LFA) has become mandatory (Sri Lanka). In India, also, LFA and other monitoring tools are in use, though not mandatory.</p>
<p>Most of the evaluations in the region (except in India) are donor-driven. For example, national disasters like the tsunami in Sri Lanka, earthquake in Pakistan, floods in Bangladesh and war in Afghanistan have led to a flow of international donations, and have also supported evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012471257">Ratnala, 2009</xref>). Since most South Asian countries are low-income countries (except Pakistan and India), and receive significant aid, donor-driven evaluations are almost a norm, rather than an exception, even under normal circumstances. For instance, the Government of Nepal introduced a project on ‘Strengthening the Monitoring and Evaluation System in Nepal’ in collaboration with the International Development Centre of Japan (National Planning Commission Secretariat). The focus of the project had been to provide training in M&amp;E and to improve training manuals, monitoring reporting documents and sharing knowledge and skills. Donors emphasize the need for result-based evaluations. Thus, these are conducted as per requirements of the donor agencies. These evaluations are generally not unbiased and do not provide real feedback about the interventions. These are also limited in scope. Impact assessments or beneficiary satisfaction is only a small component of evaluations and do not lead to programme modifications. Such evaluations are also not effective due to lack of evaluation capacity. Evaluations are weak in evaluation design and professional outlook. There is a huge shortage of professional evaluators in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356389012471257">Williams and Sankar, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1356389012471257">
<title>Budgets allocated to M&amp;E units and staff</title>
<p>In most countries, budgets are provided from projects funds on an ad hoc basis for M&amp;E (e.g. in Pakistan, all projects greater than Rs 60 million have an allocation for M&amp;E and this has been proposed to rise to 1% of the project cost). Generally, allocations on M&amp;E do not exist except where there are specific organizations for M&amp;E (e.g. Programme Evaluation Organization (PEO) in the Planning Commission in India has a separate budget and staff; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.planningcommission.gov.in">http://www.planningcommission.gov.in</ext-link>). As for PEO, Planning Commission of India, there are specific allocations made to IMED in Bangladesh, Planning Commission, and Ministry of Plan Implementation, Sri Lanka, for evaluation work. M&amp;E units are being set up in government or for donor-driven projects as part of project funding. Anecdotal evidence suggests that budget allocations have increased in the region but the extent of increase and staff allocation is far from satisfactory. In fact, information regarding budgets could not be obtained – since funds for M&amp;E are usually provided on an ad hoc basis. However, indications are that the region is giving importance to M&amp;E and activities are expanding, calling for additional personnel with adequate skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1356389012471257">
<title>Civil society organizations in M&amp;E activity</title>
<p>Evaluations in the region are conducted not only by government bodies, but also through independent organizations in the public (i.e. research institutes, universities) as well as the private sector. The trend in recent years is to outsource most evaluations to civil society organizations (e.g. Non-Governmental Organizations [NGOs] or research Institutes) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imed.gov.bd">http://www.imed.gov.bd</ext-link>). Thus, civil society has become a rapidly growing influence in the M&amp;E effort in development planning and implementation in South Asia. This became clear in our interactions with the key informants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cptu.gov.bd">http://www.cptu.gov.bd</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The network of print and audio visual media is yet another set of institutions influencing the role of M&amp;E and performance management (PM) of public expenditure. The last two decades has seen a sharp increase in the number of TV- and internet-based media in South Asia, as well as the rise of investigative journalism. The media may not be engaged in M&amp;E per se, but it influences its demand, and when evaluation findings become available, they publicize them independently.</p>
<p>Moreover, the demand for greater accountability is also emerging from civil society activists who are engaged in the Right to Information (RTI) movement. The output-related targets set by government departments for their own programmes are now available through the RTI, which gives fillip to the movement. The movement has gathered momentum since 2005 in India (after the passage of the RTI Act by Parliament), but similar movements have existed in Nepal for a while, and are incipient in other countries given the success of the Indian RTI Act.</p>
<p>In addition, in some South Asian countries there exist associations of professional evaluators (e.g. Development Evaluation Society of India in India since 2002). In Sri Lanka a few civil society organizations such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356389012471257">Sri Lanka Evaluation Association (2003)</xref> are playing an active role in conducting independent evaluations and advocating for the cause of M&amp;E since September 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389012471257">Sridharan, 2009</xref>). In Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan and Nepal there are non-governmental organizations, independent evaluators and other academic organizations that are involved with evaluations but, as stated earlier, these evaluations are done on the requests of donors. Non-governmental organizations do not have desired levels of competency in organizing evaluations; as a result the quality of evaluations remains an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012471257">Ratnala, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-1356389012471257">
<title>PM and outcome budgeting</title>
<p>The region is beginning to show concern about PM in the light of huge public expenditure being made in the social sector. However, only two countries (India and Sri Lanka) have initiated action to develop mechanisms for PM. In 2005, the Finance Minister presented for the first time in independent India, an Outcome Budget. It was a kind of report card on the implementation of promises by the government of India. The more important development is that government has introduced a Performance Monitoring and Evaluation system (PMES) for government departments and ministries from the year 2009–10 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pmindia.nic.in">http://www.pmindia.nic.in</ext-link>). PMES requires each department of the Government of India (State governments are not so bound, though Punjab and Maharashtra are racing ahead) to prepare a Results-Framework Document (RFD) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dolr.nic.in">http://dolr.nic.in</ext-link>). The RFD provides a summary of the most important results that a department expects to achieve during the financial year. The document has two objectives: a) move the emphasis of the department from process-orientation to results-orientation; and b) provide an objective and fair basis to evaluate the department‘s overall performance at the end of the year. It means that departments set their own targets and use RFDs to prepare the Outcome Budgets at the end of a financial year. The fact that State governments are also demanding RFDs suggests that demand for PM is growing, and will continue to grow.</p>
<p>In India, a list of 59 departments signed RFDs in Phase 1 (2009–10), 62 in 2010–11, and 78 departments signed RFDs in 2011–12; in other words, practically the whole central government. The 14-page RFD enumerates what the government department should be doing for good governance. However, our discussions with department officers revealed that within the last year, the RFD template required filling in the same information for the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356389012471257">Comptroller and Auditor General (2003)</xref>, for the RFD, and for demand for grants from the Planning Commission. So clearly, there is need for greater clarity and differentiation between the requirements of the various seekers of this similar information.</p>
<p>There are two additional levels of challenges that the Indian experience with PM has thrown up (the first of which is likely to arise in the other federal South Asian country, Pakistan, also). The first is that in a federal country, the vision of the central government department is complicated by the fact that implementation of a policy or programme is often dependent upon the State/provincial government. Clearly, PM in such federal countries is bound to be embroiled in structural issues of governance.</p>
<p>The second challenge is common to all South Asian countries: there may be lack of inter-ministerial support at central government level itself for achieving the results stated in the RFD. The unwillingness of each ministry to coordinate, leading to coordination failures and ineffective programmes, needs tackling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356389012471257">Mehrotra, forthcoming</xref>).</p>
<p>The only other country where PM has gathered traction in South Asia is Sri Lanka. Considering Managing for Development Results (MfDR) an essential aspect of good governance, the Sri Lankan government has adopted the concept gradually since the 1990s. The institutionalization of MfDR is seen as a major shift in focus in the M&amp;E arrangements in Sri Lanka. MfDR includes a management cycle of setting direction, planning, implementation and delivering and reviewing the results that then feedback into the cycle to improve future planning and making an ongoing improvement. The MfDR approach adopted in Sri Lanka is more of a ‘whole-of-government’ approach covering national, sectoral, and institutional and project level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389012471257">Sivagnanasothy, 2010</xref>). The Ministry of Plan Implementation has also established a web-based MfDR platform in the National Operations Room –the information arm of the Ministry of Plan Implementation – to maintain an Agency Results Framework and a Score Card/Report card for each line Ministry.</p>
<p>That demand for PM services is growing in the region was demonstrated to us by the fact that India’s Secretary PMES (in the Cabinet Secretariat) was asked by the Sri Lanka government to provide training in PM for senior Sri Lankan civil servants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fabm.gov.lk">http://www.fabm.gov.lk</ext-link>); there is a similar request pending from the Bhutan government. Moreover, within India itself, State governments are seeking the support of PMES, such that two States have already implemented RFDs, and seven others have demanded them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1356389012471257">
<title>Plans for improving implementation</title>
<p>In the recent past, a number of institutional mechanisms have been put in place to improve PM for development projects in South Asia. For instance, in India, dissatisfaction with the existing M&amp;E institutions has led to the proposal to create an Independent Evaluation Office. This new office (which will become functional in early 2013) will subsume the structure and functions of the PEO of the Planning Commission. It is expected that with this organizational structure and field organization, the phase of decline that PEO had entered in the 1980s will come to an end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356389012471257">Mehrotra, forthcoming</xref>). A Delivery Monitoring Unit has also been established in the Prime Minister‘s Office, which is intended to verify the numbers being put out on the line ministry’s (responsible to implement the programme) MIS website. In Sri Lanka, too, the government initiated a comprehensive Performance Measurement System in 2006–07 in four key line ministries (Education, Health, Agriculture, Highways) to begin with, later extended to 35 ministries. A range of activities such as awareness programmes, advocacy and sensitization for policy makers and training programmes were conducted with the technical support of UNDP and ADB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356389012471257">Asian Development Bank, 2008</xref>). The performance tracking system in Sri Lanka will be expanded to all ministries in future. In Bhutan, UNDP is expected to support a national system to monitor and evaluate poverty and Millennium Development Goals, and the government is set to adopt result-based planning and budgeting through the introduction of a multi-year rolling budget system. In Bangladesh, also, a more credible MIS system than the one at present is being put in place as the government has announced to make the country a ‘Digital Bangladesh’. In Afghanistan, the Performance Management Balance Scorecard is a cornerstone of the government, which is at present being used for the health sector and will be expanded for other sectors also. What this description suggests is that while the need for PM has been recognized, it is still very much in an embryonic stage.</p>
<p>Similarly, a MIS exists in incipient form in almost all countries, but our examination of the websites of ministries in the region suggests that these are at different stages of development. Even in India, MIS are still not universal, especially not in the state governments’ programmes. Even for India’s 13 central government flagship programmes, the MIS are at varying levels of evolution, and of uneven quality. Moreover, there are concerns around the utilization of the information collected by the MIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012471257">Mehrotra et al., 2012</xref>). MIS is yet to be made fully functional in other countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Afghanistan. However, web-based monitoring systems have been developed by all these countries – as demonstrated by the existence of websites of line ministries (which we searched, see Reference section). For example, Pakistan has designed a Project Monitoring and Evaluation System software with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank. Bhutan has PLaMS, which is a key component of their national M&amp;E system. Such web-based systems call for cadre with adequate skills.</p>
<p>Such web-based systems are also critically dependent upon the availability of broadband connectivity at sub-district level, which is often not available in many countries outside India, and even in India it is still not available at village level in many states of the country, although all block-level offices (the level of administration below the district but higher than a village) have broadband connectivity.</p>
<p>South Asian countries (except Sri Lanka) do not have a very specific policy for training of their staff in M&amp;E activities. However, ad-hoc arrangements are there for training and officials are nominated for training organized by various institutions in respective countries. For example, in Afghanistan, the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development and the Ministry of Finance are organizing courses in Result-Based Management for two to three days for government officials. In Bangladesh, IMED’s projection of weaknesses of project managers in planning and implementation techniques finally culminated in the creation of the Academy for Planning and Development in 1985, which imparts regular training to officers in the techniques of project preparation, implementation and management (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imed.gov.bd">http://www.imed.gov.bd</ext-link>). In Nepal there is no official training institute for providing focused training in M&amp;E. Nepal Administrative Staff College organizes training programmes for government personnel on topics relating to management and planning. Some issues relating to M&amp;E are also a part of the syllabus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nasc.org.np">http://www.nasc.org.np</ext-link>).</p>
<p>However, most current training programmes are short-term courses, and those too conducted occasionally. In India, some of these institutes offering such courses are: National Institute of Rural Development, Hyderabad and its regional offices; Indian Institute of Public Administration, New Delhi; Administrative Staff College of India; Institute of Applied Manpower Research, New Delhi; and International Management Institute, New Delhi. In Sri Lanka, most of the courses are meant for government officials at central level. Short-term courses offered by Sri Lanka Evaluation Association, although open for all, are largely attended by participants located centrally. Offices at district level have hardly any arrangement for capacity building. The management institutions running courses on management have some components of M&amp;E in their syllabus. Finally, some personnel from non-governmental institutes, besides government officials from most of the South Asian countries, are nominated for international courses (e.g. IPDET in Canada) organized by the World Bank and other international organizations. There has, however, been an initiative called Training Evaluation in South Asia (TESA) by six South Asian Universities (two from India, one each from Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Pakistan) to start full-time courses in M&amp;E; but all these facts still only indicate the need for more institutionalized capacity building in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012471257">Canadian International Development Agency, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Most importantly, there is very little explicit recognition in countries other than India and Sri Lanka (and under donor-pressure, in Afghanistan) of PM in government, and the need for government departments to agree on RFDs and Performance Agreements. A great need exists for sensitization in regard to PM in the South Asian region in most countries, and in the federal countries at the State/provincial level.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is some evidence of Impact Evaluations being conducted in most countries in the region, but awareness of these new techniques needs to improve. The growth in Impact Evaluation is often due to the proactive role played by the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) in this regard. The global headquarters of 3ie are located in New Delhi, and they remain active in support of such activities.</p>
<p>Finally, there is no mechanism in place to assess the skill gaps among personnel functioning in the M&amp;E area, since experts are hired on a project basis at present. This skill gap itself has to be assessed so that governments/civil society can domestically take action to fill the gap.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1356389012471257">
<title>Accountability and utilization: Availability and use of performance information</title>
<p>Dissemination of performance information primarily takes the form of publication of reports and data on the websites of ministries implementing the programmes. This electronic dissemination of information is fairly well established in India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Achievement reports are available more frequently online. In Sri Lanka, a monthly electronically-updated database is used for evaluations in the country (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fabm.gov.lk">http://www.fabm.gov.lk</ext-link>). In Pakistan, data are to be made available online after PMES in line ministries are put in place for use by all stakeholders. The system has developed a regular follow-up mechanism for providing accurate and timely information on project implementation and related issues for decision makers.</p>
<p>Most ministries in all countries have annual reports. In Sri Lanka, yearly reports as per the Annual Development Plans of the line ministries are placed in cabinet meetings for necessary action and future guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389012471257">Sivagnanasothy, 2010</xref>). In Pakistan, the Project Wing reports on a bi-monthly basis are placed before the Cabinet Committee meetings chaired by the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission. In Bangladesh, analysis of the performance of ministries and sectors against agreed targets is provided to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council, line ministries and other concerned parties whenever necessary. Evaluation findings, also containing the financial results of schemes at different stages, are made available for use for legislators, the general public and to all stakeholders. However, the use of such reports in future decision making leaves much to be desired. Thus, in India, a former head of the PEO has assessed the utilization of evaluation findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356389012471257">Pal, 2011</xref>), and found that while there is evidence that evaluation findings are widely cited by decision-makers, it is difficult to judge whether programme designs changed significantly, and in the case of a large enough number of programmes for one to assert that a systematic use of evaluation findings are being made.</p>
<p>Some countries, like Afghanistan, do not have a formally constituted accountability system. Some projects that have ties with international organizations are in place to track the progress of the projects. The public financial and procurement systems have been standardized and a pilot provincial budgeting Afghanistan Financial Management Information System is operational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356389012471257">Waissi, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to electronic dissemination, reports and budgets of line ministries are also placed before Parliaments of the respective countries. In India, budget provisions and expenditure details are indicated through annual budgets and annual plans that are accessible to the public. Expenditure on public schemes is subjected to regular audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356389012471257">Comptroller and Auditor General of India, 2003</xref>). In India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, there are Parliamentary Committees comprising members of Parliament attached to various ministries to assess achievements and propriety of expenditure. The Annual Reports of the respective ministries/departments are placed before Parliament and State Legislatures; but these are more a sort of mandatory exercise in a parliamentary system of executive accountability, rather than serving a substantial purpose of utilization of M&amp;E findings at various levels in programme planning and implementation.</p>
<p>In many cases, donors and partner countries still continue to be disbursement oriented. Moreover, donors tend to use their own donor systems rather than country systems to maintain visibility and attribution. The lack of demand for MfDR, shortage of professionals, multiple results frameworks, too many indicators, lack of aid predictability and weak statistical capacity have been identified as constraints for use of performance information in many developing countries. Circulation of reports is a challenge in the region as availability of findings to the beneficiaries and common people is very limited, except for India. Results of donor-driven projects remain with the concerned organizations.</p>
<p>In summary, experts were of the view that evaluation findings are not utilized. In the case of India, Pal cites many examples where evaluations have influenced the re-design of programmes, where the evaluation reports had found serious problems in effectiveness. However, it remains unclear whether even after programmes were re-designed their impact on outcomes on human well-being were significant. They feel that this situation arises because the M&amp;E capacity of organizations, as well as of personnel, is poor; there is a scarcity of staff for such activities; quality evaluations are lacking; and there is a dearth of institutions providing capacity-building programs. In our view, however, it is likely that the problem is not one merely of the quality of evaluations but the fact that accountability systems in general are weak, the incentive-system for bureaucrats to deliver on results are not necessarily in place, and there is no sanction attached or punishment imposed if the results are not achieved. Thus, the Second Administrative Reforms Commission of India has noted these weaknesses in the accountability and incentive systems in the bureaucracy, but much remains to be done to implement the 800 reforms it has recommended. All governments in the region have accountability systems (a parliament, an auditor general, a fairly active media) and incipient M&amp;E systems, but with rapid economic growth in South Asia (faster than in most of sub-Saharan Africa or Latin America) there has also been growth of crony capitalism, which offsets the need and demand for more accountability.</p>

<title>Conclusions about capacity building in South Asian M&amp;E systems</title>
<p>With rapid economic growth in South Asia there has been an increase in public expenditure. Traditionally, government schemes in South Asia have been assessed by government policy-makers in terms of expenditure incurred and adherence to process, with a focus on financial targets being achieved, though focus has been shifting to monitoring of outcomes, impact and PM. We have suggested that India and Sri Lanka have incipient M&amp;E systems, while the other countries are still far from a ‘system’. One of the main reasons why such a system has not emerged in full is because the lack of capacity in each of the four areas we identified in the introduction that mark out a M&amp;E system (a management information system, and an evaluation, PM and outcome budgeting system). Our discussions with key stakeholders (policy-makers, NGOs, evaluators part of the government institutions, and independent academics) revealed several gaps and weaknesses in existing M&amp;E mechanisms in South Asia, and especially capacity building.</p>
<p>We examined the MIS of government schemes, and noted that MIS have tended to become routine. There is no meaningful verification of monitored data. If data collected by administrative ministries is not regularly validated and authenticated, governments will end up having to rely exclusively upon survey-based data, rather than administratively collected data. Another problem with monitoring systems is that they do not keep future evaluations in focus. This results in evaluators collecting large amounts of data that could otherwise have come from monitoring systems.</p>
<p>Second, there is a lack of follow up action on the results of M&amp;E of programmes, though this is much less the case in India. Moreover, no capacity has been developed for adequate data analysis within line ministries, which should be the main users of MIS data. There is a very clear case here for action by donors in the smaller countries of South Asia, but by research-funding bodies in the bigger countries where in-country capacity exists but is not being put to good use.</p>
<p>Third, since evaluation commissioners (i.e. usually the planning ministries or line ministries in each country) lack capacity within the ministry to conduct evaluations, they have been outsourced to research organizations, private consultancies or civil society bodies, domestic and international. However, due to the bidding system and provision for selecting the lowest quotation bid in most government systems, quality of evaluation cannot be ensured.</p>
<p>Fourth, there is the issue of the capacity of the plethora of NGOs with false pretentions to evaluation capabilities that makes proper choice of evaluators difficult, which in turn results in poor quality of evaluations. In the absence of knowledge of evaluation standards, appropriate designing and sampling, and use of adequate performance indicators, reports tend to be of limited utility and are not accepted. As a result, the programme gets evaluated time and again. But most often evaluations suffer due to inadequate competence of the evaluation agency. There is no separate evaluation cadre and expertise. The region also lacks in adequate arrangements for training in this area, with the result that evaluation reports are not diagnostic and lack a problem-solving approach. In other words, institutional capacity to train evaluators has to be created in every state in the larger countries, and at national level in the smaller ones.</p>
<p>Finally, the evaluations are off the mark due to weakness of the programme design. Evaluations are an afterthought and not an inbuilt component of a development intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012471257">Ratnala, 2009</xref>). There is no system to enforce accountability and the focus is on financial monitoring. Programme planning must provide for all projects and programmes above a certain level of expenditure to be evaluated once in a few years, quite apart from having an MIS whose data is periodically validated.</p>

<p>The 11th Five-Year Plan has a list of 27 ‘monitorable targets’, which are similar to the MDG targets but go beyond them, which are used to presumably monitor outcomes. The other South Asian countries use the MDG’s targets/indicators as the relevant indicators.</p></fn>
