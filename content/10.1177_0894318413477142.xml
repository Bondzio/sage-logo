<abstract>
<p>The importance and challenges of the teaching of nursing theory in Uganda are discussed in this introduction to the column that follows it. Two assumptions are questioned, the first is that it is easier to teach nursing students in places like Uganda concrete theories rather than abstract ones, and the other is that a composite of theoretical perspectives in nursing is more practical than a unified theoretical framework for nurses and advanced practice nurses.</p>

<body>
<p>In the column that follows the author, a nurse educator and gerontological nurse practitioner from the United States discusses her experience of teaching nursing theory in Uganda and reflects on her own clinical practice in light of nursing and other theories. She highlights the importance of teaching theory even in locations with extremely limited resources where few nurses have access to baccalaureate nursing education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477142">Lovett &amp; Gidman, 2011</xref>). She seeks to help the learners become aware of how the use of theory in nursing and daily life helps evaluate actions and thinking that improves the quality of nursing practice. Not discussed in the paper is how the history and geography of Uganda has contributed to its current struggles with poverty, unpredictability, and corruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477142">Martin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In her own practice as an advanced practice nurse in the United States, the author reports that she meshes pieces of various theories together into a composite, and that this composite serves her well as a gerontological nurse practitioner and as a member of the interdisciplinary healthcare team. The paper explicitly mentions need and motivation theory, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477142">Erikson’s (1950)</xref> stages of development, which she finds useful in assessing how well older adults are doing. She describes that nursing students in Uganda have more difficulty with abstract nursing theories, which is understandable considering the type of education that they are familiar with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477142">Martin, 2009</xref>). Yet in every culture and country of the world, abstract ideas, stories, and art, are very important in everyday life as well as in nursing and healthcare. Nursing students only need to be encouraged to recognize their relevance to nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477142">Lovett &amp; Gidman, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The process of helping nursing students at various levels of education think about the theories that they and their patients use is valuable not only to evaluate their knowledge, but also to help them become more aware of their inherent assumptions, worldview, and way of being with others. Such educational content and processes can also help raise the position of women and nursing in places where their status has not been well-respected in the past. It would be interesting to hear more from the Ugandan nursing students about their experience of using nursing theory in their nursing practice, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477142">Kongsuwan (2011)</xref> did with nurses working in Thailand. It would be interesting to generate an international dialogue between Ugandan nursing students and nursing students in the United States and elsewhere. An assumption of the author of this introduction is that the processes of exploring one’s own assumptions about the world and about humans and then sharing these views with diverse others is a very valuable learning process for nurses and people in general. It also can be assumed that nurse educators’ familiarity and comfort with teaching more abstract nursing theories is likely to affect how difficult it is for students to learn more abstract theories. Discussing and documenting what is going on in various places and how nurses are making a difference is very important, and now with computers, smart phones, and other mobile devices global communications and sharing of innovative nursing practice, teaching strategies, and models are an everyday possibility. On the other hand, measuring healthcare and other outcomes without trying to understand nurses’ actions and thinking about their work limits the advancement of the science of nursing and healthcare in general.</p>
<p>The question raised in the title of this introduction is: What serves nurses and advanced practice nurses better, the ability to form a composite of pieces of theories or having a coherent and sustaining core theoretical perspective? The latter serves to help nurses and advanced practice nurses to develop their identities as professionals, or “how they will be known,” as Rosemarie Rizzo Parse says (personal communication, June, 6, 2012). This needs to be done before nurses can engage in mutually-respected interdisciplinary work. When nurses have a sustaining core theoretical perspective they can become connected with a community of like-minded nursing scholars, which is often international. The author holds that how the nurse is with others tests empathic skills, knowledge, and values. The problem with forming a personal composite theoretical perspective is just that, it is personal or even private, and therefore not shared in a way that is more likely to advance nursing science. In addition, a composite of theory pieces can often lead to confusion as it may contain inherently incongruent concepts and ideas patched together. Without such clarity the underlying thinking and science can become messy and restrict the development of the profession of nursing and the status of women in struggling places. Even for advanced practice nurses functioning as independent practitioners on interdisciplinary healthcare teams, trying to sound like and think like a physicians or another profession, has multiple ethical, legal, and professional problems, and does not help patients, or the profession. Pressures and expectations in the healthcare workplace can make it difficult for nurses to live their theoretical perspectives and values freely, and be able to communicate genuinely. While nurses and advanced practice nurses may have different theoretical perspectives and approaches, the internal consistency of their worldviews helps them to avoid confusion. The author of the column that follows suggests that <italic>perceived knowledge</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318413477142">McEwen &amp; Wills, 2007</xref>) is more appropriate to nursing practice in some clinical sites, while <italic>received knowledge</italic> is more appropriate in others. It is the experience of this author that the complexity of nursing and healthcare in general in all sites requires both perceived and received knowledge. This is particularly important in a country where nurses are still struggling for respect and autonomy, and where various health professionals are in very short supply.</p>
<p>The second concern, related to this, is that advanced practice nurses, such as gerontological nurse practitioners (GNP), and now adult nurse practitioners/GNP doctors of nursing practice, are now increasingly teaching undergraduate nursing students clinical content and graduate nursing students nursing theory. These advanced practice nurses, may be incorporating more public health and medical knowledge in their instruction than they are aware. This distinction should be made explicit to students and others, to avoid confusion. Even if the nursing students want to become advanced practice nurses, they need to build on a firm and clear nursing base. Nurses and advanced practice nurses do need to be full partners on interdisciplinary teams in practice and research, and coherent nursing perspectives need to be distinct and respected in themselves, not because it can mimic another profession, but rather because they reveal the undeniable commitment to putting the person at the center of healthcare. It is the experience of this author that having a coherent nursing framework helps center nursing careers and helps maintain a view of the person’s dignity and beauty.</p>
