<p>The new century has witnessed the fast development of both ‘traditional Chinese stylistics’ and ‘westernized stylistics’ in China. This article points out that the term ‘style’ (‘<italic>wenti</italic>’) has drastically different senses in the two different analytical contexts, and that the two stylistic approaches have very different concerns. With this distinction and clarification paving the way, this article goes on to review the development of ‘westernized stylistics’ in China in the new century, focusing on functional stylistics, cognitive stylistics, pragmastylistics, corpus stylistics and pedagogical stylistics. In China, westernized stylistic research is often carried out in connection with interlingual translation, either to shed new light on the stylistic choices through interlingual contrast, or to provide a new way for translation criticism. The fast development of westernized stylistics in China has to do with the EFL context, where it has attracted a large number of practitioners in the English department. Moreover, the thriving development of westernized stylistics in China in the new century testifies to the increasing international remit <italic>Language and Literature</italic> and PALA have achieved since more modest beginnings in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Stylistics started developing in China in the 1980s after China opened its door to the outside world. The end of the 1970s and the early 1980s saw the sudden rush into China of various schools of western linguistics, stylistics and literary theory. Having been subjected to political criticism for more than two decades (especially during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976), many Chinese scholars became particularly interested in scientific knowledge and text-oriented critical schools such as new criticism, structuralism, and stylistics. At the turn of the century, I gave a brief review in <italic>Language and Literature</italic> of the development of stylistics in China up to 1999, and this essay will cover the subsequent period from 2000 to the summer of 2011. In September 2000, China’s second national stylistics conference was held at Shandong University, a conference that reached two decisions: first, to establish China Stylistics Association and, second, to hold a national conference on stylistics once every one or two years from then on. At the fourth national stylistics conference held at Henan University in 2004, there was established China Stylistics Association, which decided to hold an international stylistics conference in China once every two years from 2006 onwards. These events promoted the development of stylistics in China in the new century, a development that is mainly reflected in the remarkable increase in publications in the field. During the 1980s and 1990s, although stylistics enjoyed notable development in China, most books published were textbooks or introductory books, and journal essays were primarily in the fields of literary stylistics and pedagogical stylistics. The new century has witnessed a fast increase in more specialized journal essays and PhD and MA dissertations especially in the areas of functional stylistics, cognitive stylistics, pragmastylistics, and corpus stylistics. This picture, however, cannot cover the Chinese department where traditional Chinese stylistics has still somewhat dominated the scene in the new century.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0963947011432054">
<title>2 Traditional Chinese stylistics</title>
<p>By ‘traditional Chinese stylistics’ I mean traditional stylistic research carried out in the Chinese department concerned with the study of ‘<italic>wenti</italic>’ and ‘<italic>fengge</italic>’ of Chinese literary texts, especially ancient ones. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, traditional Chinese stylistics was revived among various formal approaches to literature and it has gained great momentum in the new century. Although there have appeared some articles trying to introduce western stylistics – the study of literary language with linguistics – to scholars in the field of Chinese literature, the impact is somewhat limited (but various scholars, especially postgraduate students, have drawn on western stylistics in their research and some publications in the field of traditional Chinese stylistics show traces of influence of western stylistics). Up until now, ‘stylistics’ for many scholars in the Chinese department has a meaning quite different from ‘stylistics’ in the West, a difference that rests with the different senses of ‘style’ and ‘<italic>wenti</italic>’ (style). The word ‘<italic>wenti</italic>’ for many scholars in the Chinese department has kept its ancient sense, concerned with the language and structural characteristics of literary genres. Stylistic study means the study of generic classification, generic boundary crossing, generic norms/characteristics, and generic development. When the object of discussion is a specific text, the focus is still on how the textual characteristics reflect or deviate from the generic norms, and how the deviation contributes to the development of the genre.</p>
<p>There is another Chinese term ‘<italic>fengge</italic>’ that sounds different (‘style’ is usually translated as ‘<italic>wenti</italic>’, not ‘<italic>fengge</italic>’), but actually comes closer to the western ‘style’ since, apart from being concerned with generic characteristics, it is also concerned with the features of individual authors’ creation or specific texts. But the Chinese ‘<italic>fengge</italic>’ has a much wider sense than western ‘style’, covering the artistic characteristics of ‘the selection and refinement of the subject matter, characterization, the use of language and other representational methods’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0963947011432054">Zheng and Tang, 1989</xref>: 38–39). Moreover, in contrast with the analysis of the correlation between linguistic choices and literary significance in western stylistics, the Chinese investigation of <italic>fengge</italic> is often concerned with the general artistic quality of a literary work based on impressions, and the artistic quality of the text tends to be taken as representative of that of the author’s literary creation in general (or at a certain period if the author’s <italic>fengge</italic> changes over time). Even if specific language choices become the object of investigation, the analysts usually do not apply modern linguistics.</p>
<p>The fact that the Chinese department is not much influenced by western stylistics may be accounted for by the following factors: (a) the strong Chinese literary tradition; (b) people in the Chinese department have less contact with western stylistics; (c) there is a sharper division between linguistics and literature in the Chinese department, and scholars doing stylistics are usually in the field of literature without being equipped with modern linguistic knowledge; (d) there are no such basic language courses like intensive reading or writing, where western stylistics is found to be very helpful. This forms a contrast with the wide interest in western narratology in the Chinese department. Narratology does not really require literary scholars to cross the boundary into linguistics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963947011432054">Shen, 2005</xref>), and it has been widely adopted in literary research and teaching in the Chinese department.</p>
<p>In the new century, not only has traditional Chinese stylistics been enjoying thriving development, ‘western-style’ stylistics has also been progressing very fast in China, thanks to thousands of teachers and postgraduate students engaged in it in foreign languages departments. What follows is concerned with ‘westernized’ stylistic study of texts in English and Chinese (without considering texts in other languages) in China in the 21st century.</p>

<title>3 Functional stylistics</title>
<p>Functional stylistics (short for systemic-functional stylistics) has enjoyed very fast development in the new century in China, which has much to do with the thriving development of functional linguistics in China, primarily led by scholars who once studied with MAK Halliday. In terms of theoretical discussion, Dan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963947011432054">Shen (2002)</xref> reflects on the criteria of relevance, the situational context of a literary text, the relation between qualitative and quantitative prominence or between description and interpretation. Wei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0963947011432054">Zhao (2005)</xref> offers a discussion of the compatibility of formal and functional stylistic models in the interpretation of poetry. Delu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0963947011432054">Zhang (2007)</xref> summarizes, classifies, and predicts the methods (to be) used in functional stylistics. With English metalinguistic texts as source of data, Chengyu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947011432054">Liu (2008)</xref> takes a functional-cognitive stylistic approach to grammatical metaphor. Turning attention to translation, Delu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0963947011432054">Zhang (2008)</xref> tries to establish a theoretical framework for interlingual functional stylistic comparison. Given the focus on Halliday’s works, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963947011432054">Shisheng Liu and Chengfang Song (2010)</xref> direct particular attention to Ruqaiya Hasan’s theoretical model and other western scholars’ views.</p>
<p>In terms of practical analysis, Fan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947011432054">Dai (2002)</xref> combines Halliday’s model with Martin and Rose’s Periodicity and Appraisal in analyzing the stylistic features of a text on both macro and micro levels. Jianguo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963947011432054">Si (2004)</xref> offers a book-length study of the style of prose fiction with functional linguistics. Shuhong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947011432054">Guan (2009)</xref> combines systemic functional linguistics (especially appraisal theory) with narratology in analyzing Virginia Woolf’s <italic>Mrs Dalloway</italic>. When doing a functional stylistic analysis, some Chinese scholars have made comprehensive investigations of stylistic choices realizing all the three metafunctions in poetry, prose fiction, or non-literary discourse. But most functional stylistic analyses in China have adopted a specific model and focused on a specific metafunction. Of the various analytic models in functional linguistics, the system of transitivity pertaining to the ideational function and systems pertaining to the interpersonal function have been most frequently applied in stylistic analysis.</p>
<sec id="section4-0963947011432054">
<title>3.1 Various investigations of transitivity patterning</title>
<p>Starting from 2000, there have appeared more than 100 journal essays focusing on transitivity patterning in various kinds of texts, including novels and short stories, poetry, fairytales, the Bible, jokes, orations, advertisements, newspaper reporting, editorials, abstracts of academic essays, tourist guides, and even Peking opera.</p>
<p>In analyzing transitivity choices in poetry, some scholars not only pay attention to the original texts, but direct attention to the difference in transitivity patterning between the original and its English or Chinese translations, thus shedding light, through contrast, on the respective transitivity choices. In analyzing the translations of the Chinese classic poem ‘Feng Qiao Ye Po’, Jing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0963947011432054">Wu (2006)</xref> combines the transitivity model with cognitive linguistics in investigating the translators’ cognitive tendencies in organizing experience for poetic effects. In terms of novels or short stories, much attention is paid to the effects of transitivity choices in characterization or in the change of a character. Jing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0963947011432054">Yan (2008)</xref> combines transitivity with thematic progression in investigating the style of stream-of-consciousness fiction. As different from other investigations that focus on the contrast between different types of transitivity process, Dan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963947011432054">Shen (2006)</xref> directs attention to how a literary writer creates a contrast within the same (sub-)type of transitivity process to convey deeper symbolic significance. Some transitivity analyses of literary texts are marked by a feminist orientation, trying to reveal hidden male dominance (see for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963947011432054">Qin, 2009</xref>) or the power of female discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0963947011432054">P Zhang, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>When it comes to news reporting, many essays focus on the ideological implications of the transitivity choices involved, and can therefore be viewed as Critical Discourse Analysis from a different angle. The ideological import is sometimes highlighted through a comparison of transitivity choices in English news reporting and Chinese news reporting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0963947011432054">
<title>3.2 Various investigations of interpersonal function</title>
<p>Similar to transitivity, the model of interpersonal function is favored by Chinese scholars when doing functional stylistic analysis, with the past 11 years witnessing the publication of over 100 journal essays in this area. In analyzing prose fiction, much attention is paid to how choices realizing the interpersonal function reveal the relationship among characters or the change in the relationship between the protagonists. Approaching Virginia Woolf’s ‘The Mark on the Wall’ in terms of interpersonal function, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0963947011432054">Qinghua Xiao (2007)</xref> aims at showing the stylistic features of stream-of-consciousness fiction from a new perspective. As for poetry, many essays explore stylistic choices pertaining to the interpersonal function in classical Chinese poems and/or their English translations, as well as those in English poems. When investigating autobiography, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947011432054">Zhanzi Li (2000)</xref> probes the complex ways of manipulating the second person for serving various interpersonal functions.</p>
<p>As regards non-literary texts, much attention is directed to the stylistic choices realizing the interpersonal function in formal speeches, with the US President Obama’s speeches forming the subject of investigation of as many as nine essays. In investigating advertisements, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947011432054">Chen and Xin (2005)</xref> pay particular attention to the relation between interpersonal meaning and persuading effects. Analysis is also made of the realization of interpersonal function in film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0963947011432054">Sun and Ren, 2007</xref>) or TV interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963947011432054">Pang and Chen, 2006</xref>). Combining the consideration of interpersonal function with that of textual function, Caiying Yang devotes her PhD dissertation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0963947011432054">2006</xref>) to the investigation of interpersonal coherence in news interviews.</p>
<p>Since the different ways of realizing the interpersonal function in different languages tend to foreground cultural as well as linguistic differences, some scholars pay particular attention to the interpersonal function in stylistically oriented translation studies of both literary and non-literary texts. Jun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0963947011432054">Xu (2005)</xref> offers a contrastive study of the different ways of realizing interpersonal function in the classical Chinese novel <italic>The Scholar</italic> and its English translations, revealing the in-depth cultural implications and the difference in ethical orientation between the original author and the translators. Based on a distinction between interpersonal-function oriented advertisements and ideational-function oriented advertisements, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963947011432054">Guoqing Li (2008)</xref> investigates the translation strategies in terms of realizing similar interpersonal function when dealing with puns in the former category.</p>
<p>Many Chinese scholars and research students find the systems of functional linguistics very accessible, useful, and productive in stylistic analyses.</p>

<title>4 Cognitive stylistics</title>
<p>In contrast with the sustained fast development of functional stylistics in the new century, cognitive stylistics has enjoyed rapid development in China only recently, with 2008 starting to see a notable increase in journal essays and research dissertations. Of the various models in cognitive linguistics, cognitive/conceptual metaphor theory has been most frequently employed in stylistic analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963947011432054">Shaozeng Ren (2006)</xref> reveals the conceptual metaphor LIFE IS A TWITCH in Robert Penn Warren’s <italic>All the King’s Men</italic>, a conceptual metaphor that serves as a unifying factor, ensuring the coherence of the narrative discourse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0963947011432054">Biqiong Weng (2009)</xref> investigates the correlation between the change of conceptual metaphors and the change of the narrator’s perception of the world. Xiaohui <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963947011432054">Liang (2011)</xref> argues that in John Fowles’ <italic>The French Lieutenant’s Woman</italic>, the TIME IS SPACE metaphor permeates both the narrator’s and the characters’ words, establishing a constructed view of time in line with Sartrean existential phenomenological view of time. With a comparison between Thomas Hardy’s <italic>Tess of the d’Urbervilles</italic> and Cao Xueqin’s <italic>The Story of the Stone</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963947011432054">Xin Peng (2010)</xref> explores the similarities and differences in the use of visual conceptual metaphor in English and Chinese literary texts. Some investigations of conceptual metaphor have focused on English and classical Chinese poems. Turning attention to drama, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963947011432054">Jianguo Si (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963947011432054">2011)</xref> explores the cognitive metaphoric and metonymical dimensions of Cao Yu’s plays.</p>
<p>Various other cognitive models are also employed in stylistic analysis, and the data chosen for analysis are often classical Chinese poems, which characteristically convey rich artistic conception with a small number of words in strict rhyming and rhythmic patterning. Starting from location words reflecting figure-ground, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963947011432054">Li Liang and Rui Chen (2008)</xref> explore the realization of figure-ground in some poems of the Tang Dynasty and its effect on the formation of artistic conception in these classical texts. Focusing on nine English translations of the classical Chinese poem ‘On a Gate-Tower at Youzhou’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947011432054">Chenfei Hu (2010)</xref> analyses how the translations amplify the figure in the original text, or reduce the ground, or involve the loss of the figure-ground distinction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947011432054">Fandong Kong (2011)</xref> approaches the characteristic image of ‘flower’ in the classical poems by Li Qingzhao in terms of conceptual blending. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963947011432054">Haidi Liu (2011)</xref> discusses the interpretive power of conceptual integration theory for Chinese classical poems in general.</p>
<p>As regards prose narrative, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963947011432054">Juling Ma (2008)</xref> takes a text world approach to American black humor fictions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0963947011432054">Yina Wang (2008a)</xref> explores how referential devices realize subjectivity in narrative discourse. In order to investigate characterization in narrative discourse from a cognitive perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963947011432054">Yingrui Gong (2010)</xref> makes some amendments to Jonathan Culpeper’s characterization model for drama analysis, and then applies the modified model to the analysis of characterization in the Bible. Focusing on drama, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963947011432054">Jianwu Gao (2009)</xref> provides an integrated account of the conceptual recycling network and the development of the protagonist’s cognitive style in Brecht’s <italic>Life of Galileo</italic> using the CBT-based Brandt and Brandt model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947011432054">Brandt and Brandt, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Some Chinese scholars combine different models of cognitive linguistics in stylistic analysis. In investigating Virginia Woolf’s <italic>To the Lighthouse</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0963947011432054">Xiufeng Zhao (2009a)</xref> explores the metaphorical representation and blending of consciousness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947011432054">Caixia Li and Linyu Zhang (2010)</xref> make an analysis of Li Bai’s ‘Sitting Alone at the Jingting Mountain’ in terms of figure-ground, image schema and conceptual metaphor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963947011432054">Yunqiu Liu (2009)</xref> explores the style of advertisements in terms of cognitive metaphor, space mapping, and conceptual blending.

<p>Cognitive stylistics, as a later comer in the field, is still gaining momentum in China.</p>

<sec id="section7-0963947011432054">
<title>5 Pragmastylistics</title>
<p>The new century has also witnessed the stable development of pragmastylistics in China. Many investigations are concerned with play texts. Zongxin Feng’s exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963947011432054">2002b</xref>) sheds light on the complicated relationship between the playwright and different types of readers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0963947011432054">Dongming Yu and Jin Zuo (2004)</xref> investigate how pragmatic ambivalence and conversational strategies convey implied meanings and play an important role in characterization. Jianguo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963947011432054">Si (2006)</xref> uses relevance theory to analyze and classify the irrelevant and absurd dialogues in Harold Pinter’s <italic>The Dumb Waiter</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963947011432054">Huadong Li (2007)</xref> makes a book-length analysis of stage directions, revealing its various pragmatic stylistic functions.

<title>6 Corpus stylistics</title>
<p>Under the influence of the fast development of corpus/computational stylistics in recent years in the West, corpus stylistics is now starting to gain momentum in China. In terms of theoretical discussion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963947011432054">Jin Li and Jiangguo Lang (2010)</xref> explore the characteristics of the development of corpus-based study of literature, based on a clarification of the terms ‘corpus stylistics’, ‘computational stylistics’, ‘stylometry’, ‘statistical stylistics’ and ‘quantitative stylistics’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963947011432054">Weizhong Lu and Yun Xia (2010)</xref> discuss the main areas of corpus stylistics, pointing out the advantages of and the pitfalls involved in this approach.</p>
<p>In terms of practical analysis, Liquan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0963947011432054">Wu (2004)</xref> explores, with computer calculation, the features of ‘vigorous style’ and ‘soft style’ in Chinese rhymed literary works, and infers the basic principles for producing such styles. Guanghui <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963947011432054">Ma (2005)</xref> makes a corpus-based stylistic analysis of Faulkner’s <italic>The Sound and the Fury</italic>, trying to show the usefulness and helpfulness of this approach to literary texts. Focusing on Mansfield’s short stories, Aizhen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963947011432054">Sun (2008)</xref> proposes a working model for computational analysis of the relation between lexical choices and affect flow in literary texts.

<p>Some corpus stylistic studies are concerned with non-literary texts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947011432054">Lincong Li and Fangfang Wei (2007)</xref>, for instance, make a corpus-based study of the stylistic features of sports reporting on sports websites. Hongyan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947011432054">He (2009)</xref> offers a corpus-based stylistic comparison between China’s English news reports and Britain’s English news reports, showing that China’s English news has its own characteristics on a micro level.</p>

<title>7 Pedagogical stylistics</title>
<p>In the Chinese context of teaching English as a Foreign Language, stylistics has been from the very beginning especially valued as an approach that can help students to understand the texts in English better in various language and literature courses. Stylistics is also found to be very useful in the teaching of English–Chinese translation. Based on teaching, a large number of essays in pedagogical stylistics have appeared, more than 200 in the new century. Many essays focus on the usefulness and helpfulness of stylistics in the course ‘intensive reading’ which is marked by close reading of texts, and stylistics enables students to understand better the ways of linguistic patterning and the values or subtle effects of the language choices involved. Hongtao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0963947011432054">Zhu (2003)</xref> analyzes how English advertising increases its power of persuasion and credibility though choices in the person and mood systems, and proposes that the teaching of English writing should also help students to utilize effectively the person and mood systems so as to help increase the communicative power of their writing. Focusing on the teaching of English listening, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963947011432054">Yan Shen and Guangjun Meng (2010)</xref> discuss how stylistics helps with the selection of listening materials, the cultivation of listeners’ stylistic awareness, and the processing of the pragmatic information concerned. Dan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963947011432054">Shen (2004)</xref> discusses the complementarity between the literary stylistics course and the narratology course.</p>

<title>8 Conclusion</title>
<p>The limitation of space does not permit me to introduce other branches of stylistics, nor give more details or references. Though the picture is far from complete, the following Chinese characteristics should have become clear: first, ‘western-style’ stylistics has been developing not only at a fast speed in the new century, but also side by side with traditional Chinese stylistics; second, ‘western’ stylistic research is often carried out in connection with interlingual translation, either to shed new light on the stylistic choices through interlingual contrast, or to provide a new way for translation criticism; third, the fast development of ‘western’ stylistics in China has to do with the EFL context, where it has attracted a large number of practitioners in the English department.</p>
<p>As the epithet ‘western’ or ‘western-style’ indicates, the development of this kind of stylistics in China is to a great extent to be attributed to the influence of stylistics in the West, primarily in the English-speaking world. Without the introduction of western stylistics into China, this kind of stylistics would not have come into being in China in the first place. Over the past three decades or so, Chinese scholars have benefited in various ways from stylistics in the West, such as reading western publications in stylistics (some have been translated into Chinese or reprinted in China), visiting or doing an MA or a PhD at western universities attending PALA conferences, listening to lectures given by western stylisticians visiting China (Mick Short, for instance, has made quite a few lecture trips to China), and listening to the plenary speeches by western stylisticians at the international conferences held in China (David G Butt, Michael Cummings, Margaret H Freeman, Joanna Gavins, John McRae, Ruth Page and Paul J Thibault at the 2006 Beijing conference; Michael Burke, David Hoover, Paul Simpson and Michael Toolan at the 2008 Shanghai conference; Geoff Hall, Mick Short, and Michael Toolan at the 2010 Ningbo conference; and Geoff Hall, David S Miall, Will van Peer and Paul Simpson are committed to give a plenary at the forthcoming 2012 Suzhou Conference). The journal <italic>Language and Literature</italic> is quite well known in China, enjoying more Chinese subscriptions in the new century. To make the journal better known in China, at China’s national stylistics conference in 2002 and China’s international stylistics conference in 2008, Dan Shen (a member of the editorial board) and Paul Simpson (the then Editor) respectively introduced the journal to the conference participants at the plenary sessions. The volume <italic>New Development in Western Stylistics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963947011432054">D Shen ed., 2008</xref>) published by Shanghai Foreign Language Education Press contains seven essays published in <italic>Language and Literature</italic>, more than one-third of the total number. The volume <italic>Stylistics: Past, Present and Future</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0963947011432054">D Yu ed., 2010</xref>, brought out by the same press), which is based on papers from the 2008 international conference, contains two articles from <italic>LAL</italic> as a way to help increase the influence of the journal in China. Some Chinese scholars have not only profited from essays published in <italic>LAL</italic>, but also made contributions to the journal (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947011432054">Feng and Shen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947011432054">Ji and Shen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963947011432054">J Li, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The development of stylistics in China in the new century testifies to the increasing international remit <italic>Language and Literature</italic> and PALA have achieved since more modest beginnings in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s. The coming years may witness closer connections or interactions between the English speaking world/PALA/<italic>LAL</italic> and China in the field of ‘western’ stylistics and may see new ways of benefiting each other between western stylistics and traditional Chinese stylistics.</p>
