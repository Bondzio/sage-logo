<p>The dismal science has its optimists. Among them are Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis. Yet sociologists considering their collaborative <italic>oeuvre</italic> might be perplexed. They remain best known in sociology for their <italic>Schooling in Capitalist America</italic>, a devastating critique of our educational system that concludes with a sincere, detailed contemplation of how the “necessary and feasible” socialist revolution can be accomplished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477380">[1976] 2011</xref>: 282). On the other hand, their most recent book, <italic>A Cooperative Species</italic>, is about human evolutionary history and how it has shaped our psychology.</p>
<p>Sociologists are accustomed to arranging their intellectual deck chairs with “socialist revolution” on the left and “evolutionary psychology” on the right. Is this the same Bowles and Gintis? Have they forsaken their political ideals for the seductions of game theory and fieldwork accounts of hunter-gatherers?</p>
<p>Regarding the revolution, Bowles and Gintis have recently said elsewhere that they remain “convinced of the attractiveness of [socialism] as a system, but are less sanguine about its feasibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477380">2011</xref>: xi). If a socialist America is infeasible, why? While <italic>A Cooperative Species</italic> is not directed toward this question—to be clear, it is not specifically about socialism at all—it can nevertheless be read as ruling out one possibility. Human nature is not to blame.</p>
<p>This position is contrary to the common argument that, however appealing radically egalitarian social change may seem in principle, people are too intrinsically selfish for it to work in practice. This is often presented as an unfortunate logical inevitability, as though socialism was the societal analogue of a perpetual motion machine. Nice guys finish last, and more importantly so do their genes, whenever they are in long-run competitive self-interested behavior.</p>
<p>In this view, most of what is perceived as altruism is one or another form of <italic>mutualism</italic>—where helping others is also helping oneself. Altruism toward close relativeness, in which individual-level sacrifice is recast as gene-level selfishness, is the most prominent example. “Scratch an altruist, watch a hypocrite bleed,” famously wrote one early sociobiologist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306113477380">Ghiselin 1974</xref>: 247). The implication is that any social arrangement predicated on substantial human prosociality is many millenia too late to be workable for our species.</p>
<p>Bowles and Gintis dismissed this argument back in <italic>Schooling in Capitalist America</italic>, stating that “the antagonisms, insecurities, provincialisms, egotisms, competitiveness, greed, and chauvinism which we observe in U.S. society do not derive from innate biological needs or instincts or infirmities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113477380">1976</xref>: 16). <italic>A Cooperative Species</italic> may be considered the capstone of considerable work which Bowles, Gintis, and others have done in the intervening years to substantiate this view. The book is an extremely detailed, exacting, and persuasive argument for the possibility that people can be genuinely nice. Or, at least, that “we are not purely selfish” (p. 3).</p>
<p>You do not actually need evolutionary theory to show that people are not purely selfish. Indeed, one might say that evidence that nonselfishness exists is ubiquitiously available to observant social actors, and that it takes the determined ministrations of a science writer or economics professor to cause us to doubt our own motives and those of others. Bowles and Gintis’ preferred scientific evidence on the issue comes from behavioral experiments, especially those that can be compared to straightforward predictions from game theory. They review the large literature of studies in which people paired with strangers show enthusiasm for cooperation that both contradict predictions based on strict self-interest and also defy explanations based on mutualism alone.</p>
<p>Consequently, the puzzle is not whether we are cooperative but how to reconstruct the evolutionary history that made us this way. If you have no interest in that history, then you can skip this book. The “take away” is that a thorough demonstration exists for how human nonselfishness is fully consistent with evolution by natural selection. You can have a noncynical view of human nature and not worry that you are an unwitting crypto-creationist.</p>
<p>Worth emphasizing is that it is simply not the place of evolutionary theory to tell us how we “really are.” Rather, the closest we will ever get to our “nature” is through the painstaking study of actual brain, mind, and behavior. The more we know about our present psychology, the better we can adjudicate among competing accounts of our species history. Far less so the other way around.</p>
<p>Bowles and Gintis present the better side of human nature as a set of “social preferences.” We enjoy working together. We are inclined to help others. We are angered by people who exploit our generosity. We feel guilt about our selfishness, and shame when selfish actions are brought to the attention of others.</p>
<p>People vary in the frequency and strength of these preferences. So do societies. But, argue Bowles and Gintis, they are widespread enough to understand personal contribution to common projects, including enforcing social norms against group-detrimental behaviors and encouraging cultivation of similar preferences in the next generation.</p>
<p>Very important here is that although Bowles and Gintis are offering an evolutionary account of social preferences, these are not strictly “genetic” in the way that sociologists often misunderstand the term. Social characteristics do not develop in a predetermined way impervious to experiences. Rather, what has co-evolved is a mutually sustaining genetic propensity toward these traits and a cultural propensity toward producing environments in which the individual development of these traits is cultivated and reinforced.</p>
<p>Put another way, people may be said to be “naturally” cooperative, but the arrangements of societies—as part of the same, historically sustaining process—make us more so. Bowles and Gintis place great importance on human socialization. After all, “a considerable fraction of the total available time of members of most societies is spent teaching the young the proper way to behave” (p. 184). The capacity to internalize norms is presented as a vital part of human developmental plasticity. Why children should be susceptible to moral instruction is sometimes regarded as problematic by evolutionary psychologists—it is another thing one can tangle oneself into imagining as evolutionarily impossible—but cultural transmission and norm internalization have obviously worked well for our species.</p>
<p>Co-evolution is consistent with arguments back in <italic>Schooling in Capitalist America</italic>. There, the educational system co-developed with capitalism to place a heavy emphasis on the cultivation of traits congenial to the workplace (e.g., acceptance of authority, tolerance of long periods of boredom). That was not an argument about <italic>gene</italic>-culture co-evolution, but then again capitalism has been a short-lived phenomenon compared to life on the savanna.</p>
<p>Even though it is fairly easy to imagine hypothetically how groups would benefit from shared social preferences among members, such preferences outside kin are rare in nature. So why human beings and not meerkats must be explained. Much of the book is directed toward offering arguments for how early humans stood to reap particularly large benefits from cooperation and how they were particularly well-suited to make it work.</p>
<p>Here one gets to fundamental questions about the ultimate contributions of mathematical modeling to historical reconstruction. Again, the point of all this is not a toy proof-of-concept demonstration. As Bowles and Gintis emphasize, “The question we are asking is about something that actually happened in the human past” (p. 17). They take great care in their modeling to try to inform them with parameters that reflect plausible values of conditions of our ancestral past.</p>
<p>Yet all models, of course, are simplifications. These simplifications invariably result in actors that have some very rudimentary cognitive or social capacities (sometimes along with vast informational or calculating powers in other respects). Maybe actors can only learn from their own experiences, for example, or perhaps they are unable to coordinate actions with others.</p>
<p>Various of Bowles and Gintis’ arguments for why human beings are particularly suited to evolving cooperative dispositions turn on the observation that humans are smart. Especially important are the capacities that enable reputations, norms, other forms of culture, and institutions. Bowles and Gintis demonstrate repeatedly that the evolution of cooperative behavior is made more workable when some capacity of humans is added to a model.</p>
<p>What is less clear is how many other routes may yield a similar end, and so it is hard to evaluate how much closer the exercise brings us to “what actually happened.” As they write with respect to one of their key concepts, “We do not know that a human predisposition to strong reciprocity evolved as we have described. But our model and simulations suggest that it could have” (p. 164). Perhaps this is the most we can hope for.</p>
<p>That said, <italic>A Cooperative Species</italic> poses a convincing argument for why human capacities make us a particularly propitious species for large-scale non-kin cooperation. The standard argument for the difficulty of evolving cooperative behavior is that selfish people outcompete altruists within groups, and the advantages that more altruistic groups have over more selfish groups is too diluted by scale and time to offset this. Bowles and Gintis provide a variety of mechanisms to solve this problem for humans.</p>
<p>Within groups, the standard argument is that selfish defectors alongside cooperators are the strategic equivalent of wolves in sheep’s clothing. But the sheep are not so disadvantaged if you grant them the ability to identify wolves, avoid interacting with them, and coordinate punishing actions against them. Again, the ability for humans to communicate and to develop norms and other institutions makes the evolution of cooperative dispositions more likely. Bowles and Gintis also emphasize the importance of leveling practices that reduce inequality within groups, so that whatever competitive advantages selfishness might yield within a group are less important, making between-group differences more consequential.</p>
<p>Standard arguments about why differences between groups are not important to evolution usually only consider the extent to which groups of cooperators might outreproduce more selfish groups. Real human groups do not stick to their own equations, but instead they compete for resources and territory, often violently. As it happens, allowing groups that work well together to kill off less effectively cooperating groups, or forcibly assimilate them to more prosocial norms and institutions, works wonders for the mathematical feasibility of group selection.</p>
<p>Granted, all this adds up to a view of human nature with many ironies. Over the long run, the zeal we have to punish people who take advantage of our generosity allows us to have a stronger predisposition to cooperate in the first place. Aversion to those demarcated as outsiders allows us to more effectively trust insiders. War rewards those who work well together. In the end though, these ironies add up to a complicated human nature replete with internal tensions that accords well with introspection (at least for this reader). What we perceive as the brighter and darker aspects of human motivation and emotion are brought together in the service of balancing individual benefits with the potential large returns of being able to cooperate in grander pursuits.</p>
<p>More broadly, Bowles and Gintis’ arguments make plain that people who want a different world need to leverage our evolved psychological architecture, but they are not doomed by it. We simply cannot know what can be achieved under alternative cultural and institutional arrangements. People sometimes imagine that the way genes and culture operate together is that genes set the constraints on human possibility and then culture determines what happens within those constraints. People also used to think that our physiology obviously precluded us from ever traveling via flight or communicating instantly over long distances. If real constraints exist, it is unclear whether they can ever be distinguished <italic>a priori</italic> from failures of imagination.</p>
<p>Of course, novel social changes may not be in the direction of the greater good. Another implication of <italic>A Cooperative Species</italic> is that if we like a world with social preferences, we need to work to sustain a culture and institutions that encourage and enforce them. Believing in a positive view of human nature does not get us off the hook from pursuing our own moral development, working to cultivate humanity in the next generation, and demanding good behavior from others.</p>
