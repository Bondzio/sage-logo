<p><italic>Capitalism from Below</italic> is a stunning book. Much of what we have learned about business in China, especially from business-school cases, is based on the experience of state-owned and state-controlled enterprises, among which are the oldest and largest businesses in China. The private sector has been less accessible partly because non-state firms are smaller and more evanescent than state enterprises, and partly because entrepreneurs have had to operate at the margins of society, often out of sight and rarely willing to disclose the full extent of their assets or anything else significant about their businesses. To be sure, the Chinese constitution has protected domestic private property since 2007. Still, the super-wealthy whose names appear in the annual <italic>Hurun</italic> “rich list” remain far more likely to be investigated or arrested than entrepreneurs whose wealth <italic>Hurun</italic> has been unable to discover.</p>
<p>Given these obstacles, it is amazing that Victor Nee and Sonja Opper were able to survey a large sample of private enterprises in China’s booming Yangtze Delta region: 771 firms in 2006 and 700 firms in 2009 (of the original 771 firms, 140 refused to participate in the second round survey and were replaced with comparable firms). All were registered as private firms, were at least three years old at the time of the initial survey, and had at least ten employees. Both surveys were conducted by the Market Survey Research Institute, which in 2006 was the survey research arm of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences and has since been privatized and registered as the Shanghai Yihong Business Consulting Co., Ltd. The surveys were conducted in seven cities in three provinces: Shanghai (a provincial-level city), Jiangsu (Changzhou, Nanjing, and Nantong), and Zhejiang (Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Wenzhou). The surveys were lengthy and doubtless time-consuming. The questionnaires are reproduced in an 84-page appendix.</p>
<p>Much to its credit, <italic>Capitalism from Below</italic> asks <italic>the</italic> big question: how does one account for the emergence of a thriving private economy in a communist state that until 35 years ago vigorously suppressed capitalism? Nee and Opper’s answer is that private enterprise arose more due to a shift in social norms, what they call endogenous institutional change, rather than shifts in state policies and formal property rights. Norms supportive of private enterprise emerged from a virtuous cycle running from nascent market opportunities to entrepreneurial action to mutual monitoring and norm enforcement to the piling in of “swarms of followers,” who press for reform of formal institutions consistent with norms already in place. The process is at once spontaneous and self-reinforcing. Capitalism happens, and once it happens (at least in the Yangtze Delta) the opportunities are so compelling that it cannot be suppressed. The government, at best, plays catch-up, adjusting its own norms, strictures, and structures to fit the new reality, e.g., honoring CEOs and star athletes like basketball player Yao Ming as “model workers” and electing wealthy entrepreneurs to the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.</p>
<p>
<italic>Capitalism from Below</italic> raises other significant questions. One concerns the social construction of the firm itself. Nee and Opper argue that despite its attractions, bottom-up capitalism required legitimation. The legitimating mechanism, they argue, is isomorphism with state-owned, enterprises: “Ironically, it was China’s corporatization policy, designed to modernize state-owned companies, that provided private-sector entrepreneurs with an organizational form to gain the legitimacy they sought. Incorporating as a limited liability company . . . or as a joint stock company . . . provided private firms with a legal structure that made them virtually indistinguishable from incorporated public companies” (p. 114). Not surprisingly, Nee and Opper find that compliance with the requirements of the Chinese Company Law is sporadic, as often as not symbolic and ceremonial rather than substantial. Minimum capital requirements are circumvented. Many firms registered as limited liability or shareholding companies in fact have no annual general meeting (AGM) or board of directors; when annual meetings and boards do convene, as often as not they exercise little oversight over business decisions. Moreover, firms whose AGMs or boards of directors actually influence the business perform worse than firms whose AGMs and boards do not. Another significant question concerns norm enforcement, especially contract compliance and quality control. Litigation is rare, partly because many contracts are unwritten, partly because the Chinese conception of contract as a statement of initial rather than final conditions is far more flexible than the Western conception, and partly because the courts are seen as uninterested in small business disputes and as unreliable. Instead, contract disputes are settled through private means wherein preserving one’s reputation—and if there has been a large defalcation, one’s safety—is more important than financial advantage. Quality control is accomplished by industry self-policing, what Nee and Opper call third-party enforcement. The gossip network is very efficient, and firms with reputations for producing shoddy goods are shunned. Nee and Opper note that normative controls seem not to work as well in Shanghai as in the six smaller cities studied; a question is whether normative controls work as well in consumer as in industrial markets and in particular why it has proved so difficult to persuade consumers that Chinese dairy products are safe.</p>
<p>One of the most compelling chapters in <italic>Capitalism from Below</italic> explores the top-down role of the communist party. The key question concerns the impact of political capital on entrepreneurial success. Several forms of political capital are considered, including joining the communist party, having worked as a party cadre, having a relative who is currently a cadre, contributing to the party to “make up for political deficits,” networking with party members, and networking with government officials. The survey data suggest that political capital can advantage private firms with respect to bank loans, government contracts, access to land, and access to state assets that are subject to privatization. But the same data show no impact of political capital on profitability. Still, cultivating good relationships with the party and government remains critical, especially for the most successful firms: “. . . once you are big, then you must have good relationships with the government. . . . If the party wants you to die, you have no way to live” (p. 239). Unstated is what constitutes good relationships.</p>
<p>Any theoretical formulation like the capitalism-from-below argument will be overstated and leave unexplained instances and anomalies. The anomaly in this instance was the unforeseeable: the economic tsunami striking the Chinese private sector, especially manufacturing in Zhejiang Province, in 2010–2011. Prior to 2009, private enterprises in the Yangtze Delta depended somewhat on export orders. This was especially the case, according to Nee and Opper’s 2006 results, for Wenzhou, which is famous for its cigarette lighter and footwear factories, and Nantong, a center of shipbuilding with an otherwise diversified industrial base. The Wenzhou enterprises, in particular, depended on underground lending for working capital. The collapse of exports in 2008–09 coupled with soft domestic demand and central and local government stimulus packages set off a chain reaction: the Wenzhou entrepreneurs moved their investments from factories to speculative investments in real estate, minerals, and agriculture. By 2010, however, the central government took steps to staunch speculation in property and effectively choked off credit to the private sector. The former Wenzhou factory owners were left with large debts they were unable to pay, and many fled China, fearing retribution; the underground lending system, which had depended on trust and <italic>guanxi</italic> (connections) rather than collateral, in turn collapsed.</p>
<p>The carnage in manufacturing occurred throughout China, but it was especially pronounced in the Yangtze River Delta and in Zhejiang Province. The CEIC database, which relies on surveys conducted by the China National Bureau of Statistics, shows that the total number of manufacturing firms in Wenzhou, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Changzhou, Nanjing, and Nantong dropped from 48,838 in 2010 to 27,703 in 2011, a 43 percent decline. Wenzhou was hardest hit and lost 49 percent of its manufacturing firms, Ningbo lost 47 percent, Hangzhou 43 percent, Changzhou 43 percent, and Nanjing 36 percent. By a hair, Nantong fared best of the six Jiangsu and Zhejiang cities surveyed, losing 35 percent of its manufacturing firms; this is partly explained by the May 2008 opening of the Sutong Bridge over the Yangtze, connecting Nantong with Suzhou and integrating Nantong into the more robust southern Jiangsu economy. The rest of China, including Shanghai, lost 26 percent of manufacturing firms from 2010 to 2011. (The CEIC database does not separate state-owned, foreign-invested, and private enterprises at the level of individual municipalities; however, the great majority of manufacturing enterprises in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are privately owned.)</p>
<p>These data suggest some potential lessons. First, endogenous, spontaneous, and self-reinforcing capitalism depends on robust domestic and international markets as well as easy informal credit, in Zhejiang from underground banks flush with hot money. In other words, exogenous economic conditions cannot be excluded from the bottom-up argument. A second potential lesson is more subtle: bottom-up capitalism is resistant to top-down government intervention on its behalf. In particular, several programs aiming to resuscitate private manufacturing industry in Wenzhou have, so far, failed. <italic>China Daily</italic> (“Filling in the gap in Wenzhou’s finance market,” January 24, 2013, pp. 13–14) reports that “the much-touted financial reform . . . is stumbling.” Government facilities intended to kick-start the credit markets, including Wenzhou’s private lending registration service center, the Wenzhou SME Financing Service Center, a financial reform plaza, and two financial development zones, have had no takers and have “largely been shunned by lenders and borrowers alike.” Both are wary. The lenders prefer that the government not learn of their assets; the borrowers prefer that the government learn as little about their businesses as possible.</p>
<p>A third potential lesson has a somewhat sharper edge, Nee and Opper’s results on decoupling and profitability (firms without functioning AGMs and boards are more profitable) notwithstanding: constructing organizational structures for purposes of legitimation and then decoupling the representation from the reality of these structures can have negative real-world consequences for firms. Chinese firms listed on the U.S. and Canadian exchanges today are plagued by allegations of accounting fraud initiated by vulture short sellers. Many of the firms alleged to have committed fraud have delisted or “gone dark” by no longer filing SEC reports, wiping out investors. In the case of Xian-based China Integrated Energy, which remains on the NASDAQ pink sheets, a short seller using the pseudonym Sinclair Upton compared CIE’s SEC filings with financial statements filed with local administrations of industry and commerce (AICs) in China. Based on this research, Sinclair Upton claimed overstatement of revenues and profits in the SEC filings and misstatements of CIE’s actual ownership in both. The facts are unclear and shareholder lawsuits remain pending. The point I wish to emphasize is this: research results suggesting misrepresentation (“decoupling”) to be advantageous in the short term should be coupled with warnings that Western investors and the SEC are highly sensitive to possible fraud and intolerant of the discrepancies institutional theories sometimes celebrate.</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>Capitalism from Below</italic> is a terrific and important book. Given the speed and often unpredictable course of change in China, however, it should be read as an interim report rather than as the last word on the condition of Chinese private enterprise. And it should be read by people interested in business in China rather than solely by sociologists. It would be best if Nee and Opper could re-interview the firms and entrepreneurs surveyed in 2006 and 2009, if they can find them. While a third wave of data might not alter the core of the bottom-up argument, it would almost certainly yield valuable insights about survival strategies in what has been a difficult period for private Chinese enterprises.</p>
