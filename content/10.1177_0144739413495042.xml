<p>The question of whether the field of public administration education is prepared for the future of the public sector in Europe is a complex one, which needs to be unpacked to give a grounded answer. Unpacking this question means that we need to discuss not just what educating the field of public administration means, but also that we need to have some idea of what the future of public administration will look like, with a range of uncertainties, and then how these two topics interact. To cover this, at least three issues need to be discussed: what is the mental frame we take? How do we determine the content of our teaching and training? How do we institutionalize this, to make sure our changes and improvements are accumulating and irreversible?</p>
<sec id="section1-0144739413495042">
<title>Developing mental frameworks</title>
<p>The mental framework is an essential starting point. It is important to state what we do not want. We do not want the public administration (PA) teaching and training that we offer now for the current public administration to be offered for the future. If we were to take that position, it would mean that we are convinced that the current PA teaching and training is sufficiently generic or one-size-fits-all, including for changing circumstances; or we assume that the future public sector will look approximately the same as the current one. There are many arguments to think that both positions are suboptimal in their problem-solving capacity. This is too much single loop Education and Training (ET).</p>
<p>A second mental framework we do not want is that the public sector is shaping our teaching and training. This position could be a bit more disputable. Do we accept contingency-driven teaching and training? Circumstances, especially changing circumstances, are shaping and determining our teaching and training. Of course, our ET should be responding to changing circumstances and take these changes into account. This happens in many programmes and is needed as a mental frame. It is necessary; however, it is not sufficient. This position is too passive, too reactive, and puts ET too much in an instrumental position that potentially becomes a weak part in the chain of PA, since there are time lags in adjusting programmes to realities, and it focuses too much on reproduction, even of new situations. This mental framework is too weak to consider ET as a driver for innovation. It is too much adjusted single loop, perhaps some double loop learning. Also it is in many cases too little, and too late, when major reforms are needed and new leadership is necessary.</p>
<p>Therefore we need to re-invent, anticipate, and innovate our teaching and training according to a mental framework where PA teaching and education is proactively shaping our future public sector. This assumes a conviction that ET has a voluntaristic capacity to change realities. It also assumes that innovative ideas are determining future practices, and that they become sustainable by importing these in organizational practices. This results in renewing organizational memories. This mental framework is not just voluntaristic, and idealistic (even perhaps Hegelian), it is also producing, not just reproducing, new realities. Teaching and training in PA, at universities, and even more at national schools, becomes smart double loop and meta-learning. It becomes smart double since it is about adjusting to future and expected standards, not just about brand new standards. It also becomes meta-learning (or deuteron-learning) since it includes, accepts, actively encourages key concepts such as risk, ambiguity, openness, change, flexibility, and so on. This is not just about anticipating scenarios and different options. This is about a changed public sector that is able to handle unexpected situations. The key concepts in the mental framework are systemic features and questions such as responsibility and accountability, performance, state of law and due process, equity, transparency, checks and balances, ownership and partnerships, and so on.</p>
<p>The related question then becomes how to develop such a mental framework. There are probably three drivers to feed such a mental framework that need to be made explicit. Teaching and training for the future needs to be research driven, it needs to be future-problem driven, and it needs to be future-context driven. This implies that a generic answer is not sufficient, even if generic elements and components should be considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0144739413495042">
<title>Developing content strategies</title>
<p>A second debate is about the content, obviously derived from the mental frames developed. It is important to consider some key strategic principles to generate and test contents. There are certainly four principles to be considered.</p>
<p>First, the shift from public sector to public service has significant implications for organizing service delivery and developing policy cycles in the public space. It includes blurred borderlines, chains of delivery, partnerships, shared services, cloud sourcing, cooperation, data sharing and so on.</p>
<p>Second, the shift from monopoly (of the public sector) to oligopoly requires fewer hierarchy-based mechanisms, and more market-type mechanisms, and network-type mechanisms. It also requires a reflection on a fair and functional mixture of related tools and techniques to coordinate. This results also in generating information for comparisons of models and performance, across country and language borders. Exchange of students and staff involved in education and training is a requirement to determine content.</p>
<p>Third, the public space should not only be prepared for different (renewed) types of routine delivery of services, but also for new, innovative deliveries, and for crises. These three types of needs – routine, innovation, and crises – require different capacities, skills, resources and structures. A performing and sustainable public space needs to be made ready for these three different situations: how to deliver reliable routine services, how to innovate new ways of delivering and functioning, how to cope or solve a crisis.</p>
<p>Fourth, increasingly there is a need to recognize that public administration teaching and training is not just about its disciplinary parts (law, political science, management, et cetera), but is also about bringing these disciplines together at the level of problem solving through service delivery and policies. Instead of teaching and training for experts that are disciplinarily disconnected and become the centre, there will be a need to teach and train with a focus on routine delivery, innovation, and crisis as a centre, but from a disciplinary caleidoscopic point of view. Designing a PA teaching and training programme with a routine delivery, an innovation, and a crisis as a point of departure requires then to involve law, economics, management, political science and so on. not vice versa.</p>
<p>These four strategic principles could serve as a baseline for the next generation of PA teaching and training principles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0144739413495042">
<title>Developing institution building</title>
<p>All this does not happen automatically and spontaneously. There is a need to organize this by building and renewing institutions. In reality, PA is part of defined faculties or schools, which increasingly are subject to accreditation. It is crucial that the structural embeddedness and the related accreditation and quality control systems are owned by the PA community, nationally and internationally. For this reason, at least four measures should be taken.</p>
<p>First, national and international public administration communities should include teaching and training in their agenda of critical reflections through study groups or panels. This should result in a grounded debate driven by research, problems, and context. It is important that national and international PA communities share this information and the lessons learned.</p>
<p>Second, we need to connect different regions to make similarities and differences more explicit. This includes not just a leveling-up in certain cases, but also a possibility to recognize identity and diversity of PA teaching and training. It also helps to organize quality control systems.</p>
<p>Third, there is a need to define the governance system and principles of accreditation. Market-driven accreditation is very different from network- and peer review–driven accreditation. In any case there is a need to organize learning cycles and improvement strategies. There is also a need to have transparency, definitions of responsibility and accountability, and sufficient checks and balances in the whole accreditation system of our teaching and training.</p>
<p>Fourth, it is essential to organize the memory of our teaching and training organisations. This requires also a solid organization in itself, which guarantees an efficient and effective production of teaching and training, a receptive demand, and a sustainable and functional match of this qualitative supply and qualitative demand of PA teaching and training.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Teaching and training is like respiration. We need to make sure it gives oxygen to the brains of the public space. This requires a good public environment, which we need to create ourselves.</p>

<title>Postscript from the editors</title>
<p>We welcome the debate and discussion which Geert Bouckaert’s paper will stimulate. We hope that readers of the journal will respond to his invitation to think critically and be open to different ways of thinking about the discipline and how it responds to the new context we find ourselves in. We think that such a debate opens up contributions that include not just the way we organize and structure programmes but the role of accreditation, our approaches to teaching and learning, and the ways in which we learn from and with practitioners, policy makers and elected politicians. More crucially too, we think it invites a much more systematic debate about the relationship(s) between the discipline, practitioners and the nature of the political institutions we work with and within. There is, we think, a profound debate to be had given the current political and economic context we find ourselves in. This Journal is committed to engaging in such a debate and we welcome articles and contributions to it.</p>
