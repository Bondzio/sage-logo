<title>Objective</title>
<p>To describe head and neck manifestations of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in a cohort of HIV-infected patients receiving combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). After initiation of cART, some HIV-infected patients present a paradoxical worsening and clinical deterioration due to pathological inflammatory reactions to infectious or noninfectious antigens, a condition known as IRIS.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) for the treatment of HIV infection in the mid-1990s, a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality has been observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812437321">1</xref></sup> However, 10% to 25% of patients experience clinical deterioration due to restoration of their capacity to mount an immune response against previously unidentified or subclinical infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812437321">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812437321"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812437321">4</xref></sup> This phenomenon, termed <italic>immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome</italic> (IRIS), occurs mostly within 3 months after initiation of cART<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812437321">5</xref></sup> and results in clinical deterioration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812437321">6</xref></sup> IRIS is usually a consequence of exaggerated activation of the immune system against antigens or pathogens manifested as an inflammatory unmasking of a previously untreated subclinical infection or as a paradoxical clinical deterioration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812437321">7</xref></sup> Pathogens commonly associated with IRIS include <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mycobacterium avium-complex</italic> (MAC), and cytomegalovirus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812437321">8</xref></sup> In addition, an increased occurrence of Herpes zoster–associated IRIS has been consistently reported in several studies, and later onset of herpes zoster–associated IRIS has also been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812437321">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The main independent predictor of IRIS is a low CD4 T-cell count before initiation of cART, with a higher risk in patients with CD4 T-cell counts below 50 cells/µL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812437321">10</xref></sup> Most IRIS cases involve paradoxical worsening or unmasking infections. However, IRIS manifestations are also observed in malignancies, such as Kaposi sarcoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Both AIDS-defining neoplasms are associated with herpes virus infections (human herpesvirus 8 for Kaposi sarcoma and Epstein-Barr virus for NHL), a factor that might explain their occurrence or worsening in an IRIS context. Kaposi sarcoma is the most common AIDS-defining malignancy; sudden progression and new Kaposi sarcoma lesions have been considered as IRIS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812437321">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Case reports of head and neck IRIS have been published in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812437321">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812437321">13</xref></sup> However, here we followed 165 HIV-infected patients who had started cART within the past 2 months before entering the study. We focused on the group of 21 patients who coursed with head and neck manifestations of IRIS.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>The study was conducted at the Infectious Diseases Research Center of the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases, a tertiary referral center in Mexico for HIV-infected patients. During the period between May 2008 and October 2010, 708 HIV-infected patients underwent a complete ear, nose, and throat examination. The study inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, no previous treatment with cART, and no evidence of inflammatory process. A total of 186 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria and were thus included in the study. Twenty-one patients were excluded because of insufficient follow-up, lack of treatment adherence, or failure of cART to decrease plasma HIV-RNA titer &lt;2 log10 in 6 months. A prospective cohort of consecutive adult patients was integrated by 165 HIV-infected patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy within the past 2 months before first examination. The cohort was followed for a minimum of 6 months. Treatment initiation was in accordance with the guidelines for use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812437321">14</xref></sup> which recommends cART initiation with a CD4+ T-cell count &lt;350 cells/µL or the presence of AIDS-defining illness irrespective of the CD4 T-cell count.</p>
<p>A certified otolaryngologist performed a complete ear, nose, and throat examination involving direct examination of the oral cavity, flexible laryngoscopy (4-mm flexible laryngoscope; Olympus, Center Valley, Pennsylvania), nasal rigid endoscopy (2.6-mm rigid 0° endoscope; Karl Storz, Tuttingen, Germany), otoscopy under microscope vision (Opnipico; Karl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and clinical examination of the neck. Laboratory studies included CD4 T-cell count and HIV viral load determination before treatment and at least 1 subsequent determination. CD4 T-cell count was assessed with a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey), and plasma HIV-RNA titer was measured with the Roche Ultrasensitive Amplicor (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) assay version.</p>
<p>An IRIS event was defined as first presentation or paradoxical worsening of a preexisting infection following initiation of cART, in the presence of a viral success (decrease in plasma HIV-RNA titer &gt;2 log10 or &lt;50 copies/mL),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812437321">15</xref></sup> increasing CD4 T-cell count, and features consistent with the inflammatory process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812437321">16</xref></sup> Medical records were reviewed to identify other causes of IRIS (eg, dermatological, neurological, ophthalmological, pneumological, or infectious). The study and informed consent letter were approved by the Research and Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City, Mexico.</p>
<sec id="section8-0194599812437321">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Demographic characteristics were analyzed using the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software. A 2-sided <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered to be significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 708 HIV-infected patients underwent a complete ear, nose, and throat examination between May 2008 and October 2010 at our institution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812437321"><bold>Figure 1</bold>)</xref>. One hundred eighty-six patients fulfilled inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Twenty-one patients (11.2%) were excluded due to a follow-up duration of &lt;6 months, lack of response to standard antiretroviral treatment, or lack of adherence to treatment or death; 1 patient was referred to another hospital for an aggressive maxillary tumor. Response to cART was confirmed in all 165 patients who completed the follow-up period of at least 6 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812437321"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Most patients came from urban settings in Mexico City and the metropolitan area. As our institution is a tertiary reference center, medical care before HIV diagnosis in unknown.</p>

<p>The median age of patients was 33 years (interquartile range [IQR], 28.5-40); 85.8% were men. The median CD4 T-cell count before cART initiation was 73.73 cells/µL (IQR, 34-151.62), with 8% CD4 T cells (IQR, 5%-12.73%). The median CD8 cell count was 559.48 cells/µL (IQR, 324-905), with 60.84% CD8 T cells (IQR, 52%-69.99%); the median initial viral load was 197,110 copies/mL (IQR,101,000-422,000).</p>
<p>A total of 32 patients (19.3%) had IRIS; all IRIS events were accompanied by an increase in CD4 T-cell counts and a decrease in HIV viral loads. Although patients who presented with IRIS after cART initiation had lower baseline CD4 T-cell counts than those who did not develop the disease (64.63 vs 77.95), no statistical difference was found (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). No differences were found in the percentages of CD4 T cells, percentages and counts of CD8 T cells, or HIV viral loads. Eleven patients had IRIS without ear, nose, throat, or neck manifestations. Herpes infection was present in 5 cases, disseminated or lung tuberculosis affected 3 patients, 2 had cytomegalovirus retinitis, and 1 patient presented with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.</p>
<p>IRIS in the head and neck region was observed in 21 patients (12.7%); 3 were woman. The median onset time of head and neck IRIS was 1.5 months (IQR, 1-4); 13 patients (61.9%) presented IRIS within the first 2 months. The leading head and neck IRIS manifestation was Kaposi sarcoma of the airway (observed in 6 patients) and of cervical lymph nodes (observed in 1 patient). Four patients presented Kaposi sarcoma of the hard palate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812437321"><bold>Figure 2a</bold></xref>), and 4 male patients presented Kaposi sarcoma of the auditory canal, tongue, hypopharynx, oropharynx, supraglottis, and nasal dorsum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812437321"><bold>Figure 2b</bold></xref>). All were diagnosed through biopsies, and only 1 patient required chemotherapy because of disseminated disease. None of the patients presented airway obstruction or bleeding. Tuberculosis-associated IRIS in the head and neck region was observed in 6 patients, confirmed by culture in all 6 patients, and polymerase chain reaction for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> was positive in 3 patients. All cultures were sensitive to first-line antituberculosis drugs rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol. Patients received daily antituberculosis drugs plus pyrazinamide. Three cases were classified as unmasking because all were receiving cART when they developed tuberculosis. The remaining 3 had lung and/or lymph node tuberculosis diagnosed at the time of cART initiation. All of them presented clinical worsening with fever and lymph node enlargement, so they were classified as paradoxical reaction. All patients had neck abscesses and scrophulas, and 1 patient presented a retropharyngeal abscess that required surgical drainage. <italic>Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare</italic> infection was observed in 4 patients with neck abscesses and scrophulas; 1 subject presented with a paratracheal left abscess that caused vocal cord palsy secondary to recurrent laryngeal nerve compression, but no surgical procedure was required and the vocal fold paralysis fully recovered after medical treatment with clarithromycin and ethambutol. All cases were diagnosed by culture through neck puncture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812437321"><bold>Figure 2c</bold></xref>). Two patients presented peripheral facial palsy that improved after treatment with combined oral valacyclovir and prednisone. One female patient presented submandibular node enlargement and pigmented macular lesions in arms and legs 2 months after initiating cART. Lymph node histoplasmosis was diagnosed by culture and histopathological analysis of biopsy specimens. Absence of lung involvement was confirmed with computed tomography scan. Type 1 herpes simplex infection was diagnosed in another patient who was treated with antiviral medication. One patient in the head and neck IRIS group who had been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and Kaposi sarcoma of the hard palate died because of recurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis a few months after successful treatment completion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our cohort of 165 Mexican HIV-infected patients, 32 (19.3%) patients experienced IRIS during the first 6 months following cART initiation; this finding is consistent with the incidence of IRIS reported in other cohort studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812437321">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812437321">17</xref></sup> Of the 32 patients with IRIS, 21 patients coursed with head and neck manifestations of IRIS, which is a particularly high incidence (12.7%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the incidence of head and neck manifestations of IRIS in HIV-infected patients, as only case reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812437321">12</xref></sup> and case series<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812437321">13</xref></sup> have been published. In agreement with previous studies, we found that one of the leading causes of IRIS was tuberculosis, which was found here in 3 patients with IRIS (lung or disseminated forms) and in 6 patients with head and neck manifestations of IRIS.</p>
<p>The estimated tuberculosis rate for Mexico ranges from 25 to 49 new cases/100,000 population, and only 15% to 49% of reported cases have been detected in HIV patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812437321">18</xref></sup>Therefore, a low rate of unmasking tuberculosis IRIS would be expected in our patients. However, the fact that the study was performed in a tertiary respiratory center may constitute an important bias. In fact, tuberculosis is the second microorganism isolated in HIV-hospitalized patients at our institution (35%), just below <italic>Pneumocistis jirovecii</italic> (47%; unpublished data). Tuberculosis incidence in outpatients is expected to be lower, but it remains to be defined.</p>
<p>A distinctive characteristic of our patients was the high incidence of Kaposi sarcoma, accounting for the first cause of head and neck IRIS. Although other authors have described a high proportion of events due to other herpes infections,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812437321">4</xref></sup> this is the first cohort of patients with Kaposis sarcoma as the leading cause of IRIS. The high percentage of men found in our cohort is consistent with previous studies reporting Kaposi sarcoma predominantly in men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812437321">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>IRIS usually occurs within the first 60 days after cART initiation; 61% of our patients developed head and neck IRIS manifestations within this period of time. Therefore, we consider that an ENT screening within this period would be advisable for an adequate diagnosis and clinical management of head and neck manifestations of the syndrome. A characteristic time pattern of different IRIS etiologies has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812437321">9</xref></sup>; however, no characteristic time pattern was found here. In addition, most patients recovered without significant intervention, probably because of their stable clinical condition during cART initiation on an ambulatory outpatient basis. Nevertheless, potential airway compromise secondary to obstruction or bleeding required prompt and accurate diagnosis.</p>
<p>Low CD4 T-cell counts and elevated HIV-RNA levels at baseline have been associated with IRIS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812437321">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812437321">20</xref></sup> An advanced disease stage also characterized our cohort of patients. However, when the IRIS group was compared with the non-IRIS group, no significant differences on the initial counts or percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells, nor a higher increase on the CD4 T-cell counts, were found. No differences in mortality were found; this was probably due to the predominance of stable ambulatory outpatients in this cohort.</p>
<p>A potential limitation of this study is that the lack of a scheduled follow-up might lead to underdiagnosis of other causes of IRIS, even though most patients attending our center are routinely examined by an ophthalmologist, dermatologist, neurologist, pneumologist, and an infectious disease specialist at least twice in a year.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Head and neck manifestations of IRIS were not rare in our cohort of patients; Kaposi sarcoma and tuberculosis infection were the most common presentations. Because of the wide variety of clinical presentations and high frequency and severity of this condition, an ear, nose, and throat examination is advisable in patients initiating cART.</p>
