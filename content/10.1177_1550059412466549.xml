<abstract>
<p>Subclinical rhythmic electroencephalogram discharge of adults (SREDA) is an electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern of uncertain significance, which occurs without any correlation with epilepsy. It resembles epileptiform activity, and is therefore likely to be misinterpreted as an authentic epileptiform pattern. We describe the occurrence of SREDA during stage II nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and discuss the diagnostic difficulties that may arise when such a pattern is encountered during sleep EEG recordings. SREDA may occur during sleep, leading to difficulties in correct identification of this pattern, as the patient is unconscious and unable to report any symptoms. Although there are rather distinctive EEG features, the lack of changes in electrocardiogram rhythm and the absence of ocular/muscular artifacts suggest a nonepileptic phenomenon. The ultimate diagnosis, and the correct identification of SREDA, may be achieved by a comparison of EEG features between the pattern occurring during sleep and that recorded in the awake state.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>SREDA is an EEG pattern of uncertain significance, which occurs without any correlation with epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412466549">1</xref>-5</sup> However, it resembles epileptiform activity, and is therefore likely to be misinterpreted as an authentic epileptiform pattern. As a consequence, it is important to properly recognize SREDA to avoid misdiagnosis of epilepsy due to errors in EEG interpretation.</p>
<p>We describe the occurrence of SREDA during stage II NREM sleep and discuss the diagnostic difficulties that may arise when such a pattern is encountered during sleep EEG recordings.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 43-year-old woman, previously diagnosed with excessive daytime sleepiness related to forced sleep deprivation, underwent EEG sleep recording. We previously described this patient because of the exceptional coexistence of rhythmic temporal theta bursts of drowsiness (RTTD) and SREDA in awake EEG recordings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412466549">6</xref>
</sup> Although the patient did not have any episodes suggestive of epileptic seizures, these EEG patterns were misdiagnosed as true epileptiform activities, leading to antiepileptic treatment with levetiracetam that worsened her sleepiness. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable, and neurological examination was normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also completely normal. Since the patient<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059412466549">7</xref>
</sup> never had suggestive epileptic seizures, and because several EEG recordings did not show authentic epileptiform abnormalities, the diagnosis of epilepsy was questioned, and antiepileptic treatment was discontinued, with consequent normalization of the sleep–wake cycle. No further causes of excessive daytime sleepiness (apart from forced sleep deprivation worsened by antiepileptic treatment) or sleep disorders (such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [OSAS]) were found.</p>
<p>The long-term video of EEG sleep recording (performed as research to evaluate the occurrence of SREDA during sleep stages) showed RTTD during drowsiness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1550059412466549">Figure 1</xref>). No pattern compatible with SREDA was recorded during awake or stage I NREM sleep. During stage II NREM sleep, a pattern consisting of an abrupt onset of widespread, sharply contoured δ (2-3 Hz) waveforms, prevalent in amplitude over frontocentral regions, which rapidly evolved into a sustained semirhythmic sinusoidal θ pattern (5-6 Hz), was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059412466549">Figure 2</xref> A, B). Amplitude was maximal from the onset and remained constant. The average duration of the pattern was around 20 seconds. No slowing or changes in the EEG background activity occurred after the discharge. Interestingly, after this the pattern was admixed with spindles and positive occipital sharp transients of sleep (POSTS) and was associated neither with changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) nor with ocular or muscular artifacts. This pattern was identified as SREDA, as it shared the same EEG features of SREDA previously recorded in the same patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1550059412466549">Figure 3</xref>) in the awake state, and fulfilled the classic diagnostic criteria for this pattern.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412466549">1</xref>-5</sup> Video recording did not reveal any overt or subtle clinical signs (such as limb movements, gestural automatisms, jerks, or changes in respiratory pattern) correlated with the EEG pattern, thus supporting the correct identification of SREDA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SREDA is an uncommon distinctive rhythmic pattern that can resemble epileptic discharges. It consists of sharp-contoured or sinusoidal waveforms in the θ frequency range (usually 5-7Hz), occurring in a widespread distribution, often maximal over the parietotemporal regions. SREDA is usually bilateral, often occurs during hyperventilation and drowsiness (the occurrence in stage II NREM sleep is exceptional) , with an onset and end that may or may not be abrupt, and does not usually evolve into a different morphology or other frequencies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412466549">1</xref>

</sup> Compared to true ictal activities, SREDA has little change in frequency, morphology, and distribution of the pattern.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412466549">3</xref>
</sup> The average duration of the pattern is usually 40 to 80 seconds, but it may be less than 10 seconds or even more than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>This pattern is considered to be of uncertain significance. Naquet et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1550059412466549">
8</xref>
</sup> suggested that cerebrovascular disease, ischemia, or transient hypoxia might have a role in the genesis of SREDA. In previous reports, SREDA was described in patients with transient global amnesia,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412466549">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412466549">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059412466549">10</xref>
</sup> although its occurrence in this disorder has been considered to be incidental.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059412466549">10</xref>
</sup> Fortunately, SREDA mostly occurs during the awake state, so the patient’s mental state may be tested. However, in the literature, there are only a few reports of SREDA occurring in sleep, both in the NREM<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412466549">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412466549">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059412466549">12</xref>
</sup> and REM stage,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1550059412466549">13</xref>
</sup> hence in a condition where the patient is unable to report any symptoms. The rarity of the previous reports of SREDA in sleep should be emphasized. For instance, it is noteworthy that in the large cohort of 108 patients with SREDA described by Westmoreland and Klass, only 1 patient presented SREDA, predominately in sleep.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059412466549">12</xref>
</sup> Consequently, the absence of the pattern during sleep has been considered one of the diagnostic hallmarks of typical SREDA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412466549">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412466549">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In our patient, SREDA showed amplitude prevalence over frontocentral regions suggesting that, at least in some cases, this pattern may present atypical features. Although original reports suggested that SREDA occurs predominantly over the parietooccipital region,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412466549">11</xref>
</sup> subsequent studies expanded the spectrum to include a frontal distribution or the occurrence in sleep.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059412466549">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that in this case SREDA was recorded both with and without antiepileptic therapy. A suppression of SREDA after benzodiazepine (lorazepam) administration has been recently reported,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1550059412466549">14</xref>
</sup> suggesting that this pattern may share some pathophysiological features with ictal discharges. However, the benzodiazepine effect is not specific, as these drugs may also suppress triphasic waves due to metabolic encephalopathy,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1550059412466549">15</xref>
</sup> therefore, SREDA cannot be distinguished from true ictal discharges based on inhibition by benzodiazepines. Our single case suggests that this pattern may not change under antiepileptic treatment with levetiracetam.</p>
<p>Further studies conducted with homogenous populations are, however, required to evaluate the responsiveness of SREDA to external factors (treatments, external stimuli, etc) or to better identify the EEG features of this intriguing phenomenon (focusing especially on its atypical presentations), thus shedding light on its pathophysiology. Furthermore, classifying typical and atypical SREDA patterns together may hamper attempts to uncover the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this activity, and it may be valuable to consistently define SREDA as either typical or atypical.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1550059412466549">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Unlike other EEG patterns of uncertain significance (such as RTTD), SREDA may (although rarely) evolve into a different morphology or other frequencies,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412466549">3</xref>
</sup> and it might be misinterpreted as a true epileptiform pattern, even leading to a misdiagnosis of epilepsy and to ineffective, expensive, and possibly harmful treatment.</p>
<p>The reported case is actually interesting not only for its EEG features, but also for its methodological implications concerning the interpretation of the EEG, and illustrates the serious problem of overinterpretation of normal EEG patterns resulting in misdiagnoses of seizures. Prior to our investigation, misinterpretation of an otherwise normal EEG variant, despite the fact that the patient never had a seizure, led to a diagnosis of probable epilepsy. Diagnosing epilepsy without a consistent clinical history was a mistake; however, the lack of recognition of a pseudoepileptiform benign EEG pattern was also a serious mistake that led to ineffective, expensive, and possibly harmful treatment.</p>
<p>As a consequence, it is important to properly recognize SREDA and other unusual patterns to avoid misdiagnosis of epilepsy due to errors in EEG interpretation. In this context, misdiagnosis of epilepsy may occur especially when the electroencephalographer reads the EEG with the knowledge of the patient’s history, therefore being influenced and even biased by this information (so-called history bias), thus trying “too hard” to find EEG abnormalities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1550059412466549">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1550059412466549"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1550059412466549">19</xref>
</sup> The EEG should therefore be read by an expert electroencephalographer, who is fully aware of the existence and EEG features of benign pseudoepileptiform patterns. This case is interesting since it shows that SREDA may occur exclusively during stage II NREM sleep, leading to difficulties in correct identification of this pattern.</p>
<p>In fact, cues to a correct diagnosis of SREDA are its EEG features and the lack of clinical correlate<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412466549">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412466549"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412466549"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412466549"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059412466549">5</xref>
</sup> (testing of the patient during the occurrence of this pattern is therefore of utmost importance for a correct diagnosis).</p>
<p>When, as in the reported case, SREDA occurs in sleep, a correct identification of this pattern may be difficult as the patient is unconscious, hence not testable and unable to report any symptoms. However, SREDA has a tendency to occur several times during a single EEG recording and is frequently present also on subsequent recording<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059412466549">12</xref>
</sup>; therefore, it is advisable to record this pattern in drowsiness or awake state, as performed in our patient. When occurring in sleep, SREDA may be admixed with physiological sleep figures such as spindles and POSTS, consequently being more irregular than when occurring during drowsiness or in awake state. Although the rather distinctive EEG features, the lack of overt or subtle clinical signs, the absence of changes in heart rhythm, or the lack of ocular/muscular artifacts, suggest a nonepileptic phenomenon. The ultimate diagnosis and the correct identification of SREDA may be achieved by a comparison of EEG features between the pattern occurring during sleep and the same pattern recorded in awake state.</p>
