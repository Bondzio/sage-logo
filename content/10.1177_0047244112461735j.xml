<p>Peter Schmucker’s new book on W. G. Sebald involves three main theses (cf. p. 12). (1) The highly pessimistic view of the world as a place of disaster (p. 227) and unmitigated suffering (p. 10) that is allegedly inscribed in and unifies all Sebald’s prose fiction (cf. p. 8) is a ‘Gnostizismus der Moderne’ (‘a latter-day Gnosticism’) (pp. 521 and 551; cf. p. 510). As such, Sebald’s work has affinities with the thought of the mystical Catholic theologian Franz Xaver von Baader (1765−1841) (pp. 505−54). (2) Sebald’s poetics derive from his Gnosticism (pp. 355−503). (3) Sebald’s Gnosticism also informs his extensive, and often encrypted use of intertextual references and allusions (<italic>passim</italic>).</p>
<p>Critics often make the first point, but it does not do justice to the contradictions that pervade Sebald’s attitude to History. But although Schmucker knows Denham and McCulloh’s volume of essays on Sebald (<italic>W. G. Sebald : History, Memory, Trauma</italic>, 2006) (p. 569), he has not absorbed Peter Fritzsche’s succinct piece on ‘W. G. Sebald’s Twentieth-Century Histories’ that appeared there (pp. 291−9). Here, Fritzsche not only identifies ‘an enduring tension in Sebald’s work between nature and history, between the generic and the particular, between catastrophe and Holocaust, between the dispersed evidence of history and the specific disasters of the twentieth century’ (p. 292), he also senses a further tension between Sebald’s historical pessimism and his nostalgia for the years before World War II, especially the provincial 1930s (p. 298). This shortcoming may well be connected with Schmucker’s debt to Hans Blumenberg’s theoretical writings, especially his essay ‘Wirklichkeitsbegriff und Möglichkeit des Romans’ (1964) (p. 28), where Blumenberg insists that the sense of reality informing a work of fiction must be ‘grundsätzlich … widerspruchsfrei’ (‘free from contradictions … as a matter of principle’), ‘zukunftsorientiert’ (‘oriented towards the future’) and ‘von Gesetzen gelenkt’ (‘guided by laws’) (p. 8). It is, however, becoming increasingly clear that Sebald’s work is not governed by unified systems of laws, but is, rather, the product of a dialectic between competing and contradictory beliefs and belief systems. To give three examples only: (1) Sebald’s work oscillates between a Gnostic dualism according to which the material world is the evil principle (cf. p. 49) and a quasi-Christian panentheism according to which the material world is the locus of an eternal struggle between divine good and diabolic evil; (2) like Stifter’s <italic>magnum opus Der Nachsommer</italic> (1857) (cf. p. 18), Sebald’s work oscillates between an attraction to and a scepticism towards providential theology (cf. pp. 36−8); (3) in consequence, the moments of ‘levitation’ in Sebald’s texts, a topos which was first discussed extensively some years ago by Ben Hutchinson (‘Die Leichtigkeit der Schwermut: W. G. Sebald’s ‘Kunst der Levitation’, <italic>Jahrbuch der Schillergesellschaft</italic> 50 (2006): 457−77) and which gets 11 listings in Schmucker’s very useful ‘Begriffsregister’ (‘Index of Concepts’) (p. 586), can be interpreted in two contradictory ways. They can be seen either as moments when the protagonist/narrator is transported out of the fallen material world and into a transcendent realm, or as epiphanic moments when a liberating divine power breaks into the material world.</p>
<p>Schmucker’s insight into the link between Sebald and Baader is a new one and of considerable interest, not least because two books of Baader’s writings – <italic>Über Liebe, Ehe und Kunst: Aus den Schriften, Briefen und Tagebüchern</italic> (ed. Grassl, 1953) and <italic>Gesellschaftslehre</italic> (ed. Grassl, 1957) − have been freely available for a good six years in Sebald’s ‘Arbeitsbibliothek’, which is held in the Deutsches Literaturarchiv, Marbach/Neckar. Now although Schmucker knows of that ‘Arbeitsbibliothek’ via an essay by Marcel Atze (p. 246), he seems not to have used it for his research. So despite the fact that both publications appear in Schmucker’s extensive Bibliography (p. 558) and are cited at least 15 times in the text, all he can say with confidence is that Sebald probably (‘wahrscheinlich’) made use of them (p. 532, n. 130). As it is now an established fact that Sebald annotated many of his books with emphasis and enthusiasm, it would have been very interesting if Schmucker had been able to reinforce his argument by discovering some relevant annotations in Sebald’s copies of Grassl’s two anthologies. Such <italic>trouvailles</italic> might have thrown new light on the vexed question of Sebald’s presentation of sexuality (cf. pp. 107 and 126), a topic which gets 36 listings in the ‘Begriffsregister’ (p. 590) but about which there is a dearth of critical work.</p>
<p>On the second point, Schmucker offers a series of extremely valuable insights into various aspects of Sebald’s poetics: his strongly held belief that a historically and geographically conditioned consciousness of personal responsibility, especially vis-à-vis the ‘Opfern der Geschichte’ (‘sacrificial victims of History’), should be central to the work of serious post-war writers; the conviction, which can be traced back to Sebald’s undergraduate dissertation of 1966 (see <italic>JES</italic>, 41(3−4) (2011): 211−42), that ethics and aesthetics are, or should be, inseparable in serious literature; his tacit belief that a successful work of literature has a quasi-sacral status and as such bestows ‘Züge eines Heiligen’ (‘traits of sainthood’) (p. 355) on its creator. But most importantly, Schmucker convincingly decodes the ‘ohne Kontext schwer verständliche Begriff der “Restitution”’ (‘the concept of “Restitution”, which is hard to understand without a context’) (p. 429) and which Sebald, in his last public speech, given just four weeks before his death, put forward, somewhat gnomically, as the essential task of authentic art. From his earliest publications, Sebald was reluctant to define abstract concepts with any precision, possibly because he thought that such a procedure was too redolent of the ‘“offizielle” Germanistik’ (‘established study of German literature’) which he began to dislike at university and which, from <italic>c.</italic> 1984, i.e. the time when he was starting to see himself as a <italic>littérateur</italic>, he increasingly rejected. So Schmucker’s summary of the salient features of ‘Restitution’ (p. 447) is a significant breakthrough, especially when synthesized with what he has to say about the concept in the other 19 places he lists in the ‘Begriffsregister’ (p. 589).</p>
<p>The problems raised by Schmucker’s third point have already been touched upon, but it is worth saying a little more. First and foremost, Schmucker deserves unreserved praise for not, in contrast to so many of his critical predecessors, creating an artificial divide between Sebald’s critical and literary work and for making detailed and extensive interpretative use of texts by those writers, mainly Austrian (cf. p. 40), and with particular reference to Kafka, Stifter, Hofmannsthal, Herbeck, Bernhard, Handke and Nabokov, whom Sebald discussed in his critical essays. Nevertheless, familiarity with Sebald’s ‘Arbeitsbibliothek’ would have enabled Schmucker’s spirited explorations to go even further and with greater assurance. For instance, one of the most fascinating passages in his book (pp. 308−16) involves an analytical comparison of those entries in Samuel Pepys’s diary where Pepys describes the Great Fire of London from the point of view of its social effects and Sebald’s apocalyptic reworking of those passages at the end of <italic>Schwindel. Gefühle</italic> (p. 315). But Schmucker is puzzled by Sebald’s possible source, since the Everyman Edition which Sebald’s narrator reads in the train is dated 1913 and the only such edition that Schmucker can find is dated either 1906 or 1925 (p. 309, n. 362). So he would, I think, have been greatly encouraged by the discovery that Sebald’s ‘Arbeitsbibliothek’ contains a two-volume edition of the Everyman Edition dated 1917 (volume 1) and 1914 (volume 2). Then again, Schmucker views Kafka as the author whose literary work had the biggest impact on Sebald (see the 55 listings in the ‘Personenregister’, pp. 597−8), and at one point he enumerates, very helpfully, 11 features that are common to Kafka’s and Sebald’s work (p. 107). But Schmucker does not ask why Sebald worked with a relatively small number of Kafka’s texts – in his 60 or so interviews, for instance, Sebald mentioned only two of Kafka’s short stories and one of his novels. Nor does he ask why Sebald should have focused overwhelmingly on Kafka’s early writings and stories, or why he should have chosen to read the post-war <italic>Das Schloβ</italic> in such a consistently dark and one-dimensional way, given the multiplicity of readings that were already possible in the 1970s and of which Sebald was demonstrably aware of at least two. Familiarity with the 26 volumes by Kafka and the 20 books on Kafka that are in Sebald’s ‘Arbeitsbibliothek’, not to mention Sebald’s four reviews of books on Kafka that do not appear in Schmucker’s Bibliography (pp. 555−7), would have enabled him to take his analysis beyond affinities and parallelisms. Finally, when considering their importance for Sebald, Schmucker tacitly privileges Walter Benjamin (pp. 240−354) over Theodor Adorno (pp. 163−5) in a way that is arguably distorted. Thus, Benjamin appears in the ‘Personenregister’ 64 times, whereas Adorno appears there a mere 16 times (p. 595). Once again, familiarity with Sebald’s ‘Arbeitsbibliothek’ could have corrected this distortion, for Sebald owned 11 books by Benjamin and 10 by Adorno and the inscribed dates of their acquisition that tell the researcher that Sebald was reading the two philosophers equipollently during his university years. Moreover, Hutchinson’s study of Sebald, which is subtitled <italic>Die dialektische Imagination</italic> (2009), which is mentioned twice by Schmucker (pp. 507 and 545), and which makes creative use of the ‘Arbeitsbibliothek’, clearly indicates that Horkheimer and Adorno’s <italic>Die Dialektik der Aufklärung</italic> was at least as important for Sebald as Benjamin’s Theses on History.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding such methodological observations, Schmucker’s book is a very valuable contribution to the secondary literature on Sebald, for it is immensely learned, extremely well researched, and rich in insights that are based on astute and imaginative close reading. There is not the space to list all Schmucker’s original <italic>aperçus</italic>, but here is a brief selection of the many new things that I learnt from Schmucker’s book: the main reasons for Sebald’s positive reception of Stifter (p. 60); his use of line 30 of the 14th Canto of Dante’s <italic>La Divina Commedia</italic> for the title of the first section of <italic>Nach der Natur</italic>, and the allusions, in that section’s opening lines, to Lawrence Sterne’s <italic>Tristram Shandy</italic> and Goethe’s <italic>Dichtung und Wahrheit</italic>; the very obscure source of the quotation that prefaces his second essay (1992) on Ernst Herbeck (Heinrich Hoffmann’s <italic>Lustige Geschichten und drollige Bilder für Kinder von 3−6 Jahren</italic> (1845)) (p. 209); the references, in <italic>Austerlitz</italic>, to Balzac’s <italic>Les Chouans</italic> (1829) and <italic>Illusions perdues</italic> (1837−43) (pp. 481 and 484), and <italic>Reisenovellen</italic> (1834−7) by Heinrich von Laube (1806−84) (pp. 482−3). But some of the most fascinating surprises involved <italic>Schwindel. Gefühle</italic>, which, it turns out, is far more heavily saturated with allusions to fiction and mythology than I had realized. Schmucker notes the parallel between the narrator’s return to Klosterneuburg and <italic>The Odyssey</italic> (p. 119); the references to Kafka’s <italic>Der Verschollene</italic> (pp. 120 and 132); the symbolic meaning of the name Malachio (p. 125) (which Sebald, incidentally, first used when writing a review of Bernhard Wicki’s film <italic>Das Wunder des braven Malachias</italic> for his school magazine (1961)); the allusion to <italic>La Divina Commedia</italic> (p. 146); the fictional Romanas who also occur in works by Eichendorff (<italic>Ahnung und Gegenwart</italic> (1815)) and Jakob Wassermann (<italic>Die Romana</italic> (1935)); Sebald’s deployment of the poem ‘Le Compagnon de l’amour’ (1922) by the Decadent poet Maurice Magre (1877−1941) (pp. 224−5), and, perhaps most interestingly, the direct quotation of material from the ‘Wirtshausszene’ in Büchner’s <italic>Woyzeck</italic> (p. 275). Schmucker’s study will be a mine of information for anyone who is interested in Sebald’s amazing ability to remember intertextual material, even from a long way back, and to incorporate it almost seamlessly into his own work. The mine will be all the easier to work because of the book’s excellent, two-part index, a rarity nowadays in German academic publications.</p>
