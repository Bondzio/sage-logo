<abstract>
<p>This study examines the responses of British national newspaper editorials and op-eds to the BBC’s January 2009 decision not to air an appeal by the Disasters Emergency Committee to raise money for refugees in the Gaza region. We find six prominent themes in national newspaper discourse: (1) the BBC demonstrating blatant disregard for human life; (2) the BBC ‘taking sides’; (3) raising questions as to whether the BBC was ever impartial; (4) the decision situated as part of a broader narrative of failure; (5) the decision running counter to the BBC’s public service mission; and (6) broader questions raised over the BBC’s future. Our findings indicate that the BBC’s role in British life is under continued debate. This has implications for the organization in a time when its role is under scrutiny and threat from commercial forces.</p>

<p>The saga of the densely populated Gaza strip, long the site of contestation between Israeli and Palestinian peoples and their respective governments, took a violent turn in December 2008. In response to Palestinian rocket attacks, Israel launched a major retaliatory offensive that resulted in the deaths of 1,300 Palestinians, with a further 5,300 injured. A subsequent Israeli security blockade saw food, sanitation, and fuel come into short supply, prompting a major humanitarian crisis. On 22 January 2009, the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), an umbrella organization for 13 humanitarian aid organizations, launched a fundraising appeal for refugees in the region, expecting to count on the support of major media organizations to raise funds to relieve the crisis. However, on 24 January 2009, Director General Mark Thompson made a statement to BBC News Online explaining that the BBC, the pre-eminent British public service broadcaster, would not air the appeal on two grounds: a lack of clarity over whether aid would actually reach those who needed it; and the ‘more fundamental’ reason that broadcasting the appeal would have compromised ‘public confidence in the BBC’s impartiality’, lending the impression that ‘the BBC was taking sides in an ongoing conflict’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1464884911431539">M Thompson, 2009</xref>). The decision was controversial; figures including the Archbishop of Canterbury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884911431539">Khan, 2009</xref>), the chairman of Arab Media Watch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884911431539">Nashashibi, 2009</xref>) and 50 Members of the British Parliament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911431539">Clout, 2009</xref>) condemned the decision for its lack of compassion.</p>
<p>At a time when definitions and standards of media are in flux and the role of public broadcasting in particular is under scrutiny, the BBC’s decision not to air the emergency aid appeal raises important questions regarding the responsibilities of contemporary media organizations. One way of understanding contemporary conceptions of media responsibilities is through analyzing the responses of media organizations to a perceived ethical violation by another media organization. Doing so allows for examination of the news media’s views not only on that violation but also on the normative responsibilities that media organizations such as the BBC bear (or are perceived to bear) in the 21st century. To that end, this study examines editorial and op-ed responses in national British newspapers to the BBC decision not to air the DEC appeal.</p>
<sec id="section1-1464884911431539">
<title>The BBC and its public service mission</title>
<p>The British Broadcasting Company was founded in 1922 as a private entity. In 1927, in response to allegations of biased coverage of the 1926 General Strike, the company was dissolved and the British Broadcasting <italic>Corporation</italic> was established by Royal Charter that enshrined the principle of due impartiality. It is run as a public corporation by the BBC Trust, a body appointed by the government to protect the public interest. It is funded by a license fee mandated of all British households who watch or record TV as it’s being broadcast; resultantly, there is no advertising on the BBC. It is thus ‘insulate[d] … equally from market pressures and from state control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884911431539">Montgomery, 2006</xref>: 234). As a publicly funded media organization, the BBC has a mandate to serve the public.</p>
<p>Discussions of public service in the mass communication literature coalesce around the notion of the media’s responsibility to society, which posits that media organizations should operate not only in the interests of shareholders but of the broader citizenry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1464884911431539">Whale, 1972</xref>). Brown notes that a fundamental tenet of public service broadcasting is that ‘broadcasting should have objectives other than the entertainment of viewers and listeners and the profitability of private broadcasting firms’, namely ‘the promotion of education, equity, national identity, and social cohesion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911431539">1996</xref>: 5–6). Public broadcasting is an arena where the values of a pluralistic democracy are defined and debated, or, as James Carey describes it, ‘where social conflict over the real’ is played out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884911431539">1989</xref>: 87). Gardam writes that the role of the public service broadcasters is to ‘foster the virtues of plurality and difference inherent in a civil society’, while also indicating the ‘points of connection and mutual recognition where differences can be asserted, acknowledged, and accommodated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884911431539">2008</xref>: 12). In an applied sense, this is to ‘support the values underlying the political, legal, and social structures of democratic societies, and in particular the respect for human rights, culture, and pluralism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1464884911431539">Porter, 1995</xref>: 30).</p>
<p>How, then, have these notions translated into BBC practice? BBC founder John Reith argued that the primary role of broadcasters is their ‘responsibility’ to ‘improve the audience’ and to ‘carry into the greatest number of homes everything that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavor, and achievement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1464884911431539">1924</xref>: 34). From this perspective, broadcasters have a fundamental obligation to provide citizens with the tools necessary to function in a pluralistic, democratic society. A 2004 BBC internal report pointed to five dimensions to the public service obligations that the organization held dear. Among these dimensions was the ‘democratic value’ of public service, which posited that ‘the BBC supports civic life and national debate by providing trusted and impartial news and information that helps citizens make sense of the world and encourages them to engage with it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911431539">BBC, 2004</xref>: 7). These principles were articulated by Director General Mark Thompson in a 2006 speech, where Thompson argued that because the BBC is not dictated by ‘private supply and demand’ it is capable of aiming its content at such ‘wider societal goals’ as:
<disp-quote>
<p>… [a]n informed and engaged democracy with access to objective, impartial news and information. A population with the widest possible access to culture and talent and to skills and knowledge. Communities who are encouraged to encounter each other and to understand each other’s differences. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1464884911431539">Thompson, 2006</xref>: 3–4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Public service broadcasters are presently ‘under enormous pressure to connect to all sections of society in order to justify their continued public funding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911431539">Curran et al., 2009</xref>: 19). The BBC’s role in British public life was called into question in the 1980s under a Conservative government committed to laissez-faire economics and deregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464884911431539">McNair, 2003</xref>). The BBC has also come under threat from the emergence of cable and satellite television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911431539">Franklin, 2001</xref>) and audience fragmentation brought about by digital delivery platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911431539">Enli, 2008</xref>). While scholars have expressed concern about the BBC’s creeping moves toward commercialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911431539">Barnett, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911431539">Cushion and Lewis, 2009</xref>), the organization retains its commitment to public service, which remains the prism around which the organization’s identity is constructed.</p>

<title>Impartiality and its consequences</title>
<p>In his explanation as to why the BBC would not air the DEC emergency aid appeal, the BBC Director General Mark Thompson invoked the norm of journalistic impartiality, claiming that airing the appeal would undermine ‘public confidence in the BBC’s impartiality’ and indicate that ‘the BBC was taking sides in an ongoing conflict’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1464884911431539">2009</xref>). Impartiality is also central to the public service mission of organizations like the BBC, and was invoked by Mark Thompson in the 2006 speech mentioned above as a fundamental tenet of BBC practice.</p>
<p>What is impartiality? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1464884911431539">Westerstahl (1983)</xref>, impartiality is related to, but not synonymous, with objectivity. Westerstahl’s schema suggests that objectivity – the notion that fact can be separated from value – is comprised of factuality and impartiality. Furthermore, factuality is comprised of truth and relevance and impartiality is comprised of balance and neutrality. Impartiality, in short, can be understood as the practical application of a broader scientific concept. Impartiality emerged as a journalistic practice in the United Kingdom around the turn of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911431539">Chalaby, 1998</xref>) and became the fount of journalistic credibility, being ‘required to be a good journalist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911431539">Kieran, 1998</xref>: 35).</p>
<p>Though impartiality is a professional norm for journalists, it is not without its critics. Scholars have argued that the norm of impartiality has allowed for the manipulation of media coverage through over reliance on official sources and the freezing out of alternative voices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884911431539">Miller, 1993</xref>). For communitarian scholars, the norm of impartiality is indicative of an atavistic worldview and an impediment to the civic transformation through commitment to ‘justice, covenant, and empowerment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911431539">Christians et al., 1993</xref>: 14) that journalists and media institutions must be working towards. For communitarian scholars, impartiality implies detachment and impassive distance, which is incompatible with a world where borders are becoming diffuse, economics tie nations together, and the actions of one nation can have far-reaching consequences beyond its immediate neighbors.</p>
<p>Impartiality is enshrined in the BBC’s charter and British law due to its status as a publicly funded institution. Unlike the openly partisan British newspaper industry, British broadcasting is strictly regulated, with broadcasters bound by British law to be impartial, make clear the division between fact and opinion, and not editorialize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884911431539">Montgomery, 2006</xref>). Impartiality is also woven into the corporation’s organizational fabric; it began in the BBC not only as a legislative mandate but also ‘an emerging commitment to programme balance more broadly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911431539">Hampton, 2008</xref>: 482), an organizational norm that took root in the earliest days of the corporation’s history and remains to this day. However, the BBC’s commitment to impartiality has been criticized for how it positions the BBC in the role of a passive, disinterested mediator of an establishment view of the world, rather than prompting it to take an active role in community-building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911431539">Born, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884911431539">Hargreaves, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The BBC has also been criticized for not reporting impartially, a criticism levelled recently in the context of the Israel–Palestine conflict, in which the BBC was accused of having a pro-Israel bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1464884911431539">Philo and Berry, 2004</xref>). In response to public complaints, the BBC commissioned an independent study, which found that despite no evidence of systematic or deliberate bias, greater editorial oversight was needed to ensure impartiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911431539">BBC, 2006</xref>). Despite these criticisms, impartiality remains a pivotal element of the BBC’s mission. In a 2007 trade publication, the organization declared that:
<disp-quote>
<p>… impartiality is and should remain the hallmark of the BBC as the leading provider of information and entertainment in the United Kingdom and as a pre-eminent broadcaster internationally. It is a legal requirement, but it should also be a source of pride. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911431539">BBC Trust, 2007</xref>: 25)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The BBC’s mission statement proclaims that its impartiality is one of the reasons why it is ‘the world’s most trusted news organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911431539">BBC, 2005</xref>: 43).</p>

<title>Media responsibilities: Policing the interpretive community</title>
<p>When a media organization makes a decision that raises public outcry, it becomes important to discuss notions of media responsibilities. One such way of understanding media responsibilities is through analyzing the comments and critiques of other media organizations and professionals who are members of the same ‘interpretive community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1464884911431539">Zelizer, 1993</xref>). Notions of responsibility are of particular concern to public broadcasters given their public service mission and broader social responsibility. Analyzing reflections on decision-making at the micro-level explicates conceptions of journalistic responsibilities at the macro-level, as such discourses police the interpretive community to enforce particular norms and values.</p>
<p>Editorials and op-eds are, in addition to letters pages, ‘the only pages of the [news]paper where the ideal of objectivity does not apply’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1464884911431539">Wahl-Jorgensen, 2004</xref>: 59). They are thus a good source for media commentary on prominent or controversial issues. Editorials provide ‘as close as is possible … to an institutional voice of each newspaper’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911431539">Hindman, 2003</xref>: 671). Therefore, when the performance of another media organization becomes a matter of public concern, analyzing editorial responses provides a window into the institutional views of the press. Op-ed columns exist to ‘broaden the spectrum’ of public debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1464884911431539">Rosenfeld, 2000</xref>: 7). While op-eds are <italic>not</italic> the institutional voice of the newspaper, they are nonetheless <italic>of</italic> the newspaper and provide insight into the views of media professionals. Thus, combining analysis of editorials and op-eds provides insight into both the institutional views of the news media (or, rather, one element of it) and the ‘commentariat’ within the interpretive community. For this study, we sought the views of British national newspapers and the professionals within it on the BBC’s refusal to air the DEC Gaza emergency aid appeal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1464884911431539" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>We sought as representative a sample of British newspaper discourse as possible and thus examined the 12 national daily newspapers and 11 Sunday newspapers that comprise the British national newspaper market.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464884911431539">1</xref></sup> We conducted a search of the Access World News database for editorials and op-eds in national British newspapers mentioning the keywords ‘BBC’ and ‘Gaza’ from 24 January 2009 (when the BBC announced its decision to not air the appeal) to 24 February 2009, exactly one month later, allowing for the inclusion of both immediate and residual commentary. ‘Hard news’ reports, letters to the editor, and miscellaneous articles were discarded. To compensate for absences in the Access World News database, which does not carry the <italic>Daily Express</italic>, the <italic>Sunday Express</italic>, and the <italic>Morning Star</italic>, we supplemented our search by searching the websites of the remaining newspapers using the same keywords and timeframe. Our final dataset was 57 articles, of which 12 were editorials and 45 were op-eds.</p>
<p>The articles were analyzed using what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911431539">Altheide (1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884911431539">1996</xref>) calls ethnographic content analysis (ECA). ECA has been used in studies looking at media responses to a purportedly unethical act by another media institution, such as in analyses of media responses to the death of Princess Diana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911431539">Berkowitz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911431539">Hindman, 2003</xref>) and plagiarism by Jayson Blair, a prominent reporter at the <italic>New York Times</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884911431539">Hindman, 2005</xref>). Thus it is an ideal method for this kind of study. ECA is an inductive method that allows for themes to surface throughout the analysis process. When ECA is used by scholars:
<disp-quote>
<p>[t]he aim is to be systematic and analytic, but not rigid. Although categories and ‘variables’ initially guide the study, others are allowed and expected to emerge throughout the study. Thus, ECA is embedded in constant discovery and constant comparison of relevant situations, settings, styles, images, meanings and nuances. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911431539">Altheide, 1987</xref>: 68)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>To this end, we read the selected texts to identify portions that specifically discussed the BBC decision not to air the DEC appeal and got a sense of the overall tone of the texts. We used open coding to allow themes to emerge inductively rather than using a predetermined schema. We then re-read the texts to identify key discursive themes and features, which were distilled using axial coding to bring ‘previously separate categories together under a principle of integration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464884911431539">Lindlof and Taylor, 2002</xref>: 221).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1464884911431539">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We found six prominent themes in national newspaper discourse: (1) the BBC demonstrating blatant disregard for human life; (2) the BBC ‘taking sides’; (3) questioning whether the BBC was ever impartial; (4) the decision situated as part of a broader narrative of failure; (5) the decision violating the BBC’s public service mission; (6) the BBC’s role in public life being questioned.</p>
<sec id="section6-1464884911431539">
<title>Disregard for human life</title>
<p>This theme represents the discussion in the newspapers that the BBC demonstrated scant regard for the sanctity of human life in its decision not to air the DEC appeal. For example, a <italic>Guardian</italic> op-ed disavowed the politicized nature of the case, calling the appeal simply ‘about the unjust, abhorrent suffering of civilians, human beings, a population mostly of refugees, under occupation, bearing the brunt of military and economic siege’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884911431539">Nashashibi, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Editorials and op-eds from across the political spectrum, whether supportive or critical of the BBC decision, referred to the human misery experienced in Gaza. ‘The point is,’ a <italic>Times</italic> editorial stated, ‘that people are suffering terribly’ (2009). Marina Hyde of the <italic>Guardian</italic> alluded to the ‘abject need’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884911431539">2009</xref>) of the refugees while Melanie Phillips of the <italic>Daily Mail</italic> asserted that ‘the need for humanitarian relief for people suffering the grievous effects of war is undeniable’ (2009). A <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> editorial lamented:
<disp-quote>
<p>We applaud Mr. Thompson’s recognition of the importance of impartiality … [but] … children in Gaza are desperately in need of the aid that the charities are able to provide … We do not believe that the BBC will compromise its reputation for impartiality by broadcasting the charities’ appeal, but it may help the children in Gaza. We hope it will reconsider its decision. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1464884911431539">2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Editorials and op-eds noted the BBC’s lack of moral fortitude in refusing to air the DEC appeal, portraying a nervous, unsteady institution blind to the human consequences of its decision. The BBC was ‘timid’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911431539"><italic>Daily Mirror</italic>, 2009</xref>) in the face of human tragedy, its decision representing ‘one of the most shocking examples of moral blindness in recent times’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911431539">Hundal, 2009</xref>). The BBC, wrote one commentator, ‘is so desperate not to cause offense … that it won’t stick its neck out, making political excuses, on behalf of innocent people who desperately need aid’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1464884911431539">Pitcher, 2009a</xref>). A <italic>Mail on Sunday</italic> op-ed called the decision ‘stubborn’ and ‘spineless’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1464884911431539">Waterhouse, 2009</xref>), while an <italic>Observer</italic> op-ed referred to an appearance by former Labour MP Tony Benn on the <italic>Today</italic> BBC radio programme in which he criticized the BBC’s decision, stating that the show’s host and producers ‘rightly produced’ Benn ‘because they knew he would articulate what their bosses have failed to: reason and humanity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911431539">Llewelyn, 2009</xref>). Similarly, a <italic>Daily Mirror</italic> columnist called Benn’s appearance ‘reassuring’, as Benn tried ‘to ease the suffering of the oppressed by attacking the cowardice of the BBC management on their own airwaves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1464884911431539">Reade, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Other editorials and op-eds emphasized the callous nature of the BBC decision. For <italic>The Times</italic>, the decision ‘elevates bizarre media preoccupations about the Corporation’s image above the need to help people in an emergency … The BBC is choosing an odd moment to demonstrate concern that its Middle East coverage be seen as balanced’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1464884911431539"><italic>The Times</italic>, 2009</xref>). The most strident critique came from the <italic>Morning Star</italic>; in an editorial entitled ‘Blood on the BBC’s hands’, the newspaper angrily described the BBC’s invoking of impartiality in the name of human suffering as a ‘sick joke’. In this newspaper’s view the BBC contributed to the fate of Gaza’s afflicted, with the editorial asserting that ‘people will die because of the BBC’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1464884911431539">
<title>Taking sides</title>
<p>Some commentary concerned the issue of taking sides. For example: ‘Surely NOT showing it was, in a way, taking sides. This was a humanitarian crisis – whoever caused it – and the victims need help’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911431539">Austin, 2009</xref>). Newspapers such as the <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> asserted that the BBC had abandoned its neutrality, with ‘the failure to broadcast the appeal show[ing] that [it] is biased in favour of Israel’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911431539"><italic>Daily Telegraph</italic>, 2009</xref>). The most strident critique came from the <italic>Morning Star</italic>, which argued, ‘By pretending not to take sides, the BBC has taken Israel’s side. Israel did not suffer over 1300 civilian deaths, nor did it have its towns blitzed into rubble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884911431539"><italic>Morning Star</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>More supportive commentators suggested that ‘to broadcast a charity appeal that is so clearly aimed at helping the victims of just one side in the conflict would inevitably lead to claims of bias’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911431539">Coughlin, 2009</xref>). From this point of view, ‘the BBC … could only broadcast such an appeal in its news shows if similar air time were to be given to Israeli victims of Hamas rocket attacks in southern Israel’. For another columnist:
<disp-quote>
<p>This is not a disaster caused by a tsunami or an earthquake … It is the product of a highly controversial war – and for the BBC to broadcast appeals for humanitarian relief for Palestinian victims would inevitably be seen as a political act. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1464884911431539">Rachman, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One op-ed suggested that the charity agencies themselves are far from neutral and have a ‘semi-hysterical’ anti-Israeli political agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911431539">Alderman, 2009</xref>). Whether supportive or critical of the decision, newspaper op-eds and editorials create two distinct camps and reflect that the BBC took Israel’s side, rightly or wrongly so. Other commentators suggested that the BBC drew a false dichotomy in its decision. An <italic>Observer</italic> editorial concluded:
<disp-quote>
<p>… that any humanitarian intervention in Gaza, by definition, [becomes] a political position in the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians … By that logic, there can never be victims in a war zone, even among civilians, since to designate anyone as such would offend one of the combatant sides. That is patently absurd and inhumane. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1464884911431539"><italic>Observer</italic>, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another commentator elucidated why this dichotomy was false based on precedent:
<disp-quote>
<p>Was there a similar consideration taken by the BBC when it broadcast a DEC appeal after the Boxing Day tsunami? Back then there were fears that some of the aid would be siphoned off by Tamil Tiger terrorists in Sri Lanka. And what about the Darfur crisis? Was the BBC’s management worried about looking like it was taking side against the Janjawid militants? Was there the same level of dithering going on then? No. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911431539">Hundal, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A <italic>Guardian</italic> editorial also drew parallels to Darfur and Sri Lanka, while another columnist commented: ‘Supporting the dispossessed and starving in Sudan, Iraq, and Afghanistan wouldn’t attract any such fuss. Supporting the same in Gaza would do so. And the BBC bottles it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1464884911431539">Pitcher, 2009a</xref>). For The <italic>Guardian</italic>’s Martin Bell, ‘BBC management acts as if there is one rule for Africans and another for Palestinians’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884911431539">Bell, 2009</xref>). For Nashashibi, also of The <italic>Guardian</italic>, the consequential message was ‘that suffering Palestinians are less worthy of help than those in need in Congo, Burma, Sudan, Niger, Liberia, and numerous other countries that the BBC has helped through previous DEC appeals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884911431539">Nashashibi, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>The Times</italic> expressed concern that the BBC was approaching the matter in too reductionist a fashion:
<disp-quote>
<p>The death and suffering in Gaza is entirely the fault of Israel. That is a biased statement. The death and suffering in Gaza is entirely the fault of Hamas. That is a biased statement. There has been death and there is suffering in Gaza. That is a simple statement of fact. It is worrying that the BBC is not able to make this distinction. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1464884911431539"><italic>The Times</italic>, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Others concluded that the BBC would no longer be able to report with authority on matters pertaining to the region, for its ‘ability … to report unfolding events in Gaza impartially will be diminished as a result’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884911431539"><italic>Guardian</italic>, 2009</xref>), leaving the organization ‘isolated and exposed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884911431539">Bell, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> raised the issue of other charity appeals and how the BBC had willingly aligned itself with the British children’s charity Children in Need and the Make Poverty History campaign to alleviate Third World debt, both of which are high-profile appeals and both of which had received significant BBC support. Make Poverty History was identified as a particular source of controversy, with the <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> noting that by supporting the effort to raise money for the famine-struck populations of Africa, the BBC ‘took sides with those who insist that the only way to improve the condition of Africa is to send more aid to the continent, a position which is hotly contested by many economists and even by some aid workers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911431539"><italic>Daily Telegraph</italic>, 2009</xref>). For Melanie Phillips of the <italic>Daily Mail</italic>, the BBC showed hypocrisy in refusing to air an appeal for aid for Gaza while lending support to Make Poverty History, opening itself ‘to the charge that it was promoting a left-wing view of humanitarian relief – and that the millions it was helping raise were likely to end up in the pockets of corrupt African kleptocrats’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464884911431539">Phillips, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-1464884911431539">
<title>Was there ever impartiality?</title>
<p>Some commentators asked whether the BBC ever could claim impartiality based on its record, noting that the event was the latest in a long series of similar impasses wherein the BBC had demonstrated a lack of concern about impartiality and was, at best, selective when it invoked the norm. For these commentators, the BBC’s willingness to support some charities over others was indicative of a selective approach to impartiality.</p>
<p>For example, one <italic>Daily Mirror</italic> columnist referred to the BBC’s lack of impartiality in other instances: ‘The Beeb is famous for its impartiality. Remember all those programmes criticising the EU or suggesting global warming could be a con? Thought not’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911431539">Carroll, 2009</xref>). This sentiment was reflected in the headline to a <italic>Daily Mail</italic> op-ed: ‘The BBC won’t show the Gaza appeal to protect its impartiality. But does anyone really believe it’s impartial?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464884911431539">Phillips, 2009</xref>). The author stated that the BBC’s ‘claim that it was anxious to safeguard its reputation for impartiality will have caused a sharp intake of breath among the many who think it no longer has a reputation of impartiality to defend’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464884911431539">Phillips, 2009</xref>). As an institution, the BBC is ‘hostile to conservatism, big business, religion, the countryside, and family values; it supports multiculturalism, environmentalism, European federalism, human rights law and ‘alternative’ lifestyles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464884911431539">Phillips, 2009</xref>). The <italic>Daily Mail</italic> itself took a similar stance:
<disp-quote>
<p>The corporation says it is worried that, by screening a film which ITV, Channel Four, and Five are all prepared to air, it would place its reputation for political impartiality at risk. Fat chance! That reputation was shredded long ago, when it adopted an institutionally liberal attitude to everything from abortion to migration to minority rights and religion. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431539">2009a</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>From this perspective, the BBC was a bastion of politically correct leftist thought and any claim to impartiality it makes is laughable at best. For one <italic>Sunday Telegraph</italic> columnist, the BBC has a long tradition of such anti-Israeli bias, commenting on its ‘relentless, unthinking sympathy for Palestinian crooks, fanatics and terrorists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1464884911431539">D Thompson, 2009</xref>). For the <italic>Daily Mail</italic>’s Melanie Phillips, the BBC had been negligent in prior coverage of the region because it had long reported ‘many of Hamas’s own claims as fact – particularly its estimate of the number of civilian casualties in Gaza, which Israel strenuously contests – the BBC has helped create a dangerously unbalanced and irrational public mood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464884911431539">Phillips, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1464884911431539">
<title>History repeating itself</title>
<p>A prominent theme in the data was that the BBC’s decision was the latest in a chain of poor decisions that ultimately cast the corporation in a negative light and suggested that it was incapable of carrying out the public service task with which it had been charged. One <italic>Sunday Telegraph</italic> op-ed suggested that the corporation’s public statements ‘have that non-negotiable tone so familiar to those of us who monitor [them]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911431539">Daley, 2009</xref>). The BBC had a ‘catastrophic record on handling crises’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1464884911431539"><italic>News of the World</italic>, 2009</xref>); its bosses ‘spent last weekend doing intellectual somersaults as only they can, before falling very awkwardly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911431539">Austin, 2009</xref>). For the <italic>Daily Mail</italic>, ‘once again, the BBC finds itself in a mess of its own making’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431539">2009a</xref>); one columnist wrote that the BBC ‘lurches from one controversy to another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911431539">Glover, 2009</xref>). By portraying the BBC as consistently failing in arguably its most basic function, informing the populace, the newspapers created an impression of an inept organization with a poor track record and a shaky sense of judgment.</p>
<p>If the assertion of one commentator that ‘barely a day goes by when the BBC or its presenters are not called upon to apologize for something’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911431539">Fitzsimmons, 2009</xref>) is true, then the period around the time of the DEC decision was a maelstrom of apologia due to the amount of scandal engulfing the BBC at the time. Reference was made to BBC talk show host and comedian Jonathan Ross, who was suspended from his £18m contract for a month as a result of him making lewd comments on air, and to Carol Thatcher’s suspension from the BBC current affairs show <italic>The One Show</italic> for an off-screen comment made about a mixed-race tennis player. With regard to Ross, Marina Hyde of <italic>The Guardian</italic> suggested that the two incidents were ‘interconnected in ways sometimes too dizzying to contemplate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884911431539">Hyde, 2009</xref>), and concluded that a culture of timidity had swept over the BBC. Meanwhile, the Thatcher decision was held up as an example of overly politically correct decision-making and inattentiveness to the public mood. For example, one headline asked: ‘Is there anyone sensible living on Planet Beeb?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1464884911431539">Pitcher, 2009b</xref>). Juxtaposing these incidents alongside the Gaza decision paint a picture of an organization in terminal decline, beset by one crisis after another.</p>

<sec id="section10-1464884911431539">
<title>A decision that goes against tradition and expectation</title>
<p>For some commentators, this decision defied the BBC’s public service tradition. For one columnist, ‘the cadre that runs the BBC makes a specialty of being out of kilter with public opinion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911431539">Glover, 2009</xref>). There is, according to a <italic>Daily Mail</italic> editorial, a ‘yawning gap between the politically correct elite running the BBC and the great mass of the British people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911431539">2009b</xref>). One commentator writes that ‘it’s hard to support the BBC, though I do, but its management makes it almost impossible’, describing BBC management as ‘bland, mealy-mouthed types half-heartedly defending a bewildering decision’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884911431539">Moore, 2009</xref>). Instead of bravely taking a stand, the BBC appeared to be chasing a politically correct, inoffensive middle ground, subscribing to ‘the acceptable tenets of received opinion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911431539">Daley, 2009</xref>) and demonstrating a lack of ‘backbone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884911431539"><italic>Financial Times</italic>, 2009</xref>). Former BBC journalist Tim Llewelyn, in an <italic>Observer</italic> op-ed, argued ‘this cowardly decision betrays the values the corporation stands for’, claimed the BBC was ‘traducing the very ideals it is supposed to uphold’, described the organization as ‘a body of lions led by donkeys’, and stated that the decision ‘discredits the honest reporters the BBC still has on its books and in the field’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911431539">Llewelyn, 2009</xref>). The decision was ‘lamentable’ for one commentator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1464884911431539">Patten, 2009</xref>), while another argued that ‘the BBC embodies a frighteningly closed thought system … There is widespread dismay that, far from elevating and educating public values, its … output is becoming steadily degraded’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464884911431539">Phillips, 2009</xref>). From this perspective, ‘one of this nation’s greatest assets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911431539"><italic>Daily Mirror</italic>, 2009</xref>) was being steadily undermined by its own management, who were running the corporation into the ground and explicitly defying the traditions and values that had shaped the corporation since its founding. For one columnist, the BBC was ‘a once-magnificent institution that was long ago torn adrift from its moorings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911431539">Glover, 2009</xref>). Nowhere was this sense of loss more accurately summarized than in this <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> op-ed: ‘[this is] not about politics, it’s about moral cowardice. And that’s a worry from a public-service broadcaster. [BBC founder] Lord Reith must be turning in his grave’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1464884911431539">Pitcher, 2009a</xref>). From this perspective, the BBC had fallen very far from the idealism and energy that characterized the corporation’s halcyon days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1464884911431539">
<title>What is the BBC’s role?</title>
<p>The sixth and final theme concerned the lack of clarity over the BBC’s broader societal role. For one commentator, the BBC’s ‘entire reason for existing as a public service broadcaster is to embody the highest standards of excellence and integrity. But through both its partisan journalism and its moronic and unprincipled entertainment shows it has destroyed this reputation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464884911431539">Phillips, 2009</xref>). From this perspective, the BBC’s incompetence necessitated some reconsideration of its role in British broadcasting. Another commentator, writing favorably of the BBC’s decision, nonetheless asked:
<disp-quote>
<p>Is it the function of a broadcasting organisation – even a publicly funded one – to make decisions about the appropriate use of donations to a charitable appeal, let alone to intervene in the hugely complex international question of how the civilian population of combatant countries should be helped? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911431539">Daley, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The same article continued: ‘The BBC is not a department of state – however grandly it may conceive its public duty. It is staffed and run by people who are responsible for making television and radio programmes, not foreign policy’. To decide who receives aid in a crisis situation is a ‘dangerous assumption of political power’. As a result, the BBC is now ‘at sea’, having ‘lost its founding identity as a source of edification and enlightenment’ (2009). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1464884911431539">Preston (2009)</xref>, ‘the BBC is in the grip of an identity crisis’, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464884911431539">Phillips (2009)</xref> also referred to the BBC’s ‘profound loss of its identity, caused by a repudiation of the values that gave it a unique place in Britain’s cultural life and, indeed, the world’.</p>
<p>Given the crises befalling the BBC, some commentators pushed for radical reform. One commentator suggested that broadcasters like the BBC ‘should be able to begin behaving more like newspapers, with a little more latitude to handle polemical, opinionated broadcasting, and broadcasting regulations should start to reflect that’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1464884911431539">Sabbagh, 2009</xref>). For others, this was an opportunity to dislodge the BBC’s status as a publicly funded institution, as ‘for years it has been systematically squandering the respect and trust of the public – so much so that license-fee payers are increasingly questioning its very existence as a publicly financed broadcaster’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464884911431539">Phillips, 2009</xref>). For another commentator, despite the ‘small pools of excellence on radio and even television’ which ‘justify, at least in part, the continued public subsidy of the corporation … it is impossible to justify many of its activities which could be done just as well by commercial rivals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911431539">Glover, 2009</xref>). A <italic>Daily Mail</italic> editorial positioned the crisis engendered by the decision as an opportunity for a radical rethink. The BBC:
<disp-quote>
<p>… has become far too large for anyone to control. That must be put right. In this digital, multi-channel age, shouldn’t we be thinking seriously of preserving the best of the BBC … and selling the rest to the highest bidders? Would that be the surest way of slashing the license fee, restoring the corporation to its place in the nation’s hearts – and increasing the plurality of opinion in the British media? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911431539">2009b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These attempts at undermining the BBC from the political right were not lost on commentators from the left, with one columnist situating the DEC decision within the context of a BBC under constant fire from Conservatives and in fear of losing its mandate: ‘It has become so cowed from sniping from the right that it has lost conviction in the integrity of its own journalism. The anti-BBC brigade in the press and politics will use any excuse to undermine the corporation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911431539">Hundal, 2009</xref>). Another commentator, this time from the <italic>Guardian</italic>, noted that the right-leaning newspapers constantly had the BBC in their ‘crosshairs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884911431539">Hyde, 2009</xref>), awaiting a slip up on the institution’s part.</p>

<sec id="section12-1464884911431539" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings indicate that the BBC is at the center of some extremely important debates regarding media performance, roles, and responsibilities. While much of the discourse corresponded to the BBC particularly, others provided broader commentary into media practices in general. This is acutely clear in the discussion of impartiality in media discourses. Here, we see the norm of impartiality called into question. These critiques move from the micro- to the macro-level in their analysis, using the specific decision by Thompson and BBC management to spur a broader epistemic critique or commentary on the norm of impartiality and its suitability to the globalized world of today. Most (though not all) responses defied the convention that impartiality is the pinnacle of journalistic attainment and argued that it is secondary to concern and compassion for the afflicted and dispossessed. This is in line with communitarian thinking that has long argued that the norm of impartiality prohibits any evolution into a more inclusive, compassionate media model. This is not to say that communitarian thought is rife among British newspaper editors and columnists, but rather to suggest that we are seeing alternative modes of practice bubbling up through news discourses and the talismanic nature of conventional practices reflexively questioned. That said, the corollary of doing away with the norm of impartiality and granting broadcasters in Britain ‘more latitude to handle polemical, opinionated broadcasting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1464884911431539">Sabbagh, 2009</xref>) could well be the ‘Foxification’ of public broadcasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911431539">Cushion and Lewis, 2009</xref>). Given that there are compelling arguments against impartiality as a journalistic norm, it behooves mass communication scholars to address the consequences of a shift away from impartiality and whether such a shift would lead to a more ethical and responsible media system or something quite different.</p>
<p>Though the articles analyzed were not uniform in their criticism of the BBC, what is clear from the maelstrom raised by the decision is the fragility of the corporation’s role in contemporary British society. From attacking the BBC for its lack of compassion, to suggesting that the BBC was a calamitous organization stumbling from one gaffe to another, to arguing that the BBC’s values were unrepresentative of those of the British people, to painting an image of BBC management as weak and vacillating, the newspaper discourse surrounding this decision constructs an image of an organization that is woefully inadequate at performing its public service mission. This contributes to an ongoing weakening of the BBC’s armor, clearing the way for alternative ideas, namely, as argued by some editorials and op-eds, a move to a free-market model.</p>
<p>It is important to situate these findings within the ongoing debate over the BBC’s role in British public life. In a keynote address at the 2009 <italic>MediaGuardian</italic> Edinburgh International Television Festival, News Corporation chairman and chief executive James Murdoch lashed out at the British broadcasting system, claiming its regulatory framework positions it as the ‘Addams Family of world media’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884911431539">2009</xref>: 9). Murdoch singled out the BBC for criticism, pointing to its ‘inability to distinguish between what is good for it, and what is good for the country’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884911431539">2009</xref>: 15). ‘Funded by a universal hypothecated tax,’ Murdoch said, ‘the BBC feels empowered and obliged to try and offer something for everyone, even in areas well served by the market’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884911431539">2009</xref>: 15). Murdoch went on the state that the scope of the BBC’s activities was ‘chilling’ and ‘a land grab’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884911431539">2009</xref>: 14). Murdoch advocated a market model for British broadcasting:
<disp-quote>
<p>Most importantly, in this all-media marketplace, the expansion of state-sponsored journalism is a threat to the plurality and independence of news provision, which are so important for our democracy. Dumping free, state-sponsored news on the market makes it incredibly difficult for journalism to flourish on the Internet. Yet it is essential for the future of independent digital journalism that a fair price can be charged for news to people who value it. We seem to have decided as a society to let independence and plurality wither. To let the BBC throttle the news market and then get bigger to compensate. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884911431539">2009</xref>: 16)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Murdoch’s comments were widely covered in the British media and echoed the repeated criticisms by his father, Rupert Murdoch, of the BBC specifically and public broadcasting more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1464884911431539">Robinson, 2009</xref>). We highlight this to demonstrate the growing number of discordant voices speaking against the BBC and its role as a publicly funded institution. As this study demonstrates, the perspective that the ‘Beeb’ has an unfair advantage over its competitors due to its public funding continues to gain traction, with newspapers and commentators using the opportunities afforded them by ethical lapses in the BBC’s decision-making to weaken the public broadcasting model and advocate a move toward a free-market system. In short, our findings indicate that the wolves of the free market are at the BBC’s door and are howling louder than ever.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911431539">Cushion and Lewis (2009)</xref> have sounded alarm bells about the ‘Foxification’ of public broadcasting and the decline in standards that comes with a move to a marketplace model, where social responsibility is sacrificed at the altar of profitability. The BBC specifically, and public broadcasting more broadly, need to better articulate a clear line of defense against these attacks. The fact that the BBC appears to be making gaffe after gaffe does not help this cause. The onus is on the corporation to engage in a self-reflexive process to revise its role in British society in the 21st century and better articulate the principles of a model of news media rooted not in markets but in social responsibility. The notion that the market is the antidote to every societal ill has gained significant traction in the last quarter of the 20th century and the opening years of the 21st due to the seemingly unassailable litany of neoliberalism that has ‘become hegemonic as a mode of discourse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884911431539">Harvey, 2005</xref>: 3). When we situate this in the broader context of ongoing attempts to weaken the BBC, there are societal implications of such a move. A market model does not <italic>necessarily</italic> raise standards or contribute toward the creation of a pluralistic, informed, engaged polity; in fact, some scholars argue it does the opposite, by lowering journalistic standards, allowing for ethical slippages, and debasing public discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911431539">Cushion and Lewis, 2009</xref>). This has implications for media systems across the globe and asks searching questions about the kind of media that the public not only <italic>wants</italic> but <italic>needs</italic>. A robust public broadcasting model is essential to the proper functioning of the public sphere in a democratic society, fostering a pluralistic, diverse polity and meeting needs that are under served by the market. Given this historic and meaningful role, it is essential that they be defended.</p>
