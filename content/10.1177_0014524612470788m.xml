<p>The ‘joy’ which Hugh Pyper seeks and finds in Kierkegaard’s writings is not one side of a simple either/or of despair/joy, but rather ‘a joy that is grounded in the eternal and changeless love of God’—a joy which gives expression to the hope that emerges from an admission of our own propensity for despair. Such joy is no stranger to ‘the absurd’. Indeed, what is ostensibly even more ‘absurd’ is that such joy may itself even be ‘commanded’ by a hidden God. Reading Kierkegaard with reference to the ‘scandal’ of the Bible, Pyper succeeds where many have failed in eleven distinctive readings which each fulfil his avowed aim to be ‘potentially enlightening and life-enhancing.’ While Kierkegaard himself may have remained suspicious toward many of the discoveries of nineteenth century historical-critical biblical method, his dedication to the sacred text itself is given imaginative, literary, heterodox, and even scandalous expression in his own writings. In turn, Pyper’s essays do ample justice to Kierkegaard in their own erudition, ingenuity, and humanity. These eleven essays, which arise from decades of reading, writing, and reflection on Kierkegaard, serve as navigation points for an extensive journey through the vertiginous landscape of Kierkegaard’s authorship—engaging a vast range of topics which is itself already compelling testimony to Pyper’s opening claim that the Bible constitutes one of the most important (if not the most decisive) hermeneutical keys to Kierkegaard’s writings.</p>
<p>While all but two of the eleven essays collected here have been published elsewhere, many are difficult to obtain and the opportunity to read them together in collection is deeply enriching. The sum is greater than its parts and we are presented with a virtually polymathic account of the role of the Bible in Kierkegaard’s writings. The essays not only consider Kierkegaard’s approach to particular biblical texts, motifs, and figures, but apply themselves to Kierkegaard’s views of the Bible as a whole, while also engaging in sustained engagements with the likes of Hegel and Derrida. With respect to the latter, the book closes, most aptly, with Pyper’s profound 2002 essay ‘Forgiving the Unforgivable: Kierkegaard, Derrida and the Scandal of Forgiveness’, where Pyper brings Kierkegaard’s radical views on forgiveness into conversation with those of Jankélévitch and Derrida. In closing with such a poignant discussion of the un/forgivable in light of the Shoah, Pyper demonstrates that the joy of Kierkegaard is anything but a trite work of comic irony. On the contrary, this final essay reminds us that joy may arise as an absurdly defiant, even divinely impossible possibility which resists the abysmal triumph of evil and despair.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, this collection is a genuine treasury from one of Kierkegaard’s most insightful, creative and empathic contemporary interpreters. Already by the end of the opening essay, ‘The Joy of Kierkegaard’, Pyper has performed the epigrammatic feat of summarising the entire Hebrew Bible in one word… I will not spoil the surprise (though I have allowed the word to creep into this review, for those with eyes for the esoteric); but suffice it to say that the claim is neither as brazen nor as presumptuous as it may sound. I also think that Kierkegaard would have been proud, if not a little envious that he himself had not thought of it. Nevertheless, he would have rejoiced.</p>
