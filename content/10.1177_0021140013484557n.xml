<p>How is it that a scriptural monograph by an Irish Dominican has just appeared 60 years after it was written? The Introduction to this volume offers an explanation. The basic text (pp. 23–315) was accepted as a doctoral dissertation by the Pontifical Biblical Commission in Rome in 1951 but never formally published. Yet despite being available only in a library copy in Rome, it has long exercised great influence as the most thorough study in English on the expanded text of Ben Sira (Ecclesiasticus). Hence it has finally been published, as a result of the painstaking editorial work of Pancratius Beentjes.</p>
<p>Besides the text of the dissertation, this edition adds three useful contributions. First, there is a warm biographical appreciation of the author by a fellow Dominican biblical scholar, Gerard Norton (pp. 1–7). We learn that Conleth Kearns was born at Newbridge, County Kildare in 1902, entered the Dominican order in 1920, taught briefly in Maynooth (1934–36), and worked for many years in Rome until his death in 1985. The second contribution to the volume is a helpful introduction to the dissertation provided by Maurice Gilbert, former rector of the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome (pp. 9–21). Gilbert sets the study in context, outlines its main findings, and then assesses its conclusions in light of 60 years of subsequent research. The third contribution (pp. 317–30) is a valuable bibliographical update, supplied by Gregorian University professor Núria Calduch-Benages, listing studies from 1951–2010 dealing with the expanded text of Ben Sira, as well as the book’s teaching on death, the future life, resurrection, and Messianism.</p>
<p>The starting point for Kearns’s study is the question of how faith in the afterlife was gradually expressed more and more in the developing textual editions of Ben Sira (Ecclesiasticus). Most Old Testament scholars surmise that belief in a future resurrection arose within ancient Israel as a response to the martyrdom of devout Jews under King Antiochus Epiphanes in the 2nd century BCE (Dan 12:1–3; 2 Macc 7:9–29). In Kearns’s view, the textual tradition of Ben Sira’s book testifies to this theological development. Whereas the original Hebrew text around 190 BCE has no expectation of the afterlife (Sir 7:17; 10:11; 14:16; 22:11; 38:21; 41:3–4), the grandson’s Greek translation allows some space for retribution in the afterlife (LXX Sir 7:17; 22:11). Commenting on the difference in wording between the Hebrew and Greek forms of Sir 7:17, Kearns observes: ‘<italic>Expectation of man</italic>—the common natural lot of all men—is changed into <italic>vengeance on the ungodly man</italic>’ (p. 105).</p>
<p>In order to allow greater space for rewards and punishment in the afterlife, the additions in the expanded text of Ben Sira provide teaching on the afterlife, according to Kearns’s thesis. For instance, the word ‘immortality’ (<italic>athanasia</italic>) appears in the Greek tradition of Ben Sira only in one of the additions (Sir 19:19 Gr II): ‘They who do the things that are pleasing to Him shall pluck the fruit of the tree of immortality’ (p. 131). Comparable expansions occur, not only in the Greek text and the subsequent Latin, but even in Hebrew and Syriac manuscripts. For instance, whereas the Greek text of Sir 1:12 states that fear of the Lord brings long life (i.e., on earth), the Syriac version asserts that fear of the Lord brings ‘eternal life’ (p. 111). The significant claim of Kearns is that the major motive for the expansions is the desire to teach about the afterlife (p. 123): ‘The eschatology is the chief doctrinal bond which unites three different groups of textual witnesses’—Greek II, Latin, and Syriac. Accordingly, Kearns claims (p. 102) that it is possible ‘to group under one heading the whole homogeneous expansion’ of Ben Sira’s book in the various textual traditions.</p>
<p>The dissertation is clearly organized into four chapters. In chapter I, dealing with the origin of the expanded text of Ben Sira, Kearns lists many textual instances so as to trace predominant theological themes, including eschatology. Chapter II then makes a significant advance by situating the eschatology of the expanded Ben Sira text within the context of Second Temple period Jewish writings, especially those now generally classified as Old Testament Pseudepigrapha. For the researcher it is helpful that the volume includes a select index of scriptural and pseudepigraphic passages discussed (pp. 311–15).</p>
<p>Chapter III supplies tables, notes, and conclusions regarding the literary data from the previous chapter. Observing that the expanded Greek text has many close parallels with texts such as <italic>1 Enoch, Jubilees</italic>, the <italic>Testaments of the 12 Patriarchs</italic>, the <italic>Psalms of Solomon</italic>, and the Septuagintal Book of Wisdom, Kearns proposes that this text-form originates around 75–60 BCE. However, Gilbert’s Introduction notes that the Book of Wisdom is nowadays commonly dated to the first century CE (p. 17), and we could say the same about <italic>1 Enoch</italic> 37–71, and so Kearns’s dating is open to questioning.</p>
<p>Finally, chapter IV proposes that Essene elements are evident in the expanded text of Ben Sira, though this hypothesis needs serious refinement in light of some Qumran documents published since the 1950s. While Kearns posits several stages of development in the Essene movement, he regards the expanded text of Ben Sira as corresponding to Essene circles in 100–70 BCE that (he claims) produced <italic>1 Enoch</italic> 37–71 and also <italic>1 Enoch</italic> 91–105. The impetus for this ‘Essenian recension’ was ‘the need to revise, without re-writing,’ Ben Sira’s book: ‘A series of “glosses”, expansions and additions were interpolated in it, to bring it in line, in those respects where it was now felt to be deficient—“personal” religion, the “new” eschatology—with their distinctive and advanced theology’ (p. 302).</p>
<p>Ironically, Kearns builds his picture of the Essene community from Josephus and Philo, intentionally ignoring the Damascus Document (p. 126) and naturally ignorant of the Qumran texts published after 1951, the year the dissertation was completed. Such an approach is inadequate today, even if scholars have still not come to a full agreement about the historical development of the Essene movement and its relationship to the Qumran texts.</p>
<p>The overall theological interest characterizing Kearns’s thesis is evident in the five main headings under which chapter I examines the expanded text: God and his attributes; God and Israel; God and the soul; the moral life; divine punishment and reward (pp. 62–88). A theological concern also appears in the brief appendix, arguing for the divine inspiration of the added passages as well as of the original text of Ben Sira.</p>
<p>In 2011, the same year as Kearns’s dissertation was finally published, a conference volume appeared taking the discussion further: <italic>The Texts and Versions of the Book of Ben Sira: Transmission and Interpretation</italic>, edited by J. S. Rey and J. Joosten (JSJSup 150; Leiden: Brill, 2011). Two essays in that volume (by J. Gile and J. S. Rey) have questioned whether there actually was a homogeneous expansion of the text of Ben Sira concerned with the afterlife and arising within Essene circles. Nevertheless, the careful gathering of evidence in Kearns’s thesis provides the groundwork for future studies, even if some scholars today evaluate the evidence differently.</p>
<p>Kearns’s significant achievement is to gather and classify many dozens of textual features of the expanded text of Ben Sira, and to observe parallels to other Jewish literature written within a couple of centuries before or after the turn of the era. For instance, the index lists references about 60 passages in <italic>1 Enoch</italic>. Thus, Kearns’s thesis offers a useful presentation of many elements of the textual evidence for the expansions within the Ben Sira tradition, together with an assembling of parallel texts. It is ironic that the most substantial recent monograph on a similar area to Kearns’s thesis also remains unpublished: Thierry Legrand’s 1996 Strasbourg dissertation, ‘Le Siracide: problèmes textuels et théologiques de la récension longue.’</p>
