<abstract>
<p>This article argues for a third transformation in marketing pedagogy, one made necessary by the emergence of subsistence consumers as a high-growth market segment. Continued double-digit growth in buying power and consumption among the world’s poor appear certain, provided that the subsistence merchants serving such markets are effective. Ensuring such effectiveness, however, demands the training of millions of such marketers, which in turn requires the development of pedagogical approaches that take into account their unique capabilities, characteristics, and orientation. The article begins with a brief review of the historical record of transformation in marketing education in response to market changes, and then moves into a detailed description of subsistence merchants and the challenges they present to contemporary marketing education practices. Focus then shifts to the Marketplace Literacy Project (MLP) and its evolving methodologies for teaching marketing to subsistence merchants in India. The article concludes with takeaways from Marketplace Literacy Project’s efforts that are generalizable to other subsistence contexts and serve to inspire marketing educators to devote energy and resources to improving marketing effectiveness among the global poor.</p>

<p>There is agreement among marketing academicians and business experts that market growth in upcoming decades will be primarily in emerging markets, as billions living in subsistence conditions attain increased discretionary income and use it to improve their lives (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475311430802">Davis &amp; Stephenson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311430802">Hammond, Kramer, Katz, Tran, &amp; Walker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475311430802">Hoskisson, Eden, Lau, &amp; Wright, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475311430802">Mahajan &amp; Banga, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475311430802">Prahalad, 2005</xref>). It is also recognized that across product categories, companies depend on the talents and energy of subsistence merchants within this emergent market class to achieve effective marketing strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0273475311430802">Court &amp; Narasimhan, 2010</xref>). Subsistence merchants are people who earn a living from operating microenterprises in sectors such as the production and sale of apparel and food items, retailing produce and low-price packaged goods through neighborhood stores, and home delivery of goods and services within their communities. It is estimated that half of the 4.5 billion global subsistence consumers operate microenterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475311430802">Prahalad, 2005</xref>). That suggests that more than 2 billion of the world’s population are concurrently buyers and sellers of goods and services, and likely commingle those activities in ways that are qualitatively different from how buyers and sellers in nonsubsistence markets behave. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475311430802">Viswanathan, Rosa, and Ruth (2010)</xref>, for example, describe how some consumer merchants plan their daily purchases with the needs of the business and family in mind and adjust how the family will eat at the end of the day depending on their volume of sales that day. Separate inventories for family and business are out of the question for such consumer merchants. These are buyers and sellers whose purchase priorities are concurrently and inextricably informed by wanting to serve customer needs and family nutrition.</p>
<p>Subsistence merchants help companies with the development of products and services that are compatible with the needs and living situations of the poor and also in the design and implementation of distribution, promotion, and pricing approaches that are amenable to local-market characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0273475311430802">Sheth, 2011</xref>). Examples of such collaboration can be found in Unilever’s Shakti program in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0273475311430802">Neath &amp; Sharma, 2008</xref>) and Avon’s 1-million person sales force in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475311430802">Brooke, 1995</xref>). Interesting and unique aspects of how business is conducted in subsistence markets have been documented (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0273475311430802">Khanna, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475311430802">Prahalad, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475311430802">Weidner, Rosa, &amp; Viswanathan, 2010</xref>), and calls for improvement in how companies collaborate with subsistence merchants have been issued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0273475311430802">Viswanathan, Sridharan, Gau, &amp; Ritchie, 2009</xref>). Dramatic change and rapid growth of subsistence markets have led to the conclusion that they “will have a disruptive impact on marketing practice and theory as we know it today” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0273475311430802">Sheth, 2011</xref>, p. 180). Implicit in the unfolding conversation is the need for effectively educating this new class of marketer, with the goal of improved business effectiveness and social welfare. The focus here is on educating subsistence merchants in the name of enhancing their abilities to partner with companies and organizations and better serve their communities. It is recognized that subsistence merchants are concurrently consumers and that some spillover of skills and perspective gained from marketing education is likely to take place between their buyer and seller roles, but the approach to marketing education in subsistence markets advocated here is not intended to meet the educational needs of pure consumers. The latter is a task already being addressed by organizations, such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development of the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation, and the United Nations.</p>
<p>The objectives in this article are threefold. The first is, to point out that based on the marketing field’s history, innovative approaches to effective marketing education in subsistence markets should be expected. Marketing educators are accustomed to aggressive innovation in pursuit of teaching effectiveness when faced with significant demographic shifts and dislocations. This suggests that overcoming any challenges stemming from subsistence market expansion is well within their reach. Teaching marketing skills and concepts to subsistence marketers, however, must take into account differences between traditional students and new ones being reached. The second objective is to highlight valuable insights from the recent development and implementation of innovative approaches to marketing education among the poor, in particular the Marketplace Literacy Project (MLP) in south India. Finally, to summarize takeaway insights from what is known about subsistence merchants and MLP’s experience that may be valuable to marketing educators who want to reach subsistence markets. The overarching goal of the article is to inform and inspire marketing educators to enhance the lives of billions of consumers by helping to improve marketing effectiveness and efficiency in subsistence marketplaces.</p>

<title>Past Transformations in Marketing Education</title>
<p>Applying a historical perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311430802">Petkus, 2010</xref>) to marketing pedagogy makes clear that the field has been highly responsive to technologies such as radio, television, cell phones, the Internet, and social networks. Moreover, it has reinvented itself multiple times on account of economic and demographic events that altered market behaviors and the knowledge needs of the marketing practitioners who served such markets. Historical accounts of changes in marketing practice and thought (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0273475311430802">Bartells, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475311430802">Converse, 1959</xref>) and related disciplines (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475311430802">Chandler, 1959</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475311430802">Lebhar, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475311430802">O’Guinn, Allen, &amp; Semenik, 2002</xref>) suggest that one such transformation took place in the 1920s and 1930s in response to mass media developments (e.g., radio) and significant rural-to-urban migration. Increased product knowledge and mobility among rural consumers brought significant change to physical distribution, retailing practices, mass advertising, and branding, and they forced changes in marketing education. As a result of this first transformation, marketing textbooks and courses were added to university curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475311430802">Converse, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0273475311430802">Ferrell, 1998</xref>), and marketing education became a staple in business schools as the need for more specialized knowledge in companies became acute.</p>
<p>A second wave of change was triggered by a post–World War II generation that was buoyed by optimism and emotionally removed from the Great Depression. Images of a better life enriched by television’s wide reach gave consumers hope and a renewed sense of direction and changed their relationship to products and services. In response to such changes, which again served to render many established marketing theories and approaches ineffectual, marketing, thought leaders and educators, developed and expanded concepts, such as differentiation, segmentation, psychographic profiles, and consumer information processing, and greatly improved the scope and reach of market research. Equally important, marketing pedagogy shifted from an emphasis on practice-informed description to social science–based arguments and models applicable across market contexts. This is the educational milieu in which most readers of this journal were trained and where the field currently functions.</p>
<p>Contemporary marketing pedagogy is a body of knowledge and practice that reflects the evolving realities of developed markets, such as the European Union, Japan, and the United States, given that it is in such commercial contexts that the need for sophisticated marketing practice and accompanying education has been most critical. Its effectiveness unquestioned, current marketing pedagogy nevertheless engenders skills and perspectives that are optimally effective for less than 20% of the global consumer population—the relatively affluent consumers, primarily concentrated in Western societies, who until recently have controlled most global wealth and dominated its consumption markets—what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0273475311430802">Vilfredo Pareto (1927/1971)</xref> would call the economic elite. As we look into the 21st century, however, it is important for the marketing field and educators in particular to turn their attention to the other 80%. Almost one hundred years after Pareto argued that purchasing power and market benefits should be more equitably distributed, globalization and technological breakthroughs have made possible what political arguments could not and have resulted in double-digit growth projections for emerging markets that have captured the attention of companies and governments worldwide.</p>
<p>Marketing educators are comfortable with critical assessments of marketing curricula and practices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311430802">Caterall, Maclaren, &amp; Stevens, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0273475311430802">Peltier, Hay, &amp; Drago, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475311430802">Petkus, 2007</xref>), and such assessments appear necessary today on a grand scale. Similar to the way in which demographic and value shifts in the 20th century forced change in how marketing was taught and practiced, it is necessary for another transformation to take place—one that will enhance the effectiveness of marketing education in subsistence marketplaces.</p>

<title>What Makes Subsistence Markets Different?</title>
<p>As recently argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0273475311430802">Sheth (2011)</xref>, the institutional and economic realities for which current marketing pedagogy is best suited are changing, and it may be time for marketing educators to change as well. More than 4.5 billion subsistence consumers are dispersed throughout the globe, primarily in Africa, Asia, and Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311430802">Hammond et al., 2007</xref>). About 1 billion earn less than $1 per day and another 2 billion earn $2 to $3 per day, but increased participation in the marketplace is a common characteristic of the two segments regardless of where they are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311430802">Hammond et al., 2007</xref>). In spite of inequalities in political and social power that plague subsistence consumers on account of economic duality, globalization, and access to technologies, such as cell phones and the Internet, are elevating the productive and business potential of consumers to unprecedented levels in the developing world. Market forces, technological development, and entrepreneurial fervor have resulted in rising incomes and expanding opportunities; and as a result hundreds of millions of poor consumers are entering the commercial arena in categories as diverse as packaged foods and health and beauty aids, autos, financial services, and entertainment. An additional 1 billion consumers from emerging economies are expected to enter the market for consumable and durable goods and services in the next 10 to 15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475311430802">Davis &amp; Stephenson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, much of this new consumer population thrives in spite of not having access to traditional distribution channels, in part because it is being serviced by millions of subsistence merchants who masterfully blend buying and selling into their daily routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475311430802">Prahalad, 2005</xref>). Subsistence merchants are people who earn a living (typically $2-$3 per day) from operating microenterprises in sectors, such as apparel and food items, the retailing of produce and low-value packaged goods, and home delivery of goods and services. They live in poor neighborhoods alongside their customers, and conduct business on a daily basis to meet subsistence consumer needs. It is estimated that half of subsistence consumers work as subsistence merchants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475311430802">Prahalad, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As markets expand and the complexity of product offerings rises, an understanding of marketing principles and practices is needed by this new cadre of marketers if products and services are to be meaningfully presented and made accessible to this billions-strong consumer segment. In addition, long-term marketing success and consumer welfare demand that subsistence merchants manage their enterprises effectively and responsibly, objectives that are also germane to marketing pedagogy. In wanting consumers to be informed, marketers to be effective, and exchange to be promoted responsibly, emerging markets do not differ from developed markets, and marketing educators can comfortably apply their professional ideals to the high-growth markets of the 21st century. When it comes to how those ideals are pursued by contemporary educational practices, however, some changes are needed.</p>
<p>Because of differences in how subsistence merchants process information, make decisions, and respond to environmental factors, it is likely that contemporary approaches to marketing education will not work in preparing subsistence merchants to serve customers. The balance of this section discusses characteristics of subsistence merchants, such as their lack of functional literacy, their preferences for concrete thinking and reliance on pictographic information, and their short-term planning orientation, all of which can present significant challenges to marketing educators. The characteristics discussed and implications are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475311430802">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Low or Nonexistent Functional Literacy</title>
<p>The fundamental need for marketing knowledge among subsistence merchants is similar to the needs of currently served students. Educational techniques that rely on books and cases, text-rich presentations, technology-rich classrooms, and written assessment tools, however, are not likely to work. One factor that hinders their effectiveness is that between 30% and 50% of subsistence merchants have low or nonexistent basic literacy skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0273475311430802"><italic>The World Factbook</italic>, 2009</xref>), making them functionally illiterate by marketing education standards. Basic literacy involves being able to read simple sentences, such as “Treena went to market” and “Treena bought flowers” and write one’s name, and it is absent among many of the world’s poor. Functional literacy involves having the reading, writing, and numeracy skills required to manage daily life tasks, which in markets such as the European Union, Japan, and the United States, involves getting around in shopping malls, reading store signs, product labels, and instruction manuals, and making decisions based on written product and price information. As self-service shopping environments and packaged goods have entered subsistence markets, the need for such skills has grown among subsistence merchants and their customers.</p>
<p>Consumers having low or nonexistent functional literacy is a hindrance to effective exchange in affluent markets and likely to be an even larger problem in subsistence ones. The United States, for example, reports a 99% basic literacy rate but suffers with a 14% functional illiteracy rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0273475311430802">National Center for Education Statistics, 2003</xref>), and similar deficiencies have been found in other developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475311430802">International Adult Literacy Survey, 1995</xref>). More than 1 in 10 U.S. consumers cannot accomplish simple tasks, such as reading store signs to find the household detergents aisle and the concentrated dish detergent section by reading product labels; nor can they determine if a 20 oz. bottle of detergent for $2 is a better or worse deal than a 10 oz. bottle for $1.50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475311430802">Viswanathan, Rosa, &amp; Harris, 2005</xref>). In addition, being functionally illiterate engenders stigma in the marketplace, which further affects the flow of exchange adversely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475311430802">Adkins &amp; Ozanne, 2005</xref>). It is reasonable to expect that the functional literacy required to navigate self-service store environments and purchase packaged goods is lower in subsistence markets, and the challenges such deficiencies cause are more severe.</p>
<p>To be sure, the reading, writing, and numeracy skills required in hyperrelational subsistence markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al., 2009</xref>) may be less than what is needed in developed markets, but increases in the quantities and varieties of prepackaged products and self-service retail environments in subsistence markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475311430802">Mukherjee &amp; Patel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475311430802">Reardon, Timmer, Barrett, &amp; Berdejue., 2003</xref>) along with increases in financial and telecommunications services (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0273475311430802">Narasimhan, 2011</xref>) are exacerbating the problems caused by the lack of functional literacy. The majority of subsistence merchants cannot read product instructions, package labels, advertising copy, and service contracts, to say nothing of marketing textbooks.</p>
<p>Progress is being made toward improving basic literacy skills globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475311430802">Richmond, Robinson, and Sachs-Israel, 2008</xref>). It is slow, however, as exemplified by a less than 10% improvement in literacy in India between 2001 and 2011 (based on India Census information). Moreover, functional literacy is not the same as basic literacy, and it is safe to argue that being able to read simple sentences or write one’s name does not translate directly into success in the marketplace. The rate at which improvements in basic literacy ultimately lead to improvements in functional literacy is being outstripped by that of marketplace expansion. Packaged products and standardized commercial services are increasingly available in subsistence markets and exchange is being conducted by subsistence merchants who cannot process written information. Marketing pedagogy needs to adjust to this new breed of students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0273475311430802">
<title>Concrete Thinking and Preference for Pictographic Information</title>
<p>Related to low literacy and also likely to affect the ability of subsistence merchants to assimilate traditional marketing concepts and pedagogical approaches are their preferences for concrete thinking and pictographic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311430802">Viswanathan, 2010</xref>). Concrete thinking exists when people rely primarily on sensory information, such as smell and weight, instead of considering abstract assessments, such as reliability and design robustness, when evaluating alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al., 2005</xref>). When subsistence merchants recommend one brand of shampoo over another based on the texture and weight of the plastic bottle, they are applying concrete thinking.</p>
<p>Pictographic information is images typically found in the marketplace, such as package illustrations, brand logos, and package design characteristics. A preference for such information is present when it becomes the only data considered when searching for products and choosing among alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al., 2005</xref>). If merchants encourage customers to purchase Aunt Jemima pancake syrup instead of Mrs. Butterworth because Aunt Jemima looks friendly, instead of on account of product label information that differentiates the products, the behavior involves a preference for pictographic information. This is an understandable preference when reading and writing skills are lacking.</p>
<p>Concrete thinking and pictographic information preferences have been found to affect subsistence consumer merchant decisions and how they conduct business as buyers and sellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al., 2010</xref>), and they should be taken into account by marketing educators who are developing pedagogical approaches for subsistence markets. Reliance on concrete thinking and pictographic information makes it difficult for subsistence merchants to grasp marketing abstractions, such as value, target segments, and brand equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311430802">Viswanathan, Gajendiran, &amp; Venkatesan, 2008</xref>). To overcome concrete thinking, concepts must be analogically connected to tangible outcomes (e.g., value made analogous to a product’s resistance to breakage when dropped). Reliance on pictographic information, in contrast, must be deliberately harnessed by educators to communicate concepts and processes that are normally communicated using words. Using a concentric circles illustration with the customer at the center and business factors as inputs and outputs, for example, makes customer orientation memorable to subsistence merchants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al., 2008</xref>). Developing teaching materials that adjust to concrete thinking and pictographic information preferences (and harness such preferences) demands considerable effort and must be done with care to not exacerbate confusion instead of alleviate it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0273475311430802">
<title>Short-Term Planning Orientation</title>
<p>Also worth noting is the link between concrete thinking and short-term planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475311430802">Luria, 1976</xref>). A short-term planning orientation is present when decision horizons do not extend much more than a day or two, even when a longer horizon is advisable. Spending the equivalent of $10 on a 6-inch color TV instead of saving for a week for a 19-inch model priced at $14 is an example of short-term planning orientation. As discussed earlier, subsistence merchants respond primarily to what can be seen, heard, and otherwise sensed in the environment; and give less credence to sensory-deprived possibilities. Because future decision and consumption scenarios are deprived of sensory information, subsistence merchants tend to discount or ignore them, and they seldom extend their planning horizons beyond a day or two. The only exceptions seem to be scenarios they have experienced personally, such as family weddings and childbirths, for which they plan in advance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Further contributing to a short-term planning orientation are constant threats to survival. Because of having negligible resources and limited mobility, subsistence merchants must spend most of their time and energy securing materials for the next day’s business, and precious little preparing for more distant events. Adding to the problem, many live in unregistered or illegal residences that make them susceptible to forced relocation, which in turn makes it unproductive to plan as if their domicile and accompanying lifestyle are secure. In addition, even those living in legitimate housing are often subject to capricious changes in rent or to evictions in favor of more lucrative tenants. Finally, many subsistence merchants live with the ever-present specter of violent crime and extortion brought on by ethnic discrimination, narcotrafficking, political upheaval, corruption, and greed. Given their circumstances and sensory orientation, the short-term planning tendencies of the poor are chronic and entrenched. They must be overcome by marketing educators, however, since such tendencies hinder the ability of subsistence merchants to grasp marketing concepts, such as relationship marketing and long-term value, and to adopting a strategic orientation.</p>
<p>In summary, the absence of functional literacy, concrete thinking, and pictographic information preferences, and short-term planning orientation, made worse by high levels of uncertainty and inadequate access to basic food and shelter characterize subsistence merchants and the environment in which they operate. These are the conditions for which approaches to teaching marketing skills and concepts must be adapted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0273475311430802">
<title>Relationship Networks</title>
<p>To counter life challenges, subsistence merchants cultivate and sustain multilayered relationship networks involving family and neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475311430802">Ritchie &amp; Sridharan, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al., 2010</xref>). Membership in such networks gives them access to knowledge and shared resources (e.g., tools, money), to say nothing of encouragement, human assistance, and communal resilience, and makes it possible for them to respond more quickly and innovatively to business challenges. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475311430802">Ruth and Hsiung (2007)</xref>, for example, find that among subsistence South Africans, setbacks to a network member’s ability to work are offset by distant family members, who contribute money and effort directly and indirectly (i.e., giving to those who gave) to the resource-depleted household/business. The short-term reallocation of resources across the network helps the subsistence merchant while protecting the well-being of others, so hardship does not overwhelm any single person. Likewise, it is expected that consumer merchants will share windfall gains with other network members, so the benefits from good fortune and business success are also distributed. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al. (2010)</xref> find that although families are the primary beneficiaries of business success, they also serve as buffers for consumer merchants in their day-to-day dealings with vendors and customers. Responsibilities for running the business are often shared by family members, and they are called on to sacrifice when the day’s business is not good. At other times, however, it is vendors and customers who are called on to be loyal when family emergencies hinder the merchant’s ability to serve them. Although membership in relationship networks is influenced by individualist–collectivist cultural values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0273475311430802">Hofstede, 1980</xref>) and individual traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0273475311430802">Triandis, McCusker, &amp; Hui, 1990</xref>), it cannot be solely attributed such factors. Across cultures, the poor use relationships to offset scarcity in other domains, regardless of their cultural orientation.</p>
<p>The family and community interconnectedness of subsistence merchants can be tapped by innovative marketing pedagogy. Knowledge, along with money, moves through the network. Marketing educators can accelerate the dissemination and adoption of marketing concepts and skills by making learning a communal exercise, and by encouraging that marketing knowledge be replicated throughout the network so it is accessible to those who cannot read and write but can communicate orally with one another. Without access to books and other text-based stores of knowledge, having multiple members of the community involved in learning and dissemination can ultimately improve the retrieval and implementation of marketing lessons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0273475311430802">
<title>Different Priorities and Capabilities</title>
<p>One additional characteristic of subsistence merchants is that they hold consumption and service priorities that differ from those of contemporary marketing students. Unable to hold savings account in banks, for example, many subsistence merchants belong to savings circles, develop savings and credit arrangements with local store owners and maintain relationships with local loan sharks in spite of their collection methods and high interest rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0273475311430802">Viswanathan, 2007</xref>). They are also savvy buyers and sellers of jewelry and other products that can be quickly converted to cash as needed, and they maintain flexible and not-always-legal agreements with customers and vendors to make survival possible. In general, subsistence merchants are clever and resourceful.</p>
<p>Complex ideas are not out of their reach, but the ideas are often grasped using concepts and media that are different from what is familiar to marketing educators. Many subsistence merchants, for example, are regular users of wireless devices and the Internet (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475311430802">Weidner et al., 2010</xref>), and they hold knowledge about available products and the lifestyles they make possible that is similar to what would be found in the United States and Europe. Their relationship to such technologies, products, and lifestyle imagery, however, did not develop through the progressions common in developed countries (e.g., from landlines to cell phones to multifunction wireless devices). Many subsistence merchants go from complete ignorance about such possibilities to the stylized representations popularized by television shows and the Internet in a very short time, and hence their understanding of the role of products or the path to realized aspirations differ from that of typical marketing students. It seems safe to argue that the meaning they attach to technologies, products, and lifestyles is also different.</p>
<p>To the extent that current marketing pedagogy assumes a progression of evolved expectations among its constituents when teaching marketing concepts (e.g., the product life cycle), it must be ready for discontinuities in how subsistence students respond to what is offered. Subsistence merchants who cannot read or write are nevertheless able to acquire, use, and appreciate products as sophisticated as iPads, and they may be able to envision business approaches that use such technologies that would not occur to marketers in the United States, Japan, and Europe. The applications of technology that subsistence merchants are likely to develop over the next couple decades will most likely be different, and possibly unorthodox by current marketing standards, but they will nevertheless be suitable to subsistence market realities.</p>
<p>This state of affairs in turn suggests that subsistence merchants will see possibilities that will not occur to marketing educators who are trained in traditional ways. Subsistence merchant capabilities, motivation, and technological access create one significant difference between past transformations in marketing pedagogy and the one currently under way. Instead of having decades in which to respond to population and technology shifts that involved tens of millions of people, modern marketing educators have only a few years in which to make changes and improvements, and they face an affected population 10 times larger. Opportunities abound to revolutionize marketing education and influence the lives of billions in the process, and some educators are already responding.</p>

<title>The Marketplace Literacy Project: Learning by Doing in South India</title>
<p>The MLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al., 2009</xref>) came into existence as a result of research into how subsistence merchants conduct exchange in India (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0273475311430802">Viswanathan &amp; Rosa, 2007</xref>). Having noticed strengths and weaknesses in how subsistence merchant approach exchange, MLP developers sought to build on the merchants’ homespun tactics while enhancing their grasp of sound marketing practices. It quickly became clear that factors such as functional illiteracy, concrete thinking, and short-term planning orientation would have to be overcome in order to make concepts, such as customer orientation, value, and relationship marketing come alive. In response to those challenges, MLP developed an educational program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al., 2008</xref>) that proved effective and is being adapted to digital technologies for more widespread distribution in India.</p>
<p>MLP has developed teaching materials and approaches that are customized to the levels of literacy and interconnectedness of the communities being reached. The balance between pictorial and text information in materials, for example, can vary by Indian state (e.g., Kerala, Tamil Nadu) based on literacy rates. Similarly, among Indian women, who in general have very low literacy skills, the program uses more student-derived pictorial representations to illustrate concepts such as customer orientation (depicted at the center of concentric circles that represent the business enterprise) and value and allows for high levels of verbal interaction among participants. The program also allows students to take control of teaching materials and make changes that enhance their grasp of points being presented. All MLP exposition of marketing concepts is collaborative.</p>
<p>Customization also involves using existing knowledge shared among program participants to make new concepts memorable and useful. Local stories and myths are tapped when possible. Even mystical concepts are used to illustrate enduring and or long-term phenomena (e.g., quality), given that in the domain of religion many subsistence merchants hold longer term perspectives. Participants are also allowed to create their own labels for marketing concepts when it helps them grasp and retain the principles involved. The program is also sensitive to differences in status because of age and other factors when selecting students, creating a balance between respect and empowerment in the classroom that makes the program credible for all participants.</p>
<p>Role-playing is an indispensable tool in the MLP program, given the importance of storytelling, social roles, and the sharing of knowledge through oral means among the poor. As with other MLP factors, however, role-plays are adjusted to the realities of the community being served. If the age and social status of participants will affect the credibility of a role-play exercise, actors are chosen carefully. Likewise, if large-group role-plays are considered inappropriate but dyad or triad role-plays are acceptable, adjustments are made. Within the different role-play executions, common-market experiences, such as errors in pricing or the amount sold, unmet expectations, dissatisfaction, and dishonest behavior, are exemplified. Such role-plays are supplemented by sensemaking circles, where the thoughts and feelings that ensue from such episodes are explored. Marketing educators in these classrooms strive for high levels of trust and cooperation from students and adjust to evolving teaching needs without abandoning their overarching educational objectives. Flexibility is needed even when student group are the same for multiple sessions since life conditions in the community can change significantly from week to week.</p>
<p>Role-plays and the pictorial representations of concepts are important to MLP success for several reasons. First, they concretize marketing concepts by making them come alive in illustrations and situations that are familiar to participants while at the same time helping them see general patterns across circumstances and products that their concrete thinking orientation may otherwise preclude. Second, active discussion and role-play exercises followed by sensemaking circles help participants learn from experience how other parties in an exchange relationship react internally when different situations arise, and it forces them to compare the feelings and reactions of others with their own on the matter.</p>
<p>Seeing their peers learn and multiple roles unfold in controlled and highly animated settings helps to neutralize some of the mental models that subsistence merchants hold about aspects of exchange and other persons. Competitor actions, for example, are no longer seen as personal affronts, but as a natural aspect of marketplace dynamics. Rich experiences alter implicit theories of exchange through the same mechanisms by which such theories were initially developed—marketplace experiences. They also help merchants develop a more sophisticated view of themselves as businesspeople, which in turn empowers them for more effective exchange. Instead of being constrained by gender or social class, some MLP participants have become comfortable with negotiation and compromise, and with challenging preexisting biases and constraints to doing business constructively. This has been particularly true among female participants in MLP programs, who have become more effective in managing their businesses and providing for their families.</p>
<p>Finally, role-play exercises help participants to learn about the power of observation and synthesis as market research tools. Participants are encouraged to develop narratives about what they see unfold in role-play exercises and to share those narratives with family members and friends who are not present at the sessions. MLP educators recognize that in sharing the narratives, subsistence merchants both internalize the lessons learned and build a repository of marketing knowledge that is accessible from family and friends when conducting business. The shared narratives in effect become class notes, albeit not written ones.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that MLP did not pioneer all these practices, some being used and documented in the community development area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475311430802">Chambers, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475311430802">Kar, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475311430802">Kar &amp; Pasteur, 2005</xref>). By using concepts and tools from across multiple pedagogical domains and applying them to subsistence markets explicitly, MLP has developed an effective program for marketing education in the Indian market. More important, its work provides marketing educators with useful insights as they undertake the task of adapting and transforming current marketing pedagogy for other subsistence markets.</p>

<sec id="section9-0273475311430802">
<title>Takeaways for Marketing Pedagogy in Subsistence Markets</title>
<p>Some takeaways for marketing pedagogy arise from studying subsistence merchants and MLP’s efforts to educate them. One is that gaining the knowledge required to develop effective educational approaches is best done through immersion. The pilot MLP program was developed for the south India state of Tamil Nadu and proved effective in that setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0273475311430802">Viswanathan et al., 2009</xref>). As MLP has expanded in India, however, it has adapted its techniques to the communities being served, responding to factors, such as the varying importance of social hierarchy and gender roles to successful market exchange, the dominant religious and secular concepts and themes in the community, and the product categories most often sold by the subsistence merchants being trained. When it comes to the freedoms that married women enjoy, for example, differences exist between Muslim and Hindu communities, and even within religious communities depending on geographic location. In one community, women running their own businesses may only interact with other women, which limits their customer reach but simplifies segmentation. In this particular community, the concept of value was communicated with strong within-gender orientation, all examples and role-plays being developed with this restriction in mind. In communities where women are free to interact with male customers and vendors, in contrast, power differences exist nevertheless, and some of the examples and exercises were designed to help women consumer merchants have more effective business dealings with males without overstepping local gender norms.</p>
<p>MLP achieves some of its local knowledge by partnering with local merchants and community leaders, but it must also have some of its educators spend time in each new community and learn firsthand about similarities and differences from other communities. The behavioral differences caused by religious orientation mentioned above, for example, did not become fully known until educators entered the communities and observed firsthand how business was being conducted. In addition, marketing educators must keep in mind that subsistence markets differ from developed ones, and as discussed earlier, their constituents are likely to acquire and apply knowledge differently.</p>
<p>One interesting instance of such differences arises when negotiating price. In many subsistence markets, price negotiations involve an extended conversation in which the buyer points out flaws in the merchandise and offers exaggerated estimates of how much the asking price should be discounted while the seller responds with hard-to-confirm claims of product superiority. In communities where public arguments and disagreements are not allowed, however, a more likely scenario is for the buyer to offer a price that seems to be accepted by the seller, who in turn reduces the amount of product that the buyer receives. The buyer is free to accept the quantity being offered or to signal in increase in the price he or she is willing to pay, which results in a reassessment of the amount being purchased. In the second scenario, there is no arguing over the value proposition, and disagreements are settled through a montage of polite behaviors. In general, there is no substitute for observing and interacting with subsistence merchants if marketing educators are to appreciate how contemporary practices must be adapted to new contexts. MLP developers have not developed new marketing concepts, but they have thoughtfully adapted the mechanisms by which concepts are communicated and students are encouraged to internalize them.</p>
<p>It should be noted that marketing educators in countries with large subsistence populations, such as India and China, are no further along in their understanding of what is needed to train subsistence merchants than educators in the United States and other economies. Professional norms and how those educators are trained have resulted in most of them thinking of the poor in their countries as nonconsumers, and the merchants who serve them as unimportant. Market developments suggest that such perceptions are wrong, and that it will take the concerted efforts of foreign and domestic marketing educators in partnership with subsistence merchants to ensure that adequate educational tools are developed.</p>
<p>The number and diversity in opportunities for marketing educators to gain firsthand knowledge of subsistence markets is increasing. Fulbright commissions in the United States and other countries are expanding their programs and making it possible to have short-term assignments in developing countries for larger numbers of marketing scholars. In addition, the number of universities with international partnerships is growing, and programs for faculty development in global awareness are expanding. Being able to learn through immersion is more and more possible for marketing educators, and engaging in such learning can be highly fruitful.</p>
<p>A second takeaway is on the importance of engaging subsistence merchants in the development of approaches to education. Participatory action methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475311430802">Chambers, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0273475311430802">Ozanne &amp; Saatcioglu, 2008</xref>) have a proven track record in developing a valuable understanding and effective solutions to a myriad of problems in subsistence markets, and should have a central role as the field seeks to serve this student segment. As illustrated by MLP’s example, subsistence merchants can help bridge gaps in communication and perspective between marketing educators and their subsistence trainees by developing a more nuanced articulation of important concepts, teaching techniques that resonate with students, and presentation materials that make concepts accessible and memorable. Such participation also helps subsistence collaborators, because seeing their insights and contributions reflected back to them by respected educators raises the credibility of the experience.</p>
<p>Engaging subsistence merchants in developing teaching materials is different from actively soliciting feedback from students. When teaching in the United States and Europe, shared cultural backgrounds and consumption histories makes it easy to grasp what students mean when they offer suggestions for improving lecture materials or incorporating more social networking into the class experience. As discussed earlier, however, subsistence merchants process information and attach meaning to concepts and technologies differently from affluent students in developed markets, a condition that neutralizes much of the tacit knowledge about students held by marketing educators. The MLP experience suggests that immersion and awareness can help marketing educators overcome such deficiencies and even enhance their understanding of what makes marketing work.</p>
<p>A third takeaway is to rethink how technology can and should be used in teaching marketing. Subsistence merchants have significant access to wireless and Internet technologies, sometimes surpassing what is available in the United States and Europe in terms of cost and flexibility. Streaming video, pictorial interfaces, gaming, and audio delivery methods that overcome low literacy are known technologies already being used by forward-thinking companies and service providers to reach subsistence markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475311430802">Weidner et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, it stands to reason that how subsistence merchants relate to such technologies is different from how traditional students relate to them. Pictorial and audio information, for example, is likely to take precedence over the written word; and because such information engages different modes of learning and areas of the mind, it may cause student grasp of what is being communicated to differ. Another factor to consider is the importance of conversation in making sense of new information and retaining it. Both these factors were considered by MLP developers in India, and they are being reconsidered as MLP endeavors to accelerate its reach through Internet and digitized cinema technologies. Similar thinking is needed among marketing educators who are serving other subsistence contexts. In each context, it is important to assess the role of pictorial and audio information in learning relative to written materials, as well as how much of the learning and retention takes place through social interaction. Both these assessments can be done through observation and should not be costly. A third assessment worth making is how quickly the technologies in use are changing. The pace of change in communication technologies can vary between countries based on government policies, regulations, and established infrastructure, suggesting that the shelf life of any pedagogical tool can vary depending on the context involved. One possible strategy for addressing fast-changing technologies is to use standardized platforms (e.g., iTunes, YouTube, and Android), and design educational modules that can be implemented across platforms. Fortunately, contemporary marketing educators are already adjusting to new technologies, such as podcasting, streaming video, social networks, and the wireless Internet, suggesting that making similar allowances for subsistence markets should not be difficult to implement.</p>
<p>One final takeaway is to embrace experimentation as integral to pedagogy in subsistence markets for the foreseeable future, not unlike how highly innovative companies are known to function in fast-changing markets (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475311430802">Hargadon &amp; Sutton, 1997</xref>). Companies that bring to life truly innovative technologies and products create organizational cultures and work environments where no idea is too far-fetched, and where rapid prototyping and experimentation are encouraged to better explore what developers envision in their creative fervor. Employees in such companies are encouraged to adopt a playful approach and at the same time be passionate about new ideas and ready to abandon them quickly when circumstances make it necessary. Such companies recognize that settling on concepts and approaches prematurely or too rigidly, particularly when markets are changing rapidly, often proves detrimental to the development of successful products.</p>
<p>The situation facing marketing educators in subsistence markets is not much different, suggesting that playfulness and rapid experimentation should be embraced alongside a commitment to helping the poor. As discussed earlier, subsistence markets are growing and their purchasing power is expanding. They are becoming a more significant force in the global economy and forcing significant changes in long-established markets and economies. The progress is not linear, however, since such growth is also forcing internal changes and dislocations within subsistence markets across societal, community, family, and individual levels. Marketing pedagogy can neither afford to wait until change becomes predictable nor to anchor too soon on new approaches and assume they will remain viable. The speed at which subsistence markets are changing is directly connected to the rate at which needs and opportunities for marketing pedagogy are growing. Because the marketing field’s understanding of subsistence merchants is limited and their needs are a moving target, it seems best to experiment often and learn from both the successes and failures that are likely to ensue. Marketing educators, in other words, need to practice what they have been teaching.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0273475311430802">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>There is no question that subsistence merchants relate to exchange and the business world differently from traditional marketing students. Functional illiteracy, concrete thinking, reliance on pictorial representations, rich social networks, and acute constraints are among the factors that affect how subsistence merchants process information and make decisions and lead them to different assessments of market interactions and opportunities. Differences aside, they display a desire to understand how markets operate that is inspiring, and they are hungry to be taught how to market what they produce and engage markets in safe and profitable ways. The fact that traditional pedagogical approaches may not be effective with subsistence merchants should not deter the field’s commitment to being involved in their development. Progress in educating subsistence merchants is being made, and what has been achieved to date is exciting. In the same way that rural migration and the post–World War II generation forced radical change in marketing pedagogy, subsistence consumers are demanding that marketing educators respond with viable solutions. Those who develop such solutions stand to make perhaps even greater contributions to the field.</p>
