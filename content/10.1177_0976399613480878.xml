<p><italic>Millennial Asia: An International Journal of Asian Studies</italic> has completed three years of its vibrant existence by now with three volumes comprising six issues. It has been a great experience for all of us from AAS involved in this journey which started way back in 2003 with the conceptualization of the idea of a journal on Asian studies from an Asian perspective and running it from AAS resources for three years with very little professional and technical support. We covered a range of topics from across the Asian region both country specific as well as regional and comparative, including a special issue on changing agriculture and agribusiness in Asia, in the previous issues of the journal.</p>
<p>We are happy to place in your hands this first issue of the fourth year, published by SAGE which has taken responsibility of publishing and disseminating the journal across the globe. We have had very varied and significant contributions from across the globe to give this journal the place it has acquired for itself by now within a short span of three years. We have also expanded the editorial advisory board of the journal with a view to involve most interested scholars and reputed policy makers from across the scholarship on Asia, in the process of understanding Asia from an Asian perspective and to encourage and bring quality research from all over Asia into the journal and to the readers to facilitate learning and exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>As in the past, this issue also carries a range of contributions encompassing health, family planning, trade dynamics, government policy making and political conflicts, from eminent scholars and researchers from different fields. Krishna and Ananthpur dwell upon the issue of spatial health disparities in rural India in the context of globalization and privatization of health care. They find that while the Indian economy has been growing, there is increase in poverty in villages distant from the towns and the cities, leading to accentuation of various health problems. They conclude that globalization privileges cities and disadvantages distant villages. They argue for public policy measures to reduce health inequalities between urban India and rural India. Another paper on health issues examines the performance of a family planning programme in the Philippines as an investment in human capital. Lanzona finds that it is better to integrate such programmes with the other programmes targeted at development of women as productive entities to enhance their effectiveness and argues that such health programmes can also be used as anti-poverty measures to build human capital and raise earning capacities of citizens, especially women.</p>
<p>Basu discusses the role of economic theory in policy making based on his stint with the Government of India recently and argues that it is a society’s ideas and beliefs that is ultimately responsible for its development. The absence of good, scientific ideas proves to be the biggest stumbling block in crafting good policies. He uses examples from inflation and monetary and fiscal policy interventions, labour regulatory reforms and foodgrain production and distribution. He is of the view that mainstream economics research has paid too little attention to social and cultural prerequisites of development.</p>
<p>Trade and development cannot be separated in a globalizing world. Carolan, Mora and Singh discuss the East Asian (EA) miracle in this context with time series data on USA–EA commodity trade for three decades and find that trade pattern changes at the industry level, especially clothing and electronics, did contribute to the growth miracle of East Asia. They appeal for more research on the changed trade context of the region.</p>
<p>Political stability is must for economic growth and development in any region or country or sector. In this tradition, Mustafa examines determinants and implications of major conflicts in Pakistan and finds that Pakistan is faced with multiple conflicts that have different localized, regional and global causes. The major conflicts originated due to geo-political, sectarianism (Shia and Sunni Sects), local/religious (Mafia and groups), nationalistic reasons and ethnic/street crimes. The major causes exist at the national level in the form of poor governance, unstable political environment, weak democratic institutions, continuing and increasing polarization amongst the provinces and the different ethnic and minority groups.</p>
<p>We hope that this issue of the journal will be of even greater interest among the existing readership of the journal and attract new readers as well. We welcome any suggestions for making the journal more useful to the academic and the policy making community.</p>
