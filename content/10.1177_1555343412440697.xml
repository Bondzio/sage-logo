<abstract>
<p>New social networking and social web tools are becoming available and are easing the process of customizing online social environments for enterprises. With these developments, core design efforts have been extending beyond usability for individual users and are beginning to include notions of sociability for the engagement of communities of users. In an effort to make it easier to design for social engagement in an online social environment, the authors developed a domain-community model based on the communities-of-practice concept and the work domain analysis used in cognitive work analysis. Through a case study of University-Community Partnerships for Social Action Research, an international development leadership community of practice, the authors illustrate how the domain-community model could be used to design web components of an online social environment that integrate internal issues of social engagement and external issues of domain effectiveness. It is expected that this model can provide a basis for designers of online communities to more systematically account for social phenomena of collective efforts in a given work domain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>W<sc>ith the emergence of social networking and social web technologies, we</sc> are seeing a dramatic shift in the way enterprise information technologies are being designed. Ready-to-use social web services and social networking platforms have offloaded much of the low-level coding work and are allowing designers to easily create customized online social environments. Designers of these systems are looking at more than the visual look and feel, or usability, and are considering the “sociability” of design that can facilitate meaningful exchanges and help build knowledge and practices among communities of users. With these challenges, there is a call for a new set of analytical tools that consider the forces that support social engagement and community development. These analytical tools will provide guidance to a new generation of interface designers, who are going beyond designing for single users to designing interfaces that engage and empower entire communities of users.</p>
<p>With this mission in mind, we explore the use of the communities-of-practice (CoPs) concept as developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412440697">Wenger (1998</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger, McDermott, and Snyder (2002)</xref> as a way to consider the process of social learning in knowledge-intensive online work environments. Although not immediately suited for the purpose of interface design, the CoPs concept is explored in conjunction with cognitive work analysis (CWA) as way to provide a practical perspective on social learning within individuals and groups that can lead to a well-informed interface design approach for applying social networking and other networked information communication technologies. This effort is part of a longer-term goal of developing a work analysis approach that can model and support a range of social phenomena alongside the requirements of the individual.</p>
<p>In this article, we discuss the CoPs concept and how it offers a lens for understanding the nature of social engagement. We show how the CoPs concept and CWA can be used together to consider <italic>domain</italic> and <italic>community</italic> aspects of an online environment in an effort to support social engagement. Finally, we present a case study in which we analyze an online international development community, called University-Community Partnerships for Social Action Research (UCP-SARnet), to redesign the interface of its social networking portal. From this analysis, we hope to show the value of linking the CoPs concept with the CWA as a basis for design that supports social engagement in a knowledge-intensive community, such as UCP-SARnet.</p>
<sec id="section2-1555343412440697">
<title>CoPs Background</title>
<p>The following is a common definition of CoPs:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basis. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>, p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>CoPs stem from the seminal work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555343412440697">Lave and Wenger (1991)</xref> in situated learning and from developments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412440697">Suchman (1987)</xref> in situated action. The CoPs concept has been applied in a variety of domains, including knowledge management and management consulting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>), human resources management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555343412440697">Stahl &amp; Björkman, 2006</xref>), organizational learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555343412440697">King, 2009</xref>), and pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555343412440697">Kimble, Hildreth, &amp; Bourdon, 2008</xref>). In these domains, CoPs help people understand how tacit knowledge may be accessed and employed through formal and informal social learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412440697">Brown &amp; Duguid, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555343412440697">Hara, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555343412440697">Hildreth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412440697">McNichols, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555343412440697">Preece, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412440697">Saint-Onge &amp; Wallace, 2003</xref>). The approach has been used to inform design strategies for online communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555343412440697">Hildreth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555343412440697">Karacapilidis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555343412440697">Preece, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412440697">Stuckey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412440697">Wenger, White, &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>) and could be connected to larger systems design approaches, such as CWA.</p>
<p>There are many examples of COPs. For instance, urban construction workers share a concern for the workmanship and coordination of a large-scale building project, and the workers develop communication practices, techniques, and informal etiquette as they interact from day to day. New parents organize weekly meet-ups with other parents, sharing stories of the highs and lows as well as practical tips and tricks of caring for their children. Hobbyist astronomers meet online to characterize newfound galaxy formations discovered by deep-space telescopes and, through numerous online interactions with other hobbyists, develop a granular awareness of the features of these formations. From these examples, it should be clear that COPs exist all around us and that the CoPs concept does not necessarily describe a formal group of individuals. We are each part of multiple COPs as we engage in our daily lives.</p>
<p>It could be argued that the uptake of the notion of CoPs in theory and in practice is, in part, attributable to a critically important assumption it makes about the process of learning. In contrast to behaviorist learning theories, which hold the metaphor of “learning as acquisition,” CoPs and social learning theory hold the metaphor of “learning as participation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555343412440697">Fuller, 2007</xref>). Instead of seeing the challenge of supporting learning as shaping the content material and the individual learner, with CoPs, one views the support of learning as shaping a meaningful social context and structures for participation. This distinction is critical for the full appreciation of the CoPs concept. Rather than focusing on content, the CoPs concept suggests focusing on building context and structure for participation that facilitates ongoing meaningful learning experiences for groups of individuals.</p>
<p>For clarity, in this article, <italic>CoPs</italic> will be used to represent the communities-of-practice concept, and <italic>COP</italic> will be used to represent a specific instance of communities of practice.</p>

<title>Modeling CoPs</title>
<p>To make sound design interventions to support COPs, it was an interest to develop an operational model of CoPs. Work domain analysis (WDA), within CWA, provides designers with a way to map relationships between components in complex systems that is well suited to model a COP as a system. In this article, we show how the WDA can be used to map together the functional components of a COP. The WDA template for CoPs that was developed represents both (a) an exterior view of how a COP provides value in its greater context and (b) an interior view of how members of the COP “negotiate meaning.”</p>
<p>In the next section, the negotiation-of-meaning concept will be explained, which helps to provide an understanding of the operating principles of CoPs as they are modeled in the WDA. Following this explanation, a general structure of CoPs is explained, which provides a background to the interior and exterior dimensions of CoPs also modeled in the WDA. Finally, the concept of a CoPs life cycle analysis is briefly described as a way to build a WDA model for a specific COP in the process of design. This discussion leads to the case study, which illustrates how a WDA model was used in the process of designing the UCP-SARnet social networking portal.</p>
<sec id="section4-1555343412440697">
<title>The Negotiation of Meaning</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412440697">Wenger (1998</xref>, chap. 1) explains that for an individual, the negotiation of meaning is a process that is always being undertaken. In all situations, individuals “produce meanings that extend, redirect, dismiss, reinterpret, modify or confirm—in a word, negotiate anew—the histories of meanings of which they are part” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412440697">Wenger, 1998</xref>, p. 52). In this way, <italic>negotiation</italic> is meant to convey both the sense of the word as in “to negotiate a price between two people” but also an action that requires continuous focus and adjustment, as in “negotiating a hiking trail” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412440697">Wenger, 1998</xref>, chap. 1). In both of these senses, the negotiation of meaning takes place through an interplay of the internal experience living in the world and external forms we ascribe to the world, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412440697">Wenger (1998</xref>, chap. 1) refers to as a duality of participation and reification, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1555343412440697">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1555343412440697-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p><italic>Reification</italic>, as it relates to the negotiation of meaning, is “the process of giving form to our experience by producing objects that congeal this experience into ‘thingness.’ In so doing we create points of focus around which the negotiation of meaning becomes organized” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412440697">Wenger, 1998</xref>, p. 58). For example, in CWA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412440697">Vicente (1999)</xref> reified the idea of “supporting adaptive work” to create a focus for the reader and practitioner so that he or she may develop implications and principles for design around that idea. The range of processes of reification include “making, designing, representing, naming, encoding, and describing, as well as perceiving, interpreting, using, reusing, decoding and recasting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412440697">Wenger 1998</xref>, p. 59).</p>
<p>Although many reified constructs may seem to have meaning in and of themselves, in fact, they must be complemented with participation to contextualize the meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412440697">Wenger, 1998</xref>, chap. 1). In the negotiation of meaning, <italic>participation</italic> takes the common-usage definition: “to have or take a part or share with others (in some activity, enterprise, etc.)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555343412440697">Merriam-Webster Online, 2009</xref>). Participation is an ongoing process. It considers both personal membership in a community and involvement in social endeavors in a way that “combines doing talking, thinking, feeling and belonging, . . . [while involving] our whole person, including our bodies, minds, emotions and social relations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412440697">Wenger, 1998</xref>, p. 56). Participation does not denote only harmonious relations and can include conflicting ones as well.</p>
<p>As a group of people undergo the negotiation of meaning together through some endeavor over time, they build a collection of reified constructs and processes for participation as <italic>shared practices.</italic> In this way, the negotiation of meaning is a fundamental process by which COPs form. That said, the negotiation of meaning at the group level gives rise to greater social dynamics. It is suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412440697">Wenger (1998</xref>, chap. 10) that the general aim when designing for the negotiation of meaning at the group level is to build appropriate structures for alignment, engagement, and imagination, and doing so requires consideration of not just the balance of participation and reification but also the balance of the designed and the emergent, identification and negotiability, and the local and the global. A full exposition of these balances and priorities is beyond the scope of this work, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412440697">Wenger (1998</xref>, chap. 10) is recommended for more detail. It is enough to know that these balances and priorities provide the fundamental operating principles of a COP for the purpose of modeling CoPs in the WDA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1555343412440697">
<title>CoPs Structural Model</title>
<p>The negotiation-of-meaning concept provides a foundation for understanding the nature of COPs and how they form. To capture the range of forms COPs take, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al. (2002</xref>, chap. 2) provide a structural model of COPs comprising three dimensions: domain, community, and practice. To this model, we add a complement to the practice dimension: processes. These dimensions help to distinguish the interior and exterior of a COP and lay the basis for the domain-community WDA model developed in the next section.</p>
<p>The <italic>domain</italic> dimension represents the joint enterprises that motivate a COP and provide value in the exterior context of the COP. It is the common ground inspiring the participation of members; it motivates member learning and is the context that gives meaning to member actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>, chap. 2). The domain includes the leading challenges and open questions negotiated by COP members. The domain is often characterized by purposes, missions, values, propositions, and goals of the COP and represents the technical realities of the work domain that a COP must master.</p>
<p><italic>Community</italic> represents the quality of social engagement in the interior of the COP that is developed in pursuit of the joint enterprises of the domain. The community dimension is the “social fabric of learning” and supports interactions and a willingness to share experience and ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>, chap. 2). The community dimension captures the sense of belonging and can be characterized by notions such as interpersonal commitment, acceptance, curiosity, loyalty, care, trust, empathy, and resilience. It is through the quality of social engagement that members of a COP are able to negotiate meaning together.</p>
<p><italic>Practice</italic> is a more tangible dimension of the CoPs model. Practice represents the shared repertoire of practice elements, such as competencies, tools, technologies, instruments, artifacts, styles of discourse, routine actions, ontologies, and points of reference, through which members of the COP engage to address issues in their domain. The shared repertoire of elements in a COP’s practice functions to (a) support the quality of social engagement between members while (b) allowing the COP to effectively sense and respond to situations in its domain. The practice dimension is sometimes referred to as a COP’s knowledge base and is part of the interior dimension of the CoPs structural model.</p>
<p>Beyond what is suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al. (2002</xref>), it is useful to consider <italic>processes</italic> as a technical analog to practices in the exterior dimension of the CoPs structural model. In the structural model, processes are used to represent the ways practices translate to the activities that function to serve the technical purpose defined in the domain of the COP.</p>
<p>Designing for a COP requires an account of each dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>, p. 45). With respect to each dimensions, a designer may ask the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1555343412440697" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Domain</italic>: How does the COP provide value in the greater context?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Community</italic>: What are the systems for negotiating meaning that deeply engage members with other members and increase the COP’s ability to collectively sense, adapt, and respond to changing conditions in the COP’s domain?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Practices/Processes</italic>: Do the practices and processes in place effectively, efficiently, and elegantly integrate activities of the domain and community dimensions?</p></list-item>

<title>Domain-Community WDA</title>
<p>Bringing the operating principles of the negotiation of meaning and the structural model of CoPs together, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1555343412440697">Figure 2</xref> shows a template of a WDA model of a COP. Typically, the WDA describes functional components of a working system or subsystem at varying levels of abstraction, from the concrete physical objects up to the abstract functional purpose of the system at the top. When used as a basis for design, a WDA helps designers find ways to support system operators with dynamic information at the appropriate levels of abstraction for control situations with varying levels of complexity.</p>

</fig>
<p>In applying the WDA to provide a systems description of a COP, the authors distinguish domain and community perspectives in a single domain-community WDA, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1555343412440697">Figure 2</xref>. In a domain-community WDA, the domain is treated from a technical perspective as how value is being achieved in the greater context of the COP. The community aspect of the WDA is treated from a social perspective as how meaning is being negotiated in the COP. The domain and the community systems work in tandem, and the highest functioning COPs are effective at supporting both.</p>
<p>The domain dimension, which is more technical in nature, maps closely to the kind of work structure that is typically considered in a WDA, whereas the community dimension is an element not often modeled in a WDA. Some WDA models have been developed to consider concepts like CoPs, such as with the notion of “object worlds” developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412440697">Rasmussen, Pejtersen, and Goodstein (1994</xref>, p. 179). However, this previous work tends to model knowledge and social arrangement as static elements of the system, which can be a constraining assumption when looking at more dynamic and growing COPs. In the domain-community WDA, this constraint is addressed by modeling the community dimension as the conditions for learning or how knowledge and social arrangements adapt to changing conditions in the COP’s domain.</p>
<p>Down the WDA in both dimensions, there are differences and relationships between the layers, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1555343412440697">Figure 3</xref>. On the domain side, there is emphasis on balancing value and priority measures for optimal system performance with respect to a functional purpose in the external context. On the community side, these values and priority measures are, most generally, balancing the trade-offs and priorities for the negotiation of meaning to support a desired state of learning community. As mentioned previously, the trade-offs are participation and reification, identification and negotiability, the designed and the emergent, and the local and the global; the priorities are to increase imagination, alignment, and engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412440697">Wenger, 1998</xref>, chap. 10). On both the domain and community sides, this level of the WDA defines the basic nature of the system.</p>

</fig>
<p>At a level lower on the domain side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1555343412440697">Figure 3</xref>, the processes describe those activities that the sociotechnical system must employ to accomplish its purpose. On the community side, the practices level describes the ways in which members engage with one another to share knowledge, improve the quality of relationships, and make meaning of changing conditions in the domain. At the bottom of the WDA are the fundamental components of a COP, which include people, relationships, projects, and events. These components are drawn on both sides to show that the objects at this level would be common to both sides of the work domain.</p>
<p>What the domain-community WDA provides is a way to see how a COP may function internally and externally so that interface designers may provide the affordances to monitor processes related to the external context as well as affordances for engaging in practices that support the negotiation of meaning. Although there is no set procedure to developing a domain-community WDA, the authors consider how the CoPs life cycle stages, as developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al. (2002</xref>), can provide some guidance in this process.</p>

<title>CoPs Life Cycle</title>
<p>COPs naturally change as time passes, developing stronger and broader repertoire of practices, taking on new members, and seeing members depart. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al.

For the purpose of building the domain-community WDA for UCP-SARnet, we used a life cycle analysis based on the five stages of COP maturity outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al. (2002</xref>, p. 68): potential, coalescing, maturing, stewardship, and transformation. In each of these stages, there are practices recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al. (2002</xref>, chap. 4 and 5) that can be employed by the COP to sustain itself in the stage or grow into the more advanced stages. In this work, these life cycle stages are used to define the desired state of the learning community and the practices levels of the domain-community WDA.</p>

<title>Case Study: The UCP-SARnet Social Networking Portal</title>
<p>The following case study provides an illustration of how the domain-community WDA concepts were used to inform the design of the UCP-SARnet social networking portal.</p>
<p>Officially launched in 2008, the UCP-SARnet is an organization based at Arizona State University with a mission to “educate, engage, and empower communities” by facilitating global partnerships between universities, local governments, and community organizations.</p>
<p>UCP-SARnet maintains a partnership with 42 organizational partners and has 971 members, including university students, university faculty, community activists, and members of local government. These partnerships are aimed at creating new opportunities for joint action toward the realization of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Seven volunteer “regional coordinators,” located in Argentina, Australia, Ghana, India, Nigeria, Poland, and South Africa, act as ambassadors for UCP-SARnet, facilitating collaborations between local community organizations, universities, and governments in efforts toward achieving the MDGs. The partners, members, and regional coordinators, led by an executive team of 43 volunteers, work together to organize events promoting the MDGs, source new strategic partnerships, and contribute directly to MDG-related projects.</p>
<p>To support its distributed activities, UCP-SARnet does much of its work through an online social networking portal powered by IGLOO Software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555343412440697">IGLOO, 2011</xref>). The IGLOO platform is a software-as-a-service (SAAS) system and provides a suite of features, including member profiles, blogging, discussion forums, wikis, calendars, document sharing, status updates, and e-mail notifications.</p>
<p>In July 2010, UCP-SARnet began an effort to revamp its social networking portal on the IGLOO platform with the broad goal of making it “more attractive and alive.” From July through December, the first author, a designer from the Advanced Interface Design Lab at the University of Waterloo, worked with UCP-SARnet to redesign the portal. Working with the IGLOO SAAS system, the challenge of the design was in determining how to employ and arrange the features already available, such as blogs, calendar events, and recent activity. This challenge is representative of the kinds of interface design challenges for COPs, as it is becoming rare that a communications and social networking system is designed from scratch.</p>
<sec id="section9-1555343412440697">
<title>Website Design Approach</title>
<p>Redesign of the UCP-SARnet website took a three-stage approach, including planning, information gathering, and development.</p>
<p>The planning and information-gathering phases worked in a cycle. In this phase, the designer attended meetings with the UCP-SARnet COP, held conversations with prominent members of the COP, and met regularly with the main network facilitator. Planning included determining how the designer would work with UCP-SARnet on an ongoing basis to gather the information for the online portal. Planning and information gathering was a cycle because uncovering new information had the potential to reveal new areas of investigation, which in turn would require some adjustments in the planning.</p>
<p>As a part of the information-gathering phase, the designer worked closely with the CoPs life cycle stages as developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al. (2002</xref>, chap. 4 and 5). There is not a recommended process for conducting a life cycle analysis of this nature. As such, to conduct the analysis, the designer compared observations of the activities of UCP-SARnet with the characteristics of the COP life cycle stages indicated by Wenger et al. Using the results of the lifecycle analysis, as well as items stated as priorities in the UCP-SARnet year-end goal setting process, the designer assembled the domain-community WDA for UCP-SARnet.</p>
<p>In the development phase, the designer considered how the website components offered by the IGLOO website platform could be used to support the elements of the domain-community WDA developed for UCP-SARnet. Low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes of the website were presented to the network facilitator and other prominent members of UCP-SARnet for feedback. After coming to agreement in the high-fidelity prototype, the designer made corresponding changes to the live UCP-SARnet website.</p>
<p>The following sections outline the UCP-SARnet domain-community WDA developed and the design concepts used in the redesigned UCP-SARnet website.</p>

<title>The UCP-SARnet Domain-Community WDA Model</title>
<p>To design the new UCP-SARnet portal, a domain-community WDA was developed to provide a picture of UCP-SARnet as a COP. This model of UCP-SARnet was then used a basis for the design concepts and features in the new UCP-SARnet portal.</p>
<p>Directly serving UCP-SARnet’s challenges in the external context of international development was not part of the scope of the service, so the domain dimension of the WDA was not given focus for design decisions. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412440697">Table 1</xref>, the domain for UCP-SARnet is presented to illustrate its relationship to the community dimension.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>On the community side of the WDA for UCP-SARnet, the following needs were determined:</p>
<list id="list2-1555343412440697" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Desired state of the learning community</italic>: On the basis of the CoPs life cycle analysis, it was determined that UCP-SARnet was moving from the coalescing stage to the maturing stage, and the desired state of the learning context comprised general agreement on the role of UCP-SARnet in relation to the MDG efforts at large, strength in member relationships that would allow members to actively discuss different perspectives with respect to the UCP-SARnet’s practices and role toward the MDGs, and established skills in determining what knowledge is useful to share and how.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Priorities and trade-offs of the negotiation of meaning</italic>: As mentioned, the trade-offs of identification and negotiability, the designed and the emergent, participation and reification, and the local and the global define the design space, within which facilities for alignment, engagement, and imagination are priorities. Although the analytical tools have not matured to measure and monitor these elements of the negotiation of meaning, this level provides a helpful representation of the general nature of the community dimension and how it differs from the nature of the domain dimension. As an illustration, in the case of UCP-SARnet, it was determined that the COP was at a stage of development whereby trading off reification-leaning activity for participation-leaning activity was going to best serve alignment, engagement, and imagination of UCP-SARnet. In part, this determination was behind a decision to focus the design on transient kinds of communication features, such as blogging, rather than static communication features, such as a wiki. There is still much to explore about these relationships at this level of the WDA, and the permanence of communication features will be given more treatment in future work.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Practices</italic>: Given UCP-SARnet’s current life cycle stage, several general practices, as adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al. (2002</xref>, chap. 5), were determined that would encourage development toward the desired state of the learning community. These practices were building connections between the core participants, identifying opportunities to provide value in the larger context, finding the ideas and insights that are worth sharing with other members, identifying gaps in the knowledge, and refining the COP’s role in the larger context.</p></list-item>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412440697">Table 2</xref> describes how social networking features were employed to meet the requirements specified by the community side of the WDA. The Components column lists the prominent features designed into the UCP-SARnet website. The Design Concept column describes the intended function of the design component, and the Community Support column describes how that function connects to the requirements of the community side of the WDA and at what level of abstraction. The domain is also supported by these design elements but is not discussed.</p>
<p>The general rationale in the design of the UCP-SARnet website was to give the content some level of impermanence, as blogs and comments would eventually be pushed off the bottom of the communication streams. This design is a contrast to highly permanent-natured web components, such as wikis or static content pages. It was in this sense that the designer traded off reification for participation by allowing members to put out new ideas without feeling like it was going to be a long-term element in UCP-SARnet’s content repertoire. At UCP-SARnet’s current level of maturity, this trade-off was appropriate as a way to increase alignment, engagement, and imagination.</p>
<p>The focus of the design was to provide a medium where practices could emerge. As such, in the design of the UCP-SARnet website, there was not a one-to-one relationship between the features deployed and the practices they were intended to encourage. For instance, it was decided that the Members Area blog be designed as a more open medium in such a way that it could support all of the practices outlined in the community dimension. It is possible that as the practices emerge, the designer may provide facilities to enhance them. (Throughout of the scope of the article, it was in this sense that the designer traded off the benefits of structured <italic>design</italic> for allowing <italic>emergence</italic> of how members wished to use the blog).</p>
<p>Similar kinds of design choices could be made in the trade-offs of local and global, as well as identification and negotiability, but were outside of the scope of this design effort. However, we hope that this provides some sense of how the priorities and trade-offs of the negotiation of meaning might be considered more thoroughly in future work.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412440697">Table 2</xref>, the reader will notice several references to elements of UCP-SARnet’s domain, which is consistent with the domain-community WDA. Whereas the domain dimension is concerned with what UCP-SARnet does in the external context, the community dimension is concerned with how the members of UCP-SARnet relate to or make sense of what it does. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412440697">Table 1</xref> describes how some components of the UCP-SARnet website help members relate to what UCP-SARnet does in the external context so that they may be better able to come to alignment on its specific role.</p>
<p>In sum, the design effort for UCP-SARnet was aimed to support the community dimension of UCP-SARnet. We believe that that the new design of the UCP-SARnet website significantly enhances the UCP-SARnet COP’s ability to make meaning of what it does, which includes its relationship to its domain. As such, although social engagement is an element of the community dimension, we suggest that supporting it requires a broad analysis that distinguishes the domain and community systems.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This work is intended to offer a basis for investigating useful relationships between theories of sociology and systems design for the purpose of improving design methods for virtual social environments. Looking specifically at CoPs and CWA, we show how these two approaches can be integrated in a complementary way. In particular, the CoPs concept complements CWA by helping the analyst develop meaningful analyses in environments that are governed predominantly by social and community goals. CWA complements CoPs by providing a design framework that can allow the principles at the foundation of CoPs to be connected to design interventions. That said, this work is a first exploration into these areas and has its limitations.</p>
<p>First, there has been a significant amount of material developed around the CoPs model beyond what was presented here that could provide more resolution in the design analysis. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555343412440697">Iriberri and Leroy (2009)</xref> provide some perspective on the cyclical nature of community with a metastudy on success factors for online community through life cycle stages, which could complement the CoPs life cycle stages developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al. (2002</xref>). Other helpful CoPs-related concepts include CoPs topologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412440697">Dubé, Bourhis, &amp; Jacob, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412440697">Hara, Shachaf, &amp; Stoerger, 2009</xref>), community orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412440697">Wenger et al., 2009</xref>), principles for cultivating COPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412440697">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>), and CoPs best practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555343412440697">APQC, 2010</xref>). Many of the current topics in knowledge management include the notion of CoPs and will also provide guidance in the modeling of CoPs in conjunction with a systems analysis.</p>
<p>Second, methods of detecting and measuring the value delivered by this approach to designing for COPs are also a key concern for further research. This approach needs to be validated through measures of success that are appropriate to the CoPs community dimension of best supporting the negotiation of meaning. From a quantitative perspective, social network analysis techniques can capture the interactive relationship between actors and can show the formation of clusters, which can help to detect a COP and reveal its structure. From the qualitative perspective, ethnography and narrative techniques may give flesh to the quantitative analysis by uncovering the lived experience within the COP.</p>
<p>Third, the case study may seem like a relatively simple example in light of the wide variety of ways that groups of individuals are interacting through virtual environments, such as in massive multiplayer games, 3-D virtual worlds, enterprise collaboration suites, and the growing number of arrangements in social networking. The authors hope that the relatively simple example has made tangible the nature of CoPs from a systems perspective and the foundational issues of design that integrate domain and community dimensions of a COP. The domain-community WDA does not make any assumptions about the nature of the COP, nor does it make assumptions about the technology used to support them. With this flexibility, it is expected that the domain-community WDA can be used to model and design for a wide range of COPs across a wide range of virtual media.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1555343412440697">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As interface designers delve into the development of social networking portals, social web tools, and other online social environments, there is a growing need for analytical tools to address issues of social engagement. The CoPs concept provides helpful ideas for designing for social engagement.</p>
<p>In the article, we use the CoPs model to create a domain-community WDA map that aims to tether domain and community considerations in the process of design. The map, as illustrated in the case of the UCP-SARnet portal, allows designers to consider elements of social engagement in conjunction with technical components of the work domain. We speculate that using the domain-community WDA, one can design for social engagement in such a way that the COP can more readily develop the social complexity necessary to sense and respond to complex issues in the COP’s domain. Although there are social issues beyond what was discussed in the case that must be considered in the process of designing an online social environment, we believe the domain-community WDA provides a basis for investigating these social issues from a systems perspective to provide guidance for design.</p>
