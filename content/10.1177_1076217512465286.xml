<p>The op-ed headline on an opinion page in <italic>The New York Times</italic> reads “Young, Gifted, and Neglected” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512465286">Finn, 2012</xref>). Written by Chester Finn, former U.S. assistant secretary of education and current president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, the article lays out an argument for additional support of thousands of high-potential students. “Mostly the system ignores them, with policies and budget priorities that concentrate on raising the floor under low-achieving students . . . we’ve failed to raise the ceiling for those already well above the floor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512465286">Finn, 2012</xref>, p. A29). Dr. Finn asserts that this practice not only hurts individual students but also imperils America’s future. He is joined in this belief by many parents of gifted children. Here is what one parent said:
<disp-quote>
<p>Many teachers are so focused on the high-stakes tests that they spend much of their time concentrating on students “on the bubble.” Our child’s benchmarks always showed him to be in good shape for the tests—in fact, these tests indicated that he did not even need initial instruction. But he was generally ignored during the test preparation portion of the school year. In one school, this test preparation consumed 6 months of the school year.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Briefly, Finn points out three systemic failures made in American schools. First, he points out systemic failures in the identification of young gifted children, particularly poor and minority children or those lacking pushy, knowledgeable parents. Second, he notes that at the primary and middle school levels, there are not enough classrooms with trained teachers and appropriate curricula, and that budget cuts have cost not only the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act but also advanced classes and art and music. Laura’s father wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>Generally, her teachers tried, but they lacked the resources to meet her needs. They just weren’t able to differentiate instruction for the one child in the class who was several standard deviations above the norm; they had other priorities like helping other pupils.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Third, Finn believes that there are not enough honors or AP courses in high schools and that the available classes sometimes include students who may be bright but who do not have the preparation to succeed in these courses.</p>
<p>Dr. Finn’s “three failures” are well known in the gifted education community. In the first assertion, relating to identification, every gifted teacher and administrator is familiar with the struggle to find adequate methods of finding and supporting low socioeconomic status (SES) and minority students, particularly students whose first language is not English. Some might admit to the difficulty of working with parents who have difficulty understanding why a child with excellent grades may not belong in the school’s gifted program. As to the second point, educators and parents lament the fact that in many instances, gifted students have teachers who are untrained or poorly trained and who do not have appropriate curricula. One parent who read the article commented the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>We chose to send our gifted daughter to public school . . . We felt it was better preparation for her to be among a diverse set of students. For us, it was a value issue. But some of our experiences have indicated that we made a poor decision. One teacher said to us, “Laura’s doing great in my class. She has 99 and 100 for every assignment.” Shockingly, this teacher was gifted certified. Thankfully, Laura was transferred to another teacher within a few days of that conversation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Perhaps the point that caused the most reaction among teachers was the third—that there are not enough honors or AP courses in high schools and that the students in the classes are not always placed there appropriately. This was a “hot button” issue for several gifted specialists. “We have plenty of AP courses,” wrote one coordinator who had two primary complaints. First, she commented that AP was not geared to gifted learners, and second, that parents and students are told that anyone can challenge the course. The effect of this is that the courses are often “watered down” because students are unable to meet rigorous standards, yet parents do not want to accept lower grades. This same person commented that International Baccalaureate (IB) programs require adherence to strict standards and the IB curriculum is more appropriate for gifted learners. Another teacher said,
<disp-quote>
<p>While AP and pre-AP courses, while rigorous, are not the same as gifted classes. While they offer an accelerated curriculum . . . these classes that I experienced as a student and now as a teacher not only are open to any interested student but are not designed with gifted students in mind. Gifted students do not receive social and emotional support. This is why I was told by my pre-AP teacher that my interpretation of an author’s tone was wrong just because my idea was divergent. This lack of support can lead to underachievement, and it doesn’t support the development of future leaders. At my school’s “Meet the Teacher” night, several parents of g/t children made almost identical statements: “My child loves GT English because he says it is the only class where he can be himself and the teacher “gets him.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The problem is even worse in homogeneous classes. Most teachers know that they should differentiate instruction, and many of them try to do so. However, the practicalities of differentiation for the gifted are lost in the demands of students with IEPs or 504 provisions, and the pressure for all students to pass the standardized tests means that, as a gifted teacher said about her experiences,
<disp-quote>
<p>Gifted students are labeled as “not needing help” or “they’ll do fine on their own,” and so the overworked teacher chooses not to provide them with acceleration and/or enrichment. There may be rules about serving gifted children, but there is no enforcement. All of this creates an environment in which gifted students feel as though they are not valued or challenged. My history teacher would often read my essays as examples. Not only was I embarrassed, but I also did not receive any instruction. The teacher didn’t care whether I was growing as a learner. What a horrible message to send to the students who are most capable of changing the world!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Dr. Finn’s solution to these problems is to establish more schools that focus on high-ability, highly motivated learners. There are already well-known schools that do this, such as Boston Latin, Bronx High School of Science, and Stuyvesant High School. He lists other schools in Cincinnati, Austin, and Northern Virginia, for example, which have excellent reputations in their communities. In fact, he and his colleague, Jessica A. Hockett, located 165 of these schools, which he labels <italic>exam schools</italic>. This is a small number when one considers that there are more than 20,000 high schools in the United States. These schools are able to serve only 1% of the population, and all of them turn away qualified students. Some of these schools offer AP courses, but even when they do not, their courses have the content and rigor of AP.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“Finn’s solution to the problem of reaching gifted students is to establish more specialized schools.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finn’s solution to the problem of reaching gifted students is to establish more specialized schools. He wrote, “It’s time to end the bias against gifted and talented education and quit assuming that every school must be all things to all students, a simplistic formula that ends up neglecting all sorts of boys and girls” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512465286">Finn, 2012</xref>, p. A29). His article calls for the establishment of many more “exam schools,” a thousand or more, along with elementary and middle schools that find and prepare students to attend such schools.</p>
<p>Although this is a noble goal, it would be a difficult one to achieve, as anyone who has tried to group gifted children or establish a magnet school or prepare teachers for working with gifted students. Especially in times like these, when budgets are tight, the likelihood that a thousand new specialized high schools will be opened is a dream. Yet, his arguments would ring true with many parents and educators. Here is what one administrator said:
<disp-quote>
<p>Would a football coach leave his best athlete on the bench or make sure that everyone has equal playing time? This is what happens to our gifted students; they have to sit through numerous classes not at their level. Yet, we walk, talk, learn, and socialize differently. If it were not for a few strong AP/IB classes and early college admission, many of our gifted students would simply leave high school. We are going to lose g/t students to private/charter schools if we do not learn how to serve them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In <italic>School: The Story of American Public Education</italic>, David Tyack wrote, “One article of faith among the founding fathers was that a republic could survive only if its citizens were educated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512465286">Mondale &amp; Patton, 2001</xref>, p. 1). In recent years, this premise has led to better education for a very diverse population of children with various learning needs, who speak different languages, and who come from varying economic background. But hearing life stories from parents and teachers, and facing the reality that we are not likely to create 1,000 new exam schools any time soon can be discouraging. Yet, there are success stories of “regular” schools that are serving gifted learners. A teacher in a very diverse, low SES, and high ESL district disagrees with much of what Dr. Finn said:
<disp-quote>
<p>His arguments are strong, but he is ignoring the school districts that go above and beyond to provide academic enrichment to all students through AP and college enrollment. American schools are not failing! Schools are providing competitive environments for academics!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here is what a parent said:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some experiences in school have been great! My daughter’s kindergarten teacher was phenomenal! She pushed my highly gifted daughter as far as she could while also inculcating an abiding love of learning and of school. Of course, this was a master teacher with many years of classroom experience who took her training in gifted education seriously. And, she worked 50-60 hr a week—hardly the typical teacher at any school.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From the frustrated middle school teacher,
<disp-quote>
<p>On the flip side, some of my happiest school memories, deepest friendships, and formative experiences occurred in the gifted classroom. I’ll never forget making friends with girls in fifth grade who still loved to play make believe and wanted to name all of the trees on our playground and then write their life stories! Or the experience of standing in front of a real judge to argue the guilt of Lee Harvey Oswald. Or the time that I was forced to write an opera and even sing in it! I’ll never forget what an aria or recitative is! My friends from g/t are making a difference: I’m a teacher of the gifted, one of our group is an investigative journalist, another works in public finance, and two are doctors.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This happened in a regular school. Laura’s father said,
<disp-quote>
<p>This year, the public school is trying hard to meet Laura’s needs. They have accelerated her to advanced courses. The gifted coordinator at the high school started our first conversation with the word “challenge.” She was determined that our daughter would not simply coast through classes. She was emphatic that the choice of teachers was more critical than the subjects. For example, this school has an terrific Latin teacher, and the coordinator suggested that Laura take Latin rather than an easy Spanish sequence (which was not likely to produce mastery anyway) and be stretched in a course that we might not otherwise consider important. The coordinator was also eager to get our daughter involved in athletics and the arts and noted that gifted kids don’t need to spend all their time and energy on purely academic pursuits.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Good schools can work effectively with gifted children. Perhaps Finn’s dream of more exam schools will someday be realized. Even if it is not, the gifted community should thank him for drawing attention to the “Young, Gifted, and Neglected.” Thanks, Dr. Finn.</p>
