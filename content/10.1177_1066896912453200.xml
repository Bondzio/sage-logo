<abstract>
<p>Primary cutaneous hydroa vacciniforme (HV)–like lymphoma is a rare, Epstein–Barr virus–associated cutaneous neoplasm characterized by photosensitive papulovesicular eruption and usually associated with poor prognosis. This report presents 2 cases of primary cutaneous HV-like lymphoma with unusual indolent clinical course and favorable prognosis during the follow-up periods of 2 and 3 years, respectively. Both patients presented with erythema, papulovesicles, scars, ulcerations, and edema on the face and extremities. Skin biopsies revealed epidermal vesicle with small- to medium-sized atypical lymphoid cells infiltrating in the dermis and subcutis. The lymphoid cells were strongly immunoreactive to CD8 and CD56. The Epstein–Barr virus genomes were also found in both skin biopsies. By genetic analysis, one of patients showed T-cell receptor-γ gene clonal rearrangement. The patients underwent glucocorticoid treatment and obtained remarkable clinical improvement with regression of skin lesions. No sign of recurrence and extracutaneous manifestation was found during the period of follow-up. A long-term follow-up is suggested to be performed to inspect the progression for this tumor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hydroa vacciniforme (HV)–like lymphoma is a rare but distinct Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)–positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma occurring in children and associated with sensitivity to insect bites and sun burn. In the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system, this tumor is one of major types of EBV-associated T-cell lymphoprolilerative disorders in the pediatric age group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912453200">1</xref></sup> Most reports of HV-like lymphoma have come from Korea, Japan, China, and South America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912453200">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912453200"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912453200"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912453200">5</xref></sup> HV-like lymphoma frequently presents with unique skin lesion and is associated with poor prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912453200">6</xref></sup> Herein, we report 2 cases of primary cutaneous HV-like lymphoma with indolent clinical course.

<title>Material and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1066896912453200">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 15-year-old Chinese boy presented with a 3-year history of recurrent vesicles, papules, erosions and crusts on his face, neck, and extremities. Each episode of eruption resolved within several weeks. Some lesions on the patient’s neck and extremities progressed through a large ulcerated eschar stage before healing with an atrophic scar. About 1 year ago, the edema on his face and eyelids was also noted. As a result, the patient was referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. Physical examination revealed that his general condition was stable. Peripheral lymph nodes, liver, and spleen were not palpable. Chest radiograph and bone marrow biopsy revealed no abnormal finding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1066896912453200">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 14-year-old Chinese boy was brought to our hospital because of a recurrent papulovesicular disorder of 6-year history on his face and extremities. The patient had suffered repeated episodes of erythematous swelling on his face and discrete ulcerated papules, nodules with eschar, and scarring on the lower legs, ankles, and elbows. Physical examination showed that the patient was in good health without fevers, weight loss, lymph node enlargement, or hepatosplenomegaly. Chest radiograph, abdominal ultrasonic checking, and bone marrow aspiration did not show any abnormality.</p>
<p>The skin biopsies of patients were routinely fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The tissues were embedded in paraffin. Four micrometer-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed using the ChemMate Envision/HRP Kit (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The antibodies used in this study were CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD43, CD45RO, CD56, CD30, TIA-1, granzyme-B, CD20, CD38, CD68, CD79a, TdT, and MPO. The antibodies were obtained from Dako Cytomation (Carpinteria, CA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Slides were dewaxed and rehydrated routinely and then were treated with 10 mmol citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a microwave for antigen retrieval. After incubation with diluted primary antibodies, slides were treated with the ChemMate Envision/HRP Kit for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by development with diaminobenzidine for visualization.</p>
<p>For detection of EBV infection in the tissues, in situ hybridization for EBERs (EBV-encoded RNAs) was performed on the skin biopsies. The EBERs detection kit was purchased from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). The detection process was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>For cytogenetic analysis, the paraffin tissue DNA of 2 cases was prepared with a tissue DNA extraction and purification kit (DneasyTM Tissue Kit, Qiagene, CA). Two sets of primers (tube A, 145-255 bp; tube B, 80-220bp) were used to amplify the rearranged T-cell receptor (TCR)-γ gene. A T cell lymphoma case with a known monoclonal rearrangement was used as the positive control, a nonlymphoid and hematopoietic tumor was used as the negative control, a reaction without template DNA was simultaneously run as the blank control. β-Actin was amplified as an internal control. The detection process was conducted by the BIOMED-2-TCR-γ multiplex polymerase chain reaction amplification system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912453200">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Case 1</title>
<p>Skin examination showed erythematous papules, vesicles, and plaques with various sizes up to several centimeters in diameter along with some pitting scars on the face, neck, lower legs, and ankles. Some of the lesions were crusted or had a necrotic center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912453200">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912453200">B</xref>). In addition to papulovesicles in sun-exposed areas, reddish papules, ulcers with eschar, and scars could also be found on the buttocks and waist. Skin biopsy of the lesion on left arm was performed. Under a microscope, the lesion showed extensive ulceration with necrosis; part of epidermis was not recognized because of the ulceration. Epidermal edema and vesicle along with moderate infiltration of small- to middle-size lymphoid cell, histiocytes, eosinophils, and occasional neutrophils were observed in the lesion. The lymphoid cells had no obvious nuclear pleomorphism or atypia, but it could be found that lymphoid cells extended into the dermis and subcutis with perivascular and periappendageal infiltrating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896912453200">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896912453200">B</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining showed that lymphoid cells were positive for CD3, CD8, CD43, CD45RO, CD56, and focally positive for CD30 and TIA-1; whereas they were negative for CD4, CD5, granzyme-B, CD20, CD38, CD68, CD79a, TdT, and MPO. EBV detection by in situ hybridization for EBERs was also positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896912453200">Figure 2C</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896912453200">F</xref>). By cytogenetic analysis, TCR-γ gene clonal rearrangement was detectable in this patient.</p>

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>Skin examination showed diffuse erythematous swelling on the face, lower legs, and forearms. Discrete ulcerated papules, nodules with eschar ranging in size from 1 to 5 cm persisted on the face and extremities, and occasionally on the trunk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1066896912453200">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1066896912453200">4B</xref>). A skin biopsy was performed on the left ankle. Dermal and subcutaneous tissues were mainly infiltrated by small-sized lymphoid cells and the occasional plasma cells.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hydroa vacciniforme–like lymphoma was first described as “coexistence of hydroa vacciniforme and malignant lymphoma” by Oono et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912453200">8</xref></sup> in 1986. In 1998, Magaña et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912453200">2</xref></sup> termed this lesion as “angiocentric cutaneous T-cell lymphoma of childhood” and regarded it as a distinctive type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In 2005, WHO/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) grouped it as a variant of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type and termed it as “HV-like cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,” which defined this lesion as a rare type of EBV-associated lymphoma of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912453200">9</xref></sup> However, based on the immunohistochemical and molecular studies, this tumor recently was considered to be derived from skin homing cytotoxic T-cell or NK-cell, and incompletely satisfy the criteria for well-defined entity of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. So the latest edition of WHO classification grouped it as one of major types of EBV-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders of childhood, and suggested “HV-like lymphoma” could be a more appropriate classification and descriptive term.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912453200">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have reviewed HV-like lymphoma reported in the English literature in recent 2 decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912453200">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912453200"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912453200"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912453200">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912453200">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912453200">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912453200"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912453200"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912453200"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912453200">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066896912453200">Table 1</xref>). It revealed that all patients were from Asia and South America, especially Korea, Japan, China, and Mexico. The main clinical presentation was widespread dermal lesions. There was a slight male tendency of male to female ratio being approximately 2.3:1. Most of the patients were children with a mean age of 9 years at diagnosis (ranged from 3 to 15 years), and only 2 patients were adults. In all, 30.4% of patients showed extracutaneous presentation, including fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymph node enlargement, and anemia when being diagnosed or during the period of follow-up. The most of reported cases exhibited an indolent course and had a favorable prognosis with a survival rate of approximately 74%. The inclusion of indolent variant of HV-like lymphoma might be the reason why the prognosis of this lesion has been changed from “uniformly poor” to “variable” in the latest edition of WHO classification. However, it should be noted that the patients with extracutaneous involvement usually had poor prognosis in those reported cases. It has revealed that the NK or T lineage of tumor cells has no impact on patient survival,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896912453200">15</xref></sup> but extracutaneous involvement at presentation was the most important factor predicting poor outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912453200">16</xref></sup> Therefore, skin-only lesions in our cases might be responsible for their indolent clinical course and favorable prognosis. Till date, to our knowledge, only 2 cases developed lymphoma after long-term initial HV-like clinical presentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912453200">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896912453200">17</xref></sup> These findings implied that HV might progress from a smoldering stage to a lymphoid malignancy. In our study, case 2 was diagnosed as HV-like lymphoma after 6-year onset of initial typical HV eruptions. We postulated that this patient might progress from a smoldering stage to lymphoproliferative disorder. Therefore, patients with HV-like lymphoma may present with typical HV eruptions initially and need to be followed up for several years even if they have no evidence of systemic involvement at the beginning of the follow-up period.</p>

<p>The tumor cells in HV-like lymphoma showed various immunophenotype according to literature reports. Some cases exhibited a T-cell phenotype with expression of CD4 or CD8, and some cases were highlighted with a NK-cell marker CD56 as well. In our cases, tumor cells showed T-cell markers (CD45RO, CD43, and CD8), and NK-cell marker, and so also CD56. In addition, all of reported cases, including ours, have been proved to be related to EBV infection. The spectrum of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases in nonimmunocompromised hosts has been widened and, as far as the lesions of T/NK type with cutaneous involvement are concerned, they include several forms, such as classic and severe HV, HV-like lymphoma, mosquito bite allergy, T/NK cell lymphoma nasal-type, and systemic EBV-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disease of childhood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896912453200">18</xref></sup> The differential diagnosis of these diseases is difficult because the overlap among these entities may be wide in clinical manifestation, histopathological appearance, and immunohistochemical features. Cytogenetic analyses have been therefore considered to be helpful in making the correct diagnosis. HV-like lymphoma and nasal NK/T-cell lymphomas sometimes share common cytologic features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896912453200">19</xref></sup> Most cases of HV-like lymphoma have clonal rearrangements of the TCR genes. Some cases of NK derivation will not show TCR gene rearrangement. Some rare subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, such as primary cutaneous CD8-positive aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma, primary cutaneous CD4-positive small/medium T-cell lymphoma, and primary CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferation disorders, can co-express CD4, CD8, or CD56 molecule, which may sometimes cause diagnostic confusion with HV-like cutaneous lymphoma. However, presence of EBV infection, mainly occurring in children and indolent courses would argue against those rare subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In the present cases, one case showed TCR gene clonal rearrangement, but the other was negative. We consider that the case without TCR rearrangement exhibits NK cell phenotype, but the prognosis appears to be better than classic NK lymphoma. This result is consistent with a previous report described by Doeden et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912453200">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, the favorable outcome of our present cases might result from presentation with skin lesion only, but the possibility of more aggressive clinical course developing out of the current smoldering stage was of concern. A longer period of follow-up is necessary to be performed for the patient with HV-like lymphoma even if the patient had complete remission at initial therapy.</p>
