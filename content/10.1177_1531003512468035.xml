<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Synovial sarcoma is a well-described tumor, accounting for 6 to 10% of all soft-tissue sarcomas. A misnomer, it is not derived from the synovium but rather from immature mesenchymal elements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1531003512468035">1</xref></sup> There are 4 subtypes that exist along a continuous spectrum: biphasic, monophasic fibrous or epithelial, and poorly differentiated synovial sarcomas. It is a highly aggressive tumor and, unlike most soft-tissue sarcomas, it predominates in adolescents and young adults, causing death in more than 50% of those affected. It is found most commonly in the soft tissues of the extremities, especially near large joints, but occurrences in areas with no connection to the synovium have been reported. There are a significant number of case reports of synovial sarcomas arising from the chest, pleura, abdominal wall, parapharyngeal space, and mesentery and in organs, including the kidney, lung, heart, thyroid, and parotid glands. However, primary intravascular synovial sarcoma is extraordinarily rare. Only 5 cases have been reported in the literature, all of which were of the biphasic subtype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1531003512468035">2</xref></sup> Here, we report a sixth case of intravascular synovial sarcoma, which is also the first reported case of the monophasic subtype.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 41-year-old woman presented to her primary care provider with progressive abdominal pain and distention. This was associated with fatigue, early satiety, and bilateral lower-extremity swelling. She was evaluated with an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed the presence of hepatomegaly, ascites, and a suspicious inferior vena caval thrombus versus mass. At that time, the patient was hospitalized, started on anticoagulation with warfarin, and mechanical thrombectomy was attempted. This was unsuccessful, but histopathological evaluation of the thrombus-like material revealed high-grade synovial sarcoma of the monophasic subtype. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen confirmed the ultrasound findings and determined that the mass arose from the retrohepatic portion of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The patient was transferred to our institution for further evaluation and management. In the interim, she experienced progressive shortness of breath and an increase in her abdominal distension secondary to accumulation of ascites. Initial evaluation included transesophageal echocardiography, which showed a large mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1531003512468035">Figure 1A</xref>) occupying most of the right atrium (RA) with near absence of flow from the IVC into the RA and extension of the mass up to the tricuspid valve. There was also some impairment of flow from the superior vena cava (SVC) with a mean gradient of 6 mmHg. Her ejection fraction was preserved (EF = 60%). Because of the extent of the mass and the need for further evaluation of its origin, MRI of the abdomen was performed and revealed a 4.0- × 4.2- × 7.5-cm moderately vascular, expansile mass within the retrohepatic portion of the IVC with extension above the diaphragm to the RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1531003512468035">Figure 1B</xref>). The right atrial extension of the mass measured approximately 5.5 cm. An 8.5-cm long occlusive thrombus extended from just below the tumor to the level of the renal veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1531003512468035">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1531003512468035">2B</xref>). Multiple venous collaterals from the azygos and hemiazygos systems were present on imaging as a result of the slowly occlusive nature of the mass.</p>

<p>A multidisciplinary team, which consisted of cardiac, vascular, and hepatobiliary surgeons, visited with the patient preoperatively to discuss the available treatment options. Surgical resection was felt to be the only option. With the cardiac extent of the mass, the need for cardiopulmonary bypass with hypothermic circulatory arrest was thought to be the safest option in her case. The possibility of hepatic resection was also discussed with the patient. She was admitted preoperatively for correction of her coagulopathy, which was in part caused by warfarin and in part caused by congestive hepatopathy.</p>
<p>The operation was performed under general anesthesia. A standard median sternotomy was used, and the heart was exposed. This was followed by midline laparotomy with evacuation of almost 5 L of ascitic fluid. Complete mobilization of the liver was performed, which required division of the central tendon of the diaphragm prior to initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Standard cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass was performed through an ascending aortic and right atrial cannulation. An aortic root vent was inserted. Full cardiopulmonary pass was initiated, and the patient was cooled to a core temperature of 18° Celsius. A vertical right atriotomy was performed with extension to the retrohepatic portion of the IVC. The mass was completely visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1531003512468035">Figure 3</xref>), and it was not invading the tricuspid valve. Because of the size of the mass, it was difficult to remove it en bloc. The intracardiac portion was removed first, followed by complete dissection of the inferior vena caval portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1531003512468035">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1531003512468035">4B</xref>). The mass was found to arise from the posterior wall of the retrohepatic IVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1531003512468035">Figure 4C</xref>). It extended into the right hepatic vein, but this was removed in conjunction with the mass. A single dose of antegrade cardioplegia was required. Intermittent antegrade perfusion was performed using the sucker-bypass technique to minimize the duration of circulatory arrest. The caudal extension of the thrombus associated with the mass was removed from the infrahepatic IVC as well as from the renal veins. The portion of the posterior wall of the retrohepatic IVC (10 × 7 cm) where the tumor originated was resected with the mass. The IVC was reconstructed using a bovine pericardial patch sutured in place with a 4-0 polypropylene suture with inclusion of the hepatic veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1531003512468035">Figure 5</xref>). The patch extended short of the cavoatrial junction, and the right atriotomy was then closed primarily with a running 4-0 polypropylene suture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1531003512468035">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1531003512468035">6B</xref>). The single 2-stage venous cannula was placed back into the RA, and full cardiopulmonary bypass with rewarming was initiated. The patient was weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any inotropic support. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography confirmed complete removal of the mass, trivial tricuspid regurgitation, and preserved ventricular function. Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 197 minutes, with a total circulatory arrest time of 53 minutes. The patient tolerated the operation well and was extubated on postoperative day 1. Final histopathological examination confirmed that the mass was a synovial sarcoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1531003512468035">Figure 7</xref>). This diagnosis was further supported by immunoreactivity to TLE-1 antibody and SYT-SSX1 fusion studies. The remainder of her postoperative course was uneventful. Anticoagulation was reinstituted postoperatively, and the patient was discharged home on the seventh postoperative day. Adjuvant chemotherapy was planned to start 6 weeks postoperatively with doxorubicin and ifosfamide.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Synovial sarcoma is the fourth most common malignant soft-tissue tumor accounting for 6% to 10% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1531003512468035">2</xref></sup> The estimated incidence is 2.75 per 100 000 in the general population. It is a highly aggressive tumor with estimated 5- and 10-year survival rates as low as 36% and 20% respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1531003512468035">3</xref></sup> Unlike most soft-tissue sarcomas, it typically occurs in adolescents and young adults. Synovial sarcomas usually occur near joints, tendon sheaths, or bursae of the lower extremities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1531003512468035">4</xref></sup> There are also a significant number of cases arising from anatomical sites with no obvious connection to the synovium, including the abdominal wall, mesentery, and numerous solid organs. Retroperitoneal synovial sarcomas represent about 1% of retroperitoneal tumors, with most series published as case reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1531003512468035">4</xref></sup> Metastases develop in 50% of patients, usually within 2 years. Diagnosis of synovial sarcoma in these sites usually requires confirmation by cytogenetic, immunohistochemical, or molecular studies. Cases of primary intravascular synovial sarcoma are exceedingly rare. The current case is only the sixth reported case in the literature. Histopathologically, synovial sarcomas may be biphasic, monophasic fibrous or epithelial, or poorly differentiated. The biphasic pattern has a spindle-cell background in which glandular elements are embedded, with stromal mast cells being an important diagnostic tool with myxoid areas in some cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1531003512468035">5</xref></sup> The monophasic variant has spindle cells arranged in fascicles with a fibrosarcoma-like pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1531003512468035">6</xref></sup> The etiology of these tumors remains unclear. However, a genetic basis has been described, with 90% of these tumors harboring SYT-SSX1 fusion genes, which are formed by reciprocal translocation of the chromosome X short arm and the chromosome 18 long arm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1531003512468035">7</xref></sup> A number of other malignancies, mainly other spindle-cell sarcomas, can be easily confused with synovial sarcoma. These may include leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, solitary fibrous tumor, sarcomatoid mesothelioma, and small round cell tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1531003512468035">8</xref></sup> In such situations, immunohistochemical staining with cytokeratin (either AE1/AE3 or CAM 5.2), epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, CD 99, and calretinin may help in the differentiation from other soft-tissue tumors. S-100 protein, immunoreactivity for bcl-2, and MAGE-CT have been identified in some cases as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1531003512468035">9</xref></sup> Early detection of retroperitoneal sarcomas has been difficult because of their location, and patients usually present with advanced stage of the tumor as in our case.</p>
<p>Treatment options for retroperitoneal synovial sarcomas are limited, with the main focus on complete surgical resection. Without aggressive resection of these tumors, recurrence has been reported to be as high as 70% after conservative resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1531003512468035">10</xref></sup> Although there is no particular classification for retroperitoneal sarcomas with IVC and atrial extensions, the same classification principles, including the well-known modified Skinner classification, that apply to renal cell carcinoma can be utilized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1531003512468035">11</xref></sup> Tumors with extension deep into the RA or those known as level III or IV as in our case need cardiopulmonary bypass to ensure safe and complete excision of the tumor. Intraoperative strategies that were followed in our case were based on minimizing the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory arrest as much as possible. Complete mobilization of the liver was required prior to heparinization and initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. The question of using circulatory arrest in these cases is still controversial. The definite advantages include a relatively bloodless field and simplicity of the operation because it requires only a single venous cannulation, usually achieved through the RA. However, obvious concerns include the risks related to deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. With such large tumors occupying much of the RA, there is a concern about the adequacy of venous return and the ease and ability to achieve homogeneous cooling of the body. Placement of the 2-stage venous cannula may be difficult as well because it will be almost impossible to place it in the standard right atrial IVC location. The alternative will be to use either a short right atrial cannula or 2 separate venous cannulae: one for the SVC and the other in the infrarenal IVC, either directly or through the groin to achieve adequate venous return.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1531003512468035">12</xref></sup> The use of 2 separate venous cannulae may facilitate conducting the operation without the need for deep hypothermic circulatory arrest as has been described in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1531003512468035">13</xref></sup> The limitations of these techniques are the relative complexity and the inability to provide a completely bloodless field. The additional groin incision required for femoral vein cannulation also brings with it the potential for additional complications, including lymphocele, compartment syndrome, or infection that can affect postoperative recovery.</p>
<p>When reconstructing the involved portion of the IVC during surgical resection of retroperitoneal sarcomas, 2 options are available: total replacement of the involved portion of the cava with a tube graft, typically composed of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), with preference given to one with external support (ringed),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1531003512468035">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1531003512468035">15</xref></sup> or longitudinal cavotomy and closure using either an autologous or prosthetic patch material after complete tumor excision. The advantage of the second strategy is the speed and lack of need for reimplantation of the hepatic veins, which minimize the risk of anastomotic complications that may include bleeding from multiple suture lines, postoperative hepatic vein obstruction, or thrombosis. We applied the latter strategy in our case. With resection of the involved portion of the posterior wall of the IVC where the tumor originated, a bovine pericardial patch was used for reconstruction. The suture line was created to encase the hepatic veins and thus obviate the need for reimplantation. We prefer bovine pericardium because of its availability and ease of use. Additionally, we prefer to preserve the patient’s pericardium in case of future sternotomy, which is especially important in this young age group.</p>
<p>Many also recommend neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy to decrease the risk of developing distant recurrence as a result of undetected micrometastases present at the time of local control. However, the data are conflicting. One small study found that doxorubicin, cisplatin, and ifosfamide were effective in preventing recurrence in patients with synovial sarcoma when used in a combined neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1531003512468035">16</xref></sup> High-dose ifosfamide-based chemotherapy has also been suggested by some groups as neoadjuvant therapy for those with advanced disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1531003512468035">17</xref></sup> However, despite the existence of more than 50 recognized subtypes of soft-tissue sarcomas, they are often treated as a single clinical entity when analyzing data to generate these recommendations. An analysis of patients treated over the course of 32 years from Italiano et al demonstrated that neither neoadjuvant nor adjuvant chemotherapy improve survival in cases of synovial sarcoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1531003512468035">18</xref></sup> Furthermore, much of the data generated to support adjuvant chemotherapy use was based on studies in the pediatric population and in patients with advanced disease. Despite this, chemotherapy is often used in patients even with localized synovial sarcoma because of its aggressive nature.</p>
<p>In conclusion, primary retroperitoneal synovial sarcoma is a rare and aggressive type of soft-tissue sarcoma. Multimodality treatment is recommended in such cases to achieve the best outcomes, with aggressive surgical resection being the mainstay of therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1531003512468035">19</xref></sup> Use of cardiopulmonary bypass, with or without deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, is recommended when these tumors extend deep into the right heart to facilitate safe and complete resection.</p>
