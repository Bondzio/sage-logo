<abstract>
<p>Stories and images of successful career women and support for women’s advancement in working life have become hallmarks of contemporary postfeminist media culture, and especially of women’s magazines such as <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic>. While in previous research these features have been seen as signs for a new, popular feminism, more recently they have also been connected to the growing hegemony of neoliberal governance, a mode of power that ultimately aims at the economization of the social and is fundamentally exercised in and through discourse. The aim of this article is to investigate further the interconnectedness of these two phenomena, postfeminism and neoliberalism, in the domain of work, using the example of the German edition of <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic>. For a detailed and multilayered investigation the study draws on linguistically oriented discourse analysis, focusing on the operation of a ‘discourse of postfeminist self-management’. The examination shows how this discourse, while on the one hand evoking an ethos of feminist engagement, on the other seeks to guide readers to mould themselves into a version of the entrepreneurial self required by the neoliberalized world of work.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In contemporary Western societies women are pursuing a profession of their own in greater numbers than ever before. In the popular media, stories and images of successful career women abound across the media genres. They figure especially prominently in women’s magazines like <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic>, which regularly features articles on assertive female leaders and committed women entrepreneurs, encourages and guides its readers in their occupational lives and organizes seminars to additionally boost the careers of some chosen lucky ones. In popular discourse this development has become a major sign of the victory of feminism and thus of a postfeminist time, in which feminist ideas and values have become part of our everyday lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750481313476596">Gill, 2007a</xref>: 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1750481313476596">Lazar, 2005</xref>: 17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1750481313476596">Tasker and Negra, 2007</xref>: 8). <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic>’s approach has been characterized as ‘aspirational feminism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1750481313476596">Winship, 1987</xref>: 106) or as ‘popular feminism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750481313476596">Gauntlett, 2002</xref>: 193).</p>
<p>While these characteristics of contemporary postfeminism – an emphasis on women’s empowerment, agency and success not only but also in working life – have largely been associated with (popular) feminism, it is only recently that they have also been connected to neoliberalism or ‘the increasing hegemony of a neo-liberal form of governance’ in contemporary societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750481313476596">Gill and Arthurs, 2006</xref>: 443). Going back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750481313476596">Foucault (e.g. 2006</xref>), ‘neoliberal governance’ refers to a mode of political power that seeks to interpellate human beings as ‘enterprising individuals, striving for fulfillment, excellence and achievement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750481313476596">Rose, 1996</xref>: 154) as part of a wider ‘economization of the social’ – postulated as the golden way to societal well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750481313476596">Bröckling et al., 2000</xref>). Neoliberal governance is a mode of power that fundamentally operates in and through discourse.</p>
<p>So far, the relationship between postfeminism and neoliberalism has remained, as Rosalind Gill and Christina Scharff have recently argued, underexplored<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750481313476596">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750481313476596">Gill and Scharff, 2011a</xref>: 7) and the domain of work, although an important social domain, has been virtually ignored. Against this background, the present study<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750481313476596">2</xref></sup> aims to explore further the interconnectedness of postfeminism and neoliberalism by focusing on articles giving advice in the domain of work in the German edition of <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic>. For this purpose <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic> is particularly fitting in that it has been considered in several studies, partly due to its engagement in the advancement of women’s occupational lives, as a paradigmatic example of contemporary postfeminist women’s magazines (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750481313476596">Gauntlett, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750481313476596">Gill, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1750481313476596">Winship, 1987</xref>). On the other hand, in their large study on the brand <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic>, David Machin and Theo van Leeuwen refer to a ‘neo-capitalist philosophy of life’ underlying the whole magazine format which, in turn, points to its being particularly apt in connection with neoliberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750481313476596">Machin and Van Leeuwen, 2003</xref>: 508).</p>
<p>The methodological framework of the study draws on critical discourse analysis (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750481313476596">Fairclough, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750481313476596">Pietikäinen and Mäntynen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1750481313476596">Wodak, 2001</xref>). In addition, the study is inspired by the nexus analytical approach, initiated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750481313476596">Ron Scollon and Suzie Wong Scollon (2004)</xref>. The influence of the nexus analytical approach manifests itself in the study in the theoretical assumption of a circular connection and thus mutual influence between the micro and the macro (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750481313476596">Scollon and Wong Scollon, 2004</xref>: 8). The analytical attempt, then, is to trace the actual connections between these two (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1750481313476596">Scollon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750481313476596">Scollon and Wong Scollon, 2004</xref>: 10–11; for further applications, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750481313476596">Hult, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1750481313476596">Pietikäinen, 2010</xref>). For this purpose, in alignment with both critical discourse analysis and the nexus analytical approach, the study uses the concept <italic>discourses</italic>, understood here as historically contingent signification practices which signify a particular part of the world from a particular perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750481313476596">Fairclough, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750481313476596">Foucault, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750481313476596">Lazar, 2006</xref>). From the myriad different discourses coming together in the data, the analysis focuses on a particular discourse, which I have labeled a ‘discourse of postfeminist self-management’. As we shall see, the discourse of postfeminist self-management is not only connected to, but at least partly brought about by, both (post-)feminism and neoliberalism, which makes it especially appropriate for shedding light on the interconnectedness of these two. Essentially, then, the investigation shows how this discourse, while on the one hand evoking an ethos of feminist engagement, seeks on the other to guide the reader to form herself into a version of the entrepreneurial self required by the neoliberalized world of work.</p>
<p>The article is divided into six main sections. After this first introductory section, the second section aims to shed light on the social processes which make the appearance of the discourse of postfeminist self-management in the data not only intelligible, but, more fundamentally, possible. The first part of the section focuses on processes related to postfeminism, the second on processes related to neoliberalism. Both pay particular attention to the domain of work. After this, the third section describes the discourse analytical starting points of the study. Section four first presents the study data and then gives an account of how the analysis was carried out. The fifth section presents the findings of the study, illustrating the operation of the discourse of postfeminist self-management in the data and analyzing its connections to both (post-)feminism and neoliberalism. On the basis of this multilayered investigation, the sixth and final section considers the social and political implications of this signification practice and its consequences for contemporary femininity.</p>

<title>Two strands of social development</title>
<sec id="section3-1750481313476596">
<title>Postfeminism, women and work</title>
<p>The meanings of the term <italic>postfeminism</italic> are various (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750481313476596">Gill, 2007b</xref>). However, as a denotation for a strand of societal development, postfeminism encompasses the notion that feminism (as a social movement) not only belongs to the past, but more fundamentally has outlived its purpose, since the major feminist goals like women’s right to education, participation in the world of work and access to safe contraception have been achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1750481313476596">Lazar, 2005</xref>: 17, 18). Postfeminism suggests, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1750481313476596">Yvonne Tasker and Diane Negra (2007</xref>: 8) put it, ‘that it is the very success of feminism that produces its irrelevance for contemporary culture’. Thus, in a way, despite its ostensible obsoleteness today, feminism has become part of our everyday lives, and some feminist ideas, or ideas that resonate with feminism, like empowerment, agency, self-actualization and promotion of women’s success, have become characteristic features of the landscape of contemporary postfeminism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750481313476596">Gauntlett, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750481313476596">Gill, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1750481313476596">McRobbie, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Women’s increased participation in the world of work and (some) women’s possibilities of making a career, especially, have become emblematic signs of a postfeminist time in which women finally are equal to their male counterparts. This view has gained currency particularly in the former West Germany, where the possibility for women to pursue an occupation of their own is being accompanied by the erosion of the traditional housewife culture and is thus directly connected to women’s legal, economic and social emancipation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1750481313476596">3</xref></sup> Moreover, the domain of work today represents a central social domain in which feminist ideas have been taken on board, or, to borrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1750481313476596">Angela McRobbie’s (2004</xref>: 259) expression, ‘into account’. In the field of popular media culture, TV series like <italic>Sex and the City</italic> and <italic>Grey’s Anatomy</italic> feature ambitious, engaged career women as their protagonists; women’s magazines publish stories of strong and successful business women as inspiration and encouragement for others; and self-help books such as <italic>Your Career, Your Way!</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1750481313476596">Quast, 2007</xref>) and <italic>Women in Business: Navigating Career Success</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750481313476596">Holton and Dent, 2012</xref>), like women’s magazines, give their readers concrete advice for advancement in working life.</p>
<p>In more institutional settings the promotion of women in working life finds expression through the international concept and practice of <italic>gender mainstreaming</italic>, which the German Federal Administration, among others, declares in its website to be its guiding principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750481313476596">Gender mainstreaming, n.d.</xref>). With this principle on the one side, and on the other recognition of the fact that in Germany as elsewhere women are still clearly under-represented in leading positions, the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth gives as one of its main goals increasing the proportion of women in leading positions and occupations that offer a future, as well as supporting women’s return to the labor market after having children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750481313476596">BMFSFJ Gleichstellung, n.d.</xref>). In these aspirations of the federal administration, feminist interests are obvious, but not exclusive. Another, related website asserts:<disp-quote>
<p>Also, it is necessary, not least on account of the rapid economic, technological, structural and demographic change, to use the high professional potential of women in Germany as well as possible. In the face of these conditions, no national economy can afford to forego the qualifications and skills of half of its nation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750481313476596">BMFSFJ Erwerbstätigkeit, n.d.</xref>; translation mine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We shall return to this assertion later in the article. But now let us turn to the other strand of social development, namely, to processes relating to neoliberal governmentality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1750481313476596">
<title>Neoliberal governmentality and the world of work</title>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750481313476596">Foucault (e.g. 2006</xref>), the present study views neoliberalism as a governmentality, as a rationality of government of social actors. <italic>Government</italic>, paraphrased by Foucault himself as ‘conduct of conduct’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750481313476596">Foucault, 1982</xref>: 220), refers to a mode of power that operates less through suppression than through the production of subjectivity ‘by acting upon an acting subject’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750481313476596">Foucault, 1982</xref>: 220). <italic>Governmentality</italic>, in turn, to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750481313476596">Colin Gordon’s (1991</xref>: 7) succinct formulation, ‘is about how to govern’.</p>
<p>From this perspective, neoliberalism represents a governmentality according to which the golden way to societal wellbeing lies in an economization of the social. This, in turn, is to be achieved by dismantling welfare state systems of security and support on the one hand and strengthening the entrepreneurial capacities of individuals on the other (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750481313476596">Bröckling et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750481313476596">Rose, 1996</xref>: 150–168). In this spirit, the report of a committee looking at future issues in the German federal states of Bavaria and Saxony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750481313476596">Kommission für Zukunftsfragen Bayern – Sachsen, 1997</xref>) declared in 1997:<disp-quote>
<p>The leading concept of the future is the individual as entrepreneur managing his or her own work skills and providing for his or her own existence. This insight must be made use of, and people’s own initiative and responsibility, that is, the entrepreneurial in society, must be developed more strongly. [–] Politics, science and the media are especially needed here. (My translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this context <italic>the entrepreneurial</italic> designates, in the words of Nikolas Rose, ‘an array of rules for the conduct of one’s everyday existence: energy, initiative, ambition, calculation, and personal responsibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750481313476596">Rose, 1996</xref>: 155). ‘The enterprising self’, Rose goes on to say, ‘will make an enterprise of its life, seek to maximize its own human capital, project itself a future, and seek to shape itself in order to become that which it wishes to be’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750481313476596">Rose, 1996</xref>: 155).</p>
<p>Although the neoliberal assertion that ‘humans are, could be, or should be enterprising individuals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750481313476596">Rose, 1996</xref>: 155) evidently applies to every sphere of life (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750481313476596">Bröckling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750481313476596">Kauppinen, 2012</xref>), it is undoubtedly in the world of work where this entrepreneurial spirit is strongest. There, as also the aforementioned committee report indicates, the employee is far from being any longer a mere worker, but is reconfigured, as it were, into an entrepreneur of his/her workforce, supposed to be able to flexibly produce and trade not only task-related skills, but all sorts of other qualifications as well, ranging from communicative competencies to stress and motivation management (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750481313476596">Bröckling, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In neoliberalism the autonomy of the self no longer appears as the antithesis of political power, but instead as something that needs to be brought into alignment with political objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750481313476596">Rose, 1996</xref>: 155). In the face of this challenge, neoliberal power works not through coercion or oppression, but through well-regulated freedoms, enablement and the empowerment of individuals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750481313476596">Bröckling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750481313476596">Rose, 1996</xref>: 150–168, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1750481313476596">1999b</xref>: 84). Thus, according to neoliberal logic, in the field of work the ultimate path to business success no longer lies in disciplining workers into dutiful obedience, but rather in making sure that their aspirations fall into line with the objectives of the organization and ‘empowering’ the employees to fulfill their own needs. And so ‘through striving to fulfil their own needs and wishes at work, each employee will [. . .] work for the advance of the enterprise; the more the individual fulfils him or herself, the greater the benefit to the company’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1750481313476596">Rose, 1999a</xref>: 56; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750481313476596">Bröckling, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In their historical-comparative study <italic>The New Spirit of Capitalism</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750481313476596">Luc Boltanski and Ève Chiapello (2007)</xref> view management manuals for corporate management from the 1990s as a key site of ‘the new spirit of capitalism’, that is, contemporary neoliberalism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750481313476596">Ulrich Bröckling (2000</xref>: 131) speaks on the other hand about a hegemony of managerial thought in nearly all spheres of life. Management is connected, as Otto Nigsch notes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1750481313476596">1997</xref>: 418), with positive associations like clarity, uncomplicatedness, objectiveness, competence and efficiency. Management presents itself, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1750481313476596">Nigsch (1997</xref>: 418) asserts, as a category of calculated progress, endowed with unquestioned legitimacy. With all this in mind, we move next to the discourse analytical starting points of the study.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1750481313476596">
<title>Discourse analytical starting points of the study</title>
<p>Methodologically the present study draws, as already mentioned, on critical discourse analysis (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750481313476596">Fairclough, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750481313476596">Pietikäinen and Mäntynen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1750481313476596">Sunderland, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1750481313476596">Wodak, 2001</xref>) and is influenced by nexus analytical thinking, first put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750481313476596">Scollon and Wong Scollon (2004)</xref>. The study subscribes to a multimodal view and takes discourse to comprise, besides the linguistic, a variety of other semiotic modes, such as images (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750481313476596">Blommaert, 2005</xref>: 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750481313476596">Kress and Van Leeuwen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750481313476596">Scollon and Wong Scollon, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, discourse is understood as (a means of) social action which, like other forms of social action, has social effects and consequences, also in a very material sense. On the other hand, discourse is also shaped by the social, or, in Jan Blommaert’s words, by ‘the economic, social, [and] political’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750481313476596">Blommaert, 2005</xref>: 66).</p>
<p>Viewed from this perspective it seems obvious that discourse not only functions as a means of government, of ‘conduct of conduct’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750481313476596">Foucault, 1982</xref>: 220), but more fundamentally is constitutive of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1750481313476596">Rose, 1999b</xref>: 28). Despite this insight, however, the analytical potential of detailed investigations of actual language use has been neglected in more strongly sociologically oriented research on neoliberal governmentality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750481313476596">Kauppinen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750481313476596">Milani, 2009</xref>). By bringing this aspect of actual language use to the fore and making it investigable by means of linguistically oriented discourse analysis, the present study seeks to contribute to filling this gap.</p>
<p>As its main analytical tool the study uses the concept of <italic>discourses</italic>, understood here as historically contingent signification practices which signify a particular part of the world from a particular perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750481313476596">Fairclough, 1992</xref>: 3, 4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750481313476596">Foucault, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750481313476596">Lazar, 2006</xref>: 506) and thus ‘systematically form the objects of which they speak’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750481313476596">Foucault, 1978</xref>: 49). Although discourses get realized through language and other semiotic modes, that is, through discourse, they are understood here as something inherently social and thus irreducible to their linguistic/multisemiotic manifestation. This is seen rather as a sign of their presence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750481313476596">Foucault, 1978</xref>: 49; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750481313476596">Lazar, 2006</xref>: 506; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750481313476596">Pietikäinen and Mäntynen, 2009</xref>: 51). Due to this two-fold nature, discourses can be used, from the analytical point of view, to investigate the multiple connections between the micro-level of actual language use and the wider social, political, economic, etc. processes (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750481313476596">Lazar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750481313476596">Pietikäinen and Mäntynen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750481313476596">Scollon and Wong Scollon, 2004</xref>). It is especially this aspect that makes the concept of discourses particularly suitable for the purposes of the present study. Let us now, after these considerations, turn to the data and the method of the study.</p>

<title>The study data and method</title>
<sec id="section7-1750481313476596">
<title>The data from the German edition of <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic></title>
<p>The women’s magazine <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic> came on the market in 1964 in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1750481313476596">Winship, 1987</xref>: 106). Today, <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic> appears in 64 versions in over 100 countries, has 78 million readers and ranks as the world’s bestselling women’s magazine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1750481313476596">MVG Cosmopolitan, n.d.</xref>). The German edition was launched in 1980 and has currently around 350,000 readers, mainly in German-speaking countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1750481313476596">MVG Cosmopolitan/Auflagen, n.d.</xref>). The data of the present study derive from the 12 issues of the German edition of the magazine from the year 2006.</p>
<p>The central topic areas in the German <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic> include fashion, beauty, sex, work, money, relationships and popular psychology. As to the genres of the magazine, over half of the 200 pages in an average issue consist of straightforward advertisements. The second largest proportion is made up of reviews showcasing among other things the latest fashion and beauty trends, holiday destinations, cars, books, films and occasionally also men, and reporting the results of the latest research on psychological aspects of sexuality, partnership and work. The third largest share is taken by feature articles, which mainly deal with sex, work, partnership and popular psychological matters and frequently make use of the genres <italic>advice, interview</italic> or <italic>biography</italic>. In addition, the magazine offers portraits of successful career women, actors and singers, psychological tests and columns, as well as a horoscope, which mainly deals with sex, relationships and work. (For a more detailed description, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750481313476596">Kauppinen, 2012</xref>.) Although the topic <italic>work</italic> does not feature particularly prominently in the magazine in quantitative terms, it represents a central domain in <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic>’s brand (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750481313476596">Machin and Van Leeuwen, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1750481313476596">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>As shown elsewhere, the discourse of postfeminist self-management figures in all the main topic areas of the German edition of the magazine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750481313476596">Kauppinen, 2012</xref>). It plays a particularly central role, however, in articles relating to the domain of work, and especially in the feature articles on this topic. In the 12 issues from the year 2006, there are altogether 12 feature articles dealing explicitly with the topic of work. (These articles are marked with the heading <italic>Job</italic> at the top of the pages.) As these 12 articles both constitute the total number of feature articles relating to the topic <italic>work</italic> in the year examined and also illustrate the operation of the discourse of postfeminist self-management particularly well, the following analysis focuses on a sample of these 12 articles. The articles are an average of four pages long. Ten of the articles give advice, and in the other two selected women describe their own career paths. Nine of the articles are cover stories, which means that there is a catch-line referring to the article on the cover of the magazine. In terms of their structure, the 12 articles are very similar. After the title there is a lead-in summing up the core message of the article. Then comes (in most cases) an introduction, and after that the body text, which is divided into sections, each containing one particular piece of advice or presenting the career path of a particular woman. About one-third of the space is taken up with illustrations.</p>

<sec id="section8-1750481313476596">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The discourse of postfeminist self-management can be described as a signification practice that constructs different domains of life as areas in which women can, by dint of expert strategies and tips, independently and self-confidently achieve various kinds of goals related to their own success, happiness and well-being. The discourse was identified through a cyclical process of close examination of the data (at this point the whole year 2006) and investigation of the various contexts in which this is embedded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1750481313476596">5</xref></sup> The initial identification was followed by a detailed investigation of the main signs for the presence of the discourse in these particular data and subsequently an analysis of the linguistic features<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1750481313476596">6</xref></sup> through which these signs and the discourse were realized there (now focusing on the sample described above) (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750481313476596">Lazar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1750481313476596">Sunderland, 2000</xref>). On this basis the investigation moved on to the level of operation of the discourse and focused eventually on the connections between the discourse and wider social processes, especially those related to postfeminism and neoliberalism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750481313476596">Lazar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1750481313476596">Scollon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750481313476596">Scollon and Wong Scollon, 2004</xref>: 10–11).</p>

<title>The discourse of postfeminist self-management in the data</title>
<p>In this section, we examine how the discourse of postfeminist self-management manifests itself and how it operates in the data, focusing on the sample of 12 feature articles relating to the domain of work. The examination begins with a description of the main signs of the discourse and the characteristics of its operation in these data. After this, for a more detailed investigation, we zoom in on two exemplary articles from the sample and from them we also start to make connections to (post-)feminism and neoliberalism respectively.</p>
<sec id="section10-1750481313476596">
<title>Signs and operation of the discourse in the data: An overview</title>
<p>In the data examined here, the discourse of postfeminist self-management finds expression through five central signs, which are:</p>
<list id="list1-1750481313476596" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>constructing discursively a goal oriented ethos, or quite explicitly, goals;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>providing ‘strategies’, or different kinds of methods and tricks, for achieving the goals;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>signifying the goals always as something for the reader herself, often attributing to the reader an a priori wish to achieve such goals;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>stressing the maximal character of the goals: what is to be achieved with the help of the strategies is nothing less than ‘<italic>maximal</italic> success’ and ‘<italic>full</italic> power’ at work;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>signifying expert strategies, or rather, expert knowledge as a kind of power resource, which enables the reader to achieve her goals independently and confidently.</p></list-item></list>
<p>In the sample, the discourse manifests itself especially clearly in the articles giving advice, where it governs virtually the whole of every article. In eight of these the reader is guided on how to get ahead in her career and to be successful. This goal is indexed, for example, by the final construction <italic>Zum Erfolg</italic> (‘to success’), like in the titles <italic>Mit Recht zum Erfolg</italic> (‘Rightfully to success’) and <italic>Clever und charmant zum Erfolg</italic> (‘Cleverly and charmingly to success’), and the verbs <italic>weiterkommen</italic> (‘get ahead’) and <italic>weiterbringen</italic> (‘to help on’), the latter exemplified by the promise <italic>Diese cleveren Ideen bringen Sie garantiert weiter</italic> (‘these clever ideas will certainly help you on’). In this connection, goal orientation is at times additionally boosted by references to the reader’s own goals, as in the article <italic>Mit Recht zum Erfolg</italic>, whose lead-in begins ‘Wer seine Ziele im Job erreichen will, braucht nicht nur Talent . . .’ (‘Those who want to achieve their goals at work need more than just talent . . .’). Two of the articles, on the other hand, instruct the reader on how to keep energetic and motivated in her daily working life. For instance, in the catch-line on the cover of the issue for June, these goals are expressed by three nouns referring to these states and a subsequent infinitive structure as follows: <italic>Power, Motivation, Spaß. 11 Wege, sich jeden Tag neu in den Job zu verlieben</italic> (‘Power, motivation, fun. 11 ways to fall in love with your job every day anew’). As the goals are related to the personal success and well-being of the reader at work, so also the strategies for achieving these goals are characterized by a fundamental individualism. The observation made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750481313476596">Machin and van Leeuwen (2003</xref>: 505) in their study on <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic> holds true here; they state that ‘Whatever they [women] are counselled to do, the possibility of support from other people is not envisaged . . . It is all up to the individual, who must, alone, face the world using survival strategies . . .’ What the women are advised to do, then, includes acquiring strategies for self-assertion and self-presentation, learning to manage their emotions and to know their legal rights, and adopting (mental) techniques for self-motivation and stress management. In the articles these are presented as not only exceedingly powerful, but also indispensable means for success and happiness in working life.</p>
<p>Against this background, let us move on to investigate the manifestation and operation of the discourse in more detail, using the example of two representative articles from the sample. In the extracts the signs for the presence of the discourse are marked in bold.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Example 1: Ten silver bullets to success</bold></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Zehn Königswege zum Erfolg</italic> (‘Ten Silver Bullets to Success’)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1750481313476596">7</xref></sup> is one of the many articles in the data which guide and advice the reader in her (assumed) aspirations to get ahead in her career. The catch-line on the cover tempts with the promise:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Souverän ans Ziel. Die zehn effektivsten Erfolgsgeheimnisse der Top-Coaches</italic></p>
<p><bold>Competently achieving your goal. The ten most effective secrets of success of top coaches</bold> (Excerpt 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>which in the table of contents is presented as follows:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Zehn Königswege zum Erfolg. Wir haben Top-Coaches nach ihren Karriere-Mantras</italic></p> <p>für den maximalen Erfolg gefragt</p>
<p><bold>Ten silver bullets to success. We have asked top coaches for their career mantras for maximal success</bold> (Excerpt 2)</p>
<p>At the head of the article the title proclaims once more:</p>
<p><italic>Zehn Königswege zum Erfolg</italic></p>
<p><bold>Ten Silver Bullets to Success</bold> (Excerpt 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>after which the lead-in poses the rhetorical and suggestive question in the voice of the reader:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Wie erreiche ich meine Ziele?</italic></p>
<p><bold>How do I achieve my goals?</bold> (Excerpt 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>and answers immediately in the voice of the editorial staff:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Wir haben Top-Coaches nach ihrem Karriere-Mantra gefragt</italic></p>
<p><bold>We have asked top coaches for their career mantras</bold> (Excerpt 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Subsequently, the introduction to the article explains:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Manche Sätze begleiten uns ein ganzes Berufsleben lang. Weil sie zeitlos sind, in unterschiedlichsten Situationen anwendbar, aber trotzdem immer den Kern der Sache treffen. Um solche markanten <bold>Leitformel</bold> für den Job zu finden, haben wir <bold>führende Berater aus dem deutschsprachigen Raum</bold> gebeten, uns <bold>ihre wichtigste Maxime</bold> preiszugeben und zu erläutern. <bold>Denn sie alle haben im Laufe ihrer Coaching-Karriere jeweils eine zentrale These herausgefiltert, die die Quintessenz ihres umfangreichen Wissens und ihrer Erfahrung darstellt. Das Ergebnis unserer Recherchen wird Sie sicher weiterbringen</bold>. Viel Erfolg!</italic></p>
<p>Some phrases accompany us throughout our professional life. Because they are timeless, applicable in the most varied situations, but still always get to the heart of the matter. To find out <bold>such important leading formulas</bold> for the job, we asked <bold>leading consultants in the German-speaking region</bold> to share with us and explain <bold>their most important maxims</bold>. For each of them has <bold>chrystallized one central thesis in the course of his/her coaching career which represents the essence of his/her comprehensive knowledge and experience. The result of our inquiry will certainly help you on</bold>. We wish you success! (Excerpt 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In these first parts of the article the discourse of postfeminist self-management finds expression primarily through a multiple repetition of the two central signs of the discourse: the construction of a goal-oriented ethos, or goals, effected, for example, through the final structures <italic>ans Ziel</italic> (‘achieving your goal’) and <italic>zum Erfolg</italic> (‘to success’), and the subsequent or preceding reference to means through which the goals can be achieved, for example, through the metaphor <italic>Königswege</italic> (‘silver bullets’) and the expression <italic>Karriere-Mantras</italic> (‘career mantras’). Additionally, as the attributive adjective <italic>maximal</italic> in the table of contents (Excerpt 2) emphasizes, what can be achieved is not just some, but the biggest possible success. As is further suggested by the rhetorical question in Excerpt 4 asked ostensibly in the voice of the reader, <italic>Wie erreiche ich meine Ziele?</italic> (‘How do I achieve my goals?’), what is going on here is not just offering the reader the possibility of achieving success in her career, but of realizing her own wish to achieve her own goals in her working life. In addition to these features, the discourse of postfeminist self-management expresses itself through the signification of the expert knowledge, or ‘mantras’, offered here as exceedingly effective. These are presented as a mighty power resource, especially through the abundant use of attributes such as <italic>die effektivsten</italic> (‘the most effective’), <italic>markant</italic> (‘important’), <italic>führend</italic> (‘leading’) and <italic>wichtigste</italic> (‘most important’) (Extracts 1 and 6), words which will enhance the feeling of power and competence that has already been evoked. Besides these references, the feeling of power is boosted by the description in Excerpt 6, which evokes the image of the reader as sovereign in her empire and of the experts as courtly advisers who are giving her the best advice possible in that realm. The metaphor <italic>Königswege</italic> and the adverb <italic>souverän</italic> (‘confidently’) contribute to the feeling of effortless and competent advancement.</p>
<p>The attempt to help the reader to get ahead in her career expressed here in the frame of the discourse of postfeminist self-management might well evoke a feeling of feminist engagement. What the discourse also does, however, is to create an idea of work as a domain of life in which it all boils down to the ability to confidently and competently pursue one’s own goals and head for maximal success (whatever that may be) by utilizing what are alleged to be exceedingly powerful expert strategies.</p>
<p>The remainder of the article <italic>Zehn Königswege zum Erfolg</italic> presents and explains the 10 ‘career mantras’ of the 10 ‘top coaches’, each in its own section. The first of these, the advice of the psychologist Madeleine Leitner, entitled ‘Designen Sie sich Ihren Job selbst’ (‘Design your own job’) reads as follows:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Sie haben eine gute Stelle, sind aber unzufrieden? „Oft sind es nur Kleinigkeiten, die zum Glück fehlen“, sagt Madeleine Leitner. Und die lassen sich ändern, wenn wir die Sache aktiv angehen. „</italic>
<bold><italic>Drehen Sie den Spieß um und gestalten Sie Ihren Job selbst</italic></bold><italic>“, rät die Psychologin</italic>. <bold><italic>Was stört Sie? Was ist Ihnen wirklich wichtig? Was lässt sich ändern? Warum nicht einen Teil der Arbeit im Home-Office erledigen? Oder in ein anderes Team wechseln?</italic></bold> <italic>Möglich ist vieles</italic>. <bold><italic>Vorausgesetzt Sie wissen, was Sie wollen.</italic></bold></p>
<p>You have a good job, but you aren’t satisfied? ‘Often it is just small things that are missing from your happiness’, Madeleine Leitner says. And they can be changed when we go about it actively. ‘<bold>Turn the tables and arrange your job yourself</bold>’, the psychologist advises. <bold>What is it that bothers you? What is really important to you? What can be changed? Why not do part of your job in your office at home? Or move to another team?</bold> There are plenty of possibilities. <bold>Providing you know what you want.</bold> (Excerpt 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The extract provides a telling example of the ‘strategies’ provided in the framework of the discourse of postfeminist self-management in the data. As Ruth Wodak and Ina Wagner show in their study of the biographies of professionally successful women, the possibility of designing one’s own working environment indeed contributes to feelings of success and enjoyment in working life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1750481313476596">Wodak and Wagner, 2006</xref>: 398, 399). The discourse of postfeminist self-management clearly draws on this insight here. While evoking a sense of action and autonomy (e.g. through the encouragement <italic>Turn the tables and arrange your job yourself)</italic>, the discourse uses suggestive questions to guide the reader to deep introspection so that she can recognize her own feelings and wishes. This, moreover, is presented (through the conditional conjunction <italic>providing</italic>) as a necessary (and the only) requirement for seizing the allegedly many possibilities for change. What these changes may be like is then indicated through further suggestive questions which effectively guide the reader to autonomously re-arrange her own working habits in order to overcome her unhappiness at work.</p>
<p>Subsequently, another piece of advice, that of Sabine Dembkowski, founder and leader of The Coaching Center, entitled ‘Wechseln Sie Ihre Perspektive’ (‘Change your perspective’), advises the reader, in order to gain more recognition at work, to bring her activities at work into line with the goals of her boss. Alongside the advice the caption declares: ‘Wer den gewohnten Blickwinkel ändert, kann nur gewinnen’ (‘Those who change their usual way of looking at things can only win’). Other ‘top coaches’ give advice about how to appear self-confident, become more self-assertive and effective at work, how to overcome stress and anxiety, how to push one’s market value and how to build networks. Variable as these many instructions may seem, what they have in common is that they invariably guide the reader to work on herself: to change and modify her attitudes and behavior, get rid of her allegedly usual habits, acquire new skills. And more importantly, the ways of acting and modes of thinking she is advised to adopt, not the least of which is the will to succeed, are entirely compatible with those expected from entrepreneurial employees in the contemporary world of work (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750481313476596">Boltanski and Chiapello, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750481313476596">Bröckling, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Example 2: Full power despite stress</bold></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Besides offering guidance on how to get ahead in a career, <italic>Cosmopolitan Germany</italic> empathetically advises its readers, as already noted, on how to remain energetic and motivated at work. The article <italic>Volle Power trotz Stress</italic> (‘Full Power despite Stress’) offers an example of this aspect. The catch-line on the cover of the issue temptingly offers:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Gut gelaunt, gelassen &amp; erfolgreich im Job. Kein Stress! Strategien, mit denen Sie einen Burn-out vermeiden</italic></p>
<p><bold>Good-humored, calm &amp; successful in your job. No stress! Strategies to help you avoid burn-out</bold>. (Excerpt 8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The table of contents repeats the offer with a slight variation, as follows:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Volle Power trotz Stress: Zwölf Strategien, wie Sie ein Burn-out vermeiden</italic></p>
<p><bold>Full power despite stress: twelve strategies to avoid burn-out.</bold> (Excerpt 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And in the actual article the title tempts once more:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Volle Power despite Stress</italic></p>
<p><bold>Full power despite stress.</bold> (Excerpt 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Also here the discourse of postfeminist self-management finds its most obvious expression though the construction of a goal (or goals) and the subsequent reference to strategies, here with the very noun <italic>strategies</italic>, through which the goal can be achieved. What is offered here is the chance to avoid burn-out and instead, as the positively connoted attributes in the catch-line (excerpt 8) together with the emphatic exclamation <italic>Kein Stress!</italic> (‘No stress!’) suggest, to remain good-humored, calm and successful. Subsequently, the table of contents (excerpt 9) and the title of the article (excerpt 10) add another dimension to these attributes, which after all rather lack dynamism, by suggesting that not only tranquility and harmony can be maintained, but also full power. While the noun <italic>power</italic> brings in the qualities of strength and energy, the attribute <italic>full</italic> raises them to maximum capacity. Also here, then, what can be achieved (or at least should be aspired to) is nothing less than the maximum. The instrumental construction <italic>Strategien, mit denen Sie einen Burn-out vermeiden</italic> (‘strategies to help you avoid burn out’; literally, ‘with the help of which you can avoid burn out’) emphasizes in turn the agentive power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750481313476596">Lazar, 2006</xref>: 510) of the reader by rendering her (by directly addressing her with the pronoun <italic>Sie</italic> (‘you’)) the actor of the action that is mentioned (Burn-out vermeiden; ‘avoid burn-out’) and by making the strategies the means through which she will be able to carry this out. This aspect of agentive power is also emphasized in the title <italic>volle Power trotz Stress</italic> (‘full power despite stress’), which through the pronoun <italic>trotz</italic> (‘despite’) evokes the notion of resisting or fighting against (stress) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750481313476596">Lazar, 2006</xref>: 510). In fact, ‘full power’ can be seen as the antithesis of burn-out. Together these features make it clear that this is about the reader’s chance to take action and to contribute to her own well-being. After these introductory parts of the article the lead-in repeats essentially the same message, which the introduction then develops as follows:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Die meisten von uns arbeiten schneller, länger und mehr denn je. Wir machen Überstunden, nehmen als Freiberufler jeden Auftrag an, oder leisten bei der Realisierung von Projekten in kurzer Zeit das doppelte Pensum. Kein Wunder, dass wir immer häufiger das Gefühl haben, unsere Energiereserven würden zur Neige gehen und uns ausgebrannt zurücklassen</italic>. <bold><italic>In dieser schnellen Arbeitswelt brauchen wir besondere Strategien, um Ressourcen zu sparen und körperliche und seelische Kraft zu tanken. Effektiv müssen sie sein, und möglichst wenig Aufwand kosten.</italic></bold> <italic>Wir haben neun</italic> <bold><italic>Experten</italic></bold> <italic>gebeten, zu verschiedenen Bereichen wir Ernährung, Entspannung oder Arbeitsgestaltung</italic> <bold><italic>Tipps zu geben, mit denen Sie gelassen, gut gelaunt und erfolgreich durch die anstrengenden Phasen im Job kommen.</italic></bold></p>
<p>Most of us work faster, longer and more than ever before. We work overtime, as a freelancer accept every order, or in carrying out projects do a double workload in a short time. No wonder that more and more often we have the feeling that our energy reserves are running short and leaving us with burn-out. <bold>In this high-speed working environment we need special strategies to save our resources and to stock up on physical and mental energy. They have to be effective and cost as little effort as possible.</bold> We asked nine <bold>experts for advice</bold> in different areas such as nutrition, relaxation and job design <bold>which will help you to get through the stressful phases at work good-humouredly and successfully.</bold> (Excerpt 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The introduction shows a change in tone, from upbeat enthusiasm to gritty realism, and in doing so brings out strikingly clearly the fundamental neoliberal premise of the discourse of postfeminist self-management. Not only the conditions of work nowadays, but also their increasingly (‘more and more often we have the feeling’) disastrous consequences for ‘us’ working under them, are presented as entirely natural, as simply the state of things today. The evaluative comment <italic>kein Wunder</italic> (‘no wonder’) works to additionally highlight the naturalness of the consequences. What this description effectively does, then, is to render the notion of changing or even criticizing these conditions unthinkable. What is (allegedly) needed, instead, is acquiring strategies. As the verb <italic>need</italic> in the explanation beginning ‘In this high-speed working environment we need special strategies . . .’ indicates, it is no longer only a matter of boosting one’s well-being, but it is also a matter of survival.</p>
<p>As has already been indicated in the introduction, the strategies presented in the remainder of the article offer a comprehensive program for rescuing the stressed-out self. The measures include organizing one’s tasks at work according to one’s inner rhythm, tuning one’s relationship to meet the requirements of the stressful phase, changing one’s diet to a particular ‘anti-stress menu’, and adopting a range of strengthening and relaxing physical and mental exercises to be carried out whenever possible during the working day. An example of the latter offers the advice of the ‘psychologist and relaxation teacher’ Udo Mascher-Hütten, which reads as follows:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Ort der Ruhe: Im Kopf auf Fantasiereise gehen</italic></p>
<p><italic>“Suchen Sie sich Ihren persönlichen Ruheort, an dem Sie sich wohl fühlen, etwa einen Strand oder eine Waldlichtung. Nehmen Sie sich im Stress drei bis fünf Minuten Pause und stellen Sie sich diesen Platz möglichst genau vor. Was sehen, hören oder fühlen Sie? Wenn es Ihnen schwer fällt, etwa im Großraumbüro, abzuschalten, legen Sie sich einen Anker für Ihre Fantasien zu: eine Muschel vom Strand, Kopfhörer und CD oder ein Foto vom letzten Urlaub als Bildschirmschoner.”</italic></p>
<p>A place of tranquility: Take a fantasy trip in your head</p>
<p><bold>Find a place where you yourself feel tranquil, where you feel good, for instance a beach or a forest glade. When under stress, take a break of three to five minutes and picture yourself in this place as precisely as possible. What do you see, hear or feel? If it feels difficult for instance in an open-plan office to kick back, always have something handy to stimulate your imagination: a shell from the beach, headphones and a CD or use a photo from your last holiday as a screensaver.</bold> (Excerpt 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here the reader is encouraged to use her memories and imagination to ‘take a fantasy trip’ whenever she feels stressed at work; on the one hand, she is directly instructed to do this by the imperatives <italic>Suchen Sie sich</italic> (‘find’), <italic>Stellen Sie sich vor</italic> (‘picture’) and <italic>nehmen Sie sich [. . .] Pause</italic> (‘take a break’), and on the other hand she is led on more subtly by the suggestive question <italic>Was sehen, hören oder fühlen Sie?</italic> (‘What do you see, hear or feel?’). Despite the intended relaxing effect, she should not, however, drift away with her dreams altogether, but must always keep an eye on the time, as the time specification <italic>drei bis fünf Minuten</italic> (‘three to five minutes’) reminds her. The reader is then being helped to overcome the potential difficulties posed by her circumstances in carrying out the exercise by the suggestion to have something handy for her dreams. Thus armed with detailed instructions for this well-controlled mental escapism, she should be a little bit better able to avoid the danger of burning out at work. The extract offers an illustration not only of the operation of the discourse of postfeminist self-management in this article, but also of a wealth of similar mental techniques that the discourse provides in the field of work in <italic>Cosmopolitan Germany</italic>.</p>
<p>All in all, the discourse of postfeminist self-management evokes here an image of a power femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750481313476596">Lazar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1750481313476596">Wolf, 1993</xref>), a woman who competently manages her life against all odds, maintains full power despite stress; a femininity which the reader is invited to adopt herself. I do not wish to suggest that this image is a spurious one, nor that the strategies offered will probably not work. They well might, and in fact they should, for the discourse of postfeminist self-management bears here the same double-bind as it did in the article <italic>Zehn Königswege zum Erfolg</italic> (and does in the rest of the articles of the sample as well), namely: the more enthusiastically she strives for success and fulfillment, the more vigorously she makes efforts to control her stress and avoid burn-out, ‘the greater [is] the benefit to the company’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1750481313476596">Rose, 1999a</xref>: 56).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The aim of this article was to investigate the interconnectedness of two current social phenomena, postfeminism and neoliberalism, in the domain of work in the context of contemporary popular media culture. For this purpose, the analysis focused on the operation of a ‘discourse of postfeminist self-management’ in feature articles giving advice in the domain of work in the German edition of <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic>. This concluding section considers the social and political implications of this signification practice and its consequences with regard to contemporary femininity.</p>
<p>The obvious effort to assist women in their working lives that finds expression here through the discourse of postfeminist self-management and the feeling of empowerment, control, competence and agency that the discourse evokes, easily brings about an <italic>ethos</italic> of feminist engagement that could be characterized as popular power feminism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750481313476596">Gauntlett, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1750481313476596">Wolf, 1993</xref>) or aspirational feminism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1750481313476596">Winship, 1987</xref>). As the analysis shows, however, the <italic>logic</italic> of the discourse of postfeminist self-management is that of neoliberal governmentality. Thus, rather than feminist action of any kind, what is going on here, I suggest, is gender-specific neoliberal governance, whereby the subversive power of feminism is systematically turned into a productive force for the (self-)production of entrepreneurial subjects (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750481313476596">Bröckling et al., 2004</xref>: 14). Contrary to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750481313476596">David Machin and Joanna Thornborrow (2003</xref>: 466) suggest in their study on <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic>, the reader of the German edition is not advised to play naughty in the workplace, but instead, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750481313476596">Ros Ballaster and her colleagues (1991</xref>: 140) have noted, the advice offered is rather sound. What this advice does, however, along with the rest of the discourse of postfeminist self-management, is to lead readers to participate enthusiastically in the neoliberalized order of the world of work without leaving them any room for doubt or criticism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1750481313476596">McRobbie, 2004</xref>: 260).</p>
<p>The operation of the discourse of postfeminist self-management here is well in line with the statement of the German Federal Administration quoted earlier in the article in the section ‘Postfeminism, women and work’, which said: ‘it is necessary, not least on account of the rapid economic, technological, structural and demographic change, to use the high professional potential of women in Germany as well as possible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750481313476596">BMFSFJ Erwerbstätigkeit, n.d.</xref>). From a different position, Angela McRobbie reflects on the same issue:<disp-quote>
<p>Nowadays the young woman’s success seems to promise economic prosperity on the basis of her enthusiasm for work and having a career. [. . .] Armed with good qualifications and having been encouraged to display enthusiasm and willingness to pursue careers as a mark of new and independent sexual identities, this female participation becomes an important feature of the success of the new economy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1750481313476596">McRobbie, 2009</xref>: 58, 82)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Women thus become subjects of success in the whole double sense of the expression; and not only of their own success, but increasingly also of the success of neoliberalized societies, at the same time as they – we – are being assured that in contemporary Western societies feminism in the ‘traditional’ sense is no longer relevant.</p>

<p>However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750481313476596">Silke Bothfeld (2005</xref>: 111) points out, the increase in women’s employment in Germany during the 1990s can be explained entirely by the expansion of part-time employment, indicating clearly that there still is a long way to go to actual equality between men and women.</p>

<p>The discourse of postfeminist self-management seems to play a vital role not only in the data of the present study, but also in the whole format of <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic> as well as in other contemporary women’s magazines, as the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750481313476596">David Machin and Theo van Leeuwen (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750481313476596">David Gauntlett (2002)</xref> indicate. Furthermore, it definitely figures in the fairly recent but rapidly expanding genre of make-over shows (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750481313476596">Gill, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1750481313476596">McRobbie, 2009</xref>) and in the continuously growing field of self-help, or rather, self-management literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750481313476596">Gauntlett, 2002</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-1750481313476596">
<label>6.</label>
<p>As it soon became clear that this discourse manifests itself first and foremost through the linguistic (and not the visual, i.e. images), the examination concentrated on linguistic features.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-1750481313476596">
<label>7.</label>
<p>The meaning of the German expression <italic>Königsweg</italic> (lit., ‘king’s road’) approximates to the English expression <italic>silver bullet</italic> in so far as it denotes an easy and uncomplicated solution to a problem. What this translation leaves out, however, is the reference to kingship and the idea of a road. The former is crucial here in that the article plays in different ways with the notion of kingship, or rather ‘queenship’: the photos show a female model posing in a ‘sovereign manner’ with a severe expression on her powdered white face and her hands on her hips, wearing a crown and heavy jewelry, dressed in a glamorous evening dress. The adverb <italic>souverän</italic> in Excerpt 1 and the description in Excerpt 6 also connect to this imagery. The idea of a road, in turn, contributes to the notion of getting ahead.</p>
