<abstract>
<p>Hume’s theory of justice is commonly regarded by contemporary theorists of justice as a theory of justice as mutual advantage. It is thus widely thought to manifest all the unattractive features of such theories: in particular, it is thought to endorse the exclusion of people with serious mental or physical disabilities from the scope and protection of justice and to justify the European expropriation of the lands of defenceless aboriginal people. I argue that this reading of Hume is mistaken. Mutual advantage is only part of Hume’s theory, the part that explains the origins of the institutions of justice in a general sense (property and promise keeping), and it is bracketed off from those parts of Hume’s theory that explain who is included within the scope of justice, how much each receives, and why and to whom we have a duty to be just. The interpretation of Hume’s theory as a theory of justice as mutual advantage not only fails to convey Hume’s complex purposes, but it portrays Hume’s theory of justice as the kind of theory he was most concerned to refute.</p>

<body>
<p>Hume’s theory of justice consists of three components: a theory of the origins of justice, which is based on the principles of self-interest and mutual advantage, a separate explanation of the rules of justice, which draws on Hume’s theory of the imagination and the principle of utility, and finally a theory of the artificial virtues in which our approbation of justice and the duty to obey the laws of justice are grounded in sympathy with the public interest. It is the principle of mutual advantage, however, that has come to occupy centre stage in contemporary interpretations of Hume. His theory of justice as a whole is now routinely classified as a theory of ‘justice as mutual advantage’ and it has been given a prominent position in a history of such theories, which begins with the sceptical views of Glaucon and Thrasymachus in Plato’s <italic>Republic</italic>, includes the theories of Hobbes and Hume, and is represented in the modern era by David Gauthier, James Buchanan, and, on some readings, by John Rawls.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this modern reading, Hume’s theory of justice is widely thought to manifest all the unattractive features of theories of justice as mutual advantage. In particular, weak and defenceless human beings are excluded from the protection and scope of justice, a conclusion that Hume is commonly thought to be drawing explicitly in <italic>An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals</italic> when he argues that justice only exists among creatures of roughly equal strength (1998: 3.18–19).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470594X11433738">1</xref>
</sup> Thus, Hume is thought to have endorsed the exclusion of people with serious mental or physical disabilities from the scope of justice and to have justified the European expropriation of the lands of defenceless aboriginal people.</p>
<p>This reading of Hume has been influential in shaping certain strands of contemporary theory. The idea that justice is somehow rooted in the principle of rough equality of strength was part of Hume’s account of what Rawls termed the ‘circumstances of justice’ – those facts about human circumstances and dispositions that make justice necessary and possible. Rawls’s explicit adoption of Hume’s circumstances of justice has been identified as one of the sources of the exclusion of people with serious disabilities from the scope of Rawls’s theory of justice. Critics have argued that the presence of these Humean elements within Rawls’s theory conflict with Rawls’s belief that justice entails adopting an impartial point of view and that inequalities arising from morally arbitrary disadvantages are unjust.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470594X11433738">2</xref>
</sup> Martha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470594X11433738">Nussbaum (2006</xref>: 220), taking a broader view, identifies the Humean account of the circumstances of justice as one of the traditional starting points for liberal political theory, and argues that it has been damaging in undermining the principle of the equal worth of all persons.</p>
<p>My aim in this article is to defend Hume’s theory from this critical reading. I shall argue that it is not the case that Hume excludes the weak and disabled from the scope and protection of justice, nor is it the case, as it is commonly maintained, that the terms of justice reflect bargaining power. The critical reading goes astray because it fails to see that mutual advantage is only part of Hume’s theory, the part that explains the origins and necessity of the foundational institutions of property and promise keeping. However, mutual advantage is bracketed off from those parts of the theory that explain who is included within the scope of justice, how much each receives, and why and to whom we have a duty to be just.</p>
<p>The interpretation of Hume’s theory of justice that focuses entirely on the principle of mutual advantage is thus an attenuated and misleading one, which has obscured Hume’s own particular purposes as well as the coherence of his moral and political theory as a whole. His attempt to show, against the proponents of the ‘selfish system of morals’, that our moral approbation of justice, and our duty to be just, involve adopting an impartial and disinterested point of view is either lost sight of altogether or is judged to be incompatible with the main thrust of his theory of justice as mutual advantage. His critical reference to the European colonists who plundered America is read as an endorsement of their belief that their behaviour was just, and as a justification for any kind of maltreatment of the weak by the strong. More generally, Hume’s political purposes in challenging the different forms of contractarianism that were prevalent in his day are entirely overlooked. In all these areas the interpretation of Hume’s theory as a theory of justice as mutual advantage not only fails to convey Hume’s complex purposes, but it portrays Hume’s own theory as the kind of theory he was most concerned to refute.</p>
<p>When an interpretation of a past thinker becomes as well established as the one under consideration, it is important to understand why it has taken hold in the way it has. With this in mind, Part 1 examines the way in which a number of contemporary authors have read Hume. Particular attention is devoted to the work of Brian Barry, whose influential discussion of justice as mutual advantage contains three distinct interpretations of the role of mutual advantage in Hume’s theory. First, according to Hume, the <italic>basic institutions of justice</italic> (property rights and promise keeping) only develop between people who are capable of mutual harm. Weak and defenceless human beings are thus left out of the protection of these institutions. Terms such as ‘just’ and ‘unjust’ only apply between people who are roughly equal in strength with at least some capacity to inflict harm and retaliate against harm done to them. They have no relevance in situations in which there is an extreme disparity of strength. Second, according to Hume, a capacity for mutual harm is relevant to the determination of the <italic>terms of justice</italic>, and not just the basic institutions of justice. Justice is seen as the outcome of a bargain in which the capacity to harm or credibly threaten to harm determines how much each person receives. The weak inevitably receive little or, in some cases, nothing. Third, according to theories of justice as mutual advantage, Hume’s included, mutual advantage is the sole <italic>criterion</italic> for a just set of rules. Barry interpreted the ‘rules’ broadly to include both the basic rules or institutions of property agreed to in the circumstances of justice and also the terms of particular treaties, such as those signed by the powerful European colonists and the indigenous people of America. Thus, Barry argued, any agreement, however unequal, is just as long as it benefits both parties. Moreover, according to Barry, if mutual advantage is the sole criterion of justice and thus the sole ground of our duty to be just, it follows that it is just for either party to renege on an agreement as soon as that party ceases to benefit from its terms.</p>
<p>In Part 2, I examine these three interpretations in turn and argue that there is no foundation for any of them. With respect to the claim that Hume’s theory excludes weak and defenceless people from the basic institutions of justice, I present two counter-arguments. First, I provide a reading of Hume’s convention in which a capacity for mutual harm is relevant at the level of the species rather than the individual. Hume explains how we develop a self-interested disposition to abstain from the possessions of other human beings, including those human beings who have no capacity to harm us. The second counter-argument is that Hume, in any case, separates the question of the origins of justice from his account of our duty to be just. In addition, it is his account of our duty to be just that explains the objects of these duties. Hume is quite explicit that while the ‘inventors’ of justice considered only their own interest, our duty to treat people justly extends to everyone, including the weak and defenceless.</p>
<p>There is no textual evidence at all for the second claim that Hume thought that the terms of justice that determine the distribution of property are the outcome of a bargain. Hume, in fact, explicitly separates his discussion of the convention, which establishes the basic institutions of justice, from his explanation of the rules of justice. The latter, according to Hume, can be explained by a combination of general utility and the workings of the human imagination. The circumstances of justice, which are relevant to the origins of justice, are not relevant to the determination of the particular rules that determine the property rights of particular individuals.</p>
<p>The third claim, that mutual advantage is, for Hume, the criterion of justice, is also a misreading. For Hume, there are no criteria for a just set of rules – justice is a virtue of people not a criterion of rules or states of affairs. Barry’s contention that the mistreatment of the American Indians by the European colonists was just according to Hume’s theory is, therefore, unfounded.</p>
<p>I conclude the article with some observations on Hume’s alleged conservatism and on the broader implications of misinterpreting his theory of justice.</p>
<sec id="section1-1470594X11433738">
<title>1. Hume as a theorist of justice as mutual advantage</title>
<p>The most direct textual evidence that Hume’s theory of justice excludes the weak and defenceless from the scope of justice is the following passage from the <italic>Enquiry</italic>. Because of the centrality of this passage to what follows, it is necessary to quote it in full.<disp-quote>
<p>Were there a species of creatures, intermingled with men, which though rational, were possessed of such inferior strength, both of body and mind, that they were incapable of all resistance, and could never, upon the highest provocation, make us feel the effects of their resentment; the necessary consequence, I think, is that we should be bound, by the laws of humanity to give gentle usage to these creatures, but should not, properly speaking, lie under any restraint of justice with regard to them, nor could they possess any right or property, exclusive of such arbitrary lords … And as no inconvenience ever results from the exercise of a power, so firmly established in nature, the restraints of justice and property, being totally useless, would never have place in so unequal a confederacy.</p>
<p>This is plainly the situation of men, with regard to animals; and how far these may be said to possess reason, I leave it to others to determine. The great superiority of civilized <sc>europeans</sc> above barbarous <sc>indians</sc>, tempted us to imagine ourselves on the same footing with regard to them, and made us throw off all restraints of justice, and even of humanity, in our treatment of them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470594X11433738">Hume, 1998</xref>: 3.18–19)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Hume here refers to a ‘species of creatures’ intermingled with human beings, the passage is usually interpreted as a veiled reference to weak and defenceless human beings. Martha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470594X11433738">Nussbaum (2006</xref>: 46), for example, says that it shows Hume applying his insights about the need for rough equality of strength ‘explicitly to the case of disability’. She does not think that Hume was endorsing the European treatment of the people in the countries they colonized and she remarks that their belief in their superiority was a mistake ‘resulting from the temptation of greed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470594X11433738">Nussbaum, 2006</xref>: 48). Nevertheless, the essential point Hume is making, according to Nussbaum, is that ‘we do not need to cooperate with people who are much weaker than the normal case, because we can simply dominate them, as we now dominate nonhuman animals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470594X11433738">Nussbaum, 2006</xref>: 61). Consequently, ‘the much weaker, whether in body or in mind, are simply not part of political society, not subjects of justice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470594X11433738">Nussbaum, 2006</xref>: 48–9).</p>
<p>Allen Buchanan also thinks that the passage refers to defenceless human beings. He says that it shows that in Hume’s theory our rights depend entirely on our capacity to harm others. Buchanan perceives a family resemblance between Hume’s theory and David Gauthier’s contractarian theory, as indeed Gauthier does. In both theories, Buchanan says, our rights depend on our strategic capacities – in Gauthier’s case, our capacity to contribute productively to the cooperative surplus and in Hume’s case our capacity to inflict harm. Those who cannot harm others, or who cannot retaliate to the harm done against them, ‘are entitled to nothing because they have nothing to offer, nothing with which to bargain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X11433738">Buchanan, 1990</xref>: 229). Jonathan Wolff reads the passage in much the same way and remarks that it ‘rather chillingly’ illustrates the idea that justice is a type of bargain, in which ‘might makes right’. The logic of Hume’s theory, according to Wolff, is that ‘if others have nothing to offer us, or things we can take from them independently of what they decide or want, then we have no duties of justice, strictly speaking, towards them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470594X11433738">Wolff, 2006</xref>: 5–6).</p>
<p>Brian Barry also took the <italic>Enquiry</italic> passage to be saying that weak and defenceless human beings are excluded from justice. Like Nussbaum, he acknowledged that Hume says that the Europeans only <italic>imagined</italic> themselves to be above justice in relation to the Indians. But Barry thinks Hume is being disingenuous: ‘Hume must be accused of drawing back from the full implications of his doctrine … on his theory, they <italic>were</italic> above justice in relation to the Indians. Right from the start, the European settlers were able to impose their “lawless will” on the Indians’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X11433738">Barry, 1989</xref>: 162). Barry was sufficiently confident of this reading of the passage to systematically replace Hume’s phrase ‘species of creatures’ with ‘race of creatures’.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, some agreement among contemporary theorists that Hume’s most explicit statement about the significance of disparities in strength should be interpreted to apply to the differences between strong and weak human beings. However, in the two volumes of Brian Barry’s <italic>A Treatise of Social Justice</italic>, it is possible to find three different interpretations of the role of significant disparities in strength in Hume’s theory. I will now discuss these in turn.</p>
<sec id="section2-1470594X11433738">
<title>1.1. The scope of the basic institutions of justice</title>
<p>Barry’s discussion of Hume’s theory in <italic>Theories of Justice</italic> (the first volume of <italic>A Treatise on Social Justice</italic>) is complex, reflecting his view that Hume’s work contained two different theories of justice – justice as mutual advantage and justice as impartiality. He begins by explaining that the theory of justice as mutual advantage can be ‘found in’ Hume’s account of the <italic>origins</italic> of the basic institutions of justice: ‘According to Hume, the only possible foundation upon which the institution of property could have developed is mutual advantage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X11433738">Barry, 1989</xref>: 163). The condition of rough equality of strength, which Hume illustrates in the <italic>Enquiry</italic> passage, is taken by Barry to be one of the circumstances of justice, which he understands to apply to the <italic>basic institutions</italic> of justice. If these conditions did not obtain ‘justice would not be advantageous and the convention of separate property would never have been developed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X11433738">Barry, 1989</xref>: 154). Institutions of property and promising thus only develop between people that have the capacity for mutual harm. Weak and defenceless human beings that have no capacity to inflict significant harm are thus outside of the circumstances of justice and are not party to the convention on justice. They are, as Nussbaum says, not part of political society.</p>
<p>When the Europeans encountered the indigenous people of America they, rightly according to this reading, regarded them as an inferior species of being, on the same footing as animals, and thus outside of political society. They thus quickly reached the conclusion that they had no duties of justice towards them. In particular, they had no duty to respect the claims of the original inhabitants as first occupiers or to enter into bargains or agreements with them to gain their cooperation. Commenting on Sioux chief Red Cloud’s plea for justice, Barry says ‘A follower of Hume would have to say that he [Red Cloud] was mistaken in thinking that right and justice had any place in the relations between Indians and whites, given the superiority of the rifle over the bow and arrow’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X11433738">Barry, 1989</xref>: 162).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1470594X11433738">
<title>1.2. The terms of justice</title>
<p>Alongside this rendering of Hume’s account of the origins of the basic institutions of justice, Barry develops an analysis of theories of justice as mutual advantage, Hume’s included, as theories of bargaining. Differences in strength are significant because they influence bargaining power and hence the <italic>terms</italic> of justice. All mutual advantage theories, according to Barry, explain the terms of justice as the outcome of a self-interested bargain, or settlement of some kind, in which ‘the amount received by the parties under the settlement must reflect their relative bargaining power’. The whole point of such theories, according to Barry, is to ‘translate strength into advantage as smoothly as possible’ (1995: 39–40).</p>
<p>In <italic>Theories of Justice</italic>, Barry presented a systematic and detailed analysis of mutual advantage theories using two-person bargaining theory, and he compares the solutions of John Nash, R.B. Braithwaite and David Gauthier to what he takes to be the central problem of justice – dividing up a scarce resource between self-interested parties. The case of extreme inequality of power discussed by Hume in the <italic>Enquiry</italic> is interpreted in terms of Braithwaite’s example of the two musicians, Matthew and Luke, who live in adjacent apartments and have the same hour of the day in which to practise. Because the two musicians find each other’s playing distracting, they seek an agreement to divide up the scarce time for practising. In general, the amount of practice time each musician is allocated is determined by their ‘threat advantage’ – their capacity to distract each other. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X11433738">Barry (1989</xref>: 161), Hume’s discussion of <italic>extreme</italic> inequality of power, which he illustrates by referring to the encounter between the Europeans and the Indians, is a ‘generalization’ of the case in which one of the musicians is unaffected by the practising of the other and does not, therefore, need an agreement.</p>
<p>However, Barry found a particularly close correspondence between Hume’s theory and the theory of James Buchanan, according to which fighting in a state of nature establishes a ‘natural distribution’ in which there is no further advantage to anyone in continued predation. This establishes a basis for subsequent agreements that result in a redistribution of people’s holdings. Those with more in the natural equilibrium retain their advantage after the agreement, or as Barry says, ‘sheer physical possession gets transformed into assured property’. The most important point Barry took from Hume’s discussion of the rules of property is that ‘the determination of justice in Hume’s theory requires a reference to what people had at the non-agreement point’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X11433738">Barry, 1989</xref>: 299).</p>
<p>Jeremy Waldron also takes James Buchanan’s theory of the emergence of property rights as the appropriate modern exemplar of Hume’s theory. Waldron’s immediate concern is less to provide a direct interpretation of Hume’s theory than to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of what he calls the ‘Humean model’. However, it is evident from what he says that he regards Hume as a Humean in the relevant sense. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470594X11433738">Waldron (1994</xref>: 86): ‘On the Humean model, we start from an assumption of conflict driven by limited altruism and moderate scarcity. People grab things and use them; they argue and fight over them. Over time, the holdings determined in this way are going to be largely arbitrary. Nevertheless, if any sort of stable pattern emerges, then something like a peace dividend may be available.’ Waldron discusses a number of technical issues involved with this so-called Humean model, such as the bargaining or transaction costs of reaching the precise terms of the agreement and the problem of instability – people who do less well from the bargain ‘will try constantly to force renegotiation to redistribute the cooperative surplus’ (1994: 97). But the most serious deficiencies of Hume’s theory, Waldron thinks, are not technical, but moral. It is all, he says, ‘a matter of grabbing and fighting and defending what one can’ and some people will inevitably end up with nothing – ‘Hungry, cold, terrified, and despairing, they will doubtless face a proposal to ratify and legitimize their dispossession with considerable alarm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470594X11433738">Waldron, 1994</xref>: 105).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1470594X11433738">
<title>1.3. Mutual advantage as the criterion of justice</title>
<p>In <italic>Justice as Impartiality</italic> (the second volume of <italic>A Treatise on Social Justice</italic>), Barry revised his understanding of the <italic>Enquiry</italic> passage, along with its applicability to the encounter between the Europeans and the American Indians. In <italic>Theories of Justice</italic>, Barry had argued that the extreme disparity of strength between the Europeans and the Indians placed them outside of the circumstances of justice. The former thus had no duties to abstain from taking the possessions of the latter or to seek agreements with them to acquire their cooperation. In <italic>Justice as Impartiality</italic>, however, Barry pointed out that the Europeans did seek agreements with the native inhabitants because the latter were not in fact ‘incapable of all resistance’ as were the imagined ‘race of creatures’ referred to by Hume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470594X11433738">Barry, 1995</xref>: 45). However, the inequality of power, while not so extreme that the Europeans could have achieved all they wanted by force, enabled them to renege on the terms of the treaties whenever it suited them and without any repercussions. Moreover, according to mutual advantage theories of justice, <italic>it was just for them to do so</italic>. This, Barry now claimed, was the point Hume was ‘prepared to accept’ in the separate species passage of the <italic>Enquiry</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470594X11433738">Barry, 1995</xref>: 41–2).</p>
<p>Barry reached the conclusion that the Europeans were not bound by the treaties they signed with the Indians in the following way. Theories of justice, according to Barry, are characterized by the answers they give to two questions: <italic>What is the motive for behaving justly?</italic> and <italic>What is the criterion for a just set of rules?</italic> Mutual advantage theories, Hume’s included, answer these questions in the following way: the motive for behaving justly is self-interest and the criterion for a just set of rules is mutual advantage, that is, the rules are just if and only if everyone is better off with them than with no rules. It follows that<disp-quote>
<p>A theorist of justice as mutual advantage would have to say that any treatise was just so long as it was better for both parties than the alternative of fighting. He would also have to say that, since the only motive either side could have for adhering to the terms of the treaty was a sense of the gains to both sides if both sides observed it, it would also be just for the whites to tear up the treaty … as soon as they reached a position in which it would be more advantageous to drive the Indians by force from the territory they had been granted. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470594X11433738">Barry, 1995</xref>: 41)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The crucial feature of this reading of Hume is that a capacity for mutual harm is taken to be the <italic>criterion that determines whether a particular set of rules is just</italic>. Barry in fact applies this criterion to particular <italic>instances</italic> of the rules. He argues that the particular <italic>treaties</italic> entered into by the Europeans and the Indians were just ‘so long as it was better for both parties than the alternative of fighting’. When the Europeans first arrived in the New World they found that they needed the cooperation of the inhabitants and since the inhabitants also needed their cooperation, both sides had an incentive to enter into agreements and a duty to honour them. But this all changed when the Europeans, largely through growing numbers and greater independence, found that they could do without the restraint and cooperation of the Indians. From that point on, the Europeans no longer had a <italic>reason</italic> to honour the agreements they had signed, and because the terms of the treaties were no longer just, according to the stipulated criterion of mutual advantage, they no longer had a <italic>duty</italic> to comply.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470594X11433738">
<title>1.4. Two theories of justice</title>
<p>Barry did not overlook that part of Hume’s theory in which Hume attempted to explain that the virtue of justice is grounded on an impartial regard for the public interest. However, he argued that this reflects the presence of a different kind of theory – the theory of justice as impartiality. According to Barry, as we have seen, the theory of justice as mutual advantage answers the two questions that he says any theory of justice must answer (the question of motive and the question of the criterion of a just set of rules) so mutual advantage is the dominant component of the theory. Barry used the term ‘justice as impartiality’ for Hume’s explanation of why justice is a virtue – why it is morally approved of and why injustice is disapproved of. Thus, Barry claimed, ‘What makes justice a virtue is not that it is mutually advantageous, but something else about it.’ That something else is the fact that justice has beneficial consequences for society in general, and the fact that we sympathize with the beneficiaries of justice and with the victims of injustice.</p>
<p>The consequence of this ‘two theory’ reading of Hume is that the rules or institutions of justice can be assessed from two entirely different viewpoints: the viewpoint of mutual advantage and the impartial viewpoint. This incompatibility is nowhere more apparent than in the issue at hand – relationships involving extreme differences in power. Institutions that simply reflect relations of power and even exclude the weak entirely from their scope, but are nevertheless just from the point of view of the stipulated criteria of mutual advantage, can clearly be criticized from the impartial viewpoint Hume adopts when discussing why justice is a virtue. The fact that Hume did not provide such a criticism caused Barry to remark that Hume was ‘a better conservative than he was a philosopher’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X11433738">Barry, 1989</xref>: 164).</p>

<title>2. Defending Hume</title>
<p>This critical interpretation of Hume has not gone unchallenged. Thomas Pogge, in his review of <italic>Theories of Justice</italic>, argued that Barry’s interpretation of Hume’s reference to the encounter between Europeans and American Indians conflates explanation and justification. Hume was not making a <italic>normative</italic> point about inequality, but a <italic>factual</italic> point about the origins of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470594X11433738">Pogge, 1990</xref>: 375–84). It is certainly true that Barry entirely overlooked this distinction. However, it is not so easy to disentangle the factual and normative aspects of Hume’s theory. One of the factual points in question is about who is included within the scope of justice, and this is clearly of great normative significance. If Barry was correct in his interpretation of what Hume says about this factual point, the implication is that duties of justice are not owed to human beings who are incapable of causing harm to others.</p>
<p>Arthur Kuflik has also defended Hume from his critics, arguing that in view of what Hume has to say about justice elsewhere in <italic>A Treatise of Human Nature</italic> and <italic>An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals</italic>, the suggestion that Hume thought weak human beings were outside of the protection of justice is an ‘obviously false or highly implausible claim’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470594X11433738">Kuflik, 1998</xref>: 55). It overlooks Hume’s attempt to play down the egoistic, aggressive side of our nature and it is particularly at odds, Kuflik thinks, with Hume’s opposition to the idea that self-love is the foundation of morality, and his attempt to ground our duties of justice on an impartial regard for the public interest. However, Kuflik accepts that a literal reading of the ‘separate species’ passage of the <italic>Enquiry</italic> suggests that the Europeans <italic>were</italic> unencumbered by duties of justice, and that this cannot be squared with Hume’s remark that they only imagined themselves to be so. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470594X11433738">Kuflik (1998</xref>: 55) concludes that it is necessary to ‘discount some elements of Hume’s text’. In particular, he thinks we need to disregard those aspects of the text that suggest Hume actually meant that rough equality of power was one of the circumstances of justice.<sup>

</p>
<p>Is there a way of interpreting this passage that (1) does not require that we disregard any of its components, that (2) acknowledges that it is clearly about equality of strength, but that (3) it refers to an imaginary species of creatures rather than to inferior human beings, and hence (4) that the Europeans only <italic>imagined</italic> they were above justice and that their treatment of the indigenous Americans <italic>was</italic> unjust? Is there a reading that is also consistent with what Hume says elsewhere about justice, in particular, with his account of the virtue and duty to be just? In order to defend such a reading, it is necessary to respond to the three claims identified in Part 1 regarding (1) the scope of the basic institutions of justice, (2) the terms of justice, and (3) the criterion of a just set of rules.</p>

<title>2.1. The basic institutions of justice</title>
<sec id="section8-1470594X11433738">
<title>2.1.1. The origins of justice</title>
<p>Hume’s explanation of the origins of justice appears in book 3, part 2, section 2 of <italic>A Treatise of Human Nature</italic>, where he begins with an account of the circumstances facing mankind in its natural state. Human beings, Hume says, stand in need of society, mainly to satisfy their ‘numberless wants and necessities’ (2007: 3.2.2.4).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470594X11433738">4</xref>
</sup> We lack the natural sociability that we find in Grotius, for example, but we are impelled towards a social existence of a limited kind by the sex instinct, which Hume describes as the ‘first and original principal of human society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11433738">Hume, 2007</xref>: 3.2.2.4). However, standing against and hindering our social existence are our ‘selfishness and limited generosity’ and the fact that the goods we need and desire are limited in supply. The combination of these two factors causes the ‘instability’ of the goods we acquire by our fortune and industry and this, Hume says, is the ‘chief impediment’ to society. Lacking any natural disposition to abstain from other people’s goods, the remedy to this dilemma does not come from ‘uncultivated nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11433738">Hume, 2007</xref>: 3.3.2.8), but from artifice, that is, from a convention, whereby out of a sense of common interest ‘I observe, that it will be for my interest to leave another in the possession of his goods, <italic>provided</italic> he will act in the same manner with regard to me’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11433738">Hume, 2007</xref>: 3.2.2.10).</p>
<p>The writers that have been discussed in this article have undoubtedly exaggerated the violent and aggressive side of Hume’s discussion of our natural condition. Talk of ‘grabbing’ and ‘fighting’ over scarce resources paints a highly misleading picture of Hume’s vision of the state of nature. Violent acquisitiveness certainly plays a part in Hume’s account. The fundamental problem he identifies is that our possessions are exposed to the violence of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11433738">Hume, 2007</xref>: 3.2.2.7) and that our selfishness, which manifests itself in our ‘avidity … of acquiring goods and possessions for ourselves and our nearest friends’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11433738">Hume, 2007</xref>: 3.2.2.12), is a danger and impediment to our attempts to create societies. However, the situation we face is not one of constant predation. For the most part, we live in families, or what Hume calls ‘family-societies’ (1998: 3.16) of hunters and gatherers making use of possessions for self-preservation. Moreover, the fact that we do live in families is important because it is here that we first learn the advantages of a social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11433738">Hume, 2007</xref>: 3.2.2.4). The fact that in describing the convention Hume can refer to ‘his goods’ and my goods shows that he has in mind <italic>some</italic> degree of stability in our economic lives rather than a constant free for all. The problem seems to be more one of periodic conflict rather than constant predation, and while we do have possessions, without which we could not survive at all, we are not <italic>secure</italic> in our possessions, so we cannot form the kind of firm expectations that we need in order to expand society beyond its natural family boundaries.</p>
<p>The tendency to exaggerate the degree of hostility in Hume’s state of nature is sometimes connected with a misunderstanding of the kind of problem that Hume thinks people face. As we have seen, Barry sees the central problem of justice to be the zero-sum game of dividing up a fixed quantity of resources between people with competing interests. The best one can do is to acquire the whole of the resource while one’s opponent gets nothing. In game-theoretic terms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470594X11433738">Barry (2010</xref>) saw this as a Prisoners’ Dilemma (PD) game. To illustrate this, consider two people in the state of nature with the alternative strategies of cooperate (abstain from the other’s possessions) or defect (do not abstain). For each player, the best outcome is for her to choose defect and for the other player to choose cooperate. However, a key feature of PD is that <italic>whatever</italic> the other does, each is better off by choosing defect (defect is the dominant strategy). The dilemma is that the outcome of both players choosing to defect is worse for both than if they had both chosen to cooperate.</p>
<p>The problem that Hume is discussing, however, is not that of dividing up a given quantity of a resource, but of establishing rules that enable the participants to cooperate in ways that immeasurably increase the quantity of resources available. The <italic>best</italic> outcome for both parties, therefore, is when they both cooperate. People in Hume’s state of nature thus share a <italic>common interest</italic> in cooperation, not just in the weak sense that mutual cooperation is better than mutual defection, but in the strong sense that mutual cooperation is better than any other outcome. The ‘dilemma’ facing Hume’s cooperators is not that of the inevitability of being stuck in a sub-optimal position of constant defection, but rather the problem of trust – we would always cooperate if we had good reasons to believe that others would cooperate. This is where the convention comes in. It is not so much an account of how conflicting interests are reconciled as it is an account of how people who share a <italic>common</italic> interest come to realize that they have this common interest and how they express it to each other.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470594X11433738">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Hume is prepared to call the convention an ‘agreement’, but he stresses that it differs from the traditional idea of a contract in at least two ways: it does not involve a promise, which Hume says is itself part of justice, and it is a dynamic evolutionary process of some kind, which leads to the gradual acceptance of the conventional behaviour as people gradually experience its advantages and become more secure in their expectation of similar behaviour by others. In this way, the convention leads to the formation of an ever-increasing group within which the conventional behaviour becomes accepted.</p>
<p>One way of exploring the implications of this account of the origins of justice for the encounter between the Europeans and the American Indians is to think of it as some kind of return to a state of nature. Neither side of the encounter was encumbered by the restraints of justice, so neither could be accused of acting unjustly. Moreover, contact between them taught the Europeans that they had no need to restrain themselves by entering into any kind of convention with the Indians because they could get all they wanted by force. So relations of justice never developed between them.</p>
<p>This way of thinking about the European ventures into the New World has an important antecedent in the theory of John Locke, but I do not think that it fits Hume’s theory. On Hume’s view, it is not possible to go back to a state of nature. It is a hypothetical time before justice, not merely in the sense that there were no property rights in existence, but in the sense that <italic>the very ideas</italic> of justice, property, and promising had never occurred to people. By contrast, both the Europeans and the Indians had long-established practices of justice. The fact that there were no past agreements or bargains between the two sides (the fact that they had not even come into contact before) is not, on Hume’s theory, enough by itself to establish the conclusion that they did not have mutual duties of justice.</p>
<p>But even if we cannot think of the European conquests as taking place in a state of nature, it is still reasonable to imagine what might have happened if Europeans had somehow been intermingled with the inhabitants of the Americas in the state of nature, when all human beings lived at the same low technological and social levels. Furthermore, I think it would be reasonable to conjecture that we have no grounds for thinking that either side would emerge as a dominant group capable of imposing its ‘lawless will’ on the other without fear of retaliation. The ‘superiority’ of the Europeans consisted in the superiority of their weapons and their military organization, factors that have no bearing on the circumstances of justice in the state of nature and which are thus irrelevant from the point of view of the dynamics of group formation.</p>
<p>If this is correct, then Hume cannot be accused of drawing back from the implications of his theory in his discussion of the encounter between the Europeans and the American Indians. Nussbaum’s reading of this important passage is the more accurate one. Military superiority no more justified the European treatment of the inhabitants of the New World than it would have justified the English in invading Scotland and seizing the lands and possessions of the Scots. It is for this reason that Hume says that the superiority of the Europeans <italic>tempted them to imagine</italic> that they were on the same footing with the indigenous inhabitants as they were with animals. His point is that their military and cultural superiority was misconstrued in the imagination of the Europeans as the kind of natural superiority they had over animals. It is the critical note in this phrase that is so striking: Hume is criticizing, not justifying their actions.</p>
<p>What then are the implications of Hume’s theory for human beings with natural disabilities of a kind that <italic>could</italic> influence interaction in a state of nature and the process of group formation? Part of the answer to this question depends on whether the criteria for inclusion within the group operate at the level of the individual or at the level of the species. Is Hume’s convention of the form <italic>I abstain from the possessions of x because I need x’s cooperation</italic> or is it of the form <italic>I abstain from the possessions of x because x is the sort of creature with whom it is beneficial to cooperate</italic>?</p>
<p>For a number of reasons, I think that the second of these two readings is the superior one. First, discriminating between individuals on the basis of their capacity to resist and retaliate and adapting our behaviour accordingly is costly. Our experience of interacting with others does not tell us all we need to know about their characteristics. It is important to bear in mind that the kind of interaction we are dealing with does not take the form of face-to-face threats and bargains, but of periodic conflicts that can be relatively anonymous and do not necessarily involve personal contact at all, for example stealing from food stores or hunting and gathering in territory that is occupied by others. There is in these cases a high degree of uncertainty about the reactions that we will provoke. We will find that on some occasions we meet neither resistance nor retaliation. This may be because we are dealing with someone who is much weaker than us and has no capacity to resist or retaliate. But it may also be because she is adopting a different strategy – she may be ahead of us, realizing before we do that restraint is the best policy. And of course, we want to cooperate with people who want to cooperate with us. Distinguishing between these cases may involve time and effort and we may sometimes make costly mistakes. The least costly strategy may, therefore, be to adopt an inflexible rule in all cases.</p>
<p>Second, not only is it costly to discriminate between individuals, but the rewards of doing so are relatively small in the circumstances envisaged by Hume. As already argued, successful aggression merely rewards the aggressor with the lion’s share of the meagre resources that are available in the natural state. In the zero-sum Prisoners’ Dilemma game, this is the best we can do. But Hume’s cooperators have an eye to the greater economic benefits of social cooperation which result from the additional ‘force, ability, and security’ that society brings (2007: 3.2.2.3).</p>
<p>Third, the relevance of information about the characteristics of individuals is, in any case, much reduced in Hume’s theory because, as already mentioned, human beings in the state of nature, as Hume portrays it, do not live as isolated individuals, but in ‘family-societies’. Most of the possessions that are subject to what Hume calls ‘instability’ (that is, territory, food stores, or the product of a collective hunt) are held collectively within these ‘family-societies’. The conflict that generates the need for rules of justice is thus, to a large extent, conflict between groups rather than between individuals. In addition, we can expect a much greater degree of homogeneity between these ‘family-societies’ than between individuals.</p>
<p>In view of these considerations, Hume’s convention is best illustrated not by a two-person bargaining model, which is the way Barry represented it in <italic>Theories of Justice</italic>, but by a repeated anonymous game in which we learn which general strategy works the best against the population as a whole, but in which we do not associate the individual outcomes with the characteristics of individual opponents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470594X11433738">6</xref>
</sup> We learn that taking the possessions of other human beings is dangerous, not in the sense that we encounter retaliation on every occasion, but on a sufficient number of occasions to teach us that forbearance is the best general strategy. We thus develop a general <italic>disposition</italic> to forbear from taking the possessions of other human beings, including those who have no capacity or desire to harm us.</p>
<p>Reading Hume in this way enables us better to take into account Hume’s emphasis on habit and custom and our capacity to follow inflexible rules, as opposed to the rational and calculating side of our nature. It also enables us to see how it is possible for him to distinguish between humans, including weak and disabled humans, and a separate and inferior species of creatures. For if we imagine, along with Hume, that there are intermingled with us creatures who are easily and instantly recognizable as belonging to a different species and that we learn from our interaction with them that creatures of this kind <italic>never</italic> ‘make us feel the effects of their resentment’, even when they operate in groups, it is easy to see how we can develop different dispositions towards them compared with those we develop towards members of our own species.</p>
<p>Whether Hume was right to suggest that our relationship to animals can be explained in this way, however, is doubtful. Clearly, there are some animals (lions, tigers, and elephants) that can harm us, and the most prudent strategy may well be to leave such animals ‘in possession of their goods’, that is to say, to refrain from taking the food they have caught or from trespassing in territory that they inhabit. The difference is that we do not expect the kind of reciprocal response that can lead to the adoption of mutually binding rules. The fact that Hume’s imaginary species is ‘rational’ seems to be crucial, at least to the extent that such a species must be capable of understanding and following rules.</p>
<p>From what has been said so far it is possible to see how Hume’s convention can be read as an account of how self-interest can lead us to adopt the basic institutions of property and promise keeping that encompass other members of our species regardless of their capacity to cause us harm. When we turn to Hume’s discussion of our duty to be just in the next section, we shall see that his account of the origins of these institutions does not, in any case, define their scope. The general shape of Hume’s theory is that self-interest and mutual advantage are the origins of justice, but its scope and applicability depends upon a broader sympathy with the beneficiaries of justice and the victims of injustice, <italic>however remote they are from us</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1470594X11433738">
<title>2.1.2. The duty to be just</title>
<p>Hume explains the foundation of our duty to be just in the second part of book 3, part 2, section 2 of the <italic>Treatise</italic>, where he turns to the question of ‘Why we annexe the idea of virtue to justice, and of vice to injustice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11433738">Hume, 2007</xref>: 3.3.3). He has already explained that self-interest is the original motive for the establishment of justice, and he says that in the early stages of social development, when societies are small, self-interest also accounts for compliance with the rules. As societies grow, however, this interest becomes more remote. We no longer see that our own compliance contributes to the maintenance of the whole system. But we never fail to see the harm done to ourselves by the injustices of others. We are also aware of and moved by the harm that is done by injustices to society as a whole and to other individuals: ‘when the injustice is so distant from us, as no way to affect our interest, it still displeases us; because we consider it prejudicial to human society, and pernicious to every one that approaches the person guilty of it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11433738">Hume, 2007</xref>: 3.2.2.24). It is this displeasure or ‘uneasiness’ with acts of injustice and our pleasure or satisfaction with just acts that explains our sense of moral right or wrong; it explains why we regard injustice as a vice and justice a virtue and also why we regard justice as a duty: ‘And tho’ this sense, in the present case, be deriv’d only from contemplating the actions of others, yet we fail not to extend it even to our own actions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11433738">Hume, 2007</xref>: 3.2.2.24).</p>
<p>Our duty to be just thus becomes detached from the self-interested motive that led to the establishment of justice. This is reinforced by Hume later in the <italic>Treatise</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>justice is a moral virtue, merely because it has that tendency to the good of mankind; and indeed, is nothing but an artificial invention for that purpose. The same may be said of allegiance, of the laws of nations, of modesty, and of good manners. All these are mere human contrivances for the interest of society. <italic>The inventors of them had chiefly in view their own interest. But we carry our approbation of them into the most distant countries and ages, and much beyond our own interest.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11433738">Hume, 2007</xref>: 3.3.1.9, emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Hume presents essentially the same argument in the <italic>Enquiry</italic>, where he says that the duty to be just is founded on its usefulness: ‘Usefulness is agreeable, and engages our approbation.’ He then asks ‘But <italic>useful</italic>? For what? For somebody’s interest surely. Whose interest then? Not our own only: For our approbation frequently extends farther. It must, therefore, be the interest of those; who are served by the character or action approved of; and these we may conclude, however remote, are not totally indifferent to us’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470594X11433738">Hume, 1998</xref>: 5.15).</p>
<p>So, our approbation of justice, on which our duty to be just is based, is explained by our sympathy with the benefits of justice to ‘mankind’, to ‘human society’, to whoever are ‘served by the character or action approved of’. Our duties are not confined to those who can harm us.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1470594X11433738">
<title>2.2. The rules of justice</title>
<p>I now turn to the question of the terms of justice and to those interpretations of Hume’s theory of the convention that portray it as some kind of bargain in which the terms or rules of justice reflect the bargaining power of people in the state of nature. Much of what has been said above should suggest that I regard this as a complete misinterpretation of what Hume meant by convention, but the point I now want to stress is that Hume’s convention explains the origins of justice in a rather general sense; it does not explain the origins of the rules or terms of justice. The convention establishes ‘the general rule, <italic>that possession must be stable</italic>’, but this rule, Hume says, is of no use in such general terms, it must be ‘modified’ and ‘applied’ by other general rules, which ‘must extend to the whole society’ (2007: 3.2.3.3). In explaining these general rules Hume makes use of his theory of the imagination and of the principle of utility, principles that are quite distinct from and incompatible with the idea of a bargain between people in a state of nature.</p>
<p>Consider the rule of present possession. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470594X11433738">Waldron (1994</xref>: 86) paraphrases Hume’s convention in the following way: ‘I agree to respect what you have managed to hang on to, and you agree to respect what I have managed to hang on to: “By this means, everyone knows what he may safely possess.”’ This reading suggests a direct link between the convention (understood as a bargain) and the rule ratifying present possession. Similarly, Barry’s two-stage bargaining theory interpretation of the present possession rule construes it as the result of a bargain, in which the advantages at the non-agreement point are translated into property rights. However, there is no support for such a reading in the text. In the <italic>Treatise</italic>, Hume gives two alternative explanations of the rule of present possession. The first, which appears in the main body of the text has to do with custom and our preference for things we already have and are used to: ‘Such is the effect of custom, that it not only reconciles us to any thing we have long enjoy’d, but even gives us an affection for it, and makes us prefer it to other objects, which may be more valuable, but are less known to us … ’Tis evident, therefore, that men wou’d easily acquiesce in this expedient, <italic>that every one continue to enjoy what he is at present possess’d of</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11433738">Hume, 2007</xref>: 3.2.3.4). Hume’s second explanation of the rule of present possession is presented in a footnote in which he draws on his theory of the imagination. He says, ‘As property forms a relation between a person and an object, ‘tis natural to found it on some preceding relation; and as property is nothing but a constant possession, secur’d by the laws of society, ’tis natural to add it to the present possession, which is a relation that resembles it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11433738">Hume, 2007</xref>: 3.2.3.4).</p>
<p>Not only is there no textual support for the Barry and Waldron reading of the convention, but it is incompatible with the whole logic and structure of Hume’s own explanation. In the <italic>Treatise</italic>, Hume says that the rule of present possession is only a temporary expedient that is agreed to at the first formation of society, and that societies subsequently introduce new rules because of the inconvenience to society in general of confining property distribution to the pattern established at the beginning of social development. Once again, these other rules (that is, first occupation, prescription, accession, and succession) are explained by Hume in terms of the principles of public utility and the imagination, and there is no mention, or even suggestion, that they result from a process of bargaining. Furthermore, why, in any case, would rational, self-interested bargainers who, according to the Barry and Waldron reading, had grabbed more than they could get by their own labour and good fortune agree to a system based on first occupancy and all the other rules Hume discusses? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X11433738">Barry (1989</xref>: 299) seemed, in fact, to be half-hearted about this and conscious of the anachronism involved.</p>
<p>Hume’s discussion of present possession in the <italic>Enquiry</italic> is very different from the discussion in the <italic>Treatise</italic>. In the <italic>Enquiry</italic>, it is considered more traditionally as a ground for a claim where there is no preceding or stronger claim. It is in relation to this that Hume says that the rules are sometimes no more than analogies – slight connections of the imagination. Present possession is here treated as a rule dreamt up by lawyers faced with the need for a rule where there is no stronger ground for awarding the property right. Hume’s explanation of the other rules is also different in the <italic>Enquiry</italic> and the principle of utility is to the forefront of Hume’s discussion. The imagination is brought in only where utility recommends more than one possible rule.</p>
<p>The main point to stress, however, is that as with the explanation Hume gives in the <italic>Treatise</italic>, the rules are not presented as the result of a bargain and, moreover, the rules themselves do not reflect any trace of bargaining power. First occupancy, for example, reflects hunting ability, but also luck and geographical location. It is just as likely to protect the weak against strong invaders as it is to justify the actions of the strong. If the Europeans had acknowledged that they had duties of justice towards the American Indians, as Hume’s theory requires, they would have had to respect the property rights of the latter as first occupants. Hume’s conservatism, if that is what we should call it, is not always on the side of the strong and powerful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1470594X11433738">
<title>2.3. The criterion of justice</title>
<p>The fundamental problem with Barry’s claim that in Hume’s theory, as in all theories of justice as mutual advantage, mutual advantage is the criterion of a just set of rules, is that in Hume’s theory, as Barry himself has acknowledged in other contexts, there is no criterion for a just set of rules. Justice and injustice for Hume are not qualities of rules or institutions, rather they are qualities of people in complying with or failing to comply with the prevailing rules of justice. Barry is mislead because he assumes that justice for Hume is what it is for Rawls: ‘the terms of rational cooperation for mutual advantage under the circumstances of justice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X11433738">Barry, 1989</xref>: 148). Barry then compounds this mistake by applying this criterion of justice to individual agreements.</p>
<p>There is thus no foundation for Barry’s claim that Hume’s theory justifies any agreement, however unequally its benefits are distributed, as long as it is mutually beneficial to the agreeing parties. Nor is there any foundation for his claim that, according to Hume, it was just for the Europeans to tear up the treaties they signed with the Indians once they became powerful enough to do so without adverse consequences to themselves. Barry correctly states that for Hobbes ‘justice is carrying out of the contract or covenant and has no applicability to its terms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X11433738">Barry, 1989</xref>: 53). The same could be said of Hume, who thought that the Europeans, as civilized men ‘trained up to a certain discipline and education’ were obliged to keep whatever promises they made and that ‘a regard for justice, and abhorrence of villainy and knavery’ should have been sufficient reasons for doing so (2007: 3.2.1.9).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1470594X11433738">
<title>2.4. Two theories or one?</title>
<p>It should be apparent from what was said in Part 1 that Barry’s two-theory interpretation of Hume, and the interpretation of Hume’s ‘separate species’ passage that he put forward in <italic>Justice as Impartiality</italic>, are closely related and follow from the same interpretive step, namely, to read the mutual advantage component of Hume’s theory not only as an explanation of the origins of justice, but also as a theory that is intended to <italic>justify</italic> the rules of justice.</p>
<p>It is instructive at this point to note that David Gauthier, in making the case for regarding Hume as a contractarian, interpreted Hume in much the same way, although being more favourably disposed to Hume, he does not draw attention to the problematic nature of the reading. Gauthier explains that when Hume says in the <italic>Enquiry</italic> that ‘public utility is the <italic>sole</italic> origin of justice’ he means <italic>mutual expected utility</italic> ‘so that a rule or practice has public utility if and only if each person reasonably expects that rule or practice to be useful to himself’. But when Hume says that ‘reflections on the beneficial consequences of this virtue are the <italic>sole</italic> foundations of its merit’ he is not referring to mutual expected utility, but to the usefulness of the rule to human society in general. Thus, Gauthier says, ‘we distinguish public utility as the origin of justice, from general utility, or overall advantage, as the basis of our moral approbation of justice’. Having made these helpful distinctions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470594X11433738">Gauthier (1979</xref>: 17–18) misleadingly concludes that ‘Arrangements may be expected to be useful to each person; therefore they are just. These arrangements may also be expected to have beneficial consequences; therefore they receive moral approval, and justice is a virtue.’</p>
<p>Now it is easy to see that on the basis of this final remark our approbation of justice is separate from, and may well conflict with, our judgements about whether the arrangements in question are in fact just. In addition, since our duty to be just in Hume’s theory, as we have seen, is derived from our moral approbation of justice, we could easily have a duty to obey rules that are not just. This is the contradiction to which Barry drew attention, and it is an inescapable result of the attempt by both Barry and Gauthier to present Hume as a contractarian.</p>
<p>However, as already argued, the rules of justice, or as Gauthier calls them ‘arrangements’, are neither just nor unjust. It is a striking feature of Hume’s theory, for which he is often criticized, that he regards the choice of the particular rules of justice as relatively unimportant in comparison with the urgency of having some rules. It is not the case, therefore, that Hume’s theory provides us with two conflicting viewpoints for evaluating the rules of justice. In fact, there is no viewpoint for evaluating the <italic>rules</italic> of justice – there is a single, impartial viewpoint for evaluating the merit of justice as a virtue.</p>

<title>3. Conclusion</title>
<p>Hume’s relative indifference to the particular rules of justice, in comparison with the urgency of having some rules, has attracted widespread criticism, and Barry is not alone in regarding Hume as a conservative. However, Hume had good philosophical reasons for limiting his speculations about different rules of justice. He was acutely aware, as many are today, that moral disagreement blocks any kind of normative consensus for the design and evaluation of the rules of justice. Moreover, what was at stake in Hume’s day was not gradual democratic reform of distributive institutions within a well-ordered society, but violent revolution. Hume’s targets were the religious and political ‘fanatics’ that he thought had been so destructive in Hobbes’s century and the supporters of the different currents of political opposition in his own. It was not so much the reformist intent of the latter that Hume challenged, but the ‘speculative and dogmatic theories’ (primarily, the theory of the social contract) on which their opposition was based. Hume’s objection was not just that these currents of opposition sought in different ways to overthrow a regime that he thought was fulfilling the proper functions of government, but that any alternative regime that replaced it would be equally vulnerable to the charge that it was not justified by an imagined original agreement.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is because Hume separated his explanation of the origins of justice from his explanation of the rules of justice that he was able to be as open minded as he was about the rules. The fact that they are merely ‘conventions’, shaped, in part at least, by what we think is in the public interest, can be seen to open the door to reform. In the <italic>Enquiry</italic>, Hume says that the choice of rules can depend on ‘the sentiment of private humanity and aversion to private hardship, on positive laws, on precedents, analogies, and very fine connexions and turns of the imagination’ (1998: app. 3.10. n. 65). Hume only rules out complete equality and distribution according to virtue or merit.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hume’s theory was not a theory of distributive justice and it has not been my contention that Hume’s theory does or could yield morally defensible normative principles of distribution. I have argued, rather, that Hume’s theory does not exclude weak and defenceless people from the protection of justice and that the distribution of property is unrelated to the capacity to inflict harm. I have also argued that our obligation to abstain from the property of others and our obligation to keep our promises is not grounded in our estimation of our own personal advantage. Contemporary interpretations have thus misrepresented Hume, and this has had two unfortunate consequences.</p>
<p>First, it has obscured what was truly original in Hume’s theory of justice, in particular, his theory of convention, which enabled him to separate the explanation of the origins of justice from the explanation of its content and scope, and also from the obligation to be just. This was a crucial move in his attempt to undermine the theory of the social contract and it was paralleled in his theory of government. There too Hume argued that the explanation of the origins of government must be kept separate from the questions of the choice of particular governments and the obligation to obey government. He was prepared to allow that people first accepted the authority of governments by some kind of agreement, just as he was prepared to accept that private property had originated in a kind of agreement. But the origins of these institutions, Hume thought, has no bearing on the current legitimacy of particular governments or of particular property rules.</p>
<p>Second, many contemporary writers on justice have been inclined to trace the historical roots of their own theories, and the theories they criticize, to major historical theorists. Thus, Hobbes, Hume, Rousseau, and Kant have commonly been identified as the progenitors and inspirers of contemporary theories. This is a positive feature of contemporary discourse. The writers in question were great thinkers and we have much to learn from them. But it can also encourage a rather easy acceptance of certain ideas and a failure to scrutinize their real sources. Claiming that a certain proposition is rooted in the theories of Kant or Hume, for example, undoubtedly adds a certain authority to it and demands that it should be taken seriously. The exclusion of people with physical and mental disabilities from the scope and protection of justice is a case in point. For a writer such as Hume, for whom justice primarily served the purpose of establishing order and enhancing general utility, it could perhaps be regarded as an unfortunate, but necessary compromise. That may be one reason why so many people have mistakenly attributed the idea to him. But it is harder to explain why it has been taken seriously by so many contemporary theorists who are concerned with elucidating the correct normative principles of distributive justice and who by and large think of justice as a kind of fairness. And I think that one, although by no means the only, reason for its persistence is the claim that it has a long and illustrious history. I hope that this article has at least removed Hume from that history.</p>

In fact, Hume seems to be deliberately differentiating his argument from the one Kuflik proposes by saying that his imaginary species is rational, although weaker than humans.</p>

<p>Russell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X11433738">Hardin (2007)</xref> argues that Hume’s convention is best understood as the solution to a coordination problem of the ‘rule of the road’ type rather than a Prisoners’ Dilemma. Hume’s originality, according to Hardin, and where he makes an advance over Hobbes, was to recognize that when people manage to coordinate their action enough times, they come to expect similar behaviour of others in the future and so they acquire incentives to ‘follow the same pattern of coordination in the future’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X11433738">Hardin, 2007</xref>: 82). Annette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470594X11433738">Baier (1994</xref>) also rejects the Prisoners’ Dilemma reading of Hume and argues, convincingly in my view, that in game-theoretic terms Hume’s convention is best seen as the solution to an assurance game. Brian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470594X11433738">Skirms (2004</xref>: ch. 1) provides an illuminating discussion of a particular kind of assurance game (that is, the stag hunt) which in my view comes closest to what Hume had in mind, at least in terms of the basic payoff structure.
