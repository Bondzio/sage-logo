<abstract>
<p>The proliferation of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and women’s high level of engagement with these practices, has presented sociology with a range of questions regarding gender, embodiment and identity work in the context of contemporary medical pluralism. The current study, drawing on 60 qualitative interviews with women from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH), examines how a group of Australian women negotiate CAM and biomedicine in a range of health and illness contexts. Selected from the mid-aged cohort of this national study, here we explore their accounts of engagement with CAM and biomedicine, unpacking their logics underpinning, and rhetorical practices surrounding, their therapeutic engagement. The results provide significant insight into: the importance of ideas about nature, holism and strengthening; perceptions of the harshness and softness of medicines for women’s bodies; and, the relative importance of scientific proof vis-a-vis individual subjectivities. Ultimately, their accounts illustrate gendered and embodied strategies of strategic integration, and importantly, border crossing. We conclude that while women’s engagement with CAM and biomedicine may be indeed be gendered in character, we suggest a rethinking of gender-based resistance (to biomedicine) or gender-alignment (to CAM) arguments; the notion of women as designers would more adequately capture the landscapes of contemporary medical pluralism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is well known that, internationally, women use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) at higher rates than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459312447258">Adams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312447258">Bix, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459312447258">Luff and Thomas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459312447258">Xue et al., 2007</xref>). In Australia, survey data suggest approximately 63 per cent of men versus 74 per cent of women use some form of CAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459312447258">Adams et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459312447258">2003b</xref>). How this phenomenon in relation to CAM is to be explained remains a debated issue and continues to present a fertile site for sociological enquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459312447258">Baarts and Pedersen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312447258">Bix, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459312447258">Nissen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459312447258">Scott, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459312447258">Sointu, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312447258">2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459312447258">2011</xref>). CAM use has been presented as both resistance to (patriarchal/reductive) biomedicine, and furthermore, indicative of the affinity of women to various characteristics of CAM practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312447258">Bix, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459312447258">Feldberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459312447258">Nissen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459312447258">Sointu, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312447258">2006b</xref>). Given the high levels of variation between CAM practices and practitioners, and women’s varying levels of engagement with therapeutic options, such readings must be carefully considered. In this article we begin to explore women’s accounts of why and how they engage with CAM and biomedicine and the logics that underpin their different forms of engagement. Specifically, we examine these discursive practices as simultaneously contributing to both physical and symbolic bodily composition. While there have been various arguments surrounding women’s engagement with CAM, many of which we outline below, there is an urgent need to document women’s perspectives and stories across a range of illness and healthcare contexts. In order to do this we selected 60 women who were active CAM users from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459312447258">Brown et al., 1999</xref>), to begin to explore how women negotiate and manage different therapeutic practices and bodies of knowledge.</p>

<title>Passages of resistance: Medicalization, patriarchy and the holistic turn</title>
<p>In recent years, although the biomedical community has maintained a degree of control over health service delivery and the broader framing of illness and disease, a waning in the dominance of biomedicine and biomedical practitioners has been evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459312447258">Bakx, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459312447258">Willis, 1989</xref>). This has been partnered with increased public scepticism towards scientific and technological development, which, although not linear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459312447258">Scammell et al., 2009</xref>), has been evident in waning faith in biomedical expertise, and rather dramatic increases in the use of CAM practices and practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459312447258">Calnan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459312447258">Goldner, 2004</xref>). This shift towards so-called alternative health paradigms has regularly been theorized in the sociological literature as a practice of ‘resistance’ to biomedical dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459312447258">Willis, 1989</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459312447258">Broom and Tovey, 2007</xref>). At times, such forms of resistance have been viewed as gendered; that is, scholars have connected the patriarchal tendencies of biomedicine in the 20th Century with increased use of CAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312447258">Bix, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459312447258">Feldberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459312447258">Nissen, 2011</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459312447258">Taylor, 1999</xref>). In turn, CAM has been presented as a social movement that articulates – more so than biomedicine – the value of subjectivity and authenticity in ideas about the self, the body and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459312447258">Baarts and Pedersen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459312447258">Bishop and Yardley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459312447258">Broom and Tovey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459312447258">Feldberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459312447258">Luff and Thomas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459312447258">Sointu, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312447258">2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459312447258">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459312447258">Sointu and Woodhead, 2008</xref>). The elevation of subjectivity and well-being as evident in CAM practice as a counter discourse to bio-medicalized notions of physical pathology has been one contribution of this theoretical trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459312447258">Broom and Tovey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459312447258">Scambler and Kelleher, 2006</xref>). While the aforementioned work has been useful, conceptual models focused on gender-resistance and/or social movement-type analyses may not capture some of the complexities evident in women’s practices of utilizing both CAM and biomedical practices. Rather, and as we argue within the following sections, everyday medico-social practice may be better explored as a non-foundationalist constructive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312447258">Latour, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459312447258">Lévi-Strauss, 1968</xref>) – one of design – that sits in contrast to oppositional mappings of power, resistance and social movement-type analysis evident in early work on CAM.</p>

<title>The gendering of health consumption</title>
<p>There has been an important body of work examining CAM use from a feminist-embodiment perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459312447258">Scott, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459312447258">Sointu, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459312447258">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459312447258">Sointu and Woodhead, 2008</xref>), including arguments that women’s affinity with CAM is due to a perceived linkage with feminine ideas about the body, subjectivity, holism and closeness to nature (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459312447258">Feldberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459312447258">Ruzek, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459312447258">Weisman, 1998</xref>). Such notions have complemented work on biomedicine as complicit in the control and surveillance of women’s bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312447258">Bix, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459312447258">Conrad, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459312447258">Ruzek, 1978</xref>). In contrast, and perhaps in a rather binary fashion, CAM practitioners and knowledge systems have been conceptualized as offering a less prescriptive, normative and externally referenced model of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459312447258">Broom and Tovey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459312447258">Nissen, 2011</xref>). The focus on embodied experience, well-being and subjectivity in CAM practice presents a critique of the traditional paternal control and power of the biomedical expert even though such an ideology may not be realized in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459312447258">Oakley, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459312447258">Sointu, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312447258">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459312447258">Weisman, 1998</xref>). CAM use may thus be viewed as embedded in the performance and production of femininity, including CAM consumption as embedded in the reproduction of gender through the politics of recognition and the practice of resistance. CAM, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312447258">Sointu (2006b</xref>: 345), enables women to ‘perform and embody ideals such as self-responsibility and self-actualisation; discourses of wellbeing both reproduce and resist traditional representations of femininity’. We were interested in the extent to which such ideas and others purported in the sociological literature are manifest in women’s accounts of their health and care.</p>

<title>Towards a focus on design</title>
<p>In this article we utilize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312447258">Latour’s (2008)</xref> concept of the designer for conceptualizing these women’s engagement with CAM and biomedicine – a framing which deliberately extends beyond notions of CAM use as resistance or social/counter movement. In particular, we sought a conceptual model that would encompass their integrative utilization of multiple and ideologically disparate therapeutic practices and practitioners. Below we present engagement with health practices and bodies of knowledge as shifting, diverse and multi-dimensional in character. We use the term <italic>designer</italic> to explore the way in which women build/unite health practices and their bodies at the same time. Moreover, we reframe understandings of medico-cultural change and gendered health and healing in a manner sensitive to the nuances of integrated healthcare while retaining a sense of women’s power as builders of contemporary healthcare assemblages. Showing that integrative practices, on the part of women, contain <italic>both</italic> resistance and strategic compilation – all aimed at achieving greater levels of personal, emotional and bodily control, health and resilience – we suggest, further, that the concomitant process of gender differentiation does not rest solely with the creation or maintenance of oppositional dichotomies. Rather, it is equally built on practices of accommodation, similarity and complementarity.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section6-1363459312447258">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Following ethical clearance by the authors’ universities, the lead author (CM) completed semi-structured interviews with 60 mid-age women who took part in the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women’s Health (ALSWH) sub-study into women’s use of complementary and alternative medicine in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459312447258">Adams et al., 2011</xref>). ALSWH began in 1996 and included women in three age groups, randomly selected from the national Medicare database and invited by mail to participate. The focus of this study is women from the 1946–1951 cohort, aged between 45–50 when the study commenced in 1996. At survey one, 14,779 consented to participate and the respondents are representative of the national population of women in the target age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459312447258">Brown et al., 1999</xref>). For this sub-study, 2120 mid-aged women who had indicated in survey five (2007) that they consulted a CAM practitioner in the last 12 months were mailed a questionnaire. Of these women 1800 (85 per cent) returned completed questionnaires and 80 per cent of those offered to complete a follow-up qualitative phone interview. The results of the survey have been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459312447258">Adams et al., 2011</xref>). From the data the women provided for the survey on CAM use, we used a stratified random sampling strategy to select interviewees who were on the spectrum from high to low users of CAM practices and practitioners. Given the national distribution of the sample, phone interviews were the only feasible option. The interviews were conducted over the telephone by CM and lasted for approximately one hour. Women’s support of the principles of the ALSWH study, and the biographical approach to collecting health histories and CAM use that was taken by CM, meant that rapport was relatively easy to develop and the telephone interviews proved a highly successful way of collecting national, in-depth qualitative data. This age-group also presented a particularly engaging cohort given the extent of medico-cultural change that has taken place in the latter half of the 20th Century and, therefore, over these women’s lives. The aim of the interviews was to understand women’s use of CAM and biomedicine within the context of their history of health and practices of well-being. The interviews sought to elicit concrete descriptions of illness and treatment practice by tracing four thematic areas: history of health and healthcare utilization; practitioner engagement, both CAM and biomedical; details of treatment and care; and, attitudes towards health and well-being and therapeutic practices therein.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The methodology for this project sits within the interpretive traditions in sociology. The aim was to achieve a detailed understanding of the varying positions adhered to, and to locate these within a spectrum of broader underlying beliefs, agendas and life experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459312447258">Charmaz, 2006</xref>). The approach to data collection was developmental, in that knowledge generated in the early interviews was challenged, compared with, and built upon by later ones. This method provided an opportunity to establish initial themes and then search for deviant or negative cases, complicating our observations and retaining the complexity of the data. We approached the analysis by conducting an initial thematic analysis, writing notes and discussing ideas within the research team. Within this process, we continually sought to retain the richness of the respondents’ experiences, documenting atypical cases, conflicts and contradictions within the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459312447258">Ezzy, 2002</xref>). Once we had identified a theme, we would search through the interviews for other related comments, employing constant comparison to develop or complicate these themes further. This process helped ensure that events initially viewed as unrelated could be grouped together as their interconnectedness became apparent. The final step involved revisiting the literature and seeking out conceptual tools that could be employed to make sense of the patterns that had emerged from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459312447258">Ezzy, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Précis of healthcare practices among interviewees</title>
<p>Women were selected for interview on the basis of having used some form of CAM within a year of completing a survey by the authors in 2010. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1363459312447258">Table 1</xref> shows, at the time of qualitative interview, ninety-five per cent of women were currently using CAM. Fifty-seven per cent of the respondents were currently using biomedical care including prescription medications and physiotherapy. As unpacked in detail below, this result is telling because it highlights the extent to which women’s use of CAM did not constitute a rejection of biomedical practice but formed part of their integrative healthcare assemblages. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1363459312447258">Table 2</xref> provides a breakdown on the categories of the CAM practices used, with the majority (85 per cent) of women reporting use of biologically based therapies.</p>

<title>Invoking nature and discourses of strengthening</title>
<p>There has been considerable work on the relationships between femininity and nature and in popular culture phrases like <italic>mother earth</italic> or <italic>mother nature</italic> have emerged from historical (and often patriarchal) rhetorical and discursive connectivities between women and nature. Moreover, and as outlined above, CAMs have often been viewed and represented as providing a ‘natural’ alternative to the techno-scientific approach of biomedicine. Here, we were interested whether such emphases would be evident in these women’s experiences of negotiating CAM and biomedicine. That is, whether Australian women who are current CAM users construct and deploy distinctions between practices and practitioners, on the basis of what is deemed to be natural. Moreover, whether such distinctions and discourses would (if at all) be utilized in regards to their concerns about their bodies. It should be noted that we did not initiate discussion of concepts such as nature or holism in the interviews, but rather, looked to see where such notions emerged spontaneously in their talk about health and illness. As it emerged, ‘naturalness’ was talked about as a positive feature of CAM practices by the majority of the women interviewed, and was cited as a central component of their self-care practices – particularly in the context of consumption of particular kinds of food, CAM and biomedicine:</p>

I’ve never been one for taking pills and potions, and I just thought that something natural would be better for my body, than something that’s been concocted by man. … ‘[F]rom dust you are, to dust you’ll return.’ So I guess I believe that you know, the body needs a lot of minerals and whatever else, to make us healthy, and I kind of, me personally, I kind of figure that the naturopath is probably a little bit more in tune with that, than what the ordinary doctors are, because they go for the more synthetic type stuff.</p>

<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>Um, I suppose it’s having a healthy body, without, if possible, having any scientific [sic] in your body, without putting anything foreign into your body. Um, I suppose that’s why I do take all this, all the supplements.</p>

<p>Complementary medicine? It’s really, … I always feel that the medication that a doctor would give you, really is, comes from trees, a long time ago, they’re probably intertwined really … I think that people are looking for more natural, rather than harshness I suppose, of some of the chemicals that are out there, and um, what would I say, doctor’s medicines I suppose.</p>

<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>… for you, what defines complementary medicine?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>something perhaps of a more natural nature, not synthetic and also again that is non-invasive, that you’re not, something that I’m potentially not hooked up to for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Another respondent’s comment:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Can you remember what made you decide to [take CAM supplements]?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>Mainly because I was dissatisfied with the medication from doctors, I’ve always been sort of anti that, to me it was manmade medicines, and I prefer to go natural if I could.</p>
</speech>
<p>As shown above, and in the interviews with many of the women, CAM and biomedicine were discursively positioned (with few exceptions) across a synthetic–natural division. The perceived closeness-to-nature (of practices and practitioners) was a dominant reason given for women’s engagement with complementary and alternative medicine and a correspondent avoidance of biomedicine. That is, the ingestion of nature sat in contrast to the synthetic foreignness of biomedicine. Furthermore, the complementarity of body and substance was spoken of as an important element of that which was to be consumed.</p>

<title>Moral framings, deficiencies and reclaiming agency</title>
<p>The ‘building up’ discourse is a prominent contemporary trope and the global supplementation industry has taken full advantage of what has been termed as the ‘worried well phenomenon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459312447258">Bell, 2005</xref>). Thus, commercialized self-care, in the form of vitamin and mineral supplementation in particular, to counter personal, embodied, psychological and environmental deficiencies has proliferated in the last two decades. Consistent with such a context, in the interviews, CAM supplementation was seen to allow one to overcome various failings of physical constitution and even moral agency:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>[…] so it’s not that I don’t eat fresh vegetables and stuff, it is that in the fresh vegetables and stuff, there is not, sometimes there is not the core, are they called core, or essential? Or whatever, health sustaining minerals and stuff. So that’s why I take them.</p>

<p>As shown above, CAM was about both bolstering the body and compensating for assumed or felt deficiencies in physiology and the environment. Talk of ‘deficiency’ was linked with moral deficiencies and dependency in the context of biomedicine, whereas in relation to CAM, ongoing usage tended not to be viewed as problematic in such ways. In other words, CAM use was viewed as ‘building you up’ whereas biomedicine tended to be experienced as encouraging dependency. It should be noted that some of the women did implicitly question the naturalness of ‘taking pills’, pointing to underlying commonalities between CAM and biomedical practices in this regard. Nevertheless, while both CAM and biomedicine were perceived as requiring ongoing ingestion and self-discipline, CAM use was not viewed as limiting a sense of autonomy and agency:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>I should not have to exist with them, in a [biomedical] pill culture, and depend on them; I should be able to keep on living, if they all went down the toilet for some reason or other.</p>
</speech>
<p>Another respondent’s comment:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>I don’t really like taking any tablets. That’s probably the main reason [I don’t take glucosamine], I just find it very difficult to put tablets in my mouth, so I don’t take them… . I don’t like daily, shovelling in tablets… . I think it’s the dailyness [sic] of it.</p>
</speech>
<p>Another respondent’s comment:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>A couple of my older sisters, one of them particularly drives, used to drive me mad when I was young when, with her health pills and things, you know we always used to joke about her, “she’d rattle like a [sic],”</p>
</speech>
<p>That bodily and behavioural deficiency created an imperative for intervention, albeit fraught in the context of biomedicine which was conceived as encouraging dependency and (unsustainable) artificiality. However, not all of the women accepted this discourse of CAM utilization. In a few exceptional cases, the use of CAM was explicitly linked to moral superficiality with a suggestion that CAM might be used for aesthetic, rather than substantive issues. One participant stated, for example:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>[…] I don’t want to denigrate genuine, good herbal stuff, because I think plants are there for us to benefit from, if they’ve got good properties. But I think people are obsessed about their bodies and their health.</p>
</speech>
<p>These women’s accounts contained some variations in perspective on what was ‘natural’, in terms of substances and the act of pill taking, as well as what could be deemed morally acceptable health behaviour. Nonetheless, underpinning these divergences in judgement and perspective were some important commonalities. First, participation in <italic>both</italic> CAM and biomedical practices were an act of strengthening a (female) body that was experienced as somewhat fragile and deficient in certain ways. Consumption of substance was thus simultaneously a physical and moral action embedded in a female body that required intervention. Overall, these data lend support to arguments about the ‘affinity with nature’ regarding women’s use of CAM and also the ‘resistance to biomedicine’ arguments regarding CAM consumption. However, as shown below, their accounts also problematized these arguments, leading us to suggest a new interpretation of women’s healthcare behaviour.</p>

<title>Hardness, softness and women’s representations and experience of health practices</title>
<p>The natural/synthetic and autonomy/dependency discourses outlined above, when examined further, are underpinned by ideas about the ‘hardness’ or ‘softness’ of practices with reference to the female body. Talking of women’s bodies in particular, the participants spoke of biomedicine as necessary when acute issues emerged, but as ‘hard on the body’. This was seen as much as a risk as potentially beneficial:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>I think conventional medicine has more of a sort of a powerful, it’s a lot stronger and more direct, and attacks the illness or whatever it is that you’ve got wrong, whereas the complementary medicines build up the body’s ability to look after itself, that’s the way I see it.</p>
</speech>
<p>Another respondent’s comment:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>[pause] I think conventional tends to be the heavy, they’re the heavies, you bring in the heavies to hit something bad, hard. And the complementary are the light things, the ones that you just take to trim the sails… . I think I’m a bit suspicious of doctors and things, because they always use such heavy handed ways of getting around you. Do you know what I mean? You have to be really crook, and then they give you big medicines to fix you up. Whereas if you’ve only got something that’s slightly wrong, you don’t really want to go and get big medicines to fix you up, and when they give you big medicines to fix you up, it’s like a hammer on a teeny tiny pin, it damages the tissue all around.</p>
</speech>
<p>This hard/soft contrast between CAM and biomedicine is a common representation within the popular media and patient accounts of care in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459312447258">Luff and Thomas, 2000</xref>). Within a wider cultural context of risk sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459312447258">Lupton, 1999</xref>), and within a historical context of biomedicine as surveilling and controlling women’s bodies, the notion of ‘hardness’ or ‘heaviness’ draws from a range of historical and cultural concerns around the body and professional approaches to care. Biomedicine’s perceived tendencies towards ‘breaking’ and/or ‘controlling’ the body were perceived as a high long-term price for a short-term gain. Such discourses however, concealed a contradiction in the women’s accounts. Although constructed as benign, the ‘gentle’, ‘natural’, CAM were nonetheless deemed potent enough to overcome the weaknesses for which they were being used, suggestive that the symbolism of CAM provided women a utopic ideal of risk-free potency.</p>
<p>Exploring the transmission of this fragility discourse across the range of CAM used by women yielded interesting insight that problematized both the affinity with nature and resistance notions. In the context of treatment for musculoskeletal conditions – where these women comparatively negotiated the use of chiropractic, osteopathy, Bowen therapy, massage and/or physiotherapy – there was a tendency for them to unpack the spectrum of approaches within CAM, and moreover, ascribe certain risks to both CAM <italic>and</italic> biomedical practices. Here, the dichotomous representations of CAM and biomedicine (as natural versus synthetic, soft versus hard) were noticeably disrupted. These CAM (manipulative therapies) were viewed by the women as crossing the binaries outlined above, drawing on the perceived harshness of biomedicine. Specifically, whether one used, or rejected, any of these treatments was firmly rooted in articulations of the extent to which a practitioner was deemed to be gentle or rough.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>… how would you describe your chiropractor?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>… Yeah, she’s very good. She doesn’t use the cracking method, she uses an activator … it puts a little jolt into the joint, it’s much gentler … if you had a major car accident, then you would need to go to hospital and they would need to put you back together again. Or maybe a heart attack, or um you know, those sort of major things that western medicine is very good on. But things like back pain and general health, I think it’s better to go with a gentler approach.</p>
</speech>
<p>Another respondent’s comment:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>I do like the Bowen therapy. It’s not too strong. I don’t like anybody doing really, like I wouldn’t like to go to a physio or anything like that, or a chiropractor. I’d rather have the massage type.</p>
</speech>
<p>Another respondent’s comment:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>[…] I have sort of also been going to a chiropractor. I was going to one until fairly recently who’s technique was rather forceful and aggressive, and very painful, and after one treatment there I sort of got a headache and I’ve never been prone to headaches, and I went back, and he said ‘oh it’s just because it’s sort of, was a really good fix.’ … So I stopped going to him um, but I started going to a different chiropractor … and it’s not as aggressive.</p>
</speech>
<p>In the context of manipulative therapies, women’s oppositional representations of CAM and biomedicine became less clear as they began to deconstruct the problematic of diversity within practitioner approaches and knowledge systems in the context of their (bodily) concerns. Concern with bodily fragility and musculoskeletal therapies is clearly embedded in the age of these women as well as the fact that such therapies represent in some respects, the more ‘physical’ CAM modalities.</p>
<p>What was clear within the interviews is CAM use was not about resistance, nor about the women perceiving themselves as necessarily affine to nature. Rather, the combination of discourses on supplementation and manipulative therapies positions these women as strategic negotiators and designers of their health and healthcare. Moreover, the notion of ‘nature’ is useful as a culturally salient anchor but one to which women can discursively couple and decouple in relation to other concerns of relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459312447258">Strathern, 1992</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-1363459312447258">
<title>Holism and dealing with the whole person</title>
<p>Much like the notion of ‘nature’, ‘holism’ has become central to popular and cultural discourse around CAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459312447258">Fadlon, 2005</xref>). Historically, it has been utilized as one way of differentiating between CAM and biomedicine. However, holism has also been heavily embraced in certain areas of medicine, allied health and social care, albeit in the form of multi-disciplinary, team-based care. In this context we refer to holism in the sense of an active integration of different facets or sensitivities (i.e. mind, body, spirit) within a healthcare practice or knowledge system. As opposed to the supplementation issues outlined above, the question of holism (or being ‘holistic’) is largely centred on practitioner-delivered CAMs. Within the interviews, when these women explained why they utilized CAM, ‘holism’ was spontaneously referred to by 14 respondents (13 of whom were positive, and one of whom was negative) among this group. Others explored the notion in less explicit terms but also emphasized this perceived integrative focus of CAM practices and practitioners. We focus here on the discursive representations of CAM as a form of care:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>I mean that’s what’s wrong with [medical] specialists, they’re specialists. And that’s why one would look at whole foods or a holistic you know, alternative, just to be treated as a person, not bits and pieces of something.</p>
</speech>
<p>Another respondent’s comment:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>Um, I guess that the most important thing is the fact that it [CAM] is more holistic than say, normal medicine. Um, I think more doctors are probably moving towards that … But generally speaking, I think doctors tend to rely a lot on medication, and the scientific, you know, proof and treatment of disease, and forget sometimes that there’s a person with feelings that need to be looked at, you know, that may be contributing to the illness. So to me, the alternative um, is a much more ah, understanding and acceptable, or more cognoscente I guess, of the fact that we are, you know, multi-dimensional and need to be treated as holistically as possible, in order to get the most benefit.</p>
</speech>
<p>Another respondent’s comment:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>[…] for many of them [CAM practitioners], they have a more holistic view of the body. So, when you’re being treated, they’re looking at your whole body, and not just the part of the body that is expressing the hurt at the moment.</p>
</speech>
<p>Another respondent’s comment:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>[…] They’re [doctors] not looking at your whole system, if you go to a naturopath they’ll look in your eyes, if you go to a Chinese herbalist he’ll do your tongue, your pulse, look at your whole system, and it is holistic, it’s meant to not just treat one little thing, in fact it doesn’t necessarily even name the disease, it’s not breaking it all up into parts, it’s holistic, it’s your whole system, getting things whole, and in their best health, and so then the whole organism profits.</p>
</speech>
<p>Holism was often not given an explicit description by the women, but rather took an implied meaning as being what biomedicine was not (or perhaps what biomedical practitioners are not). When it was described, holism was often articulated as not ‘forgetting there is a person’ and not being treated as ‘bits and pieces of something’. While some women spoke of themselves as <italic>more</italic> than their bodies (i.e. as persons foremost), in many cases women’s articulations of holism engaged talk of the ‘body’ and ‘organism’ thus betraying a persistent cultural conception of the biological self. Thus, some women’s articulations resonated with other work in the sociology of CAM, suggesting that embodied practices may facilitate the person becoming ‘understood in terms of interconnectedness of the mind, the body and even the spirit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459312447258">Sointu, 2006a</xref>: 219). But this was by no means ubiquitous, and the persistence of talk of a biological body highlighted the patchwork character of cultural production where biomedical conceptions mixed with alternative medical conceptions the self, the body and of the spirit. We would argue that such subjectivities were held concomitantly with more objective and encoded forms of knowledge of the body and the self. That is, as explored in the following section, the ‘subjective’ or ‘holistic turn’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459312447258">Fadlon, 2005</xref>), may be better described as a subject–object dialectic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459312447258">Broom, 2009</xref>) which women iteratively manage, involving the balancing of competing bodies of knowledge and systems of care; what may be considered a perspectivist epistemology (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459312447258">De Castro, 1998</xref>).</p>

<p>The ‘proof differential’ between CAM and biomedicine – that is, the extent to which so-called scientific evidence supports one or other practice – is the final dichotomy we seek to examine in relation to questions of embodiment. As these excerpts attest, women commonly explained their assessment of the efficacy of treatments in experiential terms:</p>

<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, so I find, you know, I just find that it’s [CAM] a little, it’s a little, it’s better for me, it suits me. You know, I’m one to listen to my body and say you know, ‘all right I need to, you know do something about this.’</p>

Yeah, but I’ve never gone back to him anyway, well I’ve never needed to.</p>

<p>Um, because prior to that I was very tired and listless and I don’t know, I just couldn’t function very well. And he prescribed this tonic … I felt on top of the world, I was completely energized and I felt fantastic. So I felt nothing like I was feeling before, and yet I hadn’t changed, if I’d made drastic changes to my food or something I’d think, ‘oh well, it was that’, but it wasn’t. So that’s what made me think that it actually worked.</p>
</speech>
<p>Another respondent comments:</p>

<speaker>Participant:</speaker>
<p>Ah, he sees me. Um, he checks me out, and talks to me about what’s bothering me, and um, just sort of feels you know, with his hands to see what’s out of line and whatever, and then I have a massage, he sends in the therapist for a massage. And then he comes in, and he works on me.</p>
</speech>
<p>The touch of a practitioner and the intuitive actions of others were a part of these women’s acceptance of subjective knowledge in assessing the value of practices and practitioners. Yet, in elevating such ways of knowing, women did not reject scientific proof or so-called ‘objective’ means of assessment. Rather, they would hold multiple bodies of knowledge, and thus multiple perspectives on their bodies, through their utilization of techniques of (outcome) measurement used to assess ‘progress’. That is, they would combine external measures of improvement with intuitive/subjective experiences of healing thus acknowledging the importance of both subjective well-being <italic>and</italic> the ability to ‘see oneself from the outside’ as an object or collection of reducible biophysical objects. In order to validate CAM practices, they strategically utilized biomedical practitioners as a means of cross-validation, or alternatively, viewed biomedical techniques as complementing the objectives of CAM practices and practitioners.</p>

<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>What were you going to see the physician for?</p>
</speech>

<p>… the only reason I kept going to see him [the physician] was that he gave me a blood test, which the naturopath at that stage couldn’t order. He thought I was taking the medication, but I wasn’t actually. … he [doctor] never looked at the LDL and the HDL, all he looked at was that one number … then I would take the results to the naturopath, and she would say ‘hey, but the HDL and the LDL are just what they should be, don’t worry about the numbers, it’s not so important’.</p>

<p>Well, because my older friend in Melbourne who’s 91, who has the MS, quite a few years ago they decided that she needed a gluten-free diet, then after a few years that she needed a dairy-free diet as well. Now I go and stay with her, and I cook with her, and I cook for her, and I cook for her here and take frozen meals down and keep her freezer stocked. And I can see sometimes when I’m with her, that she had a reaction to some food, and I sort of think “she needs a scientific test that says ‘bang, bang, bang, avoid these foods,’” instead of this long, experimental phase of eliminating some foods, and then sort of discovering that something else she is taking um, is a problem, and they’re not recognizing it.</p>
</speech>
<p>As shown in the above excerpts, issues of gatekeeping and expertise often resulted in strategic testing, a process in which biomedical practitioners were used to serve the purposes of the women and their CAM practices and practitioners. These technologies, while exclusive to the medical community, were co-opted and reinterpreted as the women sought to maximize multiple knowledge systems and practitioner approaches. Through their integrative use of plural ways of knowing, women paid little attention to the pure discourses of the ‘subjective’ and ‘objective’, the ‘scientific’ and ‘non-scientific’. Instead, they crossed boundaries of expertise, reinterpreting these according to intuitive, subjective and formalized forms of knowledge and measurement. Emergent among these women’s accounts, was a depiction of their bodies as whole, not because they are a phenomenological or physical unity (i.e. these constructions were not of the ‘person’), but due to an interpretation of themselves as a complex, inter-related, multi-dimensional, feeling, knowing and intuitive selves <italic>and also</italic> a body composed of biochemical substance. It was a body that could not be assessed from one vantage point but required a perspectivist lens to be apprehended in its full complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459312447258">De Castro, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>These women told stories of constant shifting and adaptation to varied forms of knowledge and expertise; they told of making constant shifts in perspective in order to decide on the validity of their treatment options and to achieve the best outcome emotionally and physically; they critically assessed diverse forms, and sources, of knowledge to inform their healthcare choices. By shifting perspectives they constructed themselves as complex, multi-dimensional bodies. The women professed the value of holism as an ontology, explicating the importance of anti-reductionist and inter-subjective ways of knowing and the role of intuition and phenomenol experience. However, they were also ‘testers’ and ‘validators’. In these shifting perspectives on the self, moving between subject and object, women actively compiled multi-layered identities. We interpret this form of bodily identity as exhibiting women’s embodiment of the limits of biomedical power (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459312447258">Rose, 2007</xref>). Unlike previous work that has posited that CAM might be integrative of ‘mind, body and spirit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312447258">Sointu, 2006b</xref>), we distinguish between <italic>interconnected</italic> and <italic>integrated</italic>, identifying the women here as depicting the former trait because they nevertheless reproduced the categorical distinctions associated with modernity. Specifically, these women persisted in depicting themselves as Cartesian ‘minds’ and ‘bodies’, or even of body parts as the issue dictated, pressing us to advance that, for these women, holism was in fact an articulation of seeing oneself from multiple, yet shifting, perspectives.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Exploring the experiences of a group of 60 Australian women from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health, most of whom were current users of CAM, has provided important insight that helps us better understand women’s engagement with both CAM and biomedicine. While previous work has explored women’s experiences of therapeutic engagement, rarely have we achieved meaningful insight into a range of experiences across a spectrum of health issues, practitioner forms and usage, and biomedical engagement. Moreover, a study of women at this life stage provides important insight with respect to understanding issues around ageing and chronic illness. These results should be viewed as situated within a particular point of time across the life course (and one that presents particular issues such as osteoarthritis, menopause, etc.) but as <italic>also</italic> providing a series of broader reflections on contemporary medical pluralism and therapeutic engagement and the potential gendering of such phenomena.</p>
<p>As we revealed earlier in this article, the majority of women who took part in this study did not reject one, or other, healthcare practice or profession outright, rather, they tentatively and reflexively negotiated plural health systems, idiosyncratically according to their health and illness needs. We were particularly interested in whether various assumptions such as: CAM as resistance; CAM as reaction to biomedical reductionism; CAM in reinserting subjectivity and holism into care, would be manifest in their accounts. And, we wanted to better understand how these women would make sense of the diversity of health practices at their disposal.</p>
<p>The question of resistance to biomedicine and revisioning of bodily pathology (i.e. one’s health and bodily issues) as a CAM-related practice, while not absent from these women’s accounts, was not a dominant feature. Rather than acting in a field of power and resistance, the women acted cautiously and constructively. In describing how one assesses design, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312447258">Latour (2008</xref>: 6) states:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When you check on your space suit before getting out of the space shuttle, you are radically cautious and cautiously radical … you are painfully aware of how precarious you are, and yet simultaneously, you are completely ready to artificially engineer and to design in obsessive detail what is necessary to survive.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Much like Latour’s depiction of an astronaut, these women were engaged in a collocation of practices that would sustain them – a reality they had themselves actively designed. And, through their engagement with such practices, the life sustaining institutions they had made came equally to make them. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312447258">Latour (2008</xref>: 4) notes, ‘[t]o design is never to create <italic>ex nihilo</italic>. … The most intelligent designers never start from a <italic>tabula rasa</italic>’. Here, in particular, women were shapers of pre-existing assemblages, rather than builders of new componentry. In some cases, much like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459312447258">Lévi-Strauss’s (1968)</xref> <italic>Le Bricoleur</italic>, these women added new traditions to old ones – this was evident in the persistence of the Cartesian mind and body that persisted in discussions of ‘holism’. In other respects, these women’s discursive inventions looked to be breaking down ‘old’ practices, such as contesting biomedicine while elevating the value of strengthening ‘natural’ supplementation. Across different modalities women could flexibly reference their articulations to the salient tropes of ‘nature’ and ‘holism’ but dispense with these as they were not deemed useful or relevant. Indeed, we consider that this shaping pattern gives evidence that women’s acts reflect a non-foundationalist epistemic strategy.</p>
<p>In saying this, a foundational ontology did exist in the notion of the fragile, gendered body that served to necessitate, but was also reproduced by, the practices described. A superficial reading may suggest that this self-interpretation betrayed a powerlessness for the female subjects. However, such ascription might be seen as having a kind of functional value and thus constitute a representation that holds a duplicitous power. As it motivated women to inscribe the (female) body in different ways so as it could ‘work’ across multiple paradigms, this conception maximized the utilization of healthcare resources to achieve or bolster health and well-being and treat illness/persons. Such a process could enable empowerment for these women, where power and efficacy of healthcare are achieved through a process of strategic response, alignment and translation. Moreover, and regardless of motivation, as <italic>designers</italic> women must surely be deemed transformers of healthcare practices.</p>
<p>It is important to note that we do not interpret CAM use, here, as an act of realizing potential, or self-actualization but instead as practice that adds something to the necessarily incomplete self and delimited ageing body. CAM use contributes to body building, and the design of the poststructural body that is polyaxial and multi-dimensional – durable yet flexible, whole yet incomplete. It is a body that exists in constant relations of transaction – translation – attempting to achieve durability and secure uncertain effects or positions within a multiplicity of shifting networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459312447258">Law, 1992</xref>)</p>
<p>We end by outlining a new direction for theory and methodology aimed at better understanding CAM practice. With much previous work based on samples derived on the basis of an individual health issue or CAM practice, it seems that some reification of the character of CAM (‘nature’, ‘holism’ and ‘subjectivity’) has occurred, thus exaggerating their purported potency as drivers of social action. This is not to say that previous studies have been in error; however, we suggest that future studies on CAM practice that explicitly focus on the complexity of negotiation of complex systems in order to treat complex concerns – perhaps within an older tradition of ‘naturalism’ in the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459312447258">Hammersley and Atkinson, 1989</xref>) – may be timely. In other words, the time has come to focus on CAM as it is embedded in lived experience and the everyday, to understand the boundaries and limitations of salient cultural norms in use, in order to provide new and important perspectives on the complexities of contemporary healthcare practice.</p>
