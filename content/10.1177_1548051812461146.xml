<abstract>
<p>The aim of the current research is to examine the relationships between learning culture and performance along with the mediating interaction of knowledge creation. Data for this study were collected from five Korean firms through use of in-house intranet self-response surveys. Responses from 633 manager-level employees were used to identify the relationships among four variables: cultural aspects of the learning organization, four modes of knowledge creation practices, perceived level of knowledge gaining, and perceived level of financial performance. All constructs previously have been identified as related concepts in certain ways; however, no specific and empirically verified structural complex model exists. In this research, first, the influential and causal relations among the variables were examined, and second, a model comparison was conducted between the initially proposed and alternatively proposed structural models. Structural equation modeling and canonical correlation analysis were used for the analyses. The results suggest that the input-related concept of learning culture is not directly related to outcome-related organizational financial improvement but rather has mediating effects through the process-related concept of knowledge creation. Suggestions for future research and implications for human resource development and performance-oriented management are discussed.</p>

<p>Knowledge-based performance improvement is a critical concern in the field of general management and human resource development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812461146">Škerlavaj, Song, &amp; Lee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812461146">Song, Yoon, &amp; Yoon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051812461146">Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1548051812461146">Swanson &amp; Holton, 2001</xref>). Much attention has been given to identification of the influential factors that enhance learning-based performance improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812461146">Ellis, Margalit, &amp; Segev, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812461146">Holton, Chen, &amp; Naquin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051812461146">Kontoghiorghes, Awbrey, &amp; Feurig, 2005</xref>). Cultural aspects of the learning organization have emerged as a critical factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1548051812461146">Song, Jeung, &amp; Cho, 2011</xref>); research has empirically tested the relationship of the learning organization to outcome-related measures such as performance level, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, learning transfer, and organizational creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812461146">Cummings &amp; Worley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812461146">Egan, Yang, &amp; Berrelt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812461146">Ellinger, Ellinger, Yang, &amp; Howton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1548051812461146">Yang, Watkins, &amp; Marsick, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature suggests that some levels of organizational performance improvement are influenced by cultural aspects of the learning organization: a continuous collaborative organizational learning process occurs to apply earned knowledge in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812461146">Ellinger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812461146">Song, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1548051812461146">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). However, little attention has been focused on the question of how to convert this learning into more tangible and applicable explicit knowledge, which could be assumed to be a process-related function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812461146">Song &amp; Chermack, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1548051812461146">Yoon, Song, &amp; Lim, 2009</xref>). This issue has been a topic of interest in the general management and organizational behavioral disciplines in studies of how people create knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812461146">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1548051812461146">von Krogh, Ichijo, &amp; Nonaka, 2000</xref>) and how this created knowledge might be applied in the workplace as the agent for organizational performance improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051812461146">Peltokorpi, Nonaka, &amp; Kodama, 2007</xref>). However, these studies somewhat neglect the organizational learning process that is at the heart of dynamic knowledge creation. Both facilitate several types of performance, including organizational financial performance and knowledge gain.</p>
<p>We maintain that to achieve better understanding of knowledge-based organizational performance improvement, both cultural aspects of the learning organization and the knowledge creation process need to be explored in greater detail. In this study, we integrate two different perspectives from the disciplines of human resource development (HRD) and management/organizational behavior and posit a systematic approach based on three components of general systems theory: input, process, and outcome.</p>
<sec id="section1-1548051812461146">
<title>Significance of the Research</title>
<p>One of the basic foundations of general management is the systematic approach and system theory, which consists of three components—input, process, and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1548051812461146">Swanson &amp; Holton, 2001</xref>). According to this approach, HRD professionals focus on how to improve organizational outcomes through learning-related input and process. We have input-related components, which include learning interventions, training, organizational changes, and supportive learning culture; furthermore, we have expected outcomes of the HRD input, which are related to improving human performance at both the individual and organization levels. However, process appears to be missing. Some scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051812461146">Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1548051812461146">Swanson &amp; Holton, 2001</xref>) insist that learning interventions and training treatment could be considered as HRD processes; however, individuals’ learning outcomes need to be examined as these relate to applicable new knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1548051812461146">Song &amp; Kolb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1548051812461146">Yoon, Song, Lim, &amp; Joo, 2010</xref>). Thus, only through organizational learning process and knowledge creation practices may organizational performance be realized. To address this issue in this research, we adapted the concept of the knowledge creation process from the knowledge management field and hypothesized that this process could play a linkage role to bridge HRD input and outcome. More details on these issues are covered in the literature review section. This approach has the advantage of building HRD theory with empirically analyzed results while also providing rationale for the use of HRD interventions for performance improvement.</p>

<title>Research Purposes and Questions</title>
<p>To date, whereas much attention has been given to the impact of learning organization culture (organization’s system and climate related input) to explain organizational performance-related outcomes (expected output), less attention has been given to an examination of the process that occurs between input and output, specifically how the learning process affects performance. We posit that the knowledge creation process plays an important role in linking input and outcome.</p>
<p>The dictionary definition of the term <italic>learning</italic> is “the acquisition of knowledge through experience, practice, or study” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051812461146">Learning, n.d</xref>., <italic>Oxford College Dictionary</italic>), although the conceptual meaning of organizational learning is the process of shaping integrative knowledge through the sharing of experiences and learning from the group of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812461146">Argyris &amp; Schön, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812461146">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051812461146">Huber, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812461146">Levitt &amp; March, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812461146">Senge, 1990</xref>). Although individuals, of course, gain knowledge and achieve success when working alone, we conceptualize knowledge creation here as a collaborative practice, following the view of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812461146">Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995)</xref>, who define knowledge creation primarily as the collaborative practices of individuals that lead to a “justified true belief,” which could be applicable knowledge in the workplace. We acknowledge that there are other equally valid definitions. From the cultural influential perspective, learning organization culture promotes the individuals’ continuous learning process and supports the collaborative organizational learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812461146">Senge, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1548051812461146">Watkins &amp; Marsick, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1548051812461146">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1548051812461146">Yoon et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>From these perspectives, we construct the following chain of learning that influences organizational knowledge creation and performance improvement: (a) individual learning is the basis of organizational knowledge creation, (b) organizational learning process is the booster for dynamic collaboration, and (c) knowledge creation is the process by which individuals’ dispersed learning experience is converted to organizational actionable knowledge.</p>
<p>In this research, our focus is on identifying how knowledge creation practices could play a role in linking supportive learning culture to perceived level of organizational performance improvement. The following research questions address this issue:</p>

<title>Review of the Relevant Literature</title>
<p>The following topics, all related to organizational learning theories, HRD, and performance management, are reviewed in this section: (a) learning organization culture, (b) individual learning and organizational learning, and (c) knowledge creation practices.</p>
<sec id="section4-1548051812461146">
<title>Organizational Learning Culture</title>
<p>The cultural aspects of the organization could influence most of its learning process; this is the basis of the concept of the learning organization. The purpose of the learning organization culture is promoting and encouraging individuals’ organizational learning practices through the supportive climate of learning, system, and organizational structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812461146">Škerlavaj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1548051812461146">Watkins &amp; Marsick, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1548051812461146">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1548051812461146">Yoon et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1548051812461146">Yang et al. (2004)</xref>, many learning environment–related aspects have emerged and have been considered to define the appropriate learning organization constructs through the integrations of (a) the System Perspective of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812461146">Senge (1990)</xref>; (b) the Organizational Learning Perspective of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051812461146">Pedler, Burgoyne, and Boydell (1991)</xref>; and (c) the Organizational Structure Perspective of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812461146">Garvin (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812461146">Goh (1998)</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section5-1548051812461146">
<title>The system perspective</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812461146">Senge (1990)</xref> defined the essential five disciplines that a functional learning organization should possess: (a) <italic>team learning</italic>, focus on the learning practices of team-levels rather than on improvement of team process; (b) <italic>shared vision</italic>, ability to unearth the shared “vision of entire organization” that promotes continuous effort rather than compliance; (c) <italic>mental models</italic>, embedded internal self-guidance of how the organization works; (d) <italic>personal mastery</italic>, continually developing and deepening personal competencies following the career pathway; and (e) <italic>system thinking</italic>, ability to organize all aspects of the entire organization based on the view of interrelationship rather than on the view of a linear cause–effect chain. These five disciplines provide valuable principles that guide strategic planning for building a learning organization. Even though these basic principles are valuable in working toward learning organization status, attention needs to focus on developing and measuring observable characteristics of such organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1548051812461146">Yang et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1548051812461146">
<title>Organizational learning perspective</title>
<p>One of the other approaches is the supportive learning–based environment that has been represented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051812461146">Pedler et al. (1991)</xref>. They stressed the importance of facilitative and supportive factors of learning activities for the continuous learning process and transformation of itself to meet the organization’s strategic goals. This learning perspective provides interactive and comprehensive aspects of organizational learning in all entities of the organization along with 11 identified applied areas: learning approach to organizational strategy, participative policymaking process, interactive informating, formative accounting and control, internal exchange, flexible reward system, enabling structure, boundary workers as environmental scanners, collaborative intercompany learning, appropriative learning climate, and self-directed individual development. These 11 aspects have the merit of a comprehensive approach; however, they lack a parsimonious framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1548051812461146">Yang et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1548051812461146">
<title>Organizational structure perspective</title>
<p>According to the literature on the organizational structure approach for building learning organizations, one of the essential notions of the learning organization environment is that of internal drivers for building organizational learning capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812461146">Garvin, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812461146">2000</xref>). Based on Garvin’s definition, a learning organization is required to create, transfer, and modify organizational knowledge and lead to reflective behavioral change in which knowledge is applied to the workplace. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812461146">Goh (1998)</xref>, furthermore, presents the five enablers for building the learning organization: clarity and support for organizational mission and vision, shared leadership and positive involvement, supportive organizational culture for experimentation, organizational-level knowledge sharing and transfer, and collaborative teamwork based on the alliance with appropriate organizational structure and employees’ roles and task competencies. Those two approaches, in the macro perspective, provide the guidance, as prerequisites, for managerial practices or strategic planning for building a foundation for the learning organization. These approaches, however, neglect some of the essential components of the learning organization, such as the individuals’ learning process and continuous learning. Furthermore, from the theoretical standpoint, some of the proposed components might not be conceptually parallel (organizational capacity vs. organizational culture); and those perspectives might be the measurement of the overall structure of the organization rather than the set of measures of a particular aspect—the construct of the learning organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1548051812461146">Yang et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Last, the concept of the learning organization is the essential encouraging factor for dynamic organizational learning through enhancing the individuals’ continuous learning and knowledge sharing practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1548051812461146">Zagoršek, Dimovski, &amp; Škerlavaj, 2009</xref>), and it could be an input-related organization’s cultural component from the perspectives of the systematic HRD approach.</p>

<title>Individual and Organizational Learning</title>
<p>Learning is the collectivistic activities of individuals for discovering new concepts through several intuitional approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051812461146">Merriam, Caffarella, &amp; Baumgartner, 2007</xref>). In the activities of individual learning, individuals are using past experiences, existing knowledge, and surrounding environmental understanding for shaping newly learned facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812461146">Brussig &amp; Leber, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812461146">Mezirow, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051812461146">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812461146">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>). More specifically, individuals can learn through generative learning, reflective learning, and transformative learning processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812461146">Sessa &amp; London, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812461146">Song &amp; Chermack, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1548051812461146">Yoon et al., 2009</xref>). All these learning practices could occur independently and jointly depending on the learning subjects and individuals’ learning style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812461146">Joughin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051812461146">Kolb &amp; Kolb, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812461146">Messick, 1996</xref>). No matter how individuals’ learning processes may differ, in this research, we focused on the issue that individuals’ learning practices should be the heart of the organizational learning process, and individuals’ learning is the agent and basis for the process of organizational learning that permeates an organization.</p>
<p>The field of organizational learning gained attention very rapidly in the 1990s, with the first mention of the concept going back 40 years (March &amp; Simon, 1958, as cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812461146">Smith, Snell, &amp; Gherardi, 1998</xref>). In the 1970s, the concept was formatted as the applicable discipline by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812461146">Argyris and Schön (1978)</xref>. Organizational learning practice is the collaborative learning process among groups of individuals and has been defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812461146">Levitt and March (1988)</xref> as “the learning from direct experience, how organizations learn from the experience of others, and how organizations develop conceptual frameworks or paradigms for interpreting that experience” (p. 319). Adapting this definition, the organizational learning process is a mechanism for collecting individuals’ experience and knowledge for the purpose of exploring broader knowledge through sharing and integrating practices. Group diversity and the individuals’ readiness and capacity to learn enhance the quality of the organizational learning process. The collective approaches of individuals’ dynamic learning process enhances the organizational learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812461146">Škerlavaj et al., 2010</xref>), resulting in a synthesis and a broader perspective that enhances the organizations’ ability to solve problems, make decisions, and develop new strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812461146">Dimovski, Hernaus, Kimman, &amp; Škerlavaj, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-1548051812461146">
<title>Organizational Knowledge Creation</title>
<p>The concept of knowledge creation has received attention mainly in the fields of knowledge management and organizational studies. The book titled <italic>The Knowledge Creating Company</italic> is one of the most widely acknowledged contributions to the subject of knowledge creation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812461146">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>). This work suggests four modes of knowledge conversion theory based on the systematic conversion between tacit and explicit types of knowledge. The four modes include (a) knowledge socialization—tacit and tacit knowledge; (b) knowledge externalization—tacit and explicit knowledge; (c) knowledge combination—explicit and explicit knowledge; and (d) knowledge internalization—explicit and tacit knowledge. Detailed descriptions of each mode of knowledge conversion theory are discussed below.</p>
<p>The first mode is the knowledge socialization process; the primary practice in this mode is collaborative sharing tacit knowledge among the individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812461146">Nonaka, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812461146">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812461146">Nonaka, Toyama, &amp; Konno, 2000</xref>). Individuals have their own unique knowledge and experience; thus, sharing the diverse contents of knowledge and experience could be the fundamental booster for dynamic knowledge-related actions in the workplace. More specifically, individuals’ tacit knowledge could be acquired only through shared and hands-on experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812461146">Nonaka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812461146">Nonaka &amp; Toyama, 2003</xref>). Consequently, interactive social activities could be the key for sharing each individual’s tacit knowledge. These social interactions include not only those among employees but also interactions with customers and outside competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051812461146">Nonaka, Peltokorpi, &amp; Tomae, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The second mode is the knowledge externalization process, which is the practice of articulating tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812461146">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812461146">Nonaka, Takeuchi, &amp; Umemoto, 1996</xref>). Based on shared tacit knowledge and experiences, explicit knowledge could be crystallized for better and easier understanding among the individuals, and it could become the basis of new knowledge. Understandable concept creation in new product development is an example of this mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812461146">Nonaka et al., 2000</xref>). In this process, the sequential use of metaphor, analogy, and visual model is the most critical agent for converting tacit knowledge into conceptually explicit knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812461146">Nonaka et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812461146">Nonaka &amp; Toyama, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The third mode is the knowledge combination process, which is the practice of “converting explicit knowledge into more complex and systematic sets of explicit knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812461146">Nonaka et al., 2000</xref>, p. 9). Several types of explicit knowledge, which is articulated from inside and outside the organization, systematically are combined, edited, or reshaped to form more practical knowledge for future decision making and applications in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812461146">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>). Once the combined explicit knowledge is created, more importantly, it needs to be disseminated among all group members for another round of knowledge combination practices. Technology-based knowledge repository systems and dynamic networks could facilitate this mode of knowledge conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812461146">Nonaka et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812461146">Nonaka et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The fourth mode is the knowledge internalization process, which is the practice of forming a shared mental model through embodying explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812461146">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>). The knowledge created is shared throughout the organization and, in turn, converted into each individual’s tacit knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812461146">Nonaka et al., 2000</xref>). Individuals have their own system of converting and grasping knowledge into their own mental model; consequently, each individual’s unique understanding of the explicit knowledge could be the basis of the continuous circulative knowledge creation process in terms of diverse prosperities of individuals’ tacit knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812461146">Nonaka et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, the fourth mode of the knowledge conversion process is not a one-time round but instead circulative continuous rounds, and through the repeated knowledge conversion processes the organization could create more applicable explicit knowledge from the individuals’ tacit knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812461146">Nonaka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812461146">Nonaka &amp; Nishiguchi, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, in this knowledge worker–oriented economic arena, knowledge creation is the most influential determinant for improving organizational knowledge performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812461146">Song, Kolb, Lee, &amp; Kim, 2012</xref>), which consequently results in organizational financial outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812461146">Drucker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1548051812461146">Thurow, 2003</xref>). From the knowledge economy standpoint, knowledge creation practices could directly affect both levels of organizational performance—knowledge gaining and financial performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812461146">Song, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on this integrative literature review and research questions, the following research framework was developed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548051812461146">Figure 1</xref>). This conceptual framework was developed through a literature review of articles from two major disciplines—HRD and organization studies—that focused on the concepts of the cultural aspects of the learning organization and knowledge conversion–based knowledge creation theory and their theoretical connections for performance improvement.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The target sample group for this research was composed of employees in five subsidiary companies of a Korean private conglomerate. Large organizations were selected since they have a more strategic learning support system, in terms of the learning organization, than smaller organizations. Such organizations also have more structured research and development entities and strategic customer care functions, both of which have been identified in the literature as required for creative knowledge process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051812461146">Frey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051812461146">Lin &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1548051812461146">Tsai, 2001</xref>). Purposive sampling criteria were applied to identify managerial-level employees since people in management positions were considered to be more knowledgeable about organizational performance, another factor of interest in this study. Of the 2,000 employees identified, a total of 633 respondents submitted data that were used for data analyses. Industries included electronic, finance/insurance, IT-solution, service, and heavy industry. In terms of type of job and function, around 40% of participants work in research and development, 18% are in sales and marketing, and 12% are in production-related function. Regarding the length of work experience, 75% have more than 9 years, and only 10% have less than 5 years of work experience. More than 60% are in senior manager–level positions. Approximately 67% were male. Specific demographic information of the sample is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1548051812461146">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Instruments and Procedure</title>
<p>This research measured the cultural aspects of the learning organization, knowledge creation practices, and perceived levels of organizational performance. To collect the data, online survey questionnaires were distributed through an in-house intranet server on behalf of the senior manager of the human resource development center of the conglomerate. All the questionnaire items were measured using a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>Strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>Strongly agree</italic>).</p>
<p>To measure the cultural aspects of the learning organization, the Dimensions of the Learning Organization Questionnaire (DLOQ) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1548051812461146">Watkins and Marsick (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1548051812461146">1996)</xref> was used. The original version of the DLOQ has 43 items for 7 dimensions; however, in this research, the abbreviated version of the DLOQ with 21 items was used. This abridged version of the DLOQ does not decrease the value of the measurement, and it has been validated in several contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051812461146">Song &amp; Chermack, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1548051812461146">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1548051812461146">Zhang, Zhang, &amp; Yang, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>To measure the knowledge creation process based on the four modes of knowledge conversion theory, we developed a questionnaire based on previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051812461146">Oh, 2001</xref>) and empirically examined the item internal consistency and construct validity to ensure the general validity issue of the instrument. A total of 23 items were developed—knowledge sharing (7 items: e.g., I share my ideas and experiences with other people; I gather work-related information from other people and departments), creating concepts (7 items: e.g., I facilitate creative and constructive conversation among group members; I develop general rules and concepts based on the several examples; Our team develops new ideas through constructive dialogue]), justifying concepts (5 items: e.g., Newly developed concepts are evaluated by a reasonable assessing system and organizational mission and vision in a timely manner; I engage in developing criteria to determine the value of the new concepts; Our team conducts experiments and shares the newly developed concepts with the entire organization to evaluate the applicability of the concepts]), and prototyping concepts (4 items: e.g., Our team is good at developing ideas into tangible results; Various departments collaborate to build the final products; Our team combines existing and new concepts in meaningful way to develop new products).</p>
<p>To measure the perceived levels of organizational performance improvement based on the comparison with the situations in the last year of the organization, the earlier instrument of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812461146">Ellinger et al. (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1548051812461146">Yang et al. (2004)</xref> was adapted. This instrument consists of two parts for measuring both perceived levels of performance improvement—financial performance improvement (6 items: e.g., In my organization, return on investment us greater than last year) and knowledge performance improvement (6 items: e.g., In my organization, the number of new products or services is greater than last year); each part has six measurement items.</p>
<p>All three parts of the instruments were originally developed in English; thus, to apply them in the Korean context, a procedure for translation into the sample’s mother tongue language was required. Both forward and backward approaches were conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812461146">Brislin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812461146">Harkness, van de Vijver, &amp; Mohler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812461146">Presser et al., 2004</xref>), and several groups were involved in the translation processes including HRD doctoral candidates, English teachers, and PhD-level HRD practitioners.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>First, the basic analyses for measurement item reliability and construct validity of the proposed model were tested. For analyzing reliability and validity of the measurements, scale reliability estimates, zero-order correlation coefficients, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used.</p>
<p>Next, to test the relationships among the hypothesized constructs, canonical correlation analyses (CCA) were used. Each of the constructs is the latent variable, so each has groups of submeasurement items. Without summative procedures, considering the error variances of each observed item, CCA is the most appropriate method to analyze the correlations among the sets of the latent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812461146">Lutz &amp; Eckert, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051812461146">Stowe, Watson, &amp; Robertson, 1980</xref>). To measure the amount of the shared variances, the <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> type of effect sizes was considered. This CCA analysis would provide information for the better understanding of how much variance the matched variables were sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812461146">Sherry &amp; Henson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As a final step, structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches were used to measure the causal and influential relationships among the constructs in the hypothesized model. To measure the magnitude of the causal relationships among the constructs, squared path coefficient (SPC) estimates were mainly tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812461146">Kline, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>The basic analyses of the item scale reliability suggested that overall scale reliability estimations of all constructs were sufficiently reliable (Cronbach α ranges from .783 to .953); and the intercorrelations among the constructs were acceptable (correlations coefficient ranges from .492 to .829) as they were in the range of a moderate-level correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051812461146">Cohen, 1998</xref>); one exception is the correlation between the learning organization culture and knowledge creation. Thus, possible multicollinearity and auto (serial) correlation violations were empirically examined.</p>
<p>According to the Durbin–Watson value (1.857) and VIF value (2.949), no violation of serial correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051812461146">Kutner, Nachtsheim, &amp; Neter, 2004</xref>) and no issues regarding multicollinearity (tolerance value should be greater than 1 − <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) among the research constructs were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051812461146">Leech, Barrett, &amp; Morgan, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, all submeasures of each construct were summated for forming one construct; thus, subitem reliability estimations were separately circulated along with the number of items.

<p>Second, for testing the construct validities of the proposed instruments, CFAs were computed.

<title>Simple Relationships Among the Sets of the Constructs</title>
<p>To assess the simple relationships among the sets of the proposed constructs, CCAs were used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1548051812461146">Table 5</xref>). More economically, basic analyses of the CCA were conducted based on the examinations of Wilks’s Λ and <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> type of effect sizes. Among the several tests of the canonical correlation analysis, Wilks’s Λ is the easiest method to understand the amount of the shared variances between the sets of the variables. Wilks’s Λ represents the amount of the unexplained variances between the sets of the variables; thus, 1 − Wilks’s Λ could represent the amount of the explained variances by the proposed model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812461146">Sherry &amp; Henson, 2005</xref>).

<title>Influential Relationships Among the Hypothesized Constructs</title>
<p>The two-step approach of SEM analyses was used for examining the model-data fit of the structural model and for analyzing the relationships among the constructs in the structural model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812461146">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>; Byrne, 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051812461146">David, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The model fit to the collected data was tested for the structural model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548051812461146">Figure 1</xref>). The results showed the acceptable model-data fit of the proposed structural model based on several examinations of the model fit indices, χ<sup>2</sup>(633) = 988.14, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 4.41; RMSEA = .07; RMR = .05; CFI = .98; GFI = .88; AGFI = .85.

<p>According to the findings of two nonsignificant path coefficient estimations on the direct impacts of the learning organization culture and knowledge creation process on the perceived level of the organizational financial performance, an alternative structural model—omitting the paths of nonsignificant direct impacts—was considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1548051812461146">Figure 3</xref>). The results suggest that all the path coefficient estimates were found to be statistically significant among the constructs. Although the magnitudes of the path coefficients were slightly changed, the strongest impact of the learning organization culture was on the knowledge creation process (SPC = .91, <italic>t</italic> = 19.39). According to the results of the SEM analysis of the alternative structural model, the knowledge creation process has a mediating effect on learning organization culture in predicting the perceived level of organizational financial performance improvement.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<sec id="section19-1548051812461146">
<title>Summary of Findings</title>
<p>For this study, we integrated two different perspectives from the disciplines of human resource development and management/organizational behavior and posited a systematic approach based on three components of general systems theory: input, process, and outcome. Although much attention has been given to the impact of the organization’s climate-related input factor of learning organization culture on the outcome factor of organizational performance, less attention has been focused on how process, particularly knowledge creation, could affect sense making and thus influence performance levels.</p>
<p>Following the testing of our original proposed model, we created an alternative structural model by omitting the paths of nonsignificant direct impacts. According to the results of SEM analysis of the alternative structural model, the knowledge creation process has a mediating effect on learning organization culture in predicting the perceived level of organizational financial performance improvement.</p>
<p>The direct impacts of learning organization and knowledge creation constructs on the perceived level of financial performance were found to be statistically nonsignificant. However, and importantly, the knowledge creation process and the perceived level of knowledge-related organizational performance were found to play a mediating role in predicting the influence of the learning organization culture on the perceived level of organizational financial performance improvement.</p>
<p>Although this does not mean that we should discount the influence of organizational learning culture on performance, it does mean that we should reconsider the important role of the knowledge creation process. Results of this study reinforce the need to examine how process and practices directly and indirectly affect organizational outcomes. As reported, the direct impact of the learning organization on the knowledge creation process was two times stronger than its direct impact on knowledge performance. Much research effort and practitioner attention has been focused and continues to be focused on the learning organization. Research findings justify this pursuit. As we move forward and add to our understanding of this concept and the ways in which the learning organization interacts with and influences other variables, knowledge creation emerges as a variable worthy of further study. Knowledge creation might be viewed as a more nuanced and explicit exploration of learning transfer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1548051812461146">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The importance of organizational learning culture and its influential impact on organizational knowledge and financial performance improvement are emerging as a hallmark for the field of management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812461146">Dimovski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812461146">Egan et al., 2004</xref>). Although further studies are needed to explore the complexity of relationships among related constructs, this research makes a contribution to organization performance research and practice by taking an interdisciplinary approach based on merging learning culture and the knowledge creation process in the workplace to predict performance levels. Results add to extant literature on learning culture with the finding on the value of process and, specifically, the mediating effects of the knowledge creation process in predicting the influence of learning culture on performance improvement. Finally, results add scholarly value to performance-oriented management research and practice by proposing consideration of all three required concepts of system theory—input, process, and outcomes.</p>
<p>As the findings from this current research suggest, learning organization cultural aspects are more closely related to organization’s system and climate, which might not have a direct impact on the organizational outcome-related factors. However, when process-related knowledge creation practices are considered simultaneously, the dynamic integration between the two concepts increase the levels of organizational performance. Furthermore, the knowledge creation process itself could significantly influence organizational performance improvement in terms of more practical concepts. Today’s corporations place high value on the creation and transfer of knowledge. One reason for this is the importance of knowledge creation to organizational financial outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812461146">Song et al., 2012</xref>). The concept of the knowledge creation process could be aligned with the learning transfer approach by overlaying the more concrete approach on the slightly vague concept of learning transfer.</p>
<p>Although transfer of learning has always been of interest, most studies have focused on measurable changes that have resulted from transfer. To date, little regard has been given in the HRD field to the process by which individuals create more explicit and applicable knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1548051812461146">Song &amp; Kolb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1548051812461146">Yoon et al., 2009</xref>). According to this empirically verified research, the importance of human knowledge creation practices could be a new area for HRD study. Close examination of these processes could lead to identification and dissemination of best practices. The validated measurements discussed here provide tools to assess these practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1548051812461146">
<title>Limitations and Recommendations</title>
<p>Several limitations regarding the research variables, the sample, and the approach should be noted.</p>
<p>In this research, perceptual responses were used for measuring the proposed constructs. Financial performance information, in particular, could be measured more accurately with use of hard information such as return on assets and return on equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812461146">Ellinger et al., 2002</xref>). Such information was not available for this study. Although we realize that lack of objective measures of performance are a commonly cited problem in studies reported in HRD and management literature, we suggest that such data are valuable and necessary not only for research but also for practice. Ties to bottom-line results will serve to focus management attention on the constructs measured and the issues discussed. Additionally, measurement of the knowledge creation process could be examined more rigorously by using a psychometric approach to develop more statistically solid questionnaires, which reduce any possible common-method variance issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1548051812461146">Williams, Hartman, &amp; Cavazotte, 2010</xref>). This step is recommended for future work.</p>
<p>Regarding the sample framework, participants all were management-level employees of large-size private Korean firms that have at least 1,000 employees. Although the sample was chosen with care and made sense in terms of the constructs under examination, demographics of the sample limit the generalizability of the results. For future studies, a more diverse sample framework needs to be considered. Comparison research with samples in the public sector could increase the applicability of the findings.</p>
<p>As a final limitation, except for performance-related constructs, variables of interest could be studied in greater detail by using a qualitative approach. Results presented here could be used as a framework for such research.</p>
