<abstract>
<p>Over the past decade the contours of political party competition in Latin America have been dramatically altered by an upsurge of support for leftist–populist parties and the related weakening of established parties on the center and right end of the political spectrum. Drawing on both aggregate and individual-level evidence, this article explores the roots of this swing of the political pendulum. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, which attributes the rising “pink tide” to citizen dissatisfaction with market-oriented policies, economic performance, and/or social inequality, the analysis focuses on the role played by improving external economic conditions during the early 2000s, which relaxed the preexisting constraints on policy choice, enhanced the credibility of anti–status quo political actors, and created new opportunities for the pursuit of statist, nationalist, and redistributive political projects and associated challenges to U.S. hegemony. Consistent with this line of theoretical argument, the macro-level evidence indicates that the odds of electing a leftist–populist president in the region rose with improvements in the terms of trade. At the micro level, survey data also show that support for leftist–populist presidents in the region has been positively associated with citizen satisfaction with democracy and the state of the economy as well as with anti-Americanism. The results underline the potential significance of economic fluctuations for understanding electoral dynamics and party system change, particularly under conditions in which government policy choice is constrained by the operation of international markets.</p>

<body>
<p>Research on the advanced industrial democracies suggests that the contours of party system competition once established are relatively stable. At the micro level, citizens develop political beliefs and partisan loyalties via processes of political socialization that tend to be biased in favor of established parties. At the macro level, political institutions are engineered by the leading electoral contenders, and strategic adaptation to electoral system incentives locks in the partisan advantages associated with the equilibrium way of doing things. Winners also choose policies, whether targeted transfers or public goods, to mobilize electoral support and protect their positions against the rise of new challengers. The logic of the democratic political game therefore has usually been seen as working to the advantage of established political parties, deterring outside challenges to the status quo, limiting the menu of political choices offered to voters, and “freezing” party allegiances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414011428595">Lipset &amp; Rokkan, 1967</xref>).</p>
<p>The limitations of this theoretical perspective for understanding the evolution of party systems in other parts of the world are pronounced. Discontinuities are frequently more evident than continuities, pushing questions about electoral change to the forefront of the research agenda. Perhaps nowhere is this tendency more marked than in the study of Latin America. Over the past decade, the region has experienced a dramatic swing of the political pendulum toward leftist–populist governance, producing new policy challenges to the socioeconomic status quo and fundamental transformations of preexisting party systems. Even the Mexican and Venezuelan party systems, traditionally regarded as “well institutionalized,” have been affected by these trends, as evidenced by the emergence of new parties of the left, the Partido Revolucionario Democrático in Mexico and the Movimiento Quinta República in Venezuela, and the nearly total collapse of established Venezuelan parties.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to explore the roots of these changes. Why has the comparative fluidity of partisan attachments and electoral institutions in Latin America worked in favor of leftist–populist government? Does the “pink tide” reflect major shifts in the ideological orientation of citizens, dissatisfaction with the programmatic convergence of established parties around market-oriented reform, and/or growing popular disillusionment with political democracy? What constituencies have supported leftist presidents? And, finally, what role, if any, have international factors played in the process? By addressing these and related questions about Latin America, this article is designed to provide a systematic empirical analysis of the rise of leftist–populist governments in the region and, more broadly, to shed light on electoral dynamics under conditions in which neither stable individual-level political attachments nor macro-level incentive structures promote equilibrium electoral outcomes.</p>

<title>The Rise of the Left in Latin America</title>
<p>The shift to leftist–populist rule in Latin America began with the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. Leaving to one side the case of Cuba, over the succeeding decade an additional 10 countries joined the rising “pink tide,” and 2 others came close to doing so. By 2009 more than half of the countries and citizens of the region were governed by some form of leftist–populist government. Although the conceptual definitions that have been applied to the phenomenon vary widely, there exists a relatively high level of consensus on the empirical referents of terms such as “new left” or “leftist–populism.” The basic terrain is mapped out in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011428595">Table 1</xref>. Included in the table are all of the leaders regularly cited in recent literature as leftist or leftist–populist because of their anti–status quo appeals for expanded rights of social citizenship, regardless of the ideological variations among them. The latter are nontrivial. For example, although Hugo Chávez has utilized the rhetoric of nationalism and socialism to attack neoliberal policies and the United States, Tabaré Vásquez of Uruguay and Michelle Bachelet of Chile have supported free trade and foreign investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414011428595">Tussie &amp; Heidrich, 2008</xref>). No less varied are these leaders’ bases of partisan support, orientations toward liberal democracy, and relationship with the traditional left. On the one hand, those such as Evo Morales of Bolivia and Chávez, who have been elected on the basis of personalistic, outsider appeals without the organizational backing of an established left-wing party, have tended to challenge the legitimacy of existing democratic institutions and pursue constitutional reforms enhancing executive power. Those operating on the leftist end of the leftist–populist political spectrum, on the other hand, have come to power with the backing of established leftist parties, such as the Socialist party of Chile or the Worker’s party (Partido dos Trabalhadores, PT) in Brazil, often in coalition with established centrist parties, and have worked within the existing framework of representative democracy.</p>

<p>Precisely because of these variations, some regional observers have questioned the significance of the rise of leftist–populism, seeing less a broad swing in regional political mood than a series of conjunctural and country-specific outcomes attributable to supply rather than demand-side forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414011428595">Cardoso, 2006</xref>). Cases in point include the opportunistic coalition between liberals and Sandinistas that allowed former revolutionary leader Daniel Ortega to return to power in Nicaragua and the rules of the governing Concertación coalition in Chile that led to the nomination of Bachelet. Others disaggregate the swing of the political pendulum into multiple categories: historically rooted post-Marxist institutionalized parties of the left (e.g., the Brazilian PT), left-leaning governments rooted in preexisting populist parties (e.g., Argentina’s Peronist government), populist governments based on top-down political mobilization via charismatic leadership (e.g., Chávez), and leftist governments based on new social movements (e.g., Morales in Bolivia; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414011428595">Roberts, Bethell, &amp; Mayorga, 2007</xref>). Still others reduce the variation to two distinct trends: one involving the election of moderate, democratically oriented leftists and the other radical, populist, and nationalist responses to unstable party systems and crises of governability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414011428595">Castañeda, 2006</xref>). To these <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414011428595">Schamis (2006</xref>, p. 31) adds a third category: the “petro-left” representing “an oil-funded, twenty-first century version of patrimonial domination,” whose traits are most evident in Bolivia and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Although these varied categories of leftist–populism are seen as having differing consequences for Latin American democracy, most prior research has taken a relatively synthetic approach to explaining shifts in the region’s electoral landscape. The predominant line of analysis traces the rise of the left back to exogenous shocks, particularly the debt crisis of the early 1980s and resulting pressures for the adoption of a new model of market-oriented economic development. The costs of the latter in terms of economic stagnation, inequality, poverty, unemployment, informality, and economic dislocation are widely seen as undermining political support for established political parties and democratic rule, mobilizing new social movements, and paving the way for the emergence of leftist–populist challenges to the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414011428595">Bóron, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414011428595">Kaufman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414011428595">Roberts, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414011428595">Roberts et al., 2007</xref>, pp. 10-23). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414011428595">Lynch (2007)</xref>, for example, “Neoliberalism and democracy rapidly collided and this created the conditions for the emergence of social movements and electoral alternatives that have recently transformed the region’s political map” (p. 373). Similarly taking popular dissatisfaction with two decades of neoliberal reform as her point of departure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414011428595">Arnson (2007)</xref> writes,
<disp-quote><p>The “rise of the left” would appear to owe much to core problems arising from the <italic>quality</italic> of democracy as experienced by the average citizen: the persistence of poverty and inequality; the growth of the informal sector (with the concomitant decline of labor unions); <italic>desencanto</italic> (disenchantment) with the institutions of democratic governance, especially political parties; the difficulty of establishing adequate mechanisms of participation, representation, and accountability; and dislocations related to the domestic effects and foreign policy implications of globalization. (p. 6)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The basic argument thus encompasses both demand- and supply-side components. On one hand, dissatisfaction with economic performance and “politics as usual” generates increased citizen demands for policy shifts away from neoliberalism, enhancing political opportunities for parties with strong leftist and/or anti-neoliberal credentials. On the other, the tendency of established parties of the center–left, center, and right to converge around market-oriented policies in response to external economic pressures generates major disjunctures between citizen preferences and party programs, creating openings for leftist and populist challengers, including new party entrants.</p>
<p>Although intrinsically plausible, this account has been criticized for failing to explain the notable variations in the electoral success of leftist alternatives across the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414011428595">Cleary, 2006</xref>), which do not map neatly on to variations in the level of neoliberal reform. It also runs up against evidence that that some of the key economic reforms of the past two decades, particularly trade liberalization, have been extremely popular with voters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414011428595">Baker, 2003</xref>). But perhaps most significant, the timing of the shift to leftist–populism does not fit the argument regarding neoliberal reforms, weak economic performance, economic insecurity, or fluctuations in social inequality particularly well. Compared to the “lost decade” of the 1980s, when regional GDP suffered its most serious decline since the Great Depression, or the slow and irregular economic recuperation of the 1990s, which was punctuated by the “tequila crisis” of 1994–1995 as well as the Asian–Russian financial crisis of the late 1990s, Latin America’s economy boomed in the 2000s, with the terms of trade for the region as a whole improving 23% between 2000 and 2008, when the swing to the left gathered momentum. At the same time, inflation remained comparatively limited, averaging only 6.78% between 2000 and 2008, as compared to more than 200% over the previous 9 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414011428595">Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe [CEPAL], 1997</xref>, p. 55; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414011428595">2002</xref>, p. 110; 2008, p. 157). These developments paved the way for a major reversal of the preexisting trend toward rising inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414011428595">López-Calva &amp; Lustig, 2010</xref>). Also suggestive are the differences in performance between the nine countries that elected leftist or populist presidents in the 2000–2008 period and those that did not: The terms of trade improved 35.9% in the former but declined 1.9% in the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414011428595">CEPAL, 2008</xref>, p. 165). The contrasts between these two sets of countries are less marked with respect to GDP data, but the region’s economy grew at an average rate of 3.7% between 2001 and 2008 as compared to 2.3% over the 1981–2000 period, with the growth rate for 2004–2008 equal to 5.42% (CEPAL, 2000, p. 85; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414011428595">2008</xref>, p. 157).</p>
<p>This association between externally driven economic expansion and the rise of anti–status quo political forces thus suggests an alternative explanation for the “pink tide,” namely, that economic “good times” create opportunities more favorable to statist, nationalist, and redistributive political projects and associated challenges to U.S. hegemony. On the demand side of the political equation, the underlying theoretical logic draws on partisan models of political economy that incorporate rational expectations and assume that political support for partisan contenders is shaped by the state of the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414011428595">Alesina, Roubini, &amp; Cohen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414011428595">Erikson, MacKuen, &amp; Stimson, 2000</xref>). Economic improvement raises support for more leftist political options by increasing citizen willingness to pay for more government and by creating room for optimism that outstanding social problems can be addressed by the public sector without the risk of inflation or other potentially negative economic consequences. But even more important, an expanding economy creates opportunities for political leaders to offer voters programs of poverty reduction, improved social equity, economic nationalism, and increased government spending and enhances the credibility of those commitments. The relative credibility of policy commitments, however, also varies across the political spectrum, providing political entrepreneurs with anti-neoliberal, nationalist, and/or leftist credentials a distinct advantage in good times.</p>
<p>Given Latin America’s mode of integration into global markets and the related pressures for procyclical fiscal adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414011428595">Wibbels, 2006</xref>), precisely the opposite may be expected to occur when the economy contracts: The costs of delivering statist, nationalist, and redistributive policies rise, the policy options of leaders shrink, the credibility of leftist campaign platforms declines, and citizen preferences shift in a more conservative direction. Explanations of this type have been used successfully to account for shifts in “public mood” or aggregate policy preferences measured along the liberal to conservative continuum in the United States and Western Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414011428595">Durr, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414011428595">Erikson, MacKuen, &amp; Stimson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010414011428595">Stevenson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414011428595">Stimson, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414011428595">2004</xref>), but they are even more appealing with respect to their capacity to account for electoral dynamics in settings in which governments enjoy limited capacity to respond to negative economic shocks by international borrowing, countercyclical spending, or assertions of economic independence.</p>

<title>Aggregate Trends: Leftism, Citizen Satisfaction, and Anti-U.S. Sentiments</title>
<p>As a first step toward assessing the explanations that have been offered for leftist–populist governance, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414011428595">Table 2</xref> maps out political trends between 1996, when the region was dominated by centrist and rightist governments, and 2007, when the dramatic shift in the partisan fortunes of leftist parties had become fully evident. The table draws on public opinion data on left–right sentiments collected by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414011428595">Latinobarómetro (1996–2007)</xref>, which is the only data set providing the extensive longitudinal and cross-sectional coverage necessary to address variations in opinion over time and across the region. In spite of the inconsistencies in usage across individuals and national contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414011428595">Zechmeister, 2006</xref>), it may be noted that the distinction between left and right is sufficiently meaningful in Latin America to allow the overwhelming majority of voters to identify themselves with these terms on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. In 2006, for example, the percentage of survey respondents willing to locate themselves on the left–right spectrum ranged from a high of 89.3% in Uruguay to a low of 62.2% in Honduras—figures that approximate, respectively, those for the United Kingdom and Portugal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414011428595">Mair, 2007</xref>, p. 210).</p>

<p>As suggested by the means presented at the bottom of the table, the “left turn” in Latin America does not reflect a significant shift of opinion toward the left end of the political spectrum. Rather, variation in opinion has been limited over time, with a slight shift to the right in the early 2000s followed by a drift back toward the left. As of 2007, the mean placement of Latin American citizens on the survey was 5.24, slightly to the right of center on the 11-point 0 to 10 scale and not very different from the mean of 5.37 for 1996.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414011428595">1</xref></sup> The evidence with respect to individual countries is also less than fully consistent with the argument that ideological shifts promoted the rise of leftist–populist governance. In several countries where electoral support for the left increased in the 2000s, producing either a leftist government or a narrow leftist electoral defeat, the mean citizen placement on the left–right scale was actually slightly more rightist in 2007 than in 1996. Cases in point include Bolivia, Mexico, and Brazil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414011428595">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Also interesting with respect to the argument regarding citizen disillusionment with market-oriented reform and democratic governance are the results for dissatisfaction with democracy and economic performance shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414011428595">Figure 1</xref>. Drawing on a relatively standard question asking individuals about their level of satisfaction with the way democracy is working in their country, it is difficult to discern any clear trend with respect to political satisfaction. The percentage of survey respondents expressing dissatisfaction with the state of the domestic economy has fluctuated more significantly over time but, contrary to the conventional wisdom, improved rather dramatically beginning in 2004, just as the electoral advance of leftist candidates began to gather momentum. Although 56.8% of Latin citizens rated the economic situation of their countries as “bad” or “very bad” in 1996, by 2006 this percentage had fallen to 34.7%. The initiation of this positive trend is consistent with the thesis that positive rather than negative economic evaluations contributed to electoral change in the region.</p>

<p>Analyzing the bases of electoral support for leftist–populist presidents on the basis of aggregate data underlines the importance of positive economic performance and anti-U.S. sentiments for the election of leftist political leaders. Drawing on data for the entire 1990–2007 period, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414011428595">Table 3</xref> reports logistic regression estimates for leftist–populist electoral outcomes. Given the difficulties of assessing which dimension of economic performance is most politically salient, the analysis relies on three weakly correlated measures: lagged GDP growth, lagged inflation (logged), and changes in the terms of trade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414011428595">4</xref></sup> To the extent that the public mood has shifted to the left in response to weak economic performance, as suggested by much recent literature on Latin America, the election of leftist presidents should be negatively related to the lagged rate of growth and/or change in the terms of trade but positively related to the lagged rate of inflation. Conversely, if policy mood shifts to the left as the economy improves, as suggested by the literature on the advanced industrial nations, we would expect precisely the opposite.</p>

<p>Although the coefficients for growth and inflation are statistically insignificant, the estimates presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414011428595">Table 3</xref> indicate that improvements in the terms of trade have favored leftist victories as has the rise in anti-Americanism, as captured in columns 2 and 3 on the basis of Latinobarómetro data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414011428595">5</xref></sup> Consistent with the data on the evolution of left–right sentiments over time, variations in average citizen left–right placement, which are included in the third set of estimates, provide limited additional leverage for addressing the leftist–populist advances at the aggregate level of analysis.

<p>To address arguments about the impact of negative economic performance and citizen dissatisfaction with democracy on leftist voting, the independent variables include sociotropic and egotropic economic assessments, levels of satisfaction with the way democracy is working in the respondent’s country, and abstract support for democracy, as assessed on the basis of the “Churchill question.” Also included in the analysis are two measures of ideology: one drawing on the left–right self-placement scale and the second involving a question about attitudes toward private enterprise. The latter question was posed somewhat differently in 2006 than in the prior surveys, but it still allows for some exploration of arguments linking the rise of the left with the exhaustion of enthusiasm for neoliberalism. Also included are attitudes toward the United States to tap into the role played by anti-Americanism in the upsurge of the left. Finally, the estimates include a relatively standard set of controls for education, income, age, gender, and religion. The questions and codings utilized in the analysis are as detailed in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0010414011428595">appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>Drawing on logistic regression estimation with the standard errors adjusted for clustering on country, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0010414011428595">Table 4</xref> suggests that support for leftist–populist electoral options in Latin America elections has <italic>not</italic> emerged as a consequence of dissatisfaction either with the performance of the economy or with the functioning of democracy. Instead, the results point to positive linkages between leftist voting intentions, on one hand, and evaluations of the state of the economy and satisfaction with democracy, on the other. These results are particularly strong for 2006, when the estimated probability of leftist voting increases from 20.2% to 46.6% as democratic satisfaction rises from its lowest to highest level with all other variables set at their mean. The comparable figures for sociotropic assessments are 14.8% and 60.9%. Such economic assessments are particularly significant for voters placing themselves at the center or right end of the political spectrum. Hence in 2006 the predicted probability of leftist voting by a citizen with a centrist political placement of 5 on the left–right scale increases from 16.1% to 61.4% as economic assessments rise from <italic>very bad</italic> to <italic>very good</italic> with all other variables set at their mean. Likewise, for a rightist voter placing herself or himself at 7 on the left–right scale, the probability of a left vote increases nearly fivefold from 10.4% to 49.1%. By way of comparison, the predicated probability of a left vote by voters placing themselves at the extreme left end of the political spectrum with all other variables, including sociotropic assessments, set at their mean was 60.9%. Also contrary to the conventional wisdom are the coefficients for democracy as a system of government, which uniformly suggest that leftist voters tend to be more prodemocratic than other citizens.</p>
<p>Of even greater significance are anti-U.S. sentiments, which are only weakly correlated with left–right placement. As evaluations of the United States shift from <italic>very good</italic> to <italic>very bad</italic> in the estimates for 2004 with all other independent variables set at their mean, the probabilities of a leftist–populist vote increase from 7.3% to 56.7%. Similarly, in 2005 and 2006 the probabilities of leftist voting rise, respectively, from 11.6% to 63.3% and from 9.8% to 75.1% as negative evaluations of the United States shift from low to high. Taking again a centrist voter with a left–right placement of 5 in 2006, the predicted probability of leftist voting increases more than fivefold from 13.2% to 71.3% as anti-Americanism increases from low to high. It may be noted that these results for citizen evaluations of the economy, democracy, and the United States are even stronger if all nonresponses are coded in the nonleftist category rather than as missing values.</p>
<p>Although statistically significant, neither citizen self-placements on the left–right scale nor attitudes toward private enterprise have a comparable impact on leftist voting intentions. The impact of demographic characteristics is also unexpectedly weak, suggesting that the social bases of support for the left are highly heterogeneous. In 2006, for example, the predicted probability of an individual with 1 year of education voting for the left was 28.7%, less than the rate for voters with more than 12 years of education. Despite high levels of economic inequality across the region, the effects of income conform to a similar pattern.</p>
<p>Given the differences between the 2004 and later results, to what extent did the election of leftist leaders in the mid-2000s dampen dissatisfaction with the performance of democracy and the economy in the region rather than the other way around? Limiting the analysis to countries that had <italic>not</italic> elected leftist–populist governments prior to the 2004 survey provides one clear way of addressing this question. The results remain consistent with those for 2004 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0010414011428595">Table 4</xref> in the sense that they offer no evidence that citizen dissatisfaction played a significant role in leftist voting. The coefficients for economic and democratic assessments also remain statistically insignificant. The same is true if the statistical analysis focuses on the 2002 Latinobarómetro, which includes most of the same questions as the surveys for later years. Deleting Chile and Venezuela, which had already elected presidents of the left by the time of the 2002 survey, leaves the coefficients for democratic satisfaction and sociotropic assessments statistically insignificant. Controlling for leftist incumbency in the 2005 and 2006 surveys has much the same effect, except that the coefficient for sociotropic assessments in 2006 remains positive and statistically significant. These supplementary results help to underline the weakness of explanations stressing the importance of citizen dissatisfaction to leftist voting. To the extent that the level of citizen dissatisfaction played a significant role, it tended to work against leftist–populism.</p>
<p>Within the framework of these general trends, it should be emphasized that the results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0010414011428595">Table 4</xref> mask considerable cross-national heterogeneity. In 2004 not only were leftist political options more available in some countries than others, but the bases for leftist voting varied across cases, with ideological self-placement of major importance in countries such as Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Venezuela but completely insignificant in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. Likewise, the importance of anti-U.S. sentiments varies significantly across cases. In the 2006 survey, for example, such sentiments played no role in leftist vote choice in Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru but weighed heavily in Bolivia, Colombia, Nicaragua, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The impact of evaluations of the performance of democracy and the economy on leftist–populist voting also varied across cases.</p>
<p>To probe these issues of variation in leftist support more fully, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0010414011428595">Table 5</xref> draws on the 2006 Latinobarómetro survey to examine support for leftist–populist governments on the basis of data on presidential approval. The estimates indicate that in all six nations in which the left had gained control of the presidency by the time of the 2006 survey, citizen support for leftist–populist governments was consistently positively, rather than negatively, related to sociotropic assessments of the economy and satisfaction with the functioning of democracy. The impact of left–right placements is also relatively consistent, except in the case of Argentina, where rightist sentiments bolstered approval of the Kirchner government.</p>

<p>At the same time, considerable intercountry variance in the bases of leftist support is again evident, reinforcing the arguments of Cardoso and others who have insisted on the heterogeneity of the contemporary Latin American left. Support for democracy as a system of government, for example, was important in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, but not in the three other countries. Likewise, the impact of anti-U.S. sentiments varied widely, achieving significance in Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay, and Venezuela but not in Argentina or Brazil. Again individual demographic variables are less important, although support for leftist–populist presidents is significantly associated with lower levels of education in three of the six countries. As indicated by the pseudo-<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, the overall fit of the model also varies widely across the cases. Yet distinct patterns for regimes representing differing ends of the democratic–leftist to nationalist–populist spectrum do not emerge from the analysis. Anti-U.S. sentiments were important to leftist support both in the highly nationalist–populist cases of Bolivia and Venezuela as well as in countries ruled by an established democratic left. Moreover, the findings with respect to assessments of democracy and the state of the economy are consistent across all cases.</p>
<p>Pooling the individual-level data on presidential approval for countries with leftist–populist incumbents in 2006 and treating country as a fixed effect yield relatively consistent results with respect to the impact of sociotropic evaluations, democratic satisfaction, left–right placement, support for democracy, anti-U.S. sentiments, and education. In the pooled model, however, egotropic assessments are also positive and statistically significant, whereas age and attitudes toward private enterprise are negative. Similar findings emerge from pooled logistic regression with standard errors clustered by country, except that age is not statistically significant. The results for presidential approval in the nations with leftist–populist governments in 2004 and 2005 are also relatively consistent with those in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0010414011428595">Table 5</xref>, except that sociotropic economic assessments and democratic satisfaction have an even more positive impact on support for leftist–populist presidents.</p>
<p>These findings conform more broadly to the results for presidential approval across the region. In general, the more positive sociotropic assessments and expressions of democratic satisfaction, the higher the probability of incumbent support. Hence, just as approval of leftist leaders like Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Lula da Silva of Brazil, and Tabaré Vásquez of Uruguay is associated with positive sociotropic assessments and democratic satisfaction, the same is true of rightist presidents, such as Alvaro Uribe of Colombia, Vicente Fox of Mexico, and Antonio Saca of El Salvador. The key difference is that approval of the latter increased significantly with rightist ideological self-placements and pro-U.S. sentiments rather than the reverse. At the same time, however, it should be emphasized that the preceding findings take us beyond the established linkage between positive economic assessments and incumbent support. In Latin America, approval of leftist governments is linked with favorable evaluations of the economic and democratic performance, and, consistent with rational expectations models, such evaluations have also helped to define the direction of voting.</p>

<sec id="section4-0010414011428595">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Since the turn of the millennium, the contours of electoral competition in Latin America have changed dramatically, establishing the basis for the emergence of leftist–populist governments in the majority of countries in the region. The meltdown of traditional parties, rise of new leftist–populist electoral challengers, and growth in support for established leftist parties have all played a role in this process. The resulting pattern of political change has led to the emergence of major new challenges to the socioeconomic status quo as well as U.S. leadership in the region.</p>
<p>Neither micro-level accounts of political party system formation emphasizing the relative stability of individual-level political attachments nor macro-level perspectives highlighting the self-reinforcing partisan advantages generated by political institutions begin to address this far-reaching pattern of electoral change. In contrast to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) experience, the politics of the Latin American region have been characterized by relatively fluid partisan attachments and unstable electoral institutions, creating an environment highly conducive to party system disequilibrium. The central puzzle, however, is not why party system change might occur in such a relatively permissive environment but rather why recent electoral shifts have redounded so heavily to the advantage of leftist–populist leaders.</p>
<p>Four central conclusions about Latin America’s shift to the left emerge from the proceeding empirical analysis. First, the success of leftist–populist leaders at the polls reflects not a particularly marked nor a consistent shift in the self-placement of Latin American citizens along the left–right ideological spectrum. Over the past decade public opinion first shifted slightly to the right and then back to the left, leveling off in 2007 slightly to the right of center at approximately the same point as in 1996.</p>
<p>Second, contrary to arguments linking the rise of leftist governance with citizen negativity regarding economic or democratic performance, the level of dissatisfaction with the performance of democracy has been consistently high since 1996 but did not increase in the past decade. Economic assessments have also tended to be negative, but they improved dramatically in the early 2000s, just as the upsurge in leftist–populist government began. The analysis of data on the election of leftist–populist presidents at the aggregate level further suggests that positive economic performance played a role in boosting support for leftist options in the region. The greater the improvement in the terms of trade, the greater the likelihood of a leftist electoral victory. Similarly, at the individual level of analysis approval of leftist presidents is positively related to sociotropic economic assessments and satisfaction with the functioning of democracy. The available evidence regarding leftist–populist voting intentions points in a similar direction.</p>
<p>The third major conclusion relates to the importance of anti-Americanism, which has risen dramatically in the region since the early 2000s and fueled leftist voting. At the national level, the higher the mean anti-U.S. orientation, the higher the probability of a leftist electoral outcome. Similarly, at the individual level of analysis, the more negative the assessment of the United States, the higher the probability of leftist voting and approval of leftist government. Anti-U.S. sentiments trump education, religion, income assessments, and even left–right ideological placement as a determinant of leftist–populist voting.</p>
<p>Fourth, within the framework of these regional patterns, country-specific factors are of major significance in explaining the rise of support for leftist–populist leaders. Ideological orientation, for example, plays a much more reliable role in explaining leftist voting intentions in countries such as Chile, Uruguay, Nicaragua, and El Salvador than in Argentina. Likewise, the probability of leftist–populist voting increased significantly with anti-U.S. sentiments in countries such as Uruguay and Venezuela, but not in others, such as Chile, underlining the heterogeneity of the bases of support for left-leaning presidents across different national contexts.</p>
<p>For future research, the major implication of these findings relates to the potential relevance of the literature on “national mood” for understanding volatile electoral markets. Although most of this literature has been geared toward the study of long-term electoral trends in advanced industrial nations, its applicability to countries susceptible to international economic shocks and associated constraints on policy choice is arguably far greater. The swings of the economy in Latin America have historically been far more dramatic than in the OECD nations and the parameters of freedom for smoothing those swings via countercyclical policies more narrowly delimited. In this context, the perceived feasibility of programs of poverty alleviation, socioeconomic redistribution, or state expansion is therefore likely to vary with the state of the economy, altering the political preferences of domestic actors and the relative credibility of partisan offerings. With the economy expanding in response to buoyant export markets and capital inflows, the opportunities for politicians to pursue leftist–populist policies mount along with the attractiveness of such policies to the electorate. Under expansionary economic conditions, anti–status quo political parties may thus come to enjoy advantages over their competitors. The political fortunes of leftist–populists vis-à-vis status quo politicians are likely to be reversed as internationally defined economic conditions become less permissive. Economic pressures for fiscal contraction increase, the credibility of leftist–populist rhetoric declines, and citizen preferences start shifting in favor of more feasible conservative policy alternatives.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the electoral volatility of Latin America relative to the United States or Western Europe might be seen less as a reflection of the fickle or manipulable nature of Latin American voters than of the relative vulnerability of the region’s economies to international economic fluctuations and related pressures for procyclical policy adaptation. To the extent that voters respond rationally to these pressures, parties may be expected to face problems in developing a loyal and self-perpetuating base of supporters. Wide fluctuations in partisan support, in turn, create incentives for institutional change, reinforcing the tendency toward electoral volatility. Under these conditions, the standard expectation should be less one of party system “freezing” than of regular change and adaptation to economic shifts shaped by exogenous forces.</p>
<p>The second major implication of the preceding analysis for future research concerns the direct impact of international factors on partisan alignments. Although the roots of party system change are conventionally traced back to the sociology of domestic electoral markets, both the aggregate- and individual-level evidence analyzed in this study point to the importance of the rise of anti-Americanism in the early 2000s. Economic conditions helped fuel this dynamic: Clearly, the more robust the external economy, the greater the room for rhetoric and policies challenging U.S. hegemony. But even after controlling for variations in economic performance or assessments of the state of the economy, the evidence at both the aggregate and individual levels of analysis indicates that anti-Americanism played a major role in boosting support for leftist–populist political options. The challenge for future research is to find ways of moving beyond the confines of domestic political space to incorporate the international dimension more effectively into the study of electoral change and continuity.</p>

<p>It may also be noted that the results reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011428595">Table 1</xref> do not include the Dominican Republic, which was not added to the Latinobarómetro survey until 2002.</p>

<p>These patterns are not an artifact of the limitations of the Latinobarómetro data. Although in recent years the survey has utilized modified national probability samples, prior to 2000 the data were representative of less than 50% of the population in 4 of the 17 countries in which the survey was conducted and 50% to 75% in several others. Deleting all of these countries from the calculus of the regional trend, however, produces virtually no change in the means reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011428595">Table 1</xref>. Again, the continent was slightly more rightist in 2001–2003 than in other years and only modestly more leftist in 1997 than in 1996, with the means, respectively, equal to 5.35 and 5.22. The trends reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011428595">Table 1</xref> are also consistent with the more limited data reported for the AmericasBarometer survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414011428595">Seligson, 2007</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0010414011428595">
<label>3.</label>
<p>To allow for coverage of the pre-2000 period, anti-U.S. sentiments have been calculated on the basis of the percentage of citizens reporting a bad or very bad assessment of the United States on the Latinobarómetro survey.</p>

<p>The data on growth and inflation were drawn from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414011428595">World Bank (2008)</xref>, supplemented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010414011428595">International Monetary Fund (2007)</xref> data, and the terms of trade data are from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414011428595">Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414011428595">2008</xref>).</p>

<p>It may be noted that for the purposes of this analysis, mean left–right placements for 1999 have been interpolated on the basis of the 1998 and 2000 Latinobarómetro surveys.</p>

<p>The exceptions are Chile, where the Latinobarómetro survey was representative of only 70% of the population until 2006, and Paraguay, where the coverage of the survey was expanded from 46% to 100% in 2005.</p>

<p>The author also gratefully acknowledges the assistance of Jose Z. Garcia with respect to codings for El Salvador. These and other codings are available on request. It may be noted that for the 2005 survey the party choices of 124 Bolivian respondents cannot be identified from the Latinobarómetro codebook and have been treated as missing values. Analyzing the data for 2005 without Bolivia, however, produces results that are fully consistent with those in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414011428595">Table 3</xref>.</p>
