<p>According to Archibald (Foreword), <italic>Discourse, Identities and Roles in Specialized Communication</italic> is the sequel to a book on ideology and specialized communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445611432756">2007</xref>) edited by Garzone and Sarangi, and devotes itself to communication in professional and academic settings. The preliminary part of the book comprises a Foreword and an introductory chapter; the main part bifurcates into nine chapters on professional and seven on academic settings.</p>
<p>In the Foreword, Archibald highlights the main themes of the book: exploring the relationship between self-identity and the social world, the relationship between discourse and language use, and how English as a lingua franca shapes individual and collective identities in local and global contexts. Garzone fleshes these out in the introductory chapter by picking out the main arguments of each article.</p>
<p>The first section opens with Sarangi’s chapter which examines role and role performance in hospital settings, and offers an interactional perspective on doctor–patient relationships. Archibald deals with the differences in the discourse patterns between male and female language in judicial decision and legal texts, and how these differences impact on translated texts.</p>
<p>Cucchi anchors her discussion of vague expressions in cross-cultural interaction to uncertainty avoidance theoretic poles. Drawing data from speeches of English and Italian speakers on European Union parliamentary issues, she observes that vague expressions are more frequent in the English than Italian corpus. Spinzi and Terminiello, within the tradition of multimodality, address, with reference to public warnings, how social identities are constructed and managed in English and Italian cultures.</p>
<p>Allori, applying aspects of corpus linguistics to ‘a specialised corpus of sports-related International Awards from the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) of 400,000 words’ and ‘the British National Corpus of general English’ (p. 143), establishes the point that ‘conceptual content is a powerful identity trait of genre’ (p. 155). In another sports-based chapter, Fazio and Menghini contend that professional identity traits are available within the lexical configuration of texts, and that common elements exist across the sports-related arbitration discourse community in terms of jargon and knowledge base beyond national and linguistic limits.</p>
<p>Mottura examines civil servants ‘as an example of emerging professional identity’ (p. 191). She notices an interconnection between the way the civil servant’s professional identity is characterized and the way their discourse community is consolidated. Garzone et al. investigate the interaction between pilots and air traffic controllers. To characterize the linguistic and pragmatic elements deployed in the communication between these groups, they draw on concepts from implicature, conversation analysis, indexicality and semiotics. They conclude the chapter by recommending cooperation between technical organization and pragmalinguistic elements in aviation discourse. In the last chapter in the first section, Bromwich attends to how physically challenged persons construct and reconstruct their identities.</p>
<p>In the first chapter in the section on academic settings, Flottum, studying English, French and Norwegian research articles, addresses identity marking in three disciplines: economics, linguistics and medicine. She centrally submits that discipline plays a more prominent role than language in identity work in academic discourse. Giannoni examines the distribution and lexical resources of the evaluative metaphors used by leading researchers in four unrelated academic disciplines. He concludes that ‘metaphoric lexis contains important cues as to the axiology that underlies academic discourse’ (p. 296).</p>
<p>Sala, focusing on the impact of forensic language on the discourse by legal practitioners in academic journal articles, concludes that forensic discourse influences the academic writing of both legal practitioners and courtroom experts in training. Belotti investigates the manifestations of identity in research articles written in English by Italian economics scholars. He observes that the writers construct identity by employing evaluative expressions, face threats, abbreviations and Latin phrases. Maci, analysing the argumentative strategies found in the discussion section of research articles written in English by native speakers and Italian non-native speakers of English, submits that Italian non-native speakers use fewer hedges and connectives than English native speakers in formulating their discourse, and prefer the use of hedges and modality in indicating possible implications.</p>
<p>D’Angelo examines ‘the different writing strategies of men and women [and] the academic context in which women write and publish their work’ (p. 366). She concludes that gender partly influences women’s writing style, and that gender takes no place in distinguishing the expert from the novice writer. In the final chapter, Walsh, dealing with identity construction in lectures, suggests the possibility of interpreting lecturers’ interactional-mode behaviours as contributory to the more successful learning achieved by the student audience.</p>
<p>Overall, the book presents original, well researched and empirical articles to the reader. Structurally, all the chapters follow a single, internally modifiable, format which offers the reader a pleasant reading experience. After some background has been provided to a study, research needs are stated, clear objectives are provided, methodological statements are made, analyses are presented and conclusions, in which findings are summarized, are provided. Generally, tables are used to good effect.</p>
<p>The editors could, however, have attended to minor language and typographical issues such as inappropriate graphological case (p. 155), omission of commas on several pages, preposition omission (p. 71), clause omission (p. 359) and a few discourse and grammatical infelicities including some instances of problematic anaphoric usage (e.g. p. 26). Spinzi and Terminiello’s chapter may benefit from a revision of their presentation of ‘face’ and ‘politeness’, which seems to see the concepts as separate, though related entities, contrary to evidence in the literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445611432756">Brown and Levinson, 1987</xref>). The conclusion of Mottura’s chapter needs to be structurally aligned with other chapters. Finally, several works cited in the chapters could not be found in the references (for example, Goffman, 1981, Hofstede, 1991 and Levinson, 1988).</p>
<p><italic>Discourse, Identities and Roles in Specialized Communication</italic> takes a deep and impressive look at identity construction, reconstruction and interpretation in professional and academic discourses. Its scholastic dragnet scopes over not only specialized communication, as its title suggests, but also all areas of applied linguistics and sociologically grounded terrains of language studies. Scholars from these disciplines are, therefore, invited to utilize the rich findings in the book and participate in the engaging debates that have emerged from them.</p>
