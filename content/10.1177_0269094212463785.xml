<abstract>
<p>Policy changes by the UK Government in the 1990s led to the setting up of a large number of technology incubators specializing in biotechnology. A feature of these biotechnology incubators is that they were not confined to established life science intensive regions like the South East and East Anglia (Sainsbury, 1999), but spread across the UK. This study presents an in-depth case study of one of these biotechnology incubators. It provides insights into the contribution of incubators to the development of the biotechnology sector in the regions outside the ‘golden triangle’ (Mueller et al., 2012; Mullins, 2005) of Cambridge-London-Oxford. It identifies service-based business models as an attractive entry-mode for start-up firms in these regions and shows services to be the main contributor to job creation. The study contributes to closing some of the gaps in research into the relationship between technology incubation and economic development. In particular it identifies local factors conditioning the performance of local economies, business models, and incubation, particularly in the context of policies designed to promote the growth of technology-based start-up and spin-off companies as avenues for economic development and transformation.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094212463785" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although the UK played a leading role in the scientific discoveries that created the biotechnology sector in the late 20th century (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094212463785">Table 1</xref>), the US led the commercialization of this technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094212463785">Cooke, 2001</xref>). Despite this, the UK holds second place behind the US with the largest biotechnology sector in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094212463785">Rosiello and Parris, 2009</xref>). The 1990s saw significant growth of the UK’s biotechnology sector, with the number of specialist biotechnology companies doubling to more than 250 firms employing some 12,000 between 1994 and 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094212463785">DTI, 1999</xref>: 13).

<p>This growth reflected policy changes introduced following two White Papers <italic>Realising Our Potential</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094212463785">Cabinet Office, 1993</xref>) and <italic>Competitiveness: Forging Ahead</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212463785">DTI, 1995</xref>). These policy changes aimed to harness the potential of the science base in the UK and promote technology transfer through improved academic/industry links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094212463785">Lawton Smith and Bagchi-Sen, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>More significant changes came in 1997, reflecting a new political agenda that aimed to revive the country’s flagging science base and placed much greater emphasis on the regions. The first Comprehensive Spending Review projected a doubling of the Government’s science budget over the next 10 years. Meanwhile the 1998 White Paper <italic>Our Competitive Future</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212463785">DTI, 1998</xref>) highlighted biotechnology as part of the knowledge economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094212463785">Lawton Smith, 2003</xref>) and ushered in the new regional development agencies (RDAs) to stimulate technology transfer on a regional basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094212463785">Lawton Smith and Bagchi-Sen, 2006</xref>). This was accompanied by a range of financial incentives and tax breaks for biotechnology start-up companies. Examples included the Biotechnology Exploitation Platform Challenge and the Biotechnology Mentoring and the Incubator Challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094212463785">Leibovitz, 2004</xref>: 1134) which aimed to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from universities to the commercial world.</p>
<p>This led to the creation of a series of biotechnology incubators, designed to nurture and support embryonic start-up and spin-off biotechnology firms specializing in biotechnology applications. These covered the main categories of biotechnology activity, namely medical and pharmaceutical, agro-food and environmental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094212463785">Cooke, 2002</xref>) applications. The boom in new biotechnology incubators in the decade of the 2000s (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269094212463785">Table 2</xref>) was reminiscent of the growth of science parks in the 1980s. What is also evident from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269094212463785">Table 2</xref> is that a significant proportion of the biotechnology incubators were located not in the ‘golden triangle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094212463785">Lipsett, 2004</xref>) of Cambridge-London-Oxford, home to the strongest part of the UK’s science base for life sciences, but across the country including ones in the less favoured regions. Indeed of the 20 biotechnology incubators listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269094212463785">Table 2</xref>, eight are located in the North of England.

<p>The biotechnology incubators created at this time were of three main types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094212463785">Crocker, 2010</xref>): those operated by university teams as an integral part of the university, such as the Sheffield Bioincubator; those, like Manchester, Imperial, London and Queen Mary, operated by independent university or research centre subsidiaries; and finally those, such as BioCity in Nottingham and BioPark Herts, operated entirely as independent entities but in which one or more universities has a stake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094212463785">Crocker, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Public funding aided the setting up of these incubators. It included funds provided by the regional development agencies, many of whom in their development plans prioritized biotechnology and health sciences as a growth sector. Among specific initiatives used were the £75 m Incubator Fund made available through the Small Business Service, the £50 m Regional Innovation Fund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094212463785">Wynarczk and Raine, 2005</xref>: 208) and the Harnessing Genomics Fund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094212463785">Lipsett, 2004</xref>). Another important source of public funding was the European Union in the form of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Structural Fund (ESF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094212463785">Wynarczk and Raine, 2005</xref>: 208).</p>
<p>This article aims to provide an initial evaluation of the impact of this new generation of specialist biotechnology incubators with a focus on the less well-developed regions outside the golden triangle of Cambridge-London-Oxford. It seeks to do this through an in-depth case study of an incubator, BioCity Nottingham, located not within the UK’s golden triangle for biotechnology but in the East Midlands region. It traces the background to the incubator, and examines its performance, both in quantitative terms such as the number of new start-up companies it has attracted and their business performance, and in qualitative terms focusing on the nature of the biotechnology start-up firms, the activities they engage in, and their relationship with the local economy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094212463785"><title>Biotechnology incubators: A brief review of the literature</title>
<p>The term ‘incubator’ serves as a metaphor for the provision of a protective environment in which newly created ventures can be nurtured and supported. A number of studies formally define the incubator concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094212463785">Aernoudt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094212463785">European Commission, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094212463785">NESTA, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094212463785">OECD, 1999</xref>). The study by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094212463785">European Commission (2002)</xref> identifies two key features of incubation: the level of support provided and the degree of technology focus. Support implies the extent of the services provided, ranging from property management to administrative support and advice and guidance. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094212463785">NESTA (2008)</xref> science parks typically provide a limited range of support services, but show an enhanced technology focus. In contrast, biotechnology incubators provide extensive support services, within a narrowly defined technology sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212463785">Aerts et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212463785">Aerts et al. (2007)</xref> note that the initial focus of job creation and real estate appreciation was extended to support services in the 1990s, with a shift towards a focus on specific technology sectors such as ICT and biotechnology in the 2000s. Thus the modern biotechnology incubator represents a specialized form of incubation facility that concentrates on nurturing and developing new ventures in a single technological field, biotechnology.</p>
<p>Research into incubators has tended to look at incubators in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094212463785">Albert and Gaynor, 2001</xref>). Thus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094212463785">Wynarczk and Raine (2005)</xref> found that incubators played a significant role in nurturing businesses with growth potential, helping to overcome entrepreneurs’ lack of business skills. They noted that this in turn helps local economic development, although they highlighted the problem of providing space for growing businesses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094212463785">McAdam and McAdam (2008)</xref> undertook a more focused study looking at incubators linked to universities and their role in nurturing high tech start-up companies, focusing particularly on their lifecycle. They found that the propensity of such firms to use incubator facilities, instead of lessening as they grew, actually increased. Both these studies focused on technology incubators. While biotechnology clusters have been extensively researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094212463785">Shohet, 1998</xref>) there has been much less research into biotechnology incubators.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094212463785">Cooke et al. (2006)</xref> studied biotechnology incubators in the US, Israel and Europe. They found the regional context was crucial and significantly more important than governance-related issues, in terms of an incubator’s ability to nurture start-up firms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094212463785">Feldman and Francis (2003)</xref> studied the development of the biotechnology sector in Maryland in the US and they found that biotechnology incubators played an important role in developing an embryonic cluster. They estimated that the State’s 11 biotechnology incubators generated an estimated 2200 jobs between them, thus making a significant contribution to the development of the biotechnology sector within the State. Similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094212463785">Burton and Hicks (2006)</xref> identify a strong positive correlation between regional commercial biotechnology employment and the presence of university-based biotechnology incubators in their study of the eastern USA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094212463785">Leibovitz (2004)</xref> in contrast looked at the development of the biotechnology sector in Scotland, noting how biotechnology incubators have been a key policy instrument in supporting biotechnology there.</p>
<p>Studies focusing specifically on biotechnology incubators in the UK are rare, mostly taking the form of descriptive accounts in practitioner journals. For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094212463785">Wanklin (2002)</xref> reviews the function of biotechnology incubators and presents a short case study of Manchester’s incubator, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094212463785">Smaglik (2003)</xref> focuses on the growth of biotechnology incubators outside the golden triangle of Cambridge-London-Oxford and provides details of recently established incubators such as those in Liverpool and Manchester, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094212463785">Russo (2006)</xref> gives an overview of the growth of biotechnology incubators in the UK.</p>
<p>Hence we are able to identify two major gaps in current research. First, published studies reflect the local dimension of the emergence of the biotechnology industry mainly from the perspective of the regions blessed with a world-class research infrastructure and easy access to capital. Second, to date we have limited knowledge about the local context of biotechnology incubators and the implications in terms of the types of firms and their performance. It is against this background that the present study seeks to provide an in-depth study of a biotechnology incubator located in a less well-endowed region, so as to provide an insight into the nature and performance of biotechnology incubators and their relationship with the local economy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0269094212463785" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>The focus of the research is an in-depth study of a single biotechnology incubator, over a six-year period. The incubator is one of the new wave of incubators established in the 2000s, but is located outside the main centre of biotechnology activity in the UK. Using a single incubator means it is possible to study firms which share a common context, in this instance a common regional context, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094212463785">Yin (2009)</xref> notes is one of the benefits of using case studies as a research design.</p>
<p>We excluded 11 non-biotechnology as well as non-active firms from the total population of 50 tenant companies in the incubator, rendering a data set of 39 biotechnology start-ups. We complemented quantitative data about the tenant companies with interviews with ‘key informants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212463785">John and Reve, 1982</xref>), principally incubator staff, in order to ensure consistency of the data and gain an enhanced understanding of the context. It was also extremely helpful in understanding and making sense of some of technical aspects surrounding the activities undertaken by the tenant companies.</p>
<p>Extensive use was made of documentary and archival materials. The documentary materials included a variety of items from the specialist biotechnology literature including weekly and monthly trade magazines and periodicals, as well as the local and financial press. A database of tenant companies describing their main characteristics and performance data, like net asset or employment creation, was built up from reports, tabulations and databases prepared at various times by incubator staff, consultants and other agencies. We also used a number of business histories, industry studies and even biographies and autobiographies to provide background data on the local economy and the development of the pharmaceutical industry in the region. Overall these sources provided a wealth of valuable background and technical information in relation to the incubator and the biotechnology sector.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0269094212463785"><title>Case study: BioCity Nottingham</title>
<sec id="sec5-0269094212463785"><title>Origins</title>
<p>Launched in 2003, as a joint venture between Nottingham Trent and Nottingham universities and the East Midlands Development Agency (EMDA), BioCity Nottingham is housed in the former research laboratories of Boots pharmaceutical division. It was here in the 1960s that the well-known painkiller Ibuprofen was discovered. Today the incubator provides laboratory and office facilities for bioscience, pharmaceutical, medical technology and healthcare companies. A feature of the accommodation is the ability to respond to a company’s changing requirements by offering both small highly flexible laboratory units and grow-on space. However, as a biotechnology incubator, BioCity aims to provide more than property management. It provides a number of support services including business support, advice and guidance on new venture creation and development, training courses for would be bio-entrepreneurs and networking events. In addition, to help very small start-ups it rents out equipment and specialist facilities, thereby easing access to capital items and reducing the need for upfront investment. It even invests directly in the early stage development of biotechnology companies through its Mobius Life Sciences Fund.</p>
<p>The East Midlands region was not one of the 10 locations identified as the site of an established cluster in Lord Sainsbury’s survey of UK biotechnology clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094212463785">Sainsbury, 1999</xref>). Similarly the region is not one of the better known centres of the pharmaceutical industry, like Hertfordshire, Surrey or Cheshire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094212463785">Shohet, 1998</xref>). However, there is a significant presence of pharmaceutical companies within the region in the form of Boots, Astra-Zeneca and Riker Labs and there are also two major life science universities, Nottingham and Leicester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094212463785">DTI,1999</xref>), the latter with the UK’s only 5* genetics department (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094212463785">Asthana et al., 2009</xref>). It was these factors that led the local regional development agency to identify healthcare as a priority sector.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0269094212463785"><title>Development of the incubator</title>
<p>With financial support from EMDA and Nottingham Trent and Nottingham Universities, BioCity has been able to build on the local economy’s strength in pharmaceutical manufacturing and its science base. The first phase of the BioCity development opened in 2003 in a re-furbished five-storey block, formerly home to Boots research laboratories. This facility provides generic laboratory space for small biotechnology start-ups together with an administrative hub comprising, office space, meeting rooms, café and a conference room.</p>
<p>Phase two of the incubator was launched in July 2006 with the opening of the adjacent Stewart Adams building, named after the Boots scientist who led the team that discovered Ibuprofen. The development was part funded by the regional development agency, EMDA. This additional facility provided a particular focus on medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical applications, with larger laboratories.</p>
<p>The third phase saw the opening of the adjacent Laurus Building. This provided an additional 48,000 square feet of space bringing the total size of the incubator to some 129,000 square feet. This part of the incubator provides grow-on laboratory facilities and early tenants included Sygnature Chemicals which had grown from three employees to 26.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0269094212463785"><title>Occupancy</title>
<p>The overall trend in terms of the occupation of the incubator has followed the development phases. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094212463785">Figure 1</xref> shows there was a rapid increase in the floor area occupied over the first couple of years, from under 10,000 square feet to 35,000square feet. At this point it reached a plateau where it remained for about a year. Two years had brought growth to the point where the incubator was fully occupied.
<fig id="fig1-0269094212463785" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Growth of occupancy at BioCity incubator 2003–2009.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212463785-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>There was then a step change in occupancy at the end of 2006 as phase two of the incubator, the Stewart Adams building came on stream. Within a few months the floor area occupied almost doubled to 60,000 square feet, to be followed by modest growth for the next couple of years. At the start of 2009 phase three of the incubator, the Laurus building, was opened and occupancy then rapidly climbed again from about 70,000 to 90,000 square feet.</p>
<p>Thus by 2009 the incubator had been in operation for six years and had grown significantly in terms of occupied space, making it one of the largest biotech incubators in the UK. A clear pattern had emerged in which as additional space became available, so it was rapidly taken up by tenants, both new start-ups and existing tenants seeking to expand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0269094212463785"><title>New start-up activity</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094212463785">Figure 2</xref> shows there has been significant new start-up activity within the incubator every year between 2003 and 2009, although the rate of new start-ups has varied. There was significantly more new start-up activity in the early years with 16 new start biotech companies locating within the incubator in the first two years.
<fig id="fig2-0269094212463785" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>New start-up companies at BioCity incubator (per year).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212463785-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The overall pattern of new start-up activity is one in which each new phase of the incubator’s development was accompanied by a brief peak of new firm formations. After peaking in 2004, a year in which there were 11 new start-up companies entering the incubator, new starts dipped markedly the following year. As phase two of the incubator’s facilities came on stream in 2006 there was a resurgence of new start-up activity. New start-ups then dipped again in 2007 and 2008, possibly reflecting the worsening financial climate, before rising with the opening of phase three of the incubator in September 2008.</p>
<p>One surprising feature is that while the space occupied has steadily increased, the rate of new start-up companies coming into the incubator has not matched it, with the overall trend being downward. As the next section indicates this would appear to be mainly a function of the growth and rapid expansion of some existing tenants within the incubator.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0269094212463785"><title>Employment creation</title>
<p>One of the main functions of any incubator is to create employment. In the case of BioCity data on employment was collected for a six-year period between 2003 and 2008 for 39 tenant companies. During this six-year period employment within the facility increased from zero at the start to 396 by 2008, an impressive rate of growth in employment. However, these were not all new jobs. A number of tenant companies were already employing staff at the time they moved into the incubator. This was particularly the case with the university spin-off companies, several of which were the incubator’s first tenants. Among these early arrivals were RegenTec Ltd which employed five from the start and Critical Pharmaceuticals Ltd which employed six. The arrival of tenants who were already employing staff meant that jobs were effectively being displaced from elsewhere, in the case of most of the spin-offs this typically meant universities. In all 118 jobs were displaced in this way. As a result, over the period in question actual job creation resulting from the incubation process amounted to 396 less 118, making 278 jobs created in total, an average of 46.3 per year.</p>
<p>These figures mask a number of features of employment creation. Although the average rate of job creation was nearly 50 per year, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269094212463785">Figure 3</xref> shows that these new jobs were not evenly distributed over time. Net job creation (i.e. new jobs) in the first three years was relatively low averaging 11 per year although the trajectory was upwards. It was only in the fourth and fifth years that the number of new jobs really took off, 2007 being the best year with more than 150 new jobs created. This dipped sharply in the following year, with the onset of the financial crisis and recession. What is apparent from these figures is that job creation took time to get going. There was a distinct lag between firms setting up in the incubator and new jobs being created in anything like significant numbers. This lag would appear to be a function of the new venture creation process with a ‘settling in’ period following formation or transfer to the incubator, during which firms organize and establish their activities.
<fig id="fig3-0269094212463785" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Annual employment growth at BioCity incubator 2003–2008.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212463785-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269094212463785">Figure 3</xref> shows that the limited growth in jobs that did occur in the first three years was almost entirely the result of new tenants with an existing albeit small workforce moving into the incubator. This was employment growth through job displacement. As noted earlier most of the jobs appear to have been displaced from universities given that many of these firms were university spin-offs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269094212463785">Figure 3</xref> shows that significantly during this early period employment growth through displacement greatly outweighed growth through new job creation. The gap then narrowed sharply in the fourth year and then all but disappeared in the fifth. This indicates that initially the incubator effectively imported jobs, but over time job creation through incubation gradually built up and the number of imported or displaced jobs declined.</p>
<p>Another feature of the employment created by the incubator is the balance between jobs created in product companies (i.e. those using a product business model) and those in service companies. Overall 190 of the new jobs created were in service companies with 88 in product companies, giving proportions of 68.4% and 31.6% respectively. Since service companies made up 61.5% of the companies, this means that they created a disproportionate number of jobs, though not by a large amount.</p>
<p>The fourth feature is that the total of 278 jobs created masks considerable variation between individual tenant firms. Most of the tenant firms made a modest contribution to employment creation, with only 12 firms, representing less than one-third of the total, creating 10 or more jobs over the period. However, of these firms four could be categorized as high growth firms because they grew rapidly creating 20 or more jobs. Indeed between them these four firms created 120 jobs or nearly half of all the jobs created within the incubator by the 39 firms surveyed. Thus the incubator’s success in employment creation was heavily dependent on a small number of rapidly growing firms. They created a disproportionate share of employment. Interestingly in every one of the four firms concerned, the bulk of the jobs were created in the last two years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0269094212463785"><title>Incubator tenants: Business models</title>
<p>The characteristics of the tenant companies in BioCity, especially the nature of the work they do, can tell us much about the role of the incubator and its relationship with the local economy. Consequently a key feature of the survey was the analysis of tenant companies and their activities in order to ascertain the business models employed. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094212463785">Feldman and Francis (2003)</xref> these were classified as either product or service business models. Companies using the product business model were those using what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094212463785">Pisano (2006: 7)</xref> describes as a ‘monetization of intellectual property’ or drug discovery model. These were typically companies involved in the early phases of new product development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094212463785">Kasabov and Delbridge, 2008</xref>) aiming to capitalize on a scientific breakthrough by licensing it, or selling it to a third party with the resources to fund the commercialization stages of the development of a new therapeutic product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212463785">Casper and Kettler, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A key characteristic of this model is upfront investment in research in the hope of breakthroughs that can eventually be monetized – typically in the form of licensing deals with major pharmaceutical companies. This entails the ability to bear significant risks, as costs are certain now, but revenues may not materialize in the future and their size cannot be predicted. With this model the risks are high because of the possibility of problems in development. It is also expensive because big investments in research and development (R&amp;D) are required. However the potential rewards are high too. An example of a BioCity tenant company utilizing the product business model is Regentec Ltd. Based at the BioCity incubator since 2003, Regentec is a spin-out company from the School of Pharmacy at the University of Nottingham working in the field of regenerative medicine. It has developed intellectual property and expertise in tissue regeneration technologies, specifically degradable ‘scaffold’ designs and fabrication methods. These are used within the human body to support tissue growth and deliver cells or protein therapies. They enable tissue regeneration to occur in clinical situations in which the body’s natural repair processes have failed. Regentec specializes in orthopaedic applications and has grown steadily to the point where it now has 15 employees. To date Regentec has filed four patents.</p>
<p>Companies using the service business model do not aim for scientific breakthroughs and the associated intellectual property rights; instead they typically focus on the provision of a narrow and highly specialized range of research services that facilitate the new product development process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094212463785">Kasabov and Delbridge, 2008</xref>) of third parties. Examples might include: outsourced R&amp;D services, quality management and testing, data handling and storage. The service business model offers a very different risk reward profile. It can be very profitable, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094212463785">Pisano (2006</xref>: 169) notes, ‘it is unlikely to earn the enormous returns of a company that successfully develops drugs’. However it typically requires much less investment. An example of a BioCity company utilizing the service model is Sygnature Chemical Services Ltd. Founded at BioCity in September 2004 by a medicinal chemist with extensive pharmaceutical industry experience; Sygnature has grown rapidly to the point where it currently employs 31 people. The company undertakes specific elements of the drug discovery process and is able to offer expertise in medicinal chemistry, synthetic chemistry, arrays/focused libraries and computational chemistry. Outsourcing projects for pharmaceutical companies are a major feature of its work.</p>
<p>Of the biotechnology companies surveyed at BioCity, analysis of their principal business activities reveals that 15 out of 39 comprising just over one-third (38.5%), can be classified as ‘product’ or drug discovery biotechnology companies, found to be using an intellectual property (IP)-based business model. In contrast 24 companies making up nearly two-thirds (61.5%) of the total surveyed are utilizing a service business model. Hence the dominant type of biotechnology firm is not one employing the conventional product business model; rather it is the service business model that is dominant within this biotechnology incubator.</p>
<p>While the presence of biotechnology firms using the service business model is not surprising, particularly in the light of the research studies undertaken in various European countries that were quoted earlier, the dominance of this business model is. However, evidence from biotechnology start-up companies from across the UK provides some clues as to why this is the case. The recent Life Sciences Start-up Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094212463785">Crocker, 2010</xref>), which surveyed 315 biotechnology start-up companies in the UK established between 2005 and 2009, found that for the UK overall 44% could be classified as ‘service oriented’, i.e. providing research services to other firms. But there were significant regional variations. In London, the intellectual property/drug discovery-based model was dominant with three-quarters (76%) of biotechnology start-ups operating a product business model and only 24% utilizing a service business model, while in the less well-endowed regions such as Yorkshire and the North East, located away from the golden triangle of Cambridge-London-Oxford (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094212463785">Lawton Smith et al., 2008</xref>), the picture was quite different. Here 60% of the biotechnology firms were found to be utilizing a service business model. Hence the product business model appears to be dominant in regions like the East and South East with a strong life sciences knowledge base, while in less well-endowed regions the service business model is dominant. Thus BioCity’s profile with service-oriented biotechnology firms dominant is in line with what one might expect, given its location in the East Midlands, a less well-endowed region as far as the main biotechnology clusters in the UK are concerned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0269094212463785"><title>Incubator tenants: Patents, investment and net asset growth</title>
<p>The significance of the business models employed was analysed by examining attributes that represent performance indicators for both product and service models. The attributes chosen were patents filed, external investment funding and net asset growth. The first two are measures commonly used to judge the performance of biotechnology companies in that successful ones would be expected to have achieved a high patenting rate and to have attracted substantial external investment funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094212463785">Baum et al., 2000</xref>: 275), while service companies on the other hand would not. They would, however, be expected to show significant growth of net assets, while product companies typically would not because of the amount they were spending on R&amp;D. Hence these attributes were designed to validate the categorization of companies and provide some pointers to biotechnology industry development in less well-endowed regions like the East Midlands, in particular the relationship between the incubator and the local economy.</p>
<p>Patent filings were surveyed for 2004–2008 and 13 of the 34 companies sampled, representing 38.2% of the total, were active in filing patents. These companies filed 34 patents, of which 10 were using a product business model and only three a service business model. Hence patent activity was heavily concentrated among the product companies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0269094212463785">Figure 4</xref>) who filed almost three-quarters (71.4%) of the patents. Those companies using the service business model, in contrast, demonstrated little patenting activity, with less than one-fifth (15.0%) filing patents. The distribution of patents between the product companies varied considerably. Three were very active, with each filing four patents over the five-year period. In each instance patenting activity was spread throughout the period. Apart from these three companies, patenting was generally evenly distributed with the remaining patents spread across the other companies active in filing patents. Thus a small core of technically sophisticated product companies regularly filed a steady succession of patents.
<fig id="fig4-0269094212463785" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Patents filed per company per year 2004–2008.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212463785-fig4.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Overall the pattern of patenting activity would appear to reflect the regional context. With a majority of companies at BioCity active in ‘contract research services’, one would expect patenting activity to be relatively modest as shown by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0269094212463785">Figure 4</xref>. That patenting is heavily concentrated among the product companies, indicates that the categorization is appropriate.</p>
<p>The second aspect of the tenant companies to be analysed was the level of external investment funds (i.e. venture capital) that they were able to attract. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0269094212463785">Figure 5</xref> indicates the total annual level of investment that the sample of BioCity companies attracted. Overall the pattern is one of steady growth with a dip towards the end of the period but a significant bounce back in the final year. The big drop in investment in 2007 coincides with the financial crisis of October 2007. What is particularly impressive is the rapid recovery that took place in the following year when, despite the on-going financial crisis, the level of investment recovered to almost match the previous best year.
<fig id="fig5-0269094212463785" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Annual investment for BioCity tenant companies 2003–2008.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212463785-fig5.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The total level of investment gained by the BioCity companies over the six-year period amounted to £25.35 m. However, not all the tenant companies gained investment funding; in fact only 18, or less than half of the 39 companies surveyed, gained investment funding. For those that did gain funding, the amount of investment per company averaged £1.41 m. This is significantly less than the average investment of £3.3 m for UK biotechnology start-up companies reported in the Life Sciences Start-up Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094212463785">Crocker, 2010</xref>). However, the same study reported that there was enormous regional variation, ranging from £12.0 m per company in the South East to £0.5 m per company in the less well-endowed regions like the West Midlands, Yorkshire and Wales. Hence the picture for East Midlands-based BioCity is actually somewhat better than for neighbouring regions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0269094212463785">Figure 5</xref> also shows that again there was a huge variation between companies using product and service models. The bulk of the investment funding, 89.6% amounting to £22.7 m was obtained by companies using a product business model, while their service counterparts obtained a mere £2.6 m. Expressed as investment funding per company, this works out at £2.27 m for each product company and £328,125 for each service company. Hence, as with patent filings, external venture capital was heavily concentrated among the relatively small number of research-based companies using the product business model.</p>
<p>The third attribute to be considered was net asset growth. Net assets are a company’s total assets less its total liabilities and as such constitute a measure of its net worth or value. Consequently if net assets exhibit positive growth, the company may be said to be increasing in value. If net asset growth is negative, then its value is declining and the business may be described as a ‘cash burner’.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it was not possible to obtain net asset data for all of the 39 tenant companies surveyed, but data covering a five-year period 2003–2008 was obtained for 28 tenant companies. Of the 28, 12 were companies using a product business model and 16 were using a service business model. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269094212463785">Table 3</xref> shows that the companies using a product business model achieved overall net asset growth that was actually negative and amounted to -£3.08 m. The companies using a service business model in contrast saw positive net asset growth overall amounting to +£3.64 m. Hence the product companies taken as a group were on balance ‘cash burners’ in that they lost value, while the service companies increased their net worth and might be described as ‘cash generators’. Further examination reveals that two-thirds (66.7%) of the product companies had negative net asset growth. Only four exhibited modest positive net asset growth amounting to £1.05 m in total, but this was more than offset by £4.13 m in negative asset growth from the other eight product companies. In contrast only three out of the 16 service companies had negative net asset growth. This totalled -£405,918 and was more than offset by the positive net asset growth of the other 13 companies which amounted to £4.05 m.

<p>Thus significant differences are evident when it comes to the ability of biotechnology companies based in the incubator to generate cash (i.e. add value). While the vast majority (four-fifths) of the service companies for whom data was available achieved positive net asset growth, the majority (two-thirds) of the product companies showed negative net asset growth. This is consistent with the nature of the two types of firm being considered. The product companies, utilizing as they do a drug discovery model, typically demand a big outlay of cash to fund their research activities and have to wait a long time before they see any return, while the service companies do not require a big outlay on research and therefore have significantly lower cash requirements, while at the same time being able to generate cash pretty much from the start through the sale of services.</p>
<p>Hence the incubator contains a mixture of two rather different types of biotechnology company. There are product companies that focus on the development and subsequent patenting of intellectual property, an activity that relies on significant upfront investment in the drug discovery process. Consequently, product companies typically show negative revenues particularly in the early years, but hopefully leading in time to high levels of external investment. Service companies, in contrast, focus on the provision of research services to third parties rather than the development and patenting of intellectual property. They utilize intellectual property but typically in the form of tacit rather than explicit patentable knowledge. These services generate revenues, with the result that service companies are cash generators rather than cash burners, but lacking intellectual property in the form of patentable knowledge they typically do not attract high levels of external investment.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0269094212463785" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Interesting though it is that the incubator contains both product and service companies, what is significant is the mix of the two types of company, and in particular the predominance of service companies. Why are service companies dominant? Why are there not more product companies present within the incubator?</p>
<p>The presence of relatively small numbers of product companies is a function of a number of factors, many of which are linked to the nature of the local economy. Although the incubator contains a number of university spin-off companies, being located away from the ‘star’ universities of Cambridge and Oxford, it does not have a sufficiently well-developed life science knowledge base comprising university research at the highest levels, upon which it can draw when it comes to commercializing intellectual property. Hence only a minority of companies in the incubator are ones using a product business model where they are active in the drug discovery phase of the new product development process. Instead service companies are dominant. They are less reliant on the life sciences knowledge base. They do not require access to patentable knowledge in quite the same way and are therefore more mobile. Consequently local conditions are suited to their needs. However, while this aspect of the local economy is undoubtedly important, it is only a partial explanation. The nature of the knowledge base is not the only determining factor. There are other factors that are critical in determining the pattern of industrial development.</p>
<p>As important as the strength of the science knowledge base of the local economy, in terms of the type of biotechnology start-up companies attracted to the incubator, is the availability of finance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094212463785">Sainsbury, 1999</xref>), specifically access to specialist venture capital and other related support services such as legal advice and training. Given that the specialist venture capital finance system is ‘heavily spatially centralised’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094212463785">Mueller et al., 2012</xref>: 282) in London and South East England, the East Midlands region is relatively capital poor in terms of access to the sort of investment funding such as formal venture capital, required by conventional (i.e. product) biotechnology start-up and spin-off companies. Since this is the sort of capital vital to the commercialization of intellectual property by product companies, it is not entirely surprising that such companies are in a minority. Instead service companies are dominant because, unlike their product counterparts, they are much less reliant on being able to attract external investment funding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094212463785">Feldman and Francis (2003)</xref> note a similar reliance on service companies in the biotechnology sector in the State of Maryland in the US, and they attribute this to a lack of venture capital attracting biotechnology start-ups using a service business model, because such a business model is less costly to set up and operate.</p>
<p>Hence the balance between the two types of company, with those using a service business model dominant and those using a monetization of IP or product business model in the minority, appears to be largely a function of the local economy. With the local economy relatively poorly endowed in terms of the life sciences research base and access to formal venture capital, there is a predominance of companies that are not highly dependent on these two resources.</p>

<p>The wave of new biotechnology incubators set up in the UK during the decade of the 2000s is notable for its regional distribution, with incubators spread across the UK and a significant proportion of them located outside the golden triangle of Cambridge-London-Oxford, and even outside other recognized centres of life science activity like Manchester and Liverpool in the North West region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094212463785">Oakey, 2012</xref>). This study provides an insight into this sub-set of incubators located in what in life science terms are less well-endowed regions, by providing an in-depth case study of a biotechnology incubator located in one of these regions. Although the local economy in which the incubator is located is, and has for some time been, an important centre for pharmaceutical manufacturing, it has not hitherto been recognized as a centre of biotechnology activity or a biotechnology cluster.</p>
<p>Over a six-year period from its inception until 2009 the incubator attracted more than 50 start-up and spin-off companies, four-fifths of which were directly involved in the biotechnology sector. These firms ranged from micro-enterprises employing fewer than 10 people to rapidly growing firms like R5 Pharmaceuticals Ltd which currently employs 50. They cover various fields but are very much concentrated in medical and healthcare applications. Similarly they include both university spin-offs and new start-ups. Significantly, over the period the incubator both continued to attract a stream of new tenants and at the same time supported the rapid growth and development of existing ones. As a result the incubator is now one of the largest not just in the UK but in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094212463785">Asthana et al. , 2009</xref>: 4). By 2009 some 400 staff (it has since risen to 500) were employed within the incubator. Although this includes some job displacement, nonetheless a total of 278 were new biotechnology-related jobs. This represents a significant boost to science-related jobs within the local economy. Thus in the case of BioCity in Nottingham the picture that emerges is of a successful incubator that has made a significant contribution to developing the biotechnology sector within the local economy.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that lie behind BioCity’s success and the valuable contribution it has made to the local economy in terms of both biotechnology companies and biotechnology jobs. In employment terms the study reveals that this contribution was heavily dependent on a relatively small number of tenant companies. A particular feature of the incubator has been the distinctive nature of the facilities it provides. As one would expect these facilities include the provision of laboratory space and offices for new start-up companies. The incubator also provides various forms of support to help would-be scientific entrepreneurs set up in business, including not only administrative support, but advice and guidance, education and training, and flexible access to specialist items of equipment. However, the case study shows that a particular feature of BioCity has been not only support for new venture creation, but also support for growing biotechnology companies in the form of ‘grow on’ facilities. These became available in the later phases of the incubator’s development, enabling a small number of BioCity’s tenants to grow rapidly without having to move. As they grew, these firms rapidly created additional employment. Hence these facilities enabled a small number of high growth start-ups to create almost half of the jobs generated within the incubator.</p>
<p>Another significant finding to emerge from the case study is the nature of the biotechnology start-up and spin-off companies that it houses and the activities they engage in. A clear majority of tenant companies are service providing biotechnology companies utilizing a service business model that facilitates the new product development process of third parties. Conventional product companies utilizing the monetization of intellectual property business model are present, but they are in the minority constituting only about one-third of the total number of biotechnology firms in the incubator.</p>
<p>Since product companies utilize the classic drug discovery and can on occasions generate spectacular returns, there is a tendency to regard them as highly desirable. However, it would be a mistake to assume that the failure of this incubator to attract a high proportion of product-based start-up companies is necessarily a weakness. Although as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094212463785">Feldman and Francis (2003</xref>: 777) note in their words services companies are, ‘not as flashy as product development companies’, because they do not gain large numbers of patents or attract huge amounts of external funding, nonetheless they can, as the same authors note, play an important role in promoting the growth of the biotechnology sector within a region. The service companies surveyed are not ‘soft starters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094212463785">Helm and Mauroner, 2011</xref>: 479), that is consulting type businesses formed as an entry strategy prior to becoming product-based companies. Most were specifically set up to be providers of contract research services supporting the new product development process of third parties.</p>
<p>They have an impressive record when it comes to employment creation. More than two-thirds of the 278 jobs created in the incubator over the period were created by service companies. Even allowing for the fact that there were more service companies one still finds that they had a significantly greater employment creating capability. On average service companies created 7.9 jobs per firm, compared with 5.8 created by product companies. They can also, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094212463785">Pisano (2006</xref>: 169) notes and the case study endorses, be good generators of revenue, yielding profits from an early point in their development.</p>
<p>Although initiatives to develop a biotechnology sector in a less well-endowed region like the East Midlands may appear risky given the absence of what the Sainsbury Report on Biotechnology Clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094212463785">Sainsbury 1999</xref>: 18) refers to as ‘critical factors’ for fully functioning biotechnology clusters, such as a strong science base, availability of venture capital, an entrepreneurial culture and appropriate business support, this study suggests that this may not be so. The case of BioCity shows that where an incubator can provide some of the missing factors, such as a thriving company base of spin-off and role model companies, appropriate laboratory facilities, a range of business support services and help with networking, this can go a considerable way to establishing the foundations of a viable local biotechnology sector. But there are some factors that it is very much more difficult to compensate for, like a strong science base and a lack of specialist venture capital. Here the case of BioCity reveals that these deficiencies in the local economy can be offset by attracting biotechnology start-ups that are not so reliant on these two key resources, namely companies utilizing a service business model. The result may be the presence of biotechnology firms that differ from those found in the golden triangle. But <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094212463785">Feldman and Francis (2003)</xref> view such developments as entirely tenable. They are also something that the trend towards the outsourcing of research services in the pharmaceutical industry would appear to favour.</p>
