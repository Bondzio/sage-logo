<p>This book describes itself as ‘a rigorous exploration of the myths and realities of women’s madness’ (back cover text). But like Phyllis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464700113483268">Chesler’s <italic>Women and Madness</italic> (1972)</xref>, Paula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483268">Caplan’s <italic>They Say You’re Crazy</italic> (1995)</xref>, and numerous other similar works, Ussher’s attempt to dictate how we should ‘really’ understand women’s madness is a long, ultimately unsuccessful struggle to reframe psychology as politics. This did not work for Chesler in the 1970s, and it will not work now. Women do not want to be told how to think about their own minds, regardless of whether it is by male doctors, feminist psychologists, or anyone else.</p>
<p>Unlike Chesler and Caplan, Ussher is not trying to write for a popular audience, so she does make more of an attempt to ground her claims firmly in research and clinical data from a variety of sources. But she dismisses whatever findings do not directly support her framework, and so overstates the significance of certain results that her tone is at times closer to polemic than to scholarly argument. (There is actually a section titled ‘Therapy as Tyranny’, pp. 95–98.)</p>
<p>Ussher’s goal is to avoid either of the two poles of a long-standing debate about feminine madness: that it is a sexist attempt to silence women’s voices and solidify men’s power, or that it reflects a scientifically documented weakness in women’s psychology. She says she is undertaking ‘a material-discursive-intrapsychic analysis’, in order to ‘move beyond the realism-constructionism divide, and avoid the unnecessary distinction between the subjective and objective, or mental and physical aspects of experience’ (p. 106). But it is difficult to see how a framework this unwieldy actually advances her argument, since Ussher ignores opposing viewpoints regardless of their source.</p>
<p>For example, despite repeatedly insisting on the importance of ‘women’s lived experience of misery or prolonged distress’ (p. 5), Ussher takes women’s own accounts seriously only when they conform to her politics. Women who find antidepressant medication or, even more astounding from her perspective, ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) helpful are given short shrift, while those who reframe their sadness as oppression are awarded quote after quote in the few sections where women actually do get to speak for themselves. As someone whose research and teaching focus centrally on the extraordinary diversity and complexity of madness experiences, I found deeply distressing Ussher’s denial of the reality of those women’s lives that do not fit her assumptions. I would have thought that the whole point of arguing for the central significance of lived experience was to refrain from forcing other people’s lives into one’s own preconceived categories. One can have serious concerns about ECT and the long-term effects of medication – as I certainly do – without disparaging the experiences of women whose own often anguished histories have led them to very different conclusions.</p>
<p>There are, of course, also many strengths to this book, especially its attempt to bridge the epistemological problems of combining research findings and clinical data from so many different domains of knowledge. Most attempts to explain the indisputably larger number of women with psychiatric diagnoses have been cast in epidemiological, or experiential, or political terms; it is rare to find a scholar who wants to take all of them seriously and explores potential resonances between broad statistical trends and the stories told by individuals. Ussher has not solved all the conceptual difficulties that inevitably result from trying to combine sets of data grounded in incommensurate assumptions about what constitute valid findings. But she does clearly show the benefits of looking beyond any one way of understanding to the complicated mix of cultural/psychological/historical factors that have led such an astonishingly large number of women to be classified as ‘mad’ throughout the ages.</p>
<p>Ussher makes a real contribution when she highlights the ways that data about women’s psychological distress are often skewed by researchers’ narrow assumptions. ‘Positive experiences are rarely associated with descriptions of “PMS”’, she notes, ‘because researchers and clinicians seldom ask women about positive premenstrual changes, as they are not positioned as “symptoms,” reinforcing the positioning of premenstrual change as a sign of pathology’ (p. 208). Her professional validation of the standpoint of so many activist patients, that ‘“symptoms” are better understood as coping strategies, which serve to make sense of the abuse that they have endured’ (p. 218), is particularly welcome.</p>
<p>The author seems at times to recognise the prescriptive tone of much of her writing and to pull back from trying to impose her own viewpoint on the reader. ‘This is not a recipe for recovery’, she says on the last page of the text (p. 220; there follow another eighty pages of appendices, notes, and references). Indeed it is not. That is the last thing any book called <italic>The Madness of Women</italic> should claim to be offering.</p>
