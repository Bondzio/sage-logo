<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To describe a new technique that combines traditional stent graft and multiple overlapping uncovered stents to form a sandwich-like structure in the management of a wide-necked saccular suprarenal aneurysm.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Case report:</title>
<p>An 83-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with a large symptomatic aortic aneurysm that involved celiac trunk. Traditional stent graft and coiling were precluded due to the anatomical complexity of the aneurysm. A novel combination of multiple overlapping stents and grafted stents was utilized in this patient in order to maximally reduce the blood flow into the sac and to preserve visceral branches.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Complex aneurysms that involve major branches are traditionally treated with open surgical repair or, in some experienced centers, with fenestrated/branched endografts. However, these procedures are relatively complicated and cumbersome, and there is a risk of endoleak after stenting, depending on the anatomy of the aneurysm. Attempts have been made to treat peripheral aneurysms with multiple overlapping uncovered stents—a porous stents system that aims at reducing the velocity and volume of the blood flow into the aneurismal sac and inducing thrombus to form.<sup>

</sup> A commercial interlocked multilayer stent (MS) has been introduced (Cardiatis, Isnes, Belgium) to treat complicated aneurysms while maintaining vital branches.<sup>

</sup> The outcome of this new technique has been encouraging so far.</p>
<p>When we encountered a large saccular, wide-necked aneurysm which involved celiac trunk in an elderly patient who also presented with multiple comorbidities, a novel combination of multiple overlapping uncovered stents and grafted stents was utilized in this patient in order to maximally reduce blood flow into the aneurismal sac and preserve visceral branches. Postoperative follow-up showed completed thrombosis and shrinkage of aneurismal sac along with patent visceral branches.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>An 83-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with upper abdominal pain. The patient, who had a medical history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, was diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysm in the local hospital. Her blood test revealed an uncontrolled hyperglycemia.</p>
<p>Preoperative computer tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a large saccular (35 mm in diameter), wide-necked (34 mm) aneurysm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412471210">Figure 1A</xref> and B) located on the visceral segment of the aorta (the diameter of the local normal aorta was 24 mm), which was adjacent to superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and involved celiac artery (CA). The anatomical feature of this aneurysm precluded the application of traditional stent graft or coils, and open surgery was also contraindicated due to age and multiple comorbids of the patient. As the celiac trunk was derived from the aneurismal sac, fenestrated/branched endografts were not considered a possible way in order to preserve CA and totally avoid endoleak. Therefore, multiple overlapping uncovered stents (MOUS) was considered with a novel combination with stent graft, with the intention to maximally reduce blood flow into the sac.</p>

<p>A and B, Preoperative computer tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a large -saccular suprarenal aneurysm with the celiac artery sprouting from the aneurismal wall. The neck of the aneurysm was 34 mm (arrow in panel B), while the diameter of the sac was 35 mm. C, Postoperative CTA showed total thrombosis of the aneurysm, along with patent CA and superior mesenteric artery (SMA). D, The passage of celiac artery (CA) was kept patent while the rest of the sac was thrombosed.</p>

<p>Under lumbar anesthesia, the right femoral artery was exposed and 1800 IU of heparin was given intra-arterially (30 IU/kg). An angiogram was made through 5 F pigtail catheter, which confirmed the size and location of the aneurysm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412471210">Figure 2A</xref>). A 26 × 80-mm uncovered stent (Sinus-XL Stent, OptiMed, Ettlingen, Germany) was first placed across the aneurismal neck, covering SMA as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412471210">Figure 2B</xref>). This stent provided a skeleton of the whole stent system, which prevented the distal part of the later placed stent graft from inserting into the sac. Second, a stent graft of 26 × 80 mm (Hercules, MicroPort, Shanghai, China) was advanced and deployed within the former placed bare stent, covering subtotal aneurismal entry (the cover zone of the stent graft was marked as “d1” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412471210">Figure 2C</xref>, while the whole neck was marked as “d2”) and leaving a distal small entrance into the sac (the entrance left was “d2-d1” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412471210">Figure 2C</xref>). Another uncovered stent (26 × 80 mm, Sinus-XL Stent) was then placed and deployed inside the former placed 2 stents and covered the distal unsealed entrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412471210">Figure 2D</xref>). The former left entrance, which was marked as Δ<italic>d</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412471210">Figure 2D</xref>, was therefore covered by 2 overlapping stents.</p>
<fig id="fig2-1538574412471210" position="float">

<caption>
<p>The relationship of the 3 stents was a “sandwich”-like structure. The first layer was an uncovered stent which provided basic structure, so that distal part of grafted stent would not insert into aneurismal sac and causing postoperative migration. The middle layer was a stent graft, covering most of the neck but leaving a distal unsealed part. The last layer was a bare stent that covered both aneurismal sac and SMA. After stenting, the proximal part of the aneurismal neck was covered by 1 layer of stent graft and 2 layers of bare stents, whereas the distal entrance of the sac was eventually covered by 2 layers of uncovered stents. A, pre-stenting angiogram was made to confirm the size and location of the aneurysm, and measure the length of the aneurismal neck, the diameter of the sac, and the aortic diameter. B, The first uncovered stent was placed across the neck of the aneurysm, the arrows showed the proximal and distal mark of the neck. C, The second grafted stent was placed within the first stent, covering most part of the neck (d1) to maximally reduce blood flow into the sac. A small entry (d2-d1) was left to supply CA with blood flow. D, The final bare stent was placed within the former stents, covering the small entrance (Δ<italic>d</italic>) together with the first uncovered stent.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1538574412471210-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Post-stenting angiogram showed a significant decrease in flow velocity of the aneurismal sac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412471210">Figure 2E</xref>), therefore no more bare stent was added. The patient was given insulin to control her diabetes and discharged 4 days after surgery. At 3-month follow-up, CTA showed complete shrinkage of aneurismal sac from 35 mm in diameter to 16 mm. The CA, which was sprouting from aneurismal wall, and the SMA that was covered by 2 layers of bare stents, stayed patent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412471210">Figure 1C</xref> and D).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In terms of aneurysm exclusion, the multiple overlapping uncovered stents approach is a novel concept of active, physiological barrier which has several unique features in comparison with traditional grafted stent. The main advantage lies in its capacity of excluding the aneurysm and preserving the vital collateral circulation at the same time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412471210">6</xref>
</sup> Meanwhile, it retains the virtue of flexibility and low profile of uncovered stents. The commercial Cardiatis MSs have been applied in many centers to test its efficacy and safety and the result has been encouraging so far.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412471210">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412471210"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412471210">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As the Cardiatis stents is still not available in China and many other countries, instead we applied multiple overlapping uncovered stents, which may share a similar flow-modulating hemodynamic mechanism. However, the exact relationship between mesh porosity of the uncovered stents and its therapeutic effect remains an unsolved question. Based on different centers’ experience, a decrease in blood flow velocity into the aneurismal sac on fluoroscopy was considered a predictive factor of future total exclusion. In this case, we encountered a wide-necked aneurysm with an wide entry of 34 mm. To maximally reduce the flow into the sac, we used a stent graft to cover most of the aneurismal sac, leaving a small distal entry to supply CA with blood flow. To exclude the aneurysm, we applied two bare stents covering the distal entry, with the purpose of promoting thrombosis process within the aneurismal sac while preserving CA and SMA. The CTA at 3-month follow-up demonstrated satisfactory outcome, with complete thrombosis and shrinkage of the sac, along with patent CA and SMA. An interesting phenomenon was that, as we could see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412471210">Figure 1D</xref>, the passage of CA was patent while the rest of the sac was totally thrombosed, which might be a proof of the flow-modulating effect of the porous stents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412471210">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574412471210">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There is still a debate on the efficacy of porous stents approach, because complete thrombosis does not necessarily mean a reduction in aneurismal sac pressure, whereas shrinkage of aneurismal sac is considered as an indication that the risk of rupture is decreased. In our case, a complete shrinkage of aneurismal sac is visualized up to 54%, which serves as an evidence that supports this multiple overlapping stents to be an effective approach in the management of aneurysms as far as the flow velocity into aneurismal sac is decreased, and a grafted stent covering part of the entry may help achieve that.</p>
