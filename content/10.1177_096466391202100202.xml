<p>The specific focus of this generally titled collection is feminist legal history in the United States in the period from about 1870 to recent times. The essays have mostly been published before in American journals but have been condensed and edited for this volume. Most of the authors are based in US law schools but there are contributions from sociologists, cultural historians and feminist studies scholars as well. Once I had overcome my initial irritation that Americans rarely feel it necessary to specify that a book is solely about American experience – it would have been helpful to the rest of us to make that clear in the title or sub-title – I found lots of fascinating material here.</p>
<p>The 13 chapters are grouped into two parts. The first, ‘Contradictions in Legalizing Gender’, deals with the law’s differential and often unfair effect on women in a range of case studies. The second, ‘Women’s Transformation of the Law’, shows the law as a feminist tool rather than impediment in the struggle for justice for women. The whole is pulled together by a useful introduction that explains the methodology of feminist legal history, outlines the general features of the period covered by the book, draws out central themes, and runs through the main strands of feminist theorising in law. As the editors explain, feminist legal history is characterised by a methodology that locates women at the centre rather than the margins of events, shows how the law impacts differentially on men and women, integrates women’s stories into received versions of history (from which they have generally been omitted), and reconstructs the ‘assumed contours’ (p.1) of the past. In particular, it challenges the traditional understanding of ‘women’s linear progress from oppression under the law to equal opportunity in modern times’ (p. 2). The book’s chapters between them exemplify all these approaches, dispelling the myth of steady progress in their various accounts of times when things might have been better for women than now and of setbacks, lost battles, and, especially, forgotten and suppressed achievements. Many make a link between past and present, showing how a feminist rewriting of history not only helps to explain how things came to be but can also influence contemporary policy decisions as well as empowering the women and girls who learn of their more active heritage. They demonstrate the contributors’ shared commitment to a ‘pragmatic feminism’ (p. 26) that links theory and practice, scholarship and activism.</p>
<p>The essays in Part 1 range over topics as diverse as temperance campaigns, the tortious liability of early women drivers, the double disadvantage suffered by women of minority racial groups in nationality law, how the GI Bill reinforced traditional gender roles, and women’s assumed inability to make rational decisions about abortion. They attempt to recreate worlds long (or not so long) gone and tell stories from a new point of view, thereby changing our perception of the legal past. The chapters in Part 2 focus on feminist individuals or organisations that played a pivotal (although often ignored) role in legal history. Two chapters explore the gendered origins of Legal Aid and the way in which women’s fundamental contributions were erased by (male) institutional historians anxious to ‘masculinise’ (and thereby raise the status of) the work, with sad consequences for women lawyers and service users. If Carrie N. Baker’s chapter on ‘Sexual Harassment’ offers a rare success story – it highlights a legal wrong that women identified, campaigned against, and persuaded a sceptical legislature, and judges who at first just did not get it, to take seriously – it also shows how social change continues to lag behind the law.</p>
<p>My only criticism of this collection (apart from the universalist title) is that some of the individual essays, as edited, seem rather slight. At around 8000–9000 words (I would guess), they are not so much too short <italic>per se </italic>as tending to focus too much on the story-telling at the expense of interpretation and analysis. By British standards they are under-referenced – some quite sweeping generalisations are allowed to go unfootnoted (e.g. p. 103) – and I would find it difficult to point to any one of them as an example of the various strands of feminist legal theorising outlined in the introduction. Nor does the introduction link any of the strands described to any specific chapter in the book. I wonder then if the main intended audience of the book was students, who have been offered bite-size examples of feminist legal history, lightly referenced, as models to emulate in their own work. That assumption would fit with the generalist title and the survey-type introduction. But I think it sells feminist legal history short, and I would have welcomed longer treatments with distinct analytical approaches – something more ambitious altogether. </p>
