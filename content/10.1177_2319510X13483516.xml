<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this article is to present the findings of a study based on analysis of ERP implementation issues in context to Indian micro, small and medium scale enterprises with the objective of highlighting the key issues confronting them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2319510X13483516">
<title>Design/Methodology/Approach</title>
<p>The research study is based on wide variety of literature review focusing on issues influencing ERP adoption. Responses were collected on the basis of questionnaires and personal interviews given by officials who were closely involved in the implementation process. Initially, factor analysis has been performed on SPSS with principal component analysis using Varimax rotation and the factors were grouped on the basis of factor loading. Further to this, the researchers developed a model by SEM.</p>

<sec id="section3-2319510X13483516">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The analysis showed statistically significant relationship between the predictor and the outcome variables for the four hypotheses.</p>

<sec id="section4-2319510X13483516">
<title>Research Limitations/Implications</title>
<p>Besides the identified issues, there may be other factors that need to be explored. There is also a scope to enhance this research study by taking different industries into consideration and also by factoring the state of the economy and by increasing the number of respondents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2319510X13483516">
<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>This study will help information system managers who plan to implement ERP systems in their organisations. It will help those with useable but less than satisfactory ERP implementations to understand the underlying issues why they had problems and it will help them to avoid facing problems in future projects. It will also help those who failed to implement their planned ERP system when they try again; it will help those who have not yet tried. Even ERP vendors can take input from this study in their implementation approach while targeting SME sector.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) can be considered as a novel phenomenon for the information system research and other academic fields (e.g., operations, supply chain). Today ERP are becoming rapidly indispensable for organisations of any magnitude. Organisations of any magnitude have implemented or in the process of implementing such novel information systems (i.e., ERP) so as to remain competitive in this global business scenario. ERP can be regarded as highly integrated management information system managing all aspects of business operations of organisations which include production, manufacturing, sales, accounting, customer service, etc. ERP are increasingly becoming accepted platform for the small and medium scale industrial sectors and it is viewed as one of the ways to achieve competitive advantage and to reengineer business process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2319510X13483516">Al-Mashari, 2004</xref>). ERP automates the task of performing business processes such as fulfilment of orders, payments, material receipts, material requirement planning, invoicing, etc., thereby making all the data available to other functions instantaneously. ERP implementation today in India is picking up very fast. Enterprise business applications in the form of ERP applications constitute well-structured, reliable information technology (IT) backbones of fortune 500 companies worldwide. To compete in the new economy small and medium scale enterprises are now facing challenges to become more responsive and agile. As per IDC, the awareness and current trend in adoption of ERP is high in large organisations but it is the SME sector that would fuel the future growth.</p>
<p>Indian SMEs contribute around more than 60 per cent of country’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and because of its potential growth ERP vendors are moving their attention towards small and medium business (SMB) by offering customised and cheaper solutions from both the organisational and technological point of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2319510X13483516">Basu, Upadhyay &amp; Dan, 2011</xref>)]. India’s SME sector is a vibrant, dynamic, flexible and productive entity, containing as many as 12 million units and employing around 30 million people. The SME sector in India, which contributes almost half of India’s GDP and is home to a slew of business opportunities. Indian SME sector can be considered as very dynamic and flexible as well as source of employment. The critical influencing business drivers for SME segment will be to increase the overall business efficiency, to increase the capital and labour productivity and to reduce the fixed and variable cost and integration with tier 1 supplier and distributors. Although ERP systems can bring competitive advantage to organisations, the high failure rate being a major concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2319510X13483516">Bajwa, Gracia &amp; Mooney, 2004</xref>). A number of publications have highlighted the failures and frustrations and even total meltdown that the organisations have to go through while implementing ERP systems. Some of the notable failures are Dell, Fox-Meyer and Hershley. A study carried out by Gartner group and American companies found that 32 per cent of ERP projects were delivered late and the organisations thus not being able to reap the true benefits of the implementation. As cases of ERP failures have increased, many researches have been carried out to identify issues that could lead to implementation of such system smoothly and without any disruption. However ERP system implementation issues have been subjected to substantial research and as the failure rate is becoming high, question arises can certain issues be identified that would lead to ERP implementation successful. The purpose of this article thus attempts to answer such questions.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>ERP system implementation issues have been subjected to substantial research under various theoretical perspectives dealing with aspects like: characteristics, adoption and implementation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483516">Bingi, Sharma &amp; Godla, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2319510X13483516">Butler &amp; Pyke, 2003</xref>), designing of project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2319510X13483516">Chan, 1999</xref>), organisational impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2319510X13483516">Chang &amp; King, 2005</xref>), forecasting of the probability of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2319510X13483516">Chao &amp; Chandra, 2012</xref>) and extending towards e-commerce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2319510X13483516">Doom et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2319510X13483516">Chen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2319510X13483516">Davenport, 1998</xref>). For developing countries like India ERP is still in its early stage. As more and more ERP vendors targeting SME segment, researchers in many countries have tried to bring out difference in comparison to large companies in terms of pre-conditions, project behaviours, result achieved. SMEs either do not have sufficient resources or are not willing to commit a huge fraction of their resources due to longer implementation time and high costs associated with implementation of ERP. Lured by sheer magnitude of the SME sector in any country and particularly in a country like India, many ERP vendors have been moving their attention towards SMEs by offering simpler and cheaper solutions from both the organisational and technological point of view preconfigured systems based on best-practices at a fraction of the cost originally required and promising implementation times of 60 days. In spite of such promises, there is not a general agreement on the effectiveness of such systems. As a result current ERP adoption rate is low. Such a scenario raises some questions: Are SME’s informational needs different from that of large companies? Is it possible to identify a relationship between organisational change and ERP adoption in companies of different size? Can certain factors be identified that can be considered critical in context to SME’s on account of their peculiarities? In this section some similar developing countries like India are selected to understand the characteristics of ERP in those countries and also to investigate the issues that are affecting the implementation of ERP system.</p>

<title>Review of Literature of ERP Implementation Issues in Context to Small and Medium Scale Enterprises</title>
<p>Among the identified articles, the early published study on issues relating to implementation of manufacturing resource planning was by Duchessi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2319510X13483516">1988</xref>). The issues identified are: Project team composition; Project management; Business plan and vision; Top management support; Effective communication and Change management programme and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2319510X13483516">Duchessi et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Bingi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483516">1999</xref>) on the basis of their research outcome suggested some critical issues that would lead to positive outcome of ERP implementation process. Those issues are: Support from top management, Reengineering the business process, Role of ERP consultants, Proper team composition, Employee training and Morale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2319510X13483516">Gable &amp; Stewart, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>A research study identified ten success factors or issues in implementing ERP system in Malaysian companies which are: Support from top management, clear goals and objectives, communication, effective project management, business process engineering, data accuracy and integrity, suitability of software and hardware, support from vendor, education and training and user involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483516">Jafari et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Another research study carried out in micro and small medium scale organisations and on the basis of empirical analysis the researchers identified six critical issues that ensure smooth and positive impact in implementation of ERP systems. Those identified issues are: Proper goals and objectives of business, User education and training, Project team being competent, Change management, Assistance from vendor, External consultants role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2319510X13483516">Kaiser, 1960</xref>).</p>
<p>Upadhyay and Dan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2319510X13483516">2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2319510X13483516">Karimi, Gupta &amp; Somers, 1996</xref>) performed a similar research for Indian SME’s and revealed that certain critical factors could lead to positive implementation of ERP. The factors include top management support, proper goals and objectives, user knowledge, project champion, project team expertise; improve work efficiency, scalability and scope and ERP importance. Noudoostbeni et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2319510X13483516">2009</xref>) assessed important success factors and failure factors in Malaysian SME companies and tried to recognise the effective ones. From the research, the critical issues identified for successful implementation are proper team composition and effective training of users. Also, two issues identified responsible for the failure of the implementation are poor project planning and inappropriate training method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2319510X13483516">Kemppainen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A research study carried out in Indian small and medium scale enterprises by Basu, Upadhyay and Dan (2011) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2319510X13483516">Karimi, Gupta &amp; Somers, 1996</xref>) revealed some most influencing critical factors leading to successful implementation of ERP which includes: User knowledge, ERP importance, Interdepartmental communication, Proper selection of package, ERP team composition, Project champion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2319510X13483516">Koh &amp; Simpson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A study done by Ondrej Zach and Erik Munkvold (2012) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2319510X13483516">Zach &amp; Munkvold, 2012</xref>) on SMEs in the Czech Republic focuses on the degree of customisation necessary during implementation due to the uniqueness of their business process and the stage of the organisational growth as issues affecting SMEs in Czech Republic. Claude Doom et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2319510X13483516">2010</xref>) in their study to identify critical success factors for ERP implementation in Belgian SME opines that most of the success factors available in published literature is applicable to Belgian SME but external consultant’s role and involvement has been found to be an important factor. In context to a small and medium scale enterprise which is family run business, the impact of owner’s knowledge on IT and their subsequent strategic alignment is crucial as pointed out by Chai-An Chao and Aruna Chandra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2319510X13483516">2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Methodology</title>
<p>Based on the comprehensive compilation of literature certain issues leading to successful implementation of ERP have been identified. As it is being observed from the previous literature study there are different issues for positive and successful implementation of ERP. However the content validity of these constructs was tentatively established by extensive review with top executives and other stakeholders. Some items were removed from the construct if their removal results in an increase in the reliability estimates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-2319510X13483516">
<title>Survey Methodology</title>
<p>The researchers in this study identified those Indian small scale organisations which have recently gone through the implementation process of ERP system (any module, any vendor). Questionnaire based survey method is adopted following the previous study to evaluate the importance of success issues found from the literature review. It has been found from the survey that some of the identified issues are not applicable for smooth implementation so some issues were added and some were deleted. The survey uses five point Likert type scales where ‘1’ means strongly disagree and ‘5’ means strongly agree. These five items were empirically tested and validated.</p>
<p>The researchers used postal survey questionnaire as the research instrument. It identifies respondents’ perception of the importance of issues for positive implementation of ERP systems. Invitations to participate in the survey requested responses from the implementers of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and those who have already worked for Indian small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs).</p>
<p>The respondents came from manufacturing (44 per cent), education (10 per cent), health care (8 per cent), telecommunications (8 per cent) and a variety of other industries. They were also fairly well educated with 87 per cent having a three-year or higher college degree. They had about 8+ years of experience in their current area, 5 years with their current employer and 20 subordinates. Their organisations employed about 3000.</p>
<p>The researchers contacted those organisations which are relevant for the study. The respondents were briefed about the scope and purpose of the questions contained in the questionnaire and the feedback were obtained. Overall 175 responses from 70+ organisations were obtained for analysis. It was deliberate attempt on the part of the researcher not to collect any response in his presence so as to minimise the chance of any biasness.</p>

<sec id="section12-2319510X13483516">
<title>Data Analysis and Results</title>
<p>Through a detailed review of literature and from questionnaire survey a set of indicators are identified as variables which can prove to be critical and could influence the ERP adoption process to be point of being labelled as success or failure. These indicators have been tested on the field through empirical study. Further investigations revealed 13 items as the most influencing issues for successful ERP implementation and the data pertaining to those items (raw data) was captured in spread sheet. The spreadsheet was then converted into statistical software package (SPSS 17). We performed factor analysis on explanatory variables with the objective to determine minimum number of factors that account for maximum variance in data. Here principal component analysis (PCA) has been used with Varimax rotation. PCA gives loading for each combination of variables and loading factors. Higher loadings mark a higher correlation between variable and factor. Thus, the factor can be interpreted as underlying latent variables. In this study, we follow the Kaiser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2319510X13483516">1960</xref>) criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2319510X13483516">Kraemmergaard &amp; Rose, 2002</xref>), which suggests selection of those factors with Eigen values having values greater than 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2319510X13483516">Figure 1</xref>). PCA is a procedure, which is widely accepted in various applications of information system domain and also proved to be feasible in research method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2319510X13483516">Laframboise, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2319510X13483516">Levy and Powell, 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>The item deletion process was carried out in two phases. First, the items that did not load significantly on their respective factors were deleted one by one until all of them showed significant loadings. The detailed output is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2319510X13483516">Table 1</xref>. The results show that four factors can be considered crucial in context to ERP implementation in the SME sector for the manufacturing industry in India.

<title>Proposing a Conceptual Model</title>
<p>The factors identified from the study discussed above was used to formulate a conceptual model as shown below by the application of structural equation modelling.</p>
<p>Further to the above analysis of identifying the most important factors leading to successful implementation of ERP, the researchers developed a model adopting structural equation modelling (SEM) with AMOS software to support the hypotheses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2319510X13483516">Figure 1</xref> above shows the proposed model with relationships between the constructs and the level of significance for the supported hypotheses.</p>

<p>As can be seen in above diagram, all independent factors (Pack, Team and ORG) have meaningful impact on Project management (T-value&gt;2). But, ORG (Organisational climate) has a negative impact on project management (ML= –0.22, T-value&gt;2). In other words, this means that Organisational climate mostly acts as an inhibitor during ERP project management.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The factors identified from this study has been reported crucial by other researchers in their study. Project Management covers the project goal clarification and their congruence with organisational mission and strategic goals. The scope of the implementation should be established and controlled, clearly defined and limited. A focus on result and constant tracking of schedules and budgets against targets are important as has been the findings of some previous researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2319510X13483516">Wee, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483516">Somers and Nelson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Project Management competency is concerned crucial for any type of information system projects. But the ERP environment differs from those of traditional Information System (IS) management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2319510X13483516">Mabert et al., 2001</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2319510X13483516">Laframboise, 2002</xref>). Thus, any mechanism developed for measuring the impact of IS implementation may not necessarily apply to an ERP environment. An ERP satisfaction construct may need to consider ERP-specific factors, such as the cost of the package, quality of the project team, ultimate-user—project team interaction, ERP system product and ultimate-user—ERP system interaction. Therefore, the factors of package information, cost, support and service and user knowledge and involvement are worth considering. A review of literature stressed the importance of change and project management competences as critical success factors for ERP implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2319510X13483516">Davenport, 1998</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2319510X13483516">Doom et al., 2010</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2319510X13483516">Mandal and Gunasekaran, 2002</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2319510X13483516">Mabert, Soni &amp; Venkatramanan, 2001</xref>), hereby indirectly raising the issue of small to medium-sized enterprise’s (SME’s) lack of organisational preparation. Such a situation is mainly caused by the low extent of formalisation of people’s roles and responsibilities. This structural condition makes the identification of ERP implementation’s main figures, such as the process owner and the key user (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2319510X13483516">Davenport, 1998</xref>) [9], extremely difficult to achieve. Beside this, SMEs operating in the manufacturing sector in India generally suffer from a widespread lack of culture, as to the concept of business process: thus the concept of business process is often claimed among the critical success factors in ERP implementation in many studies. In particular, the business process concept helps promoting co-operation and convergence of efforts among managers (i.e. managerial integration), versus the internal competition induced by the functionally-oriented organisational models which is typical of many organisations operating in the manufacturing sector in India.</p>
<p>When the features of the software application do not correctly fit the business requirements two possible strategies can be identified:
<list id="list1-2319510X13483516" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Customise the existing business processes of the organisation to fit the software with minimal changes: This choice could mean changes in long-established ways of doing business (that often provide competitive advantage) and could shake up important people’s roles and responsibilities thus affecting the organisational climate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Modify the software to fit the processes: This choice would slow down the project, could affect the stability and correctness of the software application and could increase the difficulty of managing future releases, because the customizations could need to be torn apart and rewritten to work with the newer version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2319510X13483516">Koh et al., 2007</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2319510X13483516">Karimi, Gupta &amp; Somers, 1996</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Although ERP vendors are concentrating on the customisation process needed to match the ERP system modules with the actual features of existing processes in a number of different industries, several studies show that configuring and implementing ERP systems is a complex and expensive task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2319510X13483516">Mabert et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2319510X13483516">Laframboise, 2002</xref>). Small and medium scale enterprises (SME) operating in the Indian manufacturing sectordiffer from large companies in important ways affecting their information-seeking practices. These differences include the:
<list id="list2-2319510X13483516" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Lack of or less sophisticated information system management;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Information-gathering responsibilities are entrusted into one or two individuals, rather than a team working at it;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inadequate availability of resources for information-gathering; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Quantity and quality of available environmental information.</p>
<list id="list3-2319510X13483516" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Chan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2319510X13483516">1999</xref>) asserts that many SMEs either do not have sufficient resources or are not willing to commit a huge fraction of their resources due to the long implementation times and high fees associated with ERP implementation. The resource scarcity, the lack of strategic planning of information systems (IS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2319510X13483516">Levy &amp; Powell, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2319510X13483516">Kraemmergaard &amp; Rose, 2002</xref>), the limited expertise in IT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2319510X13483516">Levy &amp; Powell, 2000</xref>)[19] and also the opportunity to adopt a processoriented view of the business are among the factors that strongly influence, either positively or negatively, ERP adoption by enterprise of any size and particularly SMEs. In today’s increasingly competitive marketplace, customers have a wider range of options in selecting projects, vendors and consulting firms. As a result, client satisfaction has emerged as an important indicator of a successful project in addition to the above mentioned already established success measures.</p></list-item>

<p>Proper package selection with adequate features and scalability is another crucial aspect affecting the success of the implementation. Normally the organisation selects a package which is most users friendly, has adequate scope for scalability and covers an array of business process where the organisation experiences problem. The selection of the specific ERP package is one that requires careful attention. Previous studies by researchers like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2319510X13483516">Kraemmergaard and Rose, 2002</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2319510X13483516">Kemppainen, 2004</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2319510X13483516">Yusuf et al., 2006</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2319510X13483516">Upadhyay &amp; Dan, 2009</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2319510X13483516">Al-Mashari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2319510X13483516">Somers and Nelson, 2001</xref>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2319510X13483516">Schubert, 2003</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2319510X13483516">2004</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2319510X13483516">Schubert &amp; Leimstoll, 2004</xref>) have also highlighted this issue as a crucial factor.</p>
<p>Team competency refers to the composition and leadership of the project team and the proper selection of the project team members who would be driving the implementation. It has also been repeatedly mentioned throughout the literature that there is a critical need to put in place a solid, core implementation team that is comprised of the organisation’s best and brightest individuals. These individuals should have a proven reputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2319510X13483516">Chen, 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2319510X13483516">Chao &amp; Chandra, 2012</xref>) and there should be a commitment to ‘release’ these individuals to the project on a full-time basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2319510X13483516">Schubert, 2003</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2319510X13483516">Mandal &amp; Gunasekaran, 2002</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2319510X13483516">Siriginidi, 2000</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2319510X13483516">Zach &amp; Munkvold, 2012</xref>). Some researchers have also cited the need for the team to possess the necessary skills to probe for details when conducting the planning phase of the implementation. Once the team has been established, it might then be necessary to train the individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2319510X13483516">Bajwa et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Effective change management ensures that the acceptance and readiness of the new system, allowing it to get the benefits and its use. A successful organisational change management approach relies in a proper integration of people, process and technology. Ensuring a conducive organisational climate which is willing to adopt to the change management is important and has primary concern of IT project implementation and has been reported by researchers like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483516">Somers &amp; Nelson 2004</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2319510X13483516">Schubert and Leimstoll, 2004</xref>).This study shows and reinforces the results of some earlier research studies that the factor organisational climate can acts as an inhibitor during ERP project management if not handled properly.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study presented above is crucial for small and medium scale enterprises opting for ERP implementation. Such implementations are generally big ticket projects and resource starved enterprises can ill afford an implementation failure. The initial approach of various vendors in the form of ‘one size fits all’ approach has resulted in failures in many small and medium scale enterprises and leading ERP vendors should take a note of the same.</p>
<p>The study presented by the authors can be further refined by increasing the sample size and also incorporating the effects of modern technological options which are available to small and medium scale organisations in the form of cloud computing. Already quite a few such organisations have started adopting cloud computing technologies as a solution to their business which results in substantial savings as well as improved service levels.</p>
