         <abstract>
            <p>Medical information departments are responsible for providing information regarding the drugs the company manufactures and the diseases these drugs treat. The medical information departments of orphan drug manufacturers face unique challenges. Although they receive fewer inquiries, those received usually require sophisticated and time-consuming responses, often based on unpublished information and with greater reliance on rare disease experts. Worldwide distribution results in interactions with non-English-speaking individuals and requires familiarity with international legal requirements. Orphan drug medical information staff has greater visibility and is more likely to be contacted regarding adverse events and assistance for investigator-initiated clinical studies. As primary sources of information for patients, they need to be familiar with patient advocacy groups, clinical trial enrollment, and sources of unapproved medications such as expanded access programs. The ideal orphan drug medical information department is staffed with specialized health care professionals with advanced training dedicated to 1 or 2 orphan drug products.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>In the United States, rare diseases are defined as disorders affecting ≤200,000 people.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511427696">1</xref>
            </sup> The European Union (EU) defines rare diseases as disorders with a prevalence of ≤5 per 10,000 people,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511427696">2</xref>
            </sup> and other countries use similar definitions.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511427696">3</xref>
            </sup> Although each rare disease affects a relatively small number of individuals, it is estimated that the world population is affected by more than 7000 rare diseases, believed to collectively affect 30 to 40 million people worldwide.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861511427696">4</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>For many years, there was little interest in developing drug treatments for these patients because of the small market size relative to the incurred drug development costs, the lack of patent protection for existing or natural drug entities, and product liability.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511427696">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861511427696">5</xref>
            </sup> To increase the availability of drug therapies for treating these rare disorders, the US Congress passed the Orphan Drug Act in 1983, which encouraged the pharmaceutical industry to develop therapies for these diseases by providing several financial incentives. Provision of the act included an expedited review process, protocol assistance, grant funding, tax credits for research expenses, and a 7-year period of marketing exclusivity.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511427696">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861511427696">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861511427696">7</xref>
            </sup> To promote orphan drug development, the Office of Orphan Products Development was created within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Similar legislation was enacted in the EU to stimulate orphan drug development with oversight provided by the European Medicines Agency’s Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511427696">2</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The US Orphan Drug Act has been highly successful in bringing effective therapies to previously underserved patient populations. During the 10-year period prior to passage of the Orphan Drug Act, only 10 orphan drugs had become available.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861511427696">8</xref>
            </sup> During the subsequent 8 years, 40 orphan drugs were approved and 281 others had received orphan status and were in clinical development.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861511427696">9</xref>
            </sup> By 2008, the number of orphan-designated drugs had grown to 1892. Of these, 326 had received marketing approval for 1 or more indications.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861511427696">10</xref>
            </sup> Orphan drug development in the United States appears to be more successful than in the EU,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511427696">2</xref>
            </sup> where only 44 of 400 orphan drug candidates were approved between 2000 and 2007.<sup>

         <p>The medical information departments maintained by each orphan drug manufacturer are important sources for information regarding orphan drugs and the diseases they are used to treat. As with all medical information departments, the primary role for the medical information department representing orphan drugs is to provide accurate medical and scientific responses to medical information inquiries in a timely and professional manner; however, orphan drugs can present unique challenges to the traditional medical information departmental infrastructure. This article demonstrates these unique challenges faced by orphan drug manufacturers in their efforts to provide medical information about their products and how these challenges may be overcome with customized medical information infrastructures.</p>

            <title>Scope of Inquiries and Responses</title>
            <p>In contrast to more traditional drug information departments responding to numerous queries regarding “blockbuster” drugs, orphan drug companies receive far fewer requests for information; however, there is a greater likelihood of receiving queries from clinicians that require more sophisticated disease- and treatment-related information. For example, the response to a drug information request for an orphan drug used to treat an inborn error of metabolism may require an explanation of the effects of diet on the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic responses of the orphan drug, not just the effects of the drug itself.</p>
            <p>As well, physicians often inquire about the investigative use of an orphan drug for other rare diseases. Although such unsolicited requests may arise purely from purely academic curiosity, they still require a comprehensive response based on the known pharmacological property of the drug, such as neurotransmitter synthesis or receptor distribution. It is not unusual for a well-prepared written response to such an inquiry to require information gathered from the fields of biochemistry, physiology, immunology, genetics, and/or pharmacology. Because of the paucity of published data, the response may also have to rely on information gathered from the unpublished sources, such as the proceedings of medical society meetings.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section4-0092861511427696">
            <title>International Focus</title>
            <p>The Internet has become a rich source of medical information for the families of patients with rare diseases. It has also provided a gateway for contacting companies involved in orphan drug research and development. To effectively respond to international requests for general information from patients and family members about both orphan drugs and rare diseases, medical information experts should develop familiarity with disease-specific patient advocacy groups whenever possible. Appropriate referral to agencies such as the National Organization for Rare Diseases (NORD) may help callers obtain needed information about relevant clinical trials, patient assistance programs, and sources for unapproved medication, such as an expanded access program. Medical information specialists are also an initial point of contact for patients seeking enrollment in company-sponsored clinical development activities; therefore, it is essential that these medical information specialists maintain a close relationship with their clinical development department and clinical investigators.</p>
            <p>Many orphan drugs are marketed internationally, and it is not unusual to receive requests for information from non-English-speaking individuals, including laypeople and health care professionals. Although it is not feasible to train the medical information staff to respond to questions using a variety of languages, medical information specialists may be required to work with translation services that translate written inquiries and common standard written responses for use in other countries. For example, standard response letters for orphan drug products marketed in Canada must be written in both English and French. These translation companies typically charge on a per-word basis and provide certification of the translation process using reverse translation of the prepared document.</p>
            <p>In addition to conforming to current legal standards enforced by the US FDA, it is necessary for medical information specialists involved in supporting international activities to become familiar with the legal standards required by other countries such as EudraLex (EU) and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australia). Companies must be in compliance with the directives of each country to provide medical information to individuals within that country.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section5-0092861511427696">
            <title>Investigator-Initiated Research</title>
            <p>In addition to patient recruitment activities for company-sponsored clinical trials, and acting as an information source regarding planned and ongoing clinical trials, medical information is often the point of contact for physicians seeking assistance for investigator-initiated clinical studies. As a result of medical and drug information knowledge and familiarity with the medical rare disease community, the medical information group may be given the responsibility of managing requests for support for independent investigator-initiated research with company products. In these cases, a medical information specialist collects the initial request from a potential investigator and may triage the information to a medical science liaison for follow-up or otherwise manage according to company protocol.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section6-0092861511427696">
            <title>Limited Drug and Disease Information Resources</title>
            <p>Because of the rarity of some diseases and the paucity of published information, medical information departments in orphan drug companies generally do not have ready access to the same quantity and quality of drug information literature available to traditional pharmaceutical companies. In the case of very rare diseases, existing data may be limited to a handful of published case reports or a small clinical study. In some instances, the best available information may be in another language. Therefore, responding to orphan drug and disease queries often requires a greater reliance on animal studies and unpublished clinical data that are usually provided on a “data on file” basis. Examples include answering questions regarding the excretion of a drug in breast milk, drug distribution into the cerebrospinal fluid, and teratogenicity and reproductive studies, all based on rodent models. In some instances, the requested information is simply unknown because such studies to answer a specific question have not been conducted. Because there is little information available about specific drug-drug interactions, a greater reliance is placed on the known pharmacology or physiology of the drug for responding to these queries.</p>
            <p>The task of creating a medical and drug information database requires ongoing literature review and a greater reliance on unpublished information such as abstracts, slide decks, and poster presentations obtained by attending medical society meetings. As the development of an orphan drug continues, new activities such as investigator-initiated trials, postmarketing studies, and disease registries may eventually provide needed information. Possibly the most important information resource for rare diseases and their treatment is a network of physicians who are recognized as experts in their field. These relationships are sometimes formed early in the orphan drug development process when these individuals serve as clinical investigators during the clinical trials.</p>
            <p>In some instances, when the requested drug or medical information is unknown but the required resources are available, the medical information team may initiate experimental research to discover the needed information. For example, a large number of requests for drug information were received regarding the safety of administering crushed tablets of an orphan drug product in food. The result of an internal study initiated at the request of the medical information team determined that there was no significant change in the amount of drug present when crushed drug tablets were mixed with several foods.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861511427696">11</xref>
               </sup> In the process of supporting orphan drug products, the medical information staff is likely to have greater interdisciplinary relationships with the basic science divisions within their own organization.</p>
            <p>As a result of much smaller patient populations, there are relatively few reports of adverse events (AEs) associated with the use of orphan drugs compared with the traditional pharmaceutical agents. It is therefore necessary for the orphan drug information team to have greater familiarity with pharmacovigilance as they often perform initial intake of AEs that may be discovered during the medical information response process, and therefore the company drug safety department ensures that all medical information personnel are properly trained in AE intake procedures. Close communication with the medical information staff permits efficient triage of AEs identified by medical information, enhancing the ability of the drug safety group to detect drug safety signals. Because of their ready availability, medical information may also play a role in AE training and intake for other functional areas of the company such as sales, marketing, and customer service, ensuring that all AEs are properly identified and triaged.</p>
            <p>As orphan drug information specialists are in constant contact with clinical services and with patients, they are ideally situated for identifying potential gaps in summary information collected prior to product approval, establishing an opportunity for their involvement in developing the package label. Following approval, the medical information team remains alert for new dosing and administration methods that may affect the efficacy and safety of the product.</p>
            <p>In addition to drug information, the medical information staff supporting an orphan drug product is called upon to address medical questions more often because other readily accessible information resources do not exist. These questions may come from treating physicians and other health care professionals who are not usually involved in traditional patient care, such as dietitians and genetic counselors.</p>

            <p>Approximately 37% of orphan diseases are due to inborn errors of metabolism,<sup>

               </sup> such as the numerous lysosomal storage disorders. These disorders are usually caused by an absence or deficiency of an enzyme critically involved in the metabolism of an amino acid, carbohydrate, or lipid, leading to detrimental biochemical changes in cells and organs. The introduction of effective drug therapies may result in challenging medical information questions, such as what therapeutic end points determine patient response to treatment, how often laboratory monitoring should be performed after initiating treatment, and when dietary changes should be made in response to treatment. Because these patients usually present with differing durations of illness and disease severity and are undergoing treatment under different clinical circumstances, each of these questions requires a novel or custom response. In many instances, the medical information staff must rely on the expertise of outsourced or collaborative metabolic specialists.</p>

            <title>Pregnancy</title>
            <p>A special challenge facing the treatment of metabolic disorders is pregnancy. For example, untreated women with phenylketonuria (PKU) have high maternal phenylalanine concentrations that are known to be teratogenic. Children born to mothers with untreated PKU may suffer from maternal PKU syndrome characterized by facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, retarded growth, developmental delay, and congenital heart disease.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861511427696">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861511427696">13</xref>
               </sup> Efforts to achieve normal phenylalanine levels during pregnancy in mothers with PKU using dietary restrictions alone have met with only partial success.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861511427696">14</xref>
               </sup> Therapy with an approved orphan drug can lower maternal phenylalanine levels, but its safety during pregnancy has not been established. In such a situation, the medical information staff can provide all the available information to the treating physician, enabling him or her to make an informed decision about the patient’s care. In addition, medical information specialists can notify the drug safety department when drug exposure is known to have occurred in a pregnant patient and facilitate the provision of any required tracking forms to the health care provider. Questions regarding the excretion of orphan drugs in breast milk and the safety of lactation of treated mothers are equally challenging because of the lack of relevant human information.</p>

            <p>Orphan drug companies lacking the resources and infrastructure to establish their own medical information call center must contract with medical information vendors to supply these services on their behalf. Advantages of established call centers include availability to provide verbal and written responses to medical information queries on a 24/7 basis<sup>

Ideally, medical information experts at the vendor level are able to maintain an up-to-date bibliographic information database of published and unpublished literature that is continuously updated. The main challenge with outsourcing medical information services is maintaining a close working partnership between the company and vendor.<sup>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>Drug information call centers using the traditional high-volume, shared resource model use the entire staff to support all company products. These individuals commonly comprise registered health care professionals such as pharmacists and nurses. Using this approach, the staff are very familiar with the standard drug product information found in the FDA-approved prescribing information and prepared responses to frequently asked questions; however, there is less opportunity to gain the depth of knowledge found in the published literature, conference proceedings, postmarketing clinical trial protocols, product dossiers, internal company reports, investigator brochures, and FDA submission documents such as new drug applications. With respect to call center management, the shared resource model is better suited for busy centers with greater emphasis on high productivity while ensuring calls are all answered in a timely manner. This resource model cannot accommodate orphan drug products inquiries, which may take a drug information specialist 30 minutes and sometimes as long as 4 hours to research and complete.</p>
         <p>From an orphan drug perspective, the ideal drug information center uses a carefully trained technical support team using pharmacists with advanced pharmacology or pharmacotherapeutic training who are dedicated to providing drug and disease information for no more than 2 orphan drug products. In this way, dedicated drug information specialists are able to thoroughly familiarize themselves with the clinical and scientific literature and are more readily able to quickly and accurately respond to queries, especially these requiring custom responses for which no standard response exists. Through frequent interactions, these professionals form peer relationships with internal scientific staff, clinical investigators, and other external clinical experts in their field.</p>
         <p>Another aspect of the dedicated drug information system is the ongoing education and staff development by attending relevant specialty medical society meetings, such as the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders (SIMD) and the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM). In many instances, these conferences may constitute the sole source of new information about advances in the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. These dedicated individuals are also involved with the weekly bibliographic search process and are very familiar with all unpublished conference reports; however, difficulties associated with this model may include the use of specialized staff with advanced training in a cost-effective manner.</p>
         <p>A hybrid model has also been proposed in which a lead pharmacist with advanced training manages individuals in a shared call center model.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092861511427696">16</xref>
            </sup> When the staff in the shared model cannot respond to a drug information request in an effective or timely manner, the inquiry is escalated to the dedicated individual for a response. In collaboration with other clinical experts, this dedicated call center individual is also responsible developing the prepared responses for use by front-line drug information specialists. This hybrid model has been described in greater detail elsewhere.<sup>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Challenges faced by the medical information departments of orphan drug companies include fewer but more sophisticated inquiries requiring custom responses based on limited information. Compared to traditional settings, these specialists play a greater role in pharmacovigilance, investigator-initiated clinical studies, clinical trial enrollment, and referral to clinical specialists and patient advocacy groups. As the number of orphan drugs continues to increase, the number of specialized health care professionals with advanced training will need to grow to meet this demand.</p>
