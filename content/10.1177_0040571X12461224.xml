<p>For those who have laboured in the fields of ecotheology, it is now evident that the activity is compelling and necessary, and the fruits are plentiful and varied. The richness and importance of this work cannot be stressed enough, and the fact that it is developing around the world, in vastly different contexts and traditions, is most encouraging. Having worked in this field for over twenty-five years, I have seen much transformation. As we mapped the fields of ecotheology, I was dazzled by the array of discourses, the intense disagreements and the integrity of the participants. We gathered as people to map ecotheology as we develop and experience it, not to define or even refine it.</p>
<p>The impetus to map this field, to pause and consider the multiplicities of themes, approaches, concerns, desires and labourers within what is now a vast field of ecotheologies has five origins. The first is the commitment to an ecologically sustainable future, and the conviction that theology has a role to play. The second is an interest in the expansive nature of ecotheology in its many forms. A third is to consider anew some persistent tensions among ecotheologies. The fourth is a growing awareness of dissimilarities within the field of ecotheologies. The fifth is an increasing interaction with, appreciation of the sustained work, and friendships among, the people involved. These topics constitute my reflection.</p>
<p>While there was some ecotheological activity in the 1970s and 1980s, it was the work of those in religion and ecology that initially tilled the field.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040571X12461224">1</xref></sup> Ecotheology, as a field of research and teaching, came later. I entered this field in the 1980s as a theologian yet through multi-religious approaches. I had studied Thomas Berry and his cosmological proposal and worked extensively on ecofeminism, liberation theologies and social political/justice issues. The bridge between cosmological horizons and justice was not yet built. I attempted this with my dissertation.</p>
<p>As more people entered the field, the differences between, or tensions among the labourers became evident. Conflicts developed: justice versus evolution/cosmology, ecofeminism versus environmental racism, theology versus religious studies, people or animals, poverty or privilege, ethics or aesthetics, theory or praxis, food security or the beauty of the Earth. These ecotheologies were contrasted, but not well understood. With more careful consideration it became evident that there are resolute methodological standpoints and disparate lines of inquiry. The role of the Bible, Christology, doctrines, multiple religions, politics, socio-economic theories, gender and a host of polydoxies were at play. People differed in terms of the primary focus and interplay between theology and ecology. They accentuated retrieval, reinterpretation, recreation or removal from the tradition. Some embraced a Christian apologetics, many were critical. Ecotheology became heterogeneous, and the conflicts were not settled by prioritizing one side.</p>
<p>The second tension became how to develop a research field, and one that desires to make a social impact, with these undeniable differences. One goal of the mapping exercise is to understand in greater depth these dissimilarities, before disputing or rejecting them. From a wider point of view it is readily obvious that there are distinct contexts, traditions, cultures and eco-social locations. These shape so much of our ecotheologies – and indeed all theologies – including our priorities, and how we go about addressing them. I think that Christianity has barely begun to grapple earnestly with this. Although historical and contemporary heterogeneities reign, ‘Christian theology’ tends towards homogony and hegemony under the guise of orthodoxy, tradition, revelation, historicity, doctrines, biblical sources, veracity ordinations and institutions. These tendencies are pervasive, subtle and deeply problematic. Personal or collective truth claims are often no more than a stance, belief, assumption, presupposition, conviction or bias. When uncertainties masquerade as certitudes, truthfulness evaporates. When relative or particular claims assume universality – which is often the case with Christian discourses – questions, creativity and imagination are stifled. In my view, these are obstacles to perceptive comprehension among and within Christian discourses. They further limit the profound vitalities of religious sensibilities. Many theologians suffer from certitudes. Or we do not reveal the interactions among our claims, epistemologies and uncertainties.</p>
<p>The tensions between essential differences are not sufficiently resolved by appealing to contexts, cultures and traditions. They are not resolved by an anti-foundationalist postmodern view, given that much (eco)theology desires secure foundations. There is no resolution with right/wrong, orthodoxy/heresy assessments. Personalist stances do not illuminate or settle the issues. What is most unsatisfying is the abdication of evaluation resulting from the various postmodern challenges, and the incessant reminder that ‘all reality is socially constructed’. While I agree fully that we do indeed construct our world-views that mediate aspects of ‘reality’, this cannot be the final word. All social constructions, including ecotheology, are not judicious. All views are not equally valid, well reasoned and persuasive. Horizons of analysis and meaning claims are not the same, extrapolations vary, and each has considerably dissimilar after effects. Biases, while omnipresent, have different consequences. Accepting differences as just that – different – prevents assessments (factual, historical, ethical, prejudicial). To endorse a category of difference on the grounds of affirming diversity limits understanding and reduces the effectiveness of ecotheological endeavours. For example, if the eco-affluent are only concerned with wilderness and protecting their lifestyles, this can be assessed as morally deplorable. But, to be distressed by animal extinctions, or animal habitat and rights, does not mean that one cares less about people. Most of us can develop genuine understanding of, and be effective on only a few issues over a lifetime.</p>
<p>As I have learned more about the historical breadth, particular insights and overall nature of ‘religions’, it seems to me that theology suffers from undeveloped theories of religion. Because, in general, Christian theology does not consider the histories, complexities and multiplicities of religions within its theological horizons, it has not addressed the contested realm and definitions of ‘religion’. There are endless repercussions. For example, there is an insufficient awareness of the vast histories, diversities and insights of the many religions that have come and gone in the world. There is an absence of understanding of the dialectics between religions and cultures, or theology and science. Not enough attention is paid to religious epistemologies, or of the fluidity of symbols, imagination, particular experiences, what constitutes revelation, or of personality structures and specific theological scaffolding. Considering theories of religion would not dispel the dissimilarities, but it may improve illumination. It may go far to soften the rigidity and certainty of theological claims. This would not be appealing to some, but that is not a good enough reason to stop there. We need to understand theology within the larger phenomena of religion(s), and religious anthropologies, imagination, consciousness, sensibilities and spiritualties.</p>
<p>In years of discussions of ecotheology and in particular the activity of mapping the field, it became evident that mapping the variations is one task. Understanding them is another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040571X12461224">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>A third topic is what happens when people with diverse, even conflicting, views begin to cross paths and even work together. Most people who work in ecotheology care profoundly about what is happening to the Earth. Many of us have dedicated our lives to finding some adequate and effective responses. It is one thing to challenge and criticize in print, and another in person, especially when the commitment to Earth healing is evident.</p>
<p>Over the years I tired of the ‘discourse discords’, and I met people with whom I had significant disagreements, yet very much appreciated and respected the person. For example, some ecotheologians (like myself) interpret that because humans share 98.7 per cent of their DNA genome with Bonobos, we are in continuity with other primates and by extension the natural world. Others interpret this to mean that the genome is utterly useless in interpreting the human place within the natural world because of the extreme differences between humans and Bonobos. How does one account for opposite interpretations of the same facts?</p>
<p>This may seem banal, but the more I probe theological depths, the more I appreciate the particularity of each person’s understanding. I grapple with the variations, even those with which I disagree, through this lens. As one refines and narrows the interpretative parameters from culture, context and tradition to the person, what comes into focus is a range of topics rarely taken seriously. These are about the person who is doing ecotheology. It is increasingly clear that variances are related to a host of distinctions: impetus for the topic, starting points for inquiry into ecotheology, types of questions, particular or general concerns, dialogue partners, intellectual horizons and goals. What is the overriding priority? Another dimension quickly comes into focus: that of presuppositions. These are incalculable and are playing non-stop in the background: religious, ontological, metaphysical; roles and responsibilities of the human in the scheme of things; the meaning and purpose of Christianity in all its components; the extent and schemas of potential and actual knowledge etc. These are mixed with experiences and motivations that radically differ. Furthermore, we employ distinctive forms of persuasion: history, tradition, principles, values, aesthetics and/or consequences. And all may work on ethics and justice. Convictions vary. In addition to noting with and for whom one is working, people and their identities are differently embedded within their Christian matrix. Individuals have propensities that diverge: rituals, political action, teaching, institutional change, reform, revolution, and on and on. All of this is hidden in the work of ecotheology. The last hidden dimension is within the complexity of language and linguistics, with imaginations, desires, what provides a zest for this work and what one loves.</p>
<p>People, and ecotheologians, are indisputably different and animated by a distinct nexus of realities. For some, questions of ethics and justice dominate and for others the commitment to the tradition is crucial. For some, the elegance, beauty and evolutionary dynamics of the Earth community are foundational. For others it is the particular community that supersedes. Thus, there is no ‘religion’, Christianity or ecotheology outside the myriad historical forms, and the experiences and interpretations of adherents. The variations are limitless. We must find ways to be transparent with our person and our work. The stakes are too high and the concerns crucial.</p>
<p>In conclusion, ecotheology is becoming influential within Christian communities. It helps to keep in mind that, whatever theological enterprise is undertaken, it is in response to a particular rather than a universal question, in spite of comprehensive declarations. I take to heart that all theology is autobiographical (Frederick Buechner). And I appreciate the diversity and sincerity of the enlarging communities of ecotheologians.</p>

<fn id="fn1-0040571X12461224"><label>1</label><p>Before there were consistent publications and discussions on ecology and theology, there had already been a decade of publications on religion and ecology. It is also true that John Cobb, Paul Santmire, Jürgen Moltmann, Rosemary Radford Reuther and a few others had already signaled a concern for ecological ruin and theological topics. But it had not been addressed consistently by anyone, other than Thomas Berry. Although trained as a theologian, he was less interested in theology than religion and ecology. What became the Forum on Religion and Ecology, directed by Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim, now at Yale University, must be credited with stimulating and supporting a great deal of early and ongoing work at this intersection of religions and ecology.
