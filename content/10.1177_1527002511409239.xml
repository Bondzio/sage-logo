<abstract>
<p>Despite the financial and cultural importance of intercollegiate athletics in the United States, there is a paucity of research into how athletic scholarships are awarded. In this article, the authors empirically examine the factors that universities use in their decision to offer athletic scholarships to high school football players. Using a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) model, the authors find a player’s weight, height, body mass index (BMI), race, speed, on-the-field performance, and his high school team’s success often have large and significant impacts on the number of scholarship offers he receives. There is also evidence of a negative relationship between academic performance and scholarship offers. In addition, the authors find evidence of a scholarship premium for players from Florida and Texas. The results also show that running backs, wide receivers, and defensive backs appear to generate the most attention from college football coaches, other things equal.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Attendance at National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football games exceeded 48 million in 2009. Over 37 million of these fans attended games involving the top 120 Football Bowl Series (FBS) teams, with 4 schools averaging over 100,000 fans per home game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527002511409239">National Collegiate Athletic Association [NCAA], 2010a</xref>). This gate revenue, together with sponsorships and television contracts, has propelled gross revenues over $50 million for some football programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527002511409239">Indianapolis Star, 2005</xref>). Given ever larger television contracts, stadium expansions, and increases in ticket prices, these figures are likely to increase in coming years. For some high school athletes, a scholarship offer at one of these elite football programs is a path toward a lucrative professional career; for others it represents an opportunity to earn a valuable college degree they would not otherwise have. Yet despite its financial and cultural importance in the United States, there is a paucity of research into how the college football labor market operates.</p>
<p>Formally, the college football recruiting process is characterized by four intermittent periods officially referred to by the NCAA as the quiet, contact, evaluation, and dead periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527002511409239">NCAA, 2010b</xref>). The four periods differ in the amount of access college coaches have to potential players, or <italic>recruits</italic>. In dead periods, coaches can only write and telephone recruits. During quiet periods, players may visit college campuses, but coaches are not allowed to visit recruits off-campus. During evaluation periods coaches may not have off-campus contact with recruits, but they are allowed to visit a player’s high school to watch him play and, perhaps, gather other background information from high school coaches and administrators, such as the player’s academic performance, work ethic, or citizenship. Coaches have the greatest degree of access to recruits during contact periods—the only period in which coaches are allowed to have off-campus interaction with recruits.</p>
<p>Universities are allowed some discretion in structuring their recruiting calendars. NCAA Bylaw 13.17 notes that the months from August to November are considered a quiet period; however, universities are allowed 42 evaluation days during this period to be chosen at their own discretion. During this discretionary evaluation period, coaches are allowed one visit to a player’s high school. It is generally during this evaluation period that coaches form their opinion of a recruit’s potential to be a successful student-athlete and decide whether or not to offer the player a scholarship to attend their university. This scholarship offer is, of course, contingent on the student qualifying academically for admission to the university.</p>
<p>The months of December and January are primarily contact periods, although there are short, intermittent dead and quiet periods during this time as well. Some scholarship offers are made during this contact period, but it is mostly a time in which coaches attempt to convince players they have already offered a scholarship to attend their university. At any point during the recruiting process, an athlete can convey to a coach that they are committed to attending their university. However, such verbal commitments are nonbinding and neither the player nor the university is required to honor the commitment. For most players, the recruiting process culminates in National Signing Day on the first Wednesday in February. At this time, recruits usually sign a letter of intent stating their plans to attend a specific university. This binding agreement between the university and the player marks the end of the recruiting process and other universities are no longer allowed to contact the recruit.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527002511409239">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527002511409239">Dumond, Lynch, and Platania (2008)</xref>, the entire college football recruiting process can be divided into two distinct stages. In the first stage, coaches select which players among thousands of high school athletes to offer scholarships. In the second stage, recruits select the school they wish to attend from their pool of scholarship offers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527002511409239">Dumond et al. (2008)</xref> focus on the second stage of the recruiting process. Using data from the Rivals.com recruiting website, the same data set used in the present study, the authors identify a number of factors that affect a recruit’s decision to attend a particular school, including the academic reputation of the institution, the quality of the football program, and the location of the university. Players are more likely to select athletically elite Bowl Championship Series (BCS) schools over otherwise equivalent non-BCS schools and more likely to choose schools with relatively new stadiums with large seating capacities. They are also more likely to choose a university within close proximity to their high school; however, this effect diminishes as distance increases. In this article, we investigate the first stage of the recruiting process, examining the factors that coaches and administrators use in their decision to offer athletic scholarships to high school football players. Hence, it can be seen as a companion to the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527002511409239">Dumond et al. (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>In many ways, the process by which highly selective universities recruit top athletes is similar to the way they seek to attract top students to the general student body; the decision to offer admission and/or academic scholarship is related to a vector of demographic and performance variables. This is particularly true at athletically elite BCS universities where there is stout competition for scholarship offers. While opinions based on anecdotal evidence are plentiful, there is little empirical work relating an individual’s athletic performance and physical attributes to the amount of interest the player generates from athletically elite universities. Therefore, the benefit of additional production in the weight room, in the classroom, and on the field in terms of increased attention from college coaches and scouts is currently unknown.</p>
<p>According to NCAA rules and regulations, BCS schools are allotted 85 scholarships per academic year with an imposed constraint of 25 scholarships per recruiting class.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527002511409239">2</xref>
</sup> Approximately 65 scholarship slots are filled by returning players, which leaves about 20 open scholarships to be offered to high school seniors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527002511409239">3</xref>
</sup> Considering that there are 66 schools in the BCS, approximately 1,320 scholarships are available each year for the many high school seniors who would like to play for a BCS university. Thus, obtaining a scholarship offer from a BCS university is a remarkably difficult undertaking that only a few high school seniors will achieve.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1527002511409239">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>USA Football, the Official Youth Football Development partner of the National Football League (NFL) and NFL Player’s Association, suggests that speed and strength are the primary factors distinguishing top college athletes from those in lower divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527002511409239">USA Football, 2001</xref>). Only the fastest and strongest players will garner attention from BCS universities, while those players with substantial talent but lacking in the categories of speed and strength may gain consideration from non-BCS FBS universities. In addition to speed and strength, coaches look for players with good “field sense” or the ability to understand strategic or tactical aspects of the game. The experts at USA Football note that while a player may not be exceptional in all three aspects, it is critical to be extraordinary in at least one area. For example, a player lacking in field sense may be able to overcome this deficiency with exceptional speed or strength. Other factors that college coaches may take into account when scouting high school football players include academic ability, performance on the field, character, and physical attributes such as height and weight.</p>
<p>In this research, we seek to empirically quantify the factors that coaches and administrators use in making their decisions regarding athletic scholarship offers. We proceed as follows. First, we describe the econometric techniques used to analyze the number of scholarship offers players receive and detail the data used, then we report our empirical results and state our main conclusions.</p>

<title>Econometric Model</title>
<p>In this article, we focus on the first stage of the recruiting process, modeling the number of scholarship offers a player receives from BCS universities using a Zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) model, introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527002511409239">Greene (1994)</xref>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1527002511409239">5</xref>
</sup> In a zero-inflated model, the dependent variable can be thought of as being subject to two processes. In the first process, a player is selected into a group, A, that may receive a scholarship offer, or into a group, B, that will not. In the second process, a vector of demographic attributes and performance measures determines the number of scholarship offers the player will receive.

<p>Often the ZINB model is used when the sample consists of two distinct groups and the process used to generate zero observations differs from the process used to generate nonzero observations. This does not seem to be applicable to our data as all players, whether they receive multiple scholarship offers or none, are likely evaluated on the same criteria. Thus, we use the same independent variables in estimating whether a player receives a scholarship offer or not and the number of offers received.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The data for this study were collected from the Rivals.com website. Among other services offered by Rivals, the website provides various data on high school football players who have generated interest from college coaches and scouts. A detailed search was performed on the Rivals database for all individuals in the 2008 graduating class. For each player, we identified the BCS schools that offered them a football scholarship and collected data on four physical attributes (height, weight, 40-yard dash time, and race) and four characteristics of their high school (high school size, the number of wins the team earned, whether the school is public or private, and the state where the school is located). We also collected data on the player’s high school position as well as performance statistics relevant to their position. Lastly, we were also able to obtain a player’s grade point average (GPA) and ACT score in some cases. Definitions of the variables used are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511409239">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>In addition to including a player’s height, weight, speed, and race as explanatory variables in our model, we create a body mass index (BMI) variable to account for the effect of any interaction between height and weight on the number of scholarship offers a player receives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1527002511409239">6</xref>
</sup> In addition, we create a performance index for each player based on his individual statistics normalized against the top performer at his position. Hence, the performance index ranges from 0 to 1 for all players depending on how they compared to the most prolific player at their position.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1527002511409239">7</xref>
</sup> Finally, we group players into five positional categories—quarterbacks, running backs, perimeter players (wide receivers and defensive backs), semi-skilled players (linebackers, fullbacks, and tight ends), and linemen (offensive and defensive linemen).</p>
<p>While the rationale for including the player’s physical attributes and performance statistics is straightforward, the reason for including characteristics of their high school in the model is more complex. From one perspective, if the market for players is efficient, scouts will find quality players wherever they exist regardless of the size of their school, the state in which it is located, the number of wins the team achieves, or whether it is a public or private institution. However, there are several plausible explanations why these variables may be significant in determining the number of scholarship offers a player receives. Athletic consultants and recruiters emphasize the importance of garnering coaches' attention through press clippings, sports camps, and even personal marketers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527002511409239">Armstrong, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527002511409239">Mazonni, 2000</xref>). Players from relatively large high schools therefore may receive extra attention from recruiters due to an advantage in resources and local media exposure. Those individuals playing in larger classifications also compete against stronger competition, on average, which may make their successes more noteworthy than players in smaller classifications competing against lesser opponents. For instance, no quarterback from a town of fewer than 1,400, and few from towns of less than 10,000, started at BCS universities in 2010, despite the fact that many such players accumulated impressive statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527002511409239">Borzi, 2010</xref>). To account for these possible effects, we include the enrollment at a player’s high school as an explanatory variable in our analysis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1527002511409239">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Similarly, successful high school programs may also receive relatively more attention from the press and hence recruiters, scouts, and college coaches. Furthermore, wins by a player’s team may also be a measure of latent talent for an individual player, since a star performer is likely to improve the winning percentage of the team. We therefore include the number of wins achieved by a player’s team in the model.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1527002511409239">9</xref>
</sup> We also account for whether the player attended a public or private high school to test whether there are any differences in scholarship offers received by players at these institutions. Many private high schools recruit the best local players for their athletic programs and even offer athletic scholarships. In some regions, this practice may skew the talent pool in favor of private schools. Finally, many coaches and recruiting agencies emphasize the importance of recruiting in the perceived talent-rich states of Texas, Florida, and California—all net exporters of high school football players. We therefore include dummy variables for players whose high school is located in one of these states. We also include a dummy variable for players from other states with BCS schools. The omitted category in our analysis is states without a BCS team.</p>
<p>Lastly, we employ a player’s GPA and ACT score as proxies for field sense.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1527002511409239">10</xref>
</sup> If physical attributes, skill, and other factors were held constant, it would be reasonable to assume that a player who has demonstrated success in the classroom would be preferred by coaches to one that has struggled in the classroom. For instance, these players may be better able to grasp more complex strategies, tactics, and game plans. In other words, players with high GPAs and ACT scores may have greater field sense and, thus, attract more scholarship offers from coaches, all else equal.</p>
<p>The descriptive statistics of the data, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511409239">Table 2</xref>, reveal some interesting patterns. Semi-skilled players and linemen tend to have larger BMIs while running backs and perimeter players tend to have faster 40-yard dash times. These differences imply that a given attribute may affect the number of scholarship offers an athlete receives differently depending on his position. Also, it appears that perimeter players receive more scholarship offers than players at other positions, on average. However, perhaps the greatest revelation contained in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511409239">Table 2</xref> is the substantial racial variation in the data. African American players receive almost twice as many scholarship offers as non-African American players, on average. Furthermore, these descriptive statistics provide ample evidence of racial position segregation. Specifically, non-African American players are concentrated in the quarterback, semi-skilled, and linemen positions, and African American players are concentrated in the running back and perimeter positions. These statistics are consistent with other studies, which suggests that African American players are placed in positions that require extensive physical abilities and White players are placed in positions that require relatively less physical abilities and more leadership skills (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527002511409239">Eitzen &amp; Sanford, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527002511409239">Lewis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527002511409239">Loy &amp; McElvogue, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527002511409239">Schneider &amp; Eitzen, 1986</xref>). This phenomenon is often attributed to racial discrimination; however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527002511409239">McPherson (1975)</xref> suggests that it is due to self-segregation. In other words, racial discrimination initially led to such position segregation, but today it is more likely the result of African American youths selecting positions traditionally dominated by African American players. Thus, they invest their time and effort into being running backs, for example, rather than linebackers.</p>

<sup>a</sup> Observations on GPA, ACT, and RATING are not available for the entire sample. Thus, the descriptive statistics shown here represent the averages and standard deviations of those three variables for which observations on the variables were available within a given sample. For example, the average GPA shown for the African American subsample represents the average GPA for those 265 African Americans that reported their GPA, not the average GPA for all 642 African Americans in the sample.</p>

<p>In total, we were able to collect 1,162 complete player profiles of the 3,112 high school players in the 2008 Rivals.com database, We observe scholarship offers for all recruits in the database; however, one or more other variables such as race or 40-yard dash time are unknown for others. This data limitation gives rise to the possibility of a sample selection bias in our data—those with complete profiles may be fundamentally different from the population as a whole. However, we find no statistical difference in the proportion of individuals that receive BCS scholarship offers between our sample and the general Rivals.com population. While certainly not conclusive, this evidence suggests that the overall quality of player in our sample is very similar to that of the Rivals.com population as a whole. We infer that any sample selection within our data set does not seriously compromise our results. However, the number of high school athletes with scholarship aspirations far exceeds both our sample and the Rivals.com data set. Therefore, we must express a caveat that our results apply only to the very top players and may or may not be generalized to the population of high school football players as a whole.</p>

<p>The estimates for the ZINB model are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1527002511409239">Table 3</xref>. The first column reports the results of the entire sample of 1,162 players. We separate the sample into subgroups based on race, to investigate whether there are any distinct patterns across racial groups, and position, to examine if different types of players are evaluated differently. Columns 2 and 3 show the results for African American and non-African American subgroups, respectively, and columns 4-8 display our results by position. To determine the impact of a one unit change in the independent variables on the number of scholarship offers received, we calculate the marginal effects for each model.

<p>Interpreting the marginal effects table for the full sample, we find that all of a player’s physical attributes are important in determining the number of scholarship offers they receive from BCS universities. Evaluated at the mean height for the full sample, the marginal effect of weight is 0.015.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1527002511409239">11</xref>
</sup> Thus, other things equal, an additional 10 pounds in weight equates to 0.15 additional scholarship offers from BCS universities. Evaluated at the mean height and weight for the full sample, the marginal effect of height is 0.604. Thus, other things equal, an additional inch in height equates to 0.604 additional scholarship offers from BCS universities. Hence, it can be concluded that, all else equal, a player’s height is more important than their weight in determining the amount of interest they generate from BCS college football coaches. This result is intuitively reasonable as height is constrained by physiology while weight can be altered somewhat by diet and time in the weight room. The negative sign on the BMI variable in the full sample is consistent with this conclusion—a one unit increase in the variable is associated with 1.5 fewer scholarship offers.</p>
<p>There is little racial difference in the effect of weight on scholarship offers, and height is an insignificant determinant of scholarship offers in both the African American and the non-African American subsamples. With the exception of offensive and defensive linemen, the height, weight, and BMI variables also do a poor job of separating the most sought after players at each position from those receiving little attention at the same position. However, our model does predict that height is a significant determinant of scholarship offers for linemen. Compared to a linemen of average weight and height, an additional inch in height leads to about one more scholarship offer from a BCS university.</p>
<p>The results also indicate that speed is valued in all players. Once again, there is little racial difference in how this physical attribute affects scholarship offers; however, there is much disparity in its importance among the various positions. Speed has the largest impact on scholarship offers received for running backs. A one tenth of a second improvement in a running back’s 40-yard dash time leads to about 1.1 additional scholarship offers received, all else equal. Surprisingly, speed appears to have a larger impact on scholarship offers for semi-skilled players than perimeter players. A one tenth of a second improvement in a semi-skilled player’s 40-yard dash time leads to about 0.72 additional scholarship offers, whereas a one tenth of a second improvement in a perimeter player’s 40-yard dash time leads to about 0.54 additional scholarship offers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511409239">Table 2</xref> indicates that perimeter players in our sample are faster than semi-skilled players on average and there is less variability in their 40-yard dash times. Hence, it appears that the 40-yard dash time provides a better sorting mechanism for semi-skilled players than perimeter players. That is, a fast time in the 40-yard dash separates superior semi-skilled players from inferior semi-skilled players better than a fast time in the 40-yard dash separates superior perimeter players from inferior perimeter players. Speed is also important for quarterbacks and linemen, although the impact appears smaller for these players. A one tenth of a second improvement in 40-yard dash time leads to 0.32 and 0.29 additional scholarship offers for quarterbacks and linemen, respectively.</p>
<p>Turning to the race dummy variable, the results for the full sample reveal that African Americans receive significantly more scholarship offers than otherwise equal non-African Americans. In the full sample, African American players receive approximately 1.5 more scholarship offers from BCS universities than non-African American players. Decomposing these results further reveals that among quarterbacks, wide receivers and defensive backs, and offensive and defensive linemen, African Americans also receive significantly more scholarship offers than comparable non-African Americans. Despite the fact that African American players are much less likely to be quarterbacks—perhaps owing to racial position segregation—African American high school quarterbacks receive about 1.5 more scholarship offers from BCS universities than otherwise similar non-African American quarterbacks. Similarly, African American wide receivers and defensive backs receive about 3.5 more scholarship offers, and African American linemen receive about 1.6 more scholarship offers than their non-African American counterparts. Even though non-African American players are much less likely to be running backs—again potentially due to racial position segregation—they do not appear to be evaluated any differently by college coaches from African American running backs with equal credentials. The same is true for linebackers, fullbacks, and tight ends.</p>
<p>There are a wide range of potential explanations for the instances where African American players appear to be more sought after by college coaches than non-African American players. It may indicate that race is proxying for a latent talent variable—a possibility that we explore later. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527002511409239">Entine (2000)</xref> believes that African Americans have superior athletic genes to those of whites. Another, less controversial, explanation is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527002511409239">Hoberman (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511409239">Leeds (2003</xref>) who suggest that African Americans invest highly (or overinvest) in athletic capital due to past racial discrimination and the observed success of African Americans in the sports labor market. Another potential explanation is statistical discrimination. If recruiters perceive African American players to be more productive or less risky, on average, then the distribution of scholarship offers will reflect these beliefs. If statistical discrimination does exist, it appears to affect perceptions regarding wide receivers and defensive backs the greatest.</p>
<p>With regard to the high school characteristics, we find that players from California do not receive more scholarship offers than similar players from non-BCS states, regardless of their race and position. The same is true for players from BCS states other than the big three with the only exception being that perimeter players from BCS states receive about 2.5 more scholarship offers than perimeter players from non-BCS states. However, overall we find that players from Florida and Texas receive about 1.9 and 1.1 more scholarship offers, respectively, than players from states without BCS teams. The advantage of being from Florida and Texas in terms of scholarship offers appears to hold for both the African American and the perimeter player subsamples, but these results do not appear to hold for the non-African American subsample nor any other position subsample. This result seems to imply that wide receivers and defensive backs from Florida and Texas are highly sought after.</p>
<p>The size of the high school a player attends is an insignificant determinant of the number of scholarship offers he receives from BCS universities. The type of high school attended, public or private, is significant only for the full sample of observations. For the full sample, players attending public schools receive about 0.6 fewer scholarship offers than players attending private schools. This result may indicate a slight advantage in resources for players attending private schools. It may also reflect the fact that many private high schools are able to recruit players and offer athletic scholarships themselves. In general, the lack of significance for the school characteristic variables perhaps indicates that top players are effectively identified by scouts and coaches, regardless of where they play. In that sense, it appears that the market for top talent is fairly efficient.</p>
<p>Our results, however, show that winning games in high school may bring marginal attention to a recruit and hence lead to additional scholarship offers. The marginal effect of the number of wins achieved by a player’s high school football team is significant in the full model, the African American model, and the perimeter player model. The marginal effect ranges from 0.11 in the full model to 0.21 in the perimeter player model, meaning 10 additional wins generates between 1.1 and 2.1 more scholarship offers. Of course, care must be taken in interpreting this variable as it could be proxying for latent talent. For example, a talented perimeter player may increase the team’s victory total significantly. It is possible, in this case, that unobserved talent leads to more victories <italic>and</italic> more scholarship offers.</p>
<p>For the full sample, we find that players in every position category receive significantly more scholarship offers than otherwise similar players in the linemen position category. Perimeter players and running backs appear to generate the most interest from BCS college football coaches as these players receive about 2.4 more scholarship offers than linemen, after adjusting for player and high school attributes. The scholarship premium for quarterbacks and those players in semi-skilled positions is about 1.3 and 1.0, respectively. A similar hierarchy of scholarship offers holds true for African American players; however, quarterbacks and semi-skilled players do not receive significantly more scholarship offers than linemen. For the non-African American subsample, we obtain a somewhat surprising result regarding potential position premiums. Although, as previously noted, non-African American running backs are relatively scarce, those that do play the position appear to receive more scholarship offers than their counterparts at other positions. According to our results, non-African American running backs receive about 2.2 more scholarship offers than comparable non-African American linemen. Also, non-African American players in semi-skilled positions receive a scholarship premium of about 1.3 offers over their linemen counterparts. These results are generally consistent with coaches recruiting lineman more locally, but branching out for talent in the more skilled positions.</p>
<p>Our findings also show that on-the-field accomplishments (or performance in the weight room in the case of linemen and linebackers) are an important determinant of scholarship offers. We find the marginal effect of the performance index described previously to be significant at least at the 10% level in every model except the model for perimeter players. Thus, almost without exception, performance on the field in high school is important. Essentially, the index compares the top performing players at each position in the sample to all other players at the same position. For example, using the estimated marginal effects for the running back subsample, the running back that gained the most rushing yards in his junior season of high school is expected to receive about 2.88 more scholarship offers than an otherwise equal running back who gained half as many rushing yards [5.75 × (1 − 0.5)]. The marginal effect of the performance index is slightly larger for the African American sample than for the non-African American sample. This result seems to imply that on-the-field performance is a more important signal for African Americans. Also, performance on the field or in the weight room appears to be more important for linemen and running backs than quarterbacks and semi-skilled players. As for wide receivers and defensive backs, it may be that college coaches do not consider their performance on the field in high school a reliable indicator of their potential for success on the college field. One possible explanation for wide receivers is that high school offensive schemes are much less complex than college offensive schemes and may tend to be more run oriented as a result. Thus, a high school wide receiver with the necessary ability to compete at a BCS university may gain few receiving yards in high school because his school's offense was more focused on running than passing, perhaps out of necessity. Furthermore, a wide receiver’s production in high school may also be limited by the ability of his high school quarterback. Similarly, performance on the field may be a poor indicator of potential for high school defensive backs if opposing offenses avoiding throwing the football in the vicinity of a highly talented player, thus limiting his number of interceptions—our proxy for performance among such players. Our results also suggest that wins are perhaps a better measure of talent among perimeter players than on-the-field statistics.</p>
<p>To investigate the impact of field sense on the number of scholarship offers a player receives, we estimated two models. One model estimates scholarship offers as a function of GPA, and the other estimates scholarship offers as a function of the player’s ACT score. The marginal effects for each of these models are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1527002511409239">Table 5</xref>. Since only a small portion of players reported their GPA or ACT score, we do not decompose these samples by position or race.</p>

<p>Before discussing the impacts of GPA and ACT scores on scholarship offers, there is another interesting result found in columns 1 and 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1527002511409239">Table 5</xref>. Among those players who reported GPA, African Americans receive about 2.2 more scholarship offers than non-African Americans. Among those players who reported their ACT score, the scholarship premium for African American players is only about 1.6, which is similar to the African American scholarship premium of 1.5 found for the full sample of 1,162 observations. Whereas the ACT subsample contains players with ACT scores below NCAA minimum eligibility requirements, the GPA subsample consists of only players with a GPA of 2.0 or higher, which is the minimum GPA needed for initial eligibility according to NCAA Proposition 48. This suggests that for those players who have met initial eligibility requirements, in terms of GPA, the scholarship premium for African American players is even larger than in samples that may include players with GPAs below initial eligibility requirements. This may mean that African American players are even more sought after by BCS coaches than our previous models suggest, but eligibility issues detract from the number of scholarship offers received by many African American players.</p>
<p>As for the impact of a player’s GPA on the number of scholarship offers he receives, we find the marginal effect to be negative, but insignificant. However, the marginal effect of a player’s ACT score is found to be both negative and significant. According to our estimates, a one point increase in a player’s ACT score results in him receiving 0.15 fewer scholarship offers, other things equal. Thus, it appears that both a player’s GPA and his ACT score may be poor proxies for field sense. Intuitively, one might expect such a result since intellectual aptitude does not translate perfectly to the playing field. That is, knowledge of a given academic subject may not aid a player in understanding strategies and tactics on the field of play.</p>
<p>Our results do, however, support the notion of a trade-off between athletics and academics—devoting additional time to academics takes time away from athletics. This view is further supported by the fact that players in the ACT subsample with an ACT score less than or equal to 18 received an average of 3.38 scholarship offers from BCS universities, whereas the average player with an ACT score greater than 18 received only 2.45 scholarship offers. Thus, academic measures like GPA and ACT scores may be better proxies for athletic commitment than field sense. If a player’s GPA and ACT score is a measure of his commitment to academics and being more committed to academics means being less committed to athletics, then it seems reasonable that players with higher GPAs and ACT scores would receive fewer scholarship offers from BCS coaches that have much more riding on success on the football field than success in the classroom.</p>
<p>We now turn our attention to the results presented in column 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1527002511409239">Table 5</xref>. These results represent an effort to account for the impact of latent talent on the number of scholarship offers received by a player. Rivals assigns a rating to many players in their database, which, according to the website, is an indicator of the impact the player is expected to make in college.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1527002511409239">12</xref>
</sup> We use this variable as a measure of player talent and estimate the following ordinary least squares regression equation.<sup>

</disp-formula>We then employ the residuals from this regression as a measure of latent talent—the impact of unobservable variables on a player’s rating. For the most part, the marginal effects for this ZINB model are similar to the marginal effects for the full model presented in column 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1527002511409239">Table 4</xref>. However, the results for two variables, race and wins, are actually quite different. We find that the number of wins achieved by a player’s high school football team no longer has a significant impact on the number of scholarship offers he receives. Also, the magnitude of the marginal effect of wins decreases significantly with the latent talent measure included in the model. Even more interesting is the reduction in the scholarship premium for African American players when the latent talent measured is included. The marginal effect is still significant at the 10% level, but African American players only receive about 0.5 more scholarship offers than similar non-African American players after accounting for latent talent. This seems to suggest that race is indeed a proxy for latent talent. If our method sufficiently controls for those potential impacts suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527002511409239">Entine (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527002511409239">Hoberman (1997)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511409239">Leeds (2003</xref>), the remaining advantage accrued to African American players in the college football recruiting market may reflect statistical discrimination and coaches' perceptions about player talent and race.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Little research has investigated how the college football labor market operates. In the first stage of the college football recruiting process, universities select which players to offer scholarships, and in the second stage recruits select the school they wish to attend from their pool of scholarship offers. One previous study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527002511409239">Dumond et al. (2008)</xref>, attempts to predict which university a high school football recruit will choose to attend from their pool of scholarship offers. In this article, we examine the factors used by coaches in their decision to offer a player a scholarship.</p>
<p>Using the ZINB model pioneered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527002511409239">Greene (1994)</xref>, we find that measures of athletic ability, including height, weight, BMI, 40-yard dash time, and on-the-field performance, are often significant determinants of the number of scholarship offers a player receives. Speed was found to matter the most for running backs. We also find evidence that players, particularly wide receivers and defensive backs, from the states of Florida and Texas may receive a scholarship premium over similar players from other states.</p>
<p>We also find significant evidence that, other things equal, African Americans receive more scholarship offers from BCS universities than non-African Americans. This pattern may be the result of high levels of investment in athletic skills by African Americans males due to previous and current racial discrimination in nonathletic-related labor markets, as theorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511409239">Leeds (2003)</xref>. Another potential explanation is statistical discrimination, whereby, college coaches and scouts perceive African American players to be more productive or less risky, on average, than non-African American players and are therefore more likely to offer them a scholarship. We find that controlling for latent talent reduces the scholarship premium received by African American players, which suggests that race is a proxy for latent talent. However, controlling for latent talent does not completely eliminate the African American scholarship premium, which indicates that coaches' perceptions may indeed affect the distribution of scholarship offers.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics of the data also show much evidence of racial position segregation. Most noticeably, top-flight non-African American players are almost three times more likely than similar African American players to play quarterback and almost twice as likely to play offensive or defensive linemen. Similarly, talented African American players are almost four times more likely than non-African American players to play running back and almost three times more likely to play wide receiver or defensive back.</p>
<p>Finally, we find that a player’s academic ability, as measured by his GPA or ACT score, is a poor measure of field sense. However, we do find evidence of an inverse relationship between academic ability and scholarship offers. Players with higher GPAs and ACT scores appear to receive fewer scholarship offers from BCS universities than players with lower GPAs and ACT scores. We interpret this to mean that such academic measures may be proxying for a player’s relative commitment to athletics. That is, players with relatively low GPAs and ACT scores may be relatively more committed to athletic success and, thus, receive more scholarship offers from coaches. We conclude that, given the low probability of acquiring an academic scholarship or financial aid and the restricted financial means of many players, it may be a rational decision for top-quality student-athletes to concentrate only on achieving the minimum academic requirements and devoting additional time to honing their athletic skills.</p>

<p>Unless they graduate early from high school, recruits are required to wait until National Signing Day to sign a letter of intent. While most recruits sign a letter of intent on National Signing Day, the actual signing period continues for about 2 months. Players are technically not required to sign a letter of intent, but most top players do as it guarantees them a 1-year athletic scholarship.</p>

<p>These stipulations apply to every Division I university. In some cases, universities are allowed to count scholarships against a previous subsequent years' allotment, which would allow them to obtain a recruiting class exceeding 25 recruits in a given year.</p>

<p>Players not offered athletic scholarships at universities they would like to attend may, in some cases, be offered tryouts at their preferred universities. If accepted, these players become non-scholarship “walk-ons.” In some cases, these players go on to earn athletic scholarships. However, such “walk-ons” make up a very small portion of scholarship athletes and are therefore not factored into the analysis we conduct in this article.</p>

<p>Since scholarship offers is a count variable we investigate four count data models: Poisson, Negative Binomial, Zero-inflated Poisson, and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB). After testing for overdispersion and zero-inflation, we find the ZINB model to be preferred. The standard Poisson model is characterized by <italic>equidispersion</italic>, meaning the conditional variance of the dependent variable equals the conditional mean. The Negative Binomial model introduces latent heterogeneity into the conditional mean of the Poisson model and thus allows for <italic>overdispersion</italic>, where the variance exceeds the mean. Using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527002511409239">Cameron and Trivedi (1990)</xref> test, we find overdispersion in the data and thus reject the Poisson model. We also find that both the Poisson and the Negative Binomial models suffer from zero-inflation. Of the 1,162 individuals in our data set, 613 did not receive a single scholarship offer from a BCS university. For our full sample, we find that the standard Poisson model, for example, predicts only 365 players receiving less than one scholarship offer. Thus, there is a substantially higher proportion of zeros in our data set than would be predicted by the Poisson distribution, indicating our data set suffers from zero inflation. Finally, using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527002511409239">Vuong (1989)</xref> test statistic for non-nested models, we determine the ZINB model is preferred to the Zero-inflated Poisson model.

<p>The BMI variable is calculated in the standard manner—[(Weight × 703)/Height<sup>2</sup>], where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches.</p>

<p>The performance index is calculated as follows. All quarterbacks are normalized by passing yards; all running backs and full backs are normalized by rushing yards; all wide receivers and tight ends are normalized by receiving yards. All offensive lineman, defensive linemen, and linebackers are normalized by strength—the sum of their maximum bench press and squat in pounds. Defensive backs are normalized by interceptions.</p>

<p>Since the BMI variable is a function of height and weight, the marginal effects of height and weight are also a function of the marginal effect of BMI. Thus, the true marginal effect of weight for the full sample is [0.212 − (1.504 × 703)/Height<sup>2</sup>]. The true marginal effect of height for the full sample is [−0.559 + 2 (1.504 × 703 × Weight)/Height<sup>3</sup>].</p>

<p>Low-quality players do not receive a rating. The rating ranges from 4.9 to 6.1. Players with a rating of 4.9 are said to be “sleepers.” Players with a rating between 5.0 and 5.4 are said to be “mid-major prospects.” Players with a rating between 5.5 and 5.7 are said to be “All-Region Selections” and are “deemed to have pro potential and ability to make an impact on a college team.” Players with a rating between 5.8 and 6.0 are said to be “All-American Candidates.” Lastly, players with a rating of 6.1 are considered “one of the elite prospects in the country.”</p>
