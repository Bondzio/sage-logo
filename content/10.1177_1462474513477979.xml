<abstract>
<p>This article aims to question the role criminal justice and criminal law play in structuring the set of dominant conditioning questions in criminology. Based on socio-legal approaches and past fieldwork in immigration control, I argue that the punitive use of non-criminal-based normative systems (such as immigration law) is not a new trend and that, therefore, we are not assisting a ‘criminal contamination’ of other justice systems, but the re-emergence and consolidation of different punitive logics. In that sense, I suggest that criminal justice acts as an epistemological obstacle, being a major barrier to perceive such nuances. Instead, I propose a wider conception of the penal field which operates as a mobile (kinetic sculpture) and includes the criminal law realm, but also other institutional normative systems that configure ‘less’ prominent locations of punishment, such as: regulatory criminal law, civil courts, immigration law, military law, parole boards and other administrative legal systems that play an increasing role in social reaction. I ultimately argue that criminologists should also focus on such administrative-based justice systems in order to better address and resist punitiveness.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1462474513477979" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Criminology long struggled to establish itself as a discipline or even as a field of studies. This proposed science of ‘crime’ never achieved the alleged maturity of ‘normal science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1462474513477979">Kuhn, 1970</xref>) and in many ways, it spent the last century in a state of constant crisis and eternal transition trying to set up its own knowledge, methods and epistemology. A multi-disciplinary enterprise by definition, criminology (and criminologists) competes for space and resources with other academic fields such as law, philosophy, medicine and other social sciences. This heterogeneous composition also made more difficult the establishment of common methodological and epistemological grounds that usually characterize a discipline. Historically, these distinct knowledges and approaches were organized around the idea of crime (act, criminal, penalty, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1462474513477979">Debuyst et al., 1998</xref>) despite the fact that other forms of regulations and sanctioning practices were already in place. This article is neither the first nor the last attempt to review this fuzzy field of studies, to question its objects and eventually to propose widening its scope.</p>
<p>In the last 50 years, criminology has experienced two major ontological turns: (1) the aetiological crisis and the shift to social reaction studies; and (2) the widening of policing studies (the shift from public police to private police and broader forms of governance and regulation). In this article, I suggest that a third ontological turn is emerging in the field in the area of justice studies. This turn, like the others, partially abandons traditional research topics (the criminal, police), reviewing consequently the roles criminal justice and criminal law play in structuring the set of dominant conditioning questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1462474513477979">Bourdieu, 1967</xref>) in criminology. However, this third ontological turn has not been consolidated yet because most criminologists still dogmatically consider the ‘stuff’ of criminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1462474513477979">Cohen, 1988</xref>) as being crime-related. While this crime-related agenda can be seen as our own condition of existence, it is also certainly one of our main limitations. My objective is to question such dominant criminocentric approaches in justice studies, usually framed as the criminalization of some activity or group of people while the conflict at stake is not technically a crime, proposing a broader conception of the penal field that also includes other justice systems using different forms of punitive social reaction.</p>
<p>My argument is organized in four sections. In the first section, ‘Critical, but criminology’, I briefly expose the first two ontological turns, pointing to the contributions and limitations of elite deviance studies in decentring criminal law as a privileged locus of administration of conflicts and social reaction. In section 2, ‘The “not so new” penology and old administrative strategies’, I argue that the use of non criminal-based normative systems is not a new trend and consequently that we are not experiencing a ‘criminal contamination’ of other justice systems, but rather the re-emergence and consolidation of different punitive logics. In section 3, ‘The penal as a mobile’, I propose a mobile shaped penal complex model composed of different normative systems and not centred on any of its intricate elements. I explain how such a model was built in reaction to criminocentric literature in order to nuance field conditions and how it is somehow present in elite deviance literature and in studies about non-criminal forms of regulation. I conclude in the final section by saying that it is important to consider the penal complex as a totality in order to better evaluate the dynamics between different normative systems and to suggest combined propositions of law and policy reform.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1462474513477979"><title>Critical, but criminology: From the aetiological crisis to justice studies</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1462474513477979">Edwin H Sutherland (1940</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1462474513477979">1945</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1462474513477979">1985)</xref> was probably one of the first to question the association between crime and poverty, proposing multifactorial explanations (differential association) and widening the field (white-collar crimes), even if his work was still restricted to a criminocentric perspective. His writings were often considered ahead of their time (at least within Anglo-American criminology), anticipating some trends that would become more popular in the 1960s and 1970s, but he was well situated in the sociological studies of his time (Chicago School and Frankfurt School). Later in the 1960s, driven mainly by critical scholars, constructivism and symbolic interactionism, a new way of doing criminology arose in the United States (Berkeley), Canada (Montréal and Toronto) and England (Cambridge) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474513477979">Bertrand, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1462474513477979">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This new criminology movement was a major rupture in our field. As Alvin Gouldner put it, it was an attempt to make ‘“criminology” intellectually serious’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1462474513477979">Taylor et al., 1974: ix</xref>). Generally, new criminologists were both questioning mainstream applied criminology, which was still fairly positivistic and aetiological at the time, and proposing some epistemological breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1462474513477979">Bachelard, 2002</xref>), mainly the shift from the offender/event-centred paradigm to social reaction. This shift can be considered as responsible for a first ontological turn in criminology, presenting a clear alternative to aetiological studies and opening considerably the horizons of the discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1462474513477979">Debuyst, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1462474513477979">Young, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1462474513477979">1999</xref>). During the following decades, new topics and approaches emerged and established themselves in the field, including proposals that were potentially (creatively) destructive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1462474513477979">Schumpeter, 1994</xref>) to criminology as a discipline, such as: abolitionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474513477979">Christie, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1462474513477979">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1462474513477979">Hulsman and De Celis, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1462474513477979">Mathiesen, 1974</xref>), anti-criminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1462474513477979">Cohen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1462474513477979">Ruggiero; 2001</xref>) and, more recently, zemiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1462474513477979">Hillyard et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this important shift, key categories such as crime, criminal or criminal justice still remain central in criminology. After the labelling contributions in the 1960s and 1970s, it does not really matter if we call the ‘stuff of criminology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1462474513477979">Cohen, 1988</xref>) crime, deviance, harm, problematic situation or whatever. The issue to be addressed is rather how we conceive the social reaction apparatus that manage (punitively or not) certain conflicts in society either in terms of policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1462474513477979">Brodeur, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1462474513477979">Shearing, 1996</xref>) or legal institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1462474513477979">Bohannan, 1965</xref>). While the definition of crime remains an important concern, we should focus more on our perceptions of how the institutional mechanisms of conflict resolution in our society are set up, especially the punitive responses of judicial institutions.</p>
<p>I speak of ‘perceptions’ because we criminologists sometimes have problems in framing social reaction through judicial institutions. As a rule, when we talk about justice, we generally mean either the criminal justice system, which is only one particular justice system among others in the State Law realm, or some metaphysical conception of what justice should be. I suggest that the present discussion is quite different from the debate around the stuff of criminology because there are different legal and policy logics, procedures and practices coming into play. It is in fact analogous to Shearing's argument concerning the necessary changes in the field of policing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1462474513477979">1</xref></sup> Non-criminal law-based normative systems translate events and sanction deviance in a substantially different manner than criminalization and sentencing processes. When analysing it retrospectively, it is quite interesting that the new criminology of the 1970s (and 1980s) understood the idea of <italic>selectivity of justice</italic> as selectivity of criminal justice. They surely had their academic and political reasons to do so, but today it does not make a lot of sense to approach access to justice or enforcement like this.</p>
<p>Things are somewhat different in the realm of policing: studies do not only focus on crime, deviance, criminal justice or corrections. Policing is about order and security in a broader ontological sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1462474513477979">Castel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1462474513477979">Elias, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1462474513477979">Giddens, 1991</xref>), but this is fairly recent. During the 1970s and 1980s, a second ontological turn occurred in our discipline and allowed us to go beyond studying the public police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1462474513477979">Ericson and Haggerty, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1462474513477979">Shearing, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1462474513477979">1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1462474513477979">1996</xref>), criminal law or even the idea of reaction (e.g. prevention, risk management, etc.) in a clear proposal to ‘decriminalize criminology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1462474513477979">Shearing, 1989</xref>). A broader policing concept appeared to categorize this new wave of studies. It first incorporated private police-related subjects and then it became even broader by integrating topics and knowledge more traditionally associated with political science. Later in the 1980s and 1990s, Foucault's studies in bio-politics (<italic>governmentality</italic>) had a great influence on this field and nowadays, policing can be easily considered as related to political economy (neo-Marxists variants included) and governance studies.</p>
<p>These options are not available to us when studying legal institutions in criminology. We tend to limit ourselves to crime-related categories, a criminocentric dogmatism that has significantly occluded our discipline and its development. Framing social reaction in terms of criminalizing, not criminalizing or decriminalizing is a quite simplistic reasoning and, I argue, a misunderstanding of how formal legal responses work. As a rule, we have consistently been looking to the criminal justice system and framing all institutional forms of conflict resolution through criminal law as if it structured all the justice systems. This seems to rely on a strongly held belief that crime organizes the stuff of criminology and as a result, we turn systematically to prisons and other institutional punishments and believe that they are a particularity of criminal law. According to this understanding, criminal law and <italic>the carceral</italic> form a binary system that works more or less as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1462474513477979">Figure 1</xref> shows.</p>
<p>This traditional criminological narrative operates as common sense and this conception of the penal system has become dogma. We suppose that social reaction is essentially a criminalization process and even when our inquiries lead us away from crime, we insist on reframing the processes as such. We criminalize the poor,
<fig id="fig1-1462474513477979" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Binary system.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1462474513477979-fig1.tif"/></fig> immigration, terrorism, spaces and we govern through crime, but most of the time we are not dealing with crimes. Instead of trying to make the empirical world fit within a predetermined set of categories, we should rather explore how different forms of punitive social reaction are present in the field.</p>
<p>While white-collar criminality and elite deviance studies were a first attempt to move beyond this penal translation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1462474513477979">Acosta, 1987</xref>) by pointing to a certain legal polysemy and to the administration of conflicts through different normative systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474513477979">Acosta, 1988</xref>), most criminologists in this domain also framed these conflicts criminocentrically. First, these events are usually considered as crimes (white collar crime, corporate crime, etc.) or they fall into a crime-related category, even if they barely access the criminal justice system. This flaw was identified and addressed by some contemporary scholars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1462474513477979">Lascoumes, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1462474513477979">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1462474513477979">Ruggiero, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1462474513477979">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1462474513477979">Snider, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1462474513477979">2000</xref>), but they tend to use the same framework under different terms. Second, and more importantly, criminologists seem more interested in identifying and denouncing events, related harms and offenders than in understanding what happens with these conflicts outside of the criminal justice system, by which I mean how such events are legally translated and managed, and what kind of sanctions are involved.</p>
<p>There are of course ‘exceptions’. One good example is the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1462474513477979">Susan Shapiro (1985)</xref> about the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). Shapiro was interested in understanding how the Enforcement Division of the SEC worked and was open to perceive what they considered as problematic and how they managed these situations by enforcing different pieces of legislation, by settling non-judicial agreements and/or by taking formal legal action. She clarified that in her work, ‘the term <italic>prosecution</italic> is used … to describe the decision to take formal legal action of any kind (civil, administrative, or criminal) against securities violators’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1462474513477979">Shapiro, 1985: 147</xref>). It was an important clarification to a public who usually perceived these processes more narrowly, as if non-criminalization was a synonym of impunity or of the failure of legal institutions.</p>
<p>It is rare for criminologists to address punishment outside criminal justice. It is a taboo, even if criminological scholarship recognizes that fines are often the main punitive outcome from criminal justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1462474513477979">O'Malley, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1462474513477979">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1462474513477979">Robert and Faugeron, 1980</xref>). It is permissible to frame criminal fines as institutional punishment, but it is still quite controversial in our academic field to call administrative fines a legal form of punishment. This criminocentric focus is an ideological distinction and acts as an epistemological obstacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1462474513477979">Bachelard, 2002</xref>), occluding the other realms of law and their forms of punishment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1462474513477979">2</xref></sup> There is no need to use criminal law to arrest, detain, fine and/or exclude someone from society as there are many non-criminal exclusive forms of social control (police measures, administrative sanctions, punitive damages, etc.) that can be used alternatively (and often more ‘efficiently’). The idea of selectivity of justice is a much more complex process with many implications as to how we perceive and define the penal field.</p>
<p>This extended conception of the penal field represents a third major ontological turn in criminology, one that focuses on accesses to justice and legal administration of conflicts, changing our conception of justice, adjudication and the selectivity of justice systems. During the last 40 years, criminologists have reviewed their own disciplinary boundaries, widened the frontiers of their knowledge and the possibilities of political intervention (either as professionals in the field, policy makers, activists and/or academics). In a sense, this turn is simply the logical consequence of the first two major breaks in criminology. This process of widening the field of our discipline is still ongoing and open. Currently it is mainly focused on State Law as the first locus of social reaction, but it does not have to be restricted to it. The main issue is how criminologists, penologists, criminal lawyers and socio-legal scholars framed social reaction in the past, perceive it today and will represent it in the near future.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1462474513477979"><title>The ‘not so new’ penology and old administrative strategies</title>
<p>In this section, I provide two elementary historical examples in order to show how this epistemological obstacle has impeded criminologists from properly framing central issues in our discipline by considering them almost blindly as criminal law-related, as if the realization of the obligation to punish offences was only associated to it. These examples also serve to illustrate that we are not witnessing the emergence of new criminal law strategies or even the spread of such strategies in our field. Instead, we are simply observing a different accommodation of old provisions of social control.</p>
<p>The first example is related to the ‘birth’ of the prison in the 19th century or to the idea that imprisonment should be considered as a form of punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1462474513477979">Foucault, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1462474513477979">Melossi and Pavarini, 1981</xref>) and not as a bureaucratic police measure or a holding facility while awaiting a legal decision. I am not challenging the fact that a new form of punishment arose, but that the birth of the prison as a form of sentence (<italic>peine</italic>) did not imply that bureaucratic police measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1462474513477979">Napoli, 2011</xref>) and administrative sanctions (in use at the time) simply disappeared or stopped their own historical developments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1462474513477979">3</xref></sup> Quite to the contrary, most of the bibliography on new penology and actuarial justice supports this concurrent progress despite their fairly criminocentric perspective. Indeed, we usually forget that one of the main penal strategies of the rising ‘modern’ carceral system, the 1834 Poor Law and its workhouses, was not really criminal law, but rather related to administrative law. Furthermore, Bentham's <italic>Panopticon</italic> full title includes: ‘applicable to any sort of establishment … in particular to penitentiary houses, prisons, houses of industry, workhouses, poorhouses, manufactories, madhouses, lazarettos, hospitals, and schools’.</p>
<p>Actually, the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act introduced administrative law to England and Wales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1462474513477979">Charlesworth, 2010</xref>), as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1462474513477979">Felix Driver (1989: 271)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1462474513477979">4</xref></sup> reminds us:<disp-quote>
<p>In 1836, Edwin Chadwick, one of the architects of the 1834 reform, almost casually described the new Poor Law as an ‘administrative law’. For Chadwick, the new Poor Law had effectively turned poor relief into an administrative question. The Act established quite new channels of authority, ‘transmission belts’ for the circulation of information between various levels of the state. At the hub of the new system was a central government body, the Poor Law Commission, which was responsible for the issuing of general regulations concerning administrative practice in the localities.</p></disp-quote>Criminology did not only translate Poor Law into criminal law or blur different punitive strategies of the rising penal system, but it also centralized legal sensibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1462474513477979">Ewick and Silbey, 1998</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474513477979">Arthurs (1985)</xref> argued, administrative justice in 19th-century England, Factory Inspectorates and Poor Law Commissions included, did not operate within a legal formalist paradigm (the rule of law) but rather continued regulating social life in a local and discretionary way.</p>
<p>The second example concerns the creation of organized public police forces during the 19th century in different colonial contexts. At the time, the main focus of the public police was controlling urban disorder and in particular certain people or groups considered dangerous either because they were poor, unemployed, slaves, not recognized as citizens by the colonial state or simply because they gathered in public spaces. Criminologists typically frame these situations within a criminalization process, as if at the time the idea of crime or criminalization had the same relevancy that it has today.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1462474513477979">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In fact, in most of these cases, there was no reference to criminal law and in some cases there was no criminal justice at all: no legislation and no institutions. This absence can be explained in different ways. First, criminal law was still fairly blurred into the idea of civil law understood as city, republic or royal law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1462474513477979">Berman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1462474513477979">Blackstone et al., 1875</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1462474513477979">Cockburn, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1462474513477979">Foucault, 1974</xref>). Second, criminal law might not have yet established itself as the dominant realm of legal punishment and administration of conflicts in public spaces – something that eventually happened later by the end of the 19th century due to different institutional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1462474513477979">Hay and Snyder, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1462474513477979">Radzinowicz and Hood, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1462474513477979">Steinberg, 1989</xref>). Finally, administrative law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1462474513477979">Napoli, 2003</xref>) and informal and legal pluralistic dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1462474513477979">Shearing and Stenning, 1987</xref>) played a prominent role.</p>
<p>A radical example of this is the creation of the public police in the city of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), with the arrival of the Portuguese Royal Court in 1808 and its policing activities and routines throughout the 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474513477979">Algranti, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1462474513477979">Holloway, 1993</xref>). There was no criminal code before 1830 and the concrete existence of criminal justice institutions is quite questionable even during the second half of the 19th century. At the time, the public police were basically enforcing, if at all, the Philippine Ordinances of 1603 and by-laws in order to control the fluxes of urban slavery, small urban disorders and the proliferation of <italic>cortiços</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1462474513477979">6</xref></sup> Later, the Imperial Criminal Code (1830) technically replaced the Fifth Book (the ‘criminal’ one) of the Philippine Ordinances, but some provisions of the four other books remained in use in Brazil until the early 20th century and by-laws are still used as a major legal reference by police forces there and elsewhere in the West.</p>
<p>These two examples do not constitute historical revisionism or an attempt at identifying every tiny non-criminal manifestation in the history of social control, but an illustration of how modern police and corrections were not restricted to criminal law. In fact, it may very well be that the criminocentric approach is the result of historical confusion or the collateral effect of a process of academic autonomization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1462474513477979">Bourdieu, 1969</xref>) in the Anglo-American world where criminology gained stronger disciplinary contours than it ever did in continental Europe. Consequently, the contemporary punitive use of administrative law is not necessarily a new trend (e.g. post 9-11 new normal) or the ‘widening of the carceral archipelago’ as it is sometimes suggested (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1462474513477979">Cohen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1462474513477979">Feeley and Simon, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1462474513477979">2003</xref>). These forms of punishment were always available, but they were rarely perceived as such by most criminologists and criminal law scholars. In that sense, I am not suggesting a conception of the penal field according to which criminal law would be expanding its logics and practices or contaminating other realms of the law. Instead, the concurrence and the interactions among normative systems (criminal law, regulatory criminal law, administrative law, etc.) produce different penal configurations. My proposition involves breaking with contemporary hegemonic penal theories, the revival of an extended penal system model which would not necessarily be governed by criminal principles, but by a complex network of normative systems, distinct legal logics, practices and intervention institutions.</p>
<p>This conception of the penal system as a multitude of normative systems is present in criminology, but has been more developed by socio-legal scholars. It can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1462474513477979">Foucault's (1995)</xref> <italic>Discipline and Punish</italic> when he first borrows from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1462474513477979">Rusche and Kirchheimer (2003)</xref> central propositions to think ‘penality’ beyond the ‘means of reducing crime’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1462474513477979">7</xref></sup> in order to analyse ‘“concrete systems of punishment” … that cannot be accounted by the juridical structure of society alone’ (1995: 24); and later when he develops the idea of a continuum dimension of the carceral and tries to trace a distinction between dominant illegalities and delinquency (1995: 285ss.). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1462474513477979">Foucault (1995: 297)</xref> considered the carceral archipelago (and his idea of punishment or control of bodies) as ‘well beyond the frontiers of criminal law’, he framed it more in a socialization/normalization perspective (disciplinary society) rather than as a conflict resolution or access to justice dynamic. In other words, the carceral continuum (and maybe most of Foucault's writings) is conceptualized much more as policing/political economy (of bodies) than justice studies, which becomes even clearer when considering the ways in which Anglo-American criminologists used his work.</p>
<p>Interestingly, David Garland is maybe the author who first pushed forward this extended model in the area of justice studies. In his early writings about welfare sanction and penal institutions in the 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1462474513477979">Garland, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1462474513477979">1985</xref>), he presented the modern penal system as a welfare/control complex composed of a new disciplinary network that was not limited to criminal law or to its support agencies: ‘They opened up a correctional system which policed not crimes but characters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1462474513477979">Garland, 1981: 41</xref>), displacing justice questions (criminal and/or natural law principles) to a more administrative level (e.g. indeterminate sentences, preventive detention, reformatory discipline and other forms of administrative sanctions and police measures). Unfortunately, he did not develop this model in terms of justice studies, shifting to the already opened and well-paved path of governance and policing studies in his subsequent writings.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1462474513477979"><title>The penal as a mobile: A non-criminal centred penal complex model</title>
<p>If a criminocentric conception of justice is not sufficiently precise to describe the legal processes involved in the historical constitution of western modern penal systems, this model seems to be even more problematic today given the complexity of penal strategies. It is unable to encompass the increasing use of non-criminal normative systems in administrating punitively different events and bodies in contemporary societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474513477979">Beckett and Herbert, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1462474513477979">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474513477979">Beckett and Murakawa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474513477979">Bosworth and Kaufman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1462474513477979">De Keijser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1462474513477979">Duff, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1462474513477979">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1462474513477979">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1462474513477979">Hörnqvist, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1462474513477979">Valverde, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1462474513477979">Velloso, 2013</xref>). This is especially true in North America where prosecutors can shop between normative systems more easily than in Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1462474513477979">8</xref></sup> Conflicts are decriminalized and the State punitive apparatus and the ‘crime’ control industry increase their range of action. This punitive decriminalization sounds paradoxical, but it is not. It is just a matter of appropriately framing institutional forms of conflict resolution and perceiving how persons are being prosecuted (and eventually convicted and punished, yet not necessarily in this order). We should not have a closed binary model formed by criminal justice and the carceral, but an open model incorporating the different possibilities of legal processes and institutional forms of punishment. Such a model can be briefly summarized in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1462474513477979">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
<p>This model is not centred on criminal law, on the carceral, on the penal system or on any other ‘independent’ structure. It works as a mobile (kinetic sculpture) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1462474513477979">Figure 3</xref>); a Tocquevillian conception of structure undergoing constant change and settling in a different configuration every time any force is applied and/or each time one of its elements is altered, abolished or a new one is created. In other

<fig id="fig3-1462474513477979" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Mobile (kinetic sculpture).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1462474513477979-fig3.tif"/></fig> words, the penal complex is always changing. Its stability as a system is provisional and its configuration varies in accordance to several factors, including the logics and practices of different normative systems, the communications (or lack of) and fluxes among them (the arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1462474513477979">Figure 2</xref>), the policies (not only the penal ones as Garland had suggested), the key role of the public prosecutor (selecting different justice systems), the creation of new elements (e.g. specialized administrative tribunals and regulatory agencies) and broader external variables (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1462474513477979">Rusche and Kirchheimer, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Methodologically, this perspective is at the same time a reaction to criminocentric approaches and a tentative attempt to build, contextualize and relativize existing categories to better analyse and to help us think not only the actual context, but also previous ones where criminal justice institutions played (and maybe still play) a major role. Therefore, this mobile shaped model is only a break in terms of decentring criminal law within the penal complex and nuancing legal sensibilities that are more anchored in the field. In a way, it is in continuity with the new criminology and policing/political economy (of punishment) enterprises, pushing part of the social reaction realm back to where it probably always was (outside criminal law), but boldly incorporating these ‘less prominent locations of punishment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1462474513477979">Galanter, 1991</xref>) into our legitimate field of studies. Substantively speaking, this is a model based on access to justice(s) and procedure, anchored in anthropology and sociology of law and aiming to describe how different events are legally translated into different normative systems. In that sense, it fits and gives support to post-Fordist sociologies of punishment and confinement (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1462474513477979">Chantraine and Mary, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1462474513477979">De Giorgi, 2006</xref>). Paraphrasing Shearing (see note <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1462474513477979">1</xref>), whatever it is that unifies the topic, it is not crime, but juridical social reaction and the resemblance of the forms of punishment involved.</p>
<p>To be sure, the elements detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1462474513477979">Figure 2</xref> do not necessarily cover all realms of state-based punitiveness and were chosen in a very conservative way. The binary model (criminal law and the <italic>carceral</italic>) is completely integrated in the mobile model, but the penal system includes sites and forms of punishment that are not restricted to prisons and corrections or related to criminal sentencing (e.g. administrative and regulatory fines, administrative detention, banishment, zoning orders, punitive and statutory damages, etc.). Regulatory criminal law and parole boards are presented as dissociated from criminal law and the penal system because they constitute distinct normative systems, operating mostly in an administrative manner in terms of rituals, procedures, standards and legal guarantees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1462474513477979">9</xref></sup> The penal role of civil courts is also well known through punitive damages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1462474513477979">Galanter, 1991</xref>). Military law and immigration law are administrative law-based normative systems that traditionally (and dramatically) regulate and penalize part of the population under their jurisdiction (military and foreigners). Other administrative law may encompass by-laws that are not covered by regulatory criminal law regimes and other specialized areas and/or tribunals (land law, labour law, copyright law, mental health, etc.). Finally, the prosecutor (and arguably the police) acts as a filter, choosing among these different procedural options. While some empirical work has already been done with respect to crime-related selectiveness (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1462474513477979">Grosman, 1969</xref>), more research is needed to understand how conflicts flow through different normative systems and which steps of penal translation and legal sensibilities are involved.</p>
<p>This conception of the penal as a mobile should not be taken as primarily theoretical or purely abstract, but as an open model built from fieldwork and adaptable to other contexts. It is an empirically grounded and procedural model, traces of which can be found in elite deviance and regulatory studies interested in the different fluxes of legal responses given to such conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474513477979">Acosta, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1462474513477979">Hawkins, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1462474513477979">Lascoumes, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1462474513477979">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1462474513477979">Shapiro, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1462474513477979">Velloso, 2006</xref>). While it may not be explicitly presented as such in these studies, they constitute a first step in realizing how the traditional criminological conceptual toolbox is not precise enough to perceive the diversity of conflict resolution dynamics and, more importantly, to recognize that decriminalization (either by law reforms or through non-enforcement) ‘paradoxically’ implies more punishment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1462474513477979">10</xref></sup> In that sense, the penal as a mobile model is a radicalization and extension of these approaches to other areas.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate this further by using the example of immigration control based on fieldwork conducted at the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB). Immigration control in Canada (and elsewhere) is not criminal justice. Immigration and refugee law is basically administrative law and the IRB is the largest administrative tribunal in the country. However, the forms of punishment available are not economic sanctions, as it is usually the case in administrative law-based systems, but they are mainly related to deprivation of liberty (detention, surveillance and removals).</p>
<p>How should we characterize what is going on in immigration control on a normative level? For criminologists, it is very tempting to approach it criminocentrically, trying to make field data fit into established theories. Criminological contemporary literature on policing, risk, new penology supports some <italic>post 9-11</italic> criminological common-sense ideas, such as: <italic>crimmigration</italic> (a fusion of immigration and criminal law; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1462474513477979">Miller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1462474513477979">Stumpf, 2006</xref>), <italic>criminalization of immigrants</italic> (the most common one), <italic>criminalization through counter-law</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1462474513477979">Ericson, 2007</xref>) and so on. However, this idea of criminal contamination of other justice systems does not seem to be supported by field data and administrative law perspectives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1462474513477979">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ericson's appropriation and development of the Foucauldian counter-law idea is the most sophisticated and interesting version of this. He suggested that there are two types of counter-law: <italic>counter-law I</italic> that ‘takes the form of laws against law’ which he associated to Agamben's <italic>state of exception</italic>; and <italic>counter-law II</italic> that ‘takes the form of surveillance assemblages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1462474513477979">Ericson, 2007: 24ss.</xref>). Later in his book he argues that:<disp-quote>
<p>This new wave of criminalization is enacted through counter-law. Counter-law I entails the creative development of laws that counter the traditional principles, standards, and procedures of criminal law. Through new forms of criminal law, as well as new uses of civil and administrative law, counter-law seeks to reduce or eliminate due process protections that create uncertainty in investigations. It also increases the discretionary capacity for pre-emptive strikes against the suspicious, including incapacitations and severe punishment. … Enabled by counter-law I, counter-law II seeks to make legal process unnecessary. It does so either by making suitable enemies uncomfortable to the point that they go elsewhere, or by making their suspicious signs and harmful behaviour visible in ways that make exclusion and punishment seem obvious and necessary.</p><attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1462474513477979">Ericson, 2007: 207</xref>)</attrib></disp-quote>Ericson is right, but for his categorization of this phenomenon as ‘criminalization’. The problem is that he was still too attached to traditional crime-related references. First, most of what is happening today is not exceptional or an emergency, but the everyday routine of a normative system that works with less legal guarantees. Second, the idea of criminalization through counter-law is a contradiction by definition. This form of prosecution is made possible precisely by creating access to other normative systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1462474513477979">12</xref></sup> Therefore, the term penalization (or any other broader category) would be more appropriate to describe this process. Finally other forms of legal punishment and legal translation of events were always out there, but we were not paying attention to them or we were framing them through our own disciplinary preconceptions.</p>
<p>Administrative law has its own fundamental principles of ‘vision and division’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1462474513477979">Bourdieu, 1991</xref>). For instance, some instruments in the immigration justice system can be fairly associated with punishment and exclusive forms of social control, but they are not equivalent to the criminal notion of punishment (<italic>poena</italic>). Administrative sanctions (e.g. fines) and police measures are two examples of this, despite the fact that the former are considered repressive and the latter mostly preventive. On one hand, administrative sanctions are similar to penalties (<italic>poena</italic>) because both are framed as an <italic>a posteriori</italic> response to a given event (repressive). On the other hand, the legal guarantees are lower in the case of administrative sanctions: no <italic>mens rea</italic> is required, strict liability is often sufficient and lower standards of proof are applied, producing even harsher effects on those subject to administrative social reaction.</p>
<p>The punitive instruments used in immigration control in Canada are not administrative sanctions, but police measures (<italic>mesures de police</italic>) and they follow a totally different logic of intervention. They are not an <italic>a posteriori</italic> response, but an <italic>aprioristic</italic> one aiming to maintain public order<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1462474513477979">13</xref></sup> (preventive). The legal reasoning is not to inflict a penalty reactively, but to prevent immigrants from endangering Canadian society. In other words, an individual does not necessarily need to commit an offence to be punished by administrative law, it is only necessary that there be reasonable grounds to believe that the foreigner is a danger to society or that he or she will virtually be a danger in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1462474513477979">Velloso, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Thinking of the penal complex as an intricate mobile allows the researcher to establish links that were not available before in the criminocentric model. Regarding immigration control, it allows us not only to observe a process of punishment along, beyond and in addition to the criminal law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1462474513477979">Velloso, 2013</xref>), but also to realize the impact of broader social policies in the penal field. The most apparent use of immigration law to punish and manage populations is not a direct effect of the 9-11 attacks or law reform (at least in Canada). The actual Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (2002) was already in an advanced processing stage in the House of Commons when the attacks happened and its punitive instruments are basically the same as those present in the older Immigration Act (1976), including the security certificate provisions.</p>
<p>Such an analytical penal model is not only helpful to analyse immigration control. It is a general and open model that helps to accommodate different juridical paths and manifestations of punishment in our society. For instance, the management (and treatment) of those considered ‘not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder’ is handled through administrative law and discretionary procedures. Yet, such management is far from being non-punitive and the role of mental health boards/tribunals and strategies of (non-)confinement have very concrete effects on the penal complex as well as on the transfer of carceral populations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1462474513477979">Harcourt, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The same can be said of several other areas, including that of the legal adjustments made in the context of the adoption of broken window policing in several western cities in the late 1990s and 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1462474513477979">Harcourt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1462474513477979">Young, 1999</xref>). As many socio-legal scholars have shown, the punitive social reaction used to address urban disorder passed through non-criminal law-based normative systems (mostly administrative, but also civil and regulatory) and have not followed the criminal-based law and order agenda present in the criminological imaginary (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474513477979">Beckett and Herbert, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1462474513477979">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474513477979">Beckett and Murakawa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1462474513477979">Blomley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1462474513477979">Ranasinghe and Valverde, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1462474513477979">Sylvestre, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1462474513477979">Valverde, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1462474513477979">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1462474513477979">2012</xref>). For instance, in Canadian cities, by-laws and provincial regulatory statutes were primarily used along with zero-tolerance policing practices and policies to control marginalized groups of people occupying public spaces with important exclusive consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1462474513477979">Sylvestre, 2010</xref>). Changes and legal innovations in this area were much more in terms of guidelines, policies, procedures and recycling of old by-laws rather than by the creation of new criminal offences or the increase in criminal sentences.</p>
<p>Similarly, the North American war on terror was mainly operated through administrative law (mostly military and immigration law). In this context, law enforcement strategies changed substantially and new actors appeared in the penal field, such as Homeland Security (USA) and Public Safety Canada, reshaping significantly the penal complex mobile. These super national security departments concentrate numerous state agencies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1462474513477979">14</xref></sup> which have a whole range of enforcement possibilities: some are criminal, but most are administrative. The immigration law asymmetric incorporation of criminal justice norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1462474513477979">Legomsky, 2007</xref>) is a totally new configuration of the penal mobile and again most probably the result of new policy and enforcement structures and not necessarily substantive changes in criminal law and immigration law (e.g. harsher penalties or new offences). Finally, Guantanamo Bay detention camp is still in operation and it surely is the most brutal example of administrative detention today.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1462474513477979"><title>The penal complex as a totality: Towards multiple sites of resistance</title>
<p>It is important to think of the penal complex as a dynamic process and as a totality. This approach is not only helpful to better understand punitive social reaction, but also to evaluate and strategically plan our capacity of intervention in the penal field. Assuming that decriminalization means depenalization is simply naïve. Social change does not happen in a sociological vacuum and once a problematic situation is decriminalized, it is usually handled by other normative systems achieving the ideological obligation to punish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1462474513477979">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>When I argue that we should stop decriminalizing conflicts because it only gets worse in administrative law, criminologists frequently ask me whether my position does not lead to legitimizing the criminal justice system. This is not the case. First, I never phrased my argument in those terms; and second, this is a false paradox. It is a legitimate question, of course, but it does not make sense when you are working with an extended conception of the penal field as a totality. The paradox lies elsewhere, in how criminocentric approaches perceive the phenomenon. Innovations in the field of criminal law can make the penal complex harsher by increasing the punitive use of other normative systems that have less procedural guarantees for the defendant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1462474513477979">16</xref></sup> Liberal criminal law reform can result in penal complex configurations in which conflicts are administratively translated and eventually punished in a more effective way because administrative justice offers greater enforcement capacity, speed, lower standards of proof and informality. Unfortunately, even the best intended actions might produce adverse systemic effects that are presently not well addressed and predicted, making penal abolitionism and penal parsimony enterprises more difficult, but not impossible.</p>
<p>Dealing with the penal complex (trying to depenalize it or to avoid excessive punishment) is exactly like squeezing an under-inflated balloon trying to explode it. You squeeze one of its sides and the air may flow to the other side, expanding it. The only way to explode the under-inflated balloon is through an integrated action. One should squeeze both sides at the same time and if the air is still flowing to an available spot, producing an expected knob, a second person must press there too while the first one is still grasping the balloon in order to finally explode it. An abolitionist and/or penal parsimony enterprise is exactly the same thing. At this point in the historical development of our discipline, we should, as criminologists, review our biases and maybe unlearn criminology a bit in order to better understand how the different structures of the mobile work, how these elements interact or communicate (if and when they interact), what are their uses and what are their ‘external’ forces and ‘internal’ resistances (‘non-judicial’ discourses, policies, major events, etc.). In doing so, we can improve our capacity to evaluate systemic trends and therefore promote broader and combined propositions for law reform and anti-penal policies.</p>

The problem doesn't have to do with the perspective being used, or the lack thereof. The problem has to do with the way the topic of study is identified. The problem is that, whatever it is that unifies the topic, the family resemblance noted earlier, it is not crime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1462474513477979">Shearing, 1989: 171</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn2-1462474513477979"><label>2</label><p>This does not mean that theories elaborated from this criminocentric perspective are wrong, but maybe incomplete or slightly biased. It is also important to emphasize the variety of works in the criminological and socio-legal field dealing with other forms of deviance and social control governed directly or indirectly by the State, including forms of confinement and surveillance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1462474513477979">Castel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1462474513477979">Ewald, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1462474513477979">Foucault, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1462474513477979">Goffman, 1961</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3-1462474513477979"><label>3</label><p>On this point, see the notion of <italic>traceability</italic> and its liability implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474513477979">Pedrot, 2003</xref>).</p></fn>

<fn id="fn5-1462474513477979"><label>5</label><p>Edward Christian commented on the use of the term ‘crime’ by Blackstone as follows: ‘The word “crime” has no technical meaning in the law of England. It seems, when it has a reference to positive law, to comprehend those acts which subject the offender to punishment. When the words <italic>high crimes and misdemeanours</italic> are used in prosecutions by impeachment, the words <italic>high crimes</italic> have no definite signification, but are used merely to give greater solemnity to the charge. When the word <italic>crime</italic> is used with a reference to moral law, it implies every deviation from moral rectitude. Hence we say it is a <italic>crime</italic> to refuse the payment of a just debt; it is a <italic>crime</italic> wilfully to do an injury to another's person or property without making him a satisfaction’ (comments by Christian, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1462474513477979">Blackstone et al., 1875, IV:4</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn6-1462474513477979"><label>6</label><p><italic>Cortiço</italic> was a type of collective urban housing where poor populations lived in deprived conditions and often considered by authorities as a site of sickness, disorder and danger. Sweeping undesirables based on health and safety reasons is not that out-dated and was the main justification for removing Occupy Wall Street protesters from Zuccotti Park (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/nyregion/police-begin-clearing-zuccotti-park-of-protesters.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/nyregion/police-begin-clearing-zuccotti-park-of-protesters.html</ext-link> (last accessed 16 November 2011).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn7-1462474513477979"><label>7</label><p>Interestingly, the term ‘crime’ is apparently used only in the English translation. The original in French is ‘délits’, a far more general category.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn8-1462474513477979"><label>8</label><p>The interpretation given to Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights (right to a fair trial), more specifically to the idea of ‘“autonomy” of the concept of “criminal”’ (<italic>Engel and Others v. the Netherlands</italic>, ECHR, 1976, §§80-83; available at: hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57479 (accessed 20 October 2012), makes it more difficult to punish someone by prosecuting her/him under administrative-based normative systems in order to avoid criminal trials. The severity of the sanctions that might be inflicted really matters to determine the level of legal guarantees of the accused, even if originally the offence was not labelled as criminal. However, these provisions do not cover immigration conflicts and they are regulated under administrative law terms.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn9-1462474513477979"><label>9</label><p>In Canada, the UK (and in many US states) parole boards are simply not criminal law-based, but administrative tribunals or panels.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn10-1462474513477979"><label>10</label><p>This punitive decriminalization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1462474513477979">Velloso, 2006</xref>) is similar to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1462474513477979">Ashworth and Zedner (2010)</xref> refer to as a problem of undercriminalization. In fact, the idea of a punitive decriminalization is only paradoxical if you presuppose a criminocentric conception of the penal complex. If punishment is not restricted to the criminal realm, there are no contradictions or paradoxes at all.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn11-1462474513477979"><label>11</label><p>In fact, if any ‘contamination argument’ can be made, it is the other way around with administrative law strategies increasingly influencing the criminal justice system (e.g. preventive orders, preventive detention, zoning restrictions, security perimeters).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn12-1462474513477979"><label>12</label><p>This can be explained by various non-exclusive reasons: prosecutorial discretion, policing strategies, decriminalization, non-enforcement of criminal norms, citizenship status and/or criminal background of the offender, undercriminalization and even overcriminalization (e.g. mandatory minimum sentences may push actors in the field to use other normative systems).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn13-1462474513477979"><label>13</label><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1462474513477979">Napoli (2011)</xref> links the origins of police measures to the development of state bureaucracies during the Ancient Regime, having a different rationality compared to contemporary liberal forms of rule (e.g. criminal law).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn14-1462474513477979"><label>14</label><p>The Department of Homeland Security is composed of seven agencies: US Immigration and Customs Enforcement; US Customs and Border Protection; Transportation Security Administration; US Citizenship and Immigration Services; US Secret Service; Federal Emergency Management Agency; and US Coast Guard. On the Canadian side, Public Safety Canada has five agencies: Canada Border Service Agency; Royal Canadian Mounted Police; Canada Security Intelligence Service; Correctional Service Canada; and National Parole Board.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn15-1462474513477979"><label>15</label><p>This should not be understood as something related to Blumstein and Cohen's homeostatic hypothesis, but simply as a different structural configuration of the penal mobile that may facilitate the administration of certain conflicts in particular normative systems and institutions of sequestration.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn16-1462474513477979"><label>16</label><p>The same argument can be made within criminal law. For instance, the increasing use of life without parole sentences in the USA can be partially explained by the fact that they do not require the ‘super due process’ procedures of capital punishment cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1462474513477979">Gottschalk, 2006: 231–232</xref>).</p></fn></fn-group></notes><ack>
