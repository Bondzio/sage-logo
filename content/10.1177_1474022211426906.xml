<abstract>
<p>We report on the experience of creating a socially networked system, the Research-oriented Social Environment (RoSE), for representing knowledge in the form of relationships between people, documents, and groups. Developed as an intercampus, interdisciplinary project of the University of California, this work reflects on a collaboration between scholars in the humanities, software engineering, and information studies by providing an opportunity not only to synthesize different disciplinary perspectives, but also to interrogate and challenge the assumptions each brings to team-based design projects in the digital humanities. This work examines socially networked knowledge as both content and methodology for collaboration, calling for further critique and future investigation of epistemological questions in models of social networks.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1474022211426906" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social networks are a central element of contemporary Internet culture. In March of 2010, Facebook managed to receive more hits than Google (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474022211426906">Gaudin, 2010</xref>); <italic>The Social Network</italic>, a movie about the founding of Facebook, topped the box office in its opening weekend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022211426906">Fritz, 2010</xref>); and social network analysis and network theory have seen critical use in fields as diverse as sociology, communication studies, economics, and information studies. This article considers what it might mean to theorize ‘socially networked knowledge’, both as a kind of knowledge object and, especially, as a process of knowledge work. We take as our case study the Research-oriented Social Environment (RoSE), a new system created by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474022211426906">University of California Transliteracies Project (2010)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474022211426906">RoSE</xref> demonstrates how the social network model might serve as a learning environment, as it allows users to map and visualize relationships between documents, people, and groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474022211426906">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1474022211426906">2</xref>).

<p>But the process of developing RoSE also required a kind of socially networked knowledge, as scholars in the humanities, software engineering, and information studies brought together their different areas of expertise to produce a single framework. In the following discussion, we reflect upon our development of this system in order to reveal the kinds of perspectives, principles, and challenges that arise in such interdisciplinary work.</p>
<p>Such collaboration across fields is central to the digital humanities, which have been gaining crucial momentum in recent years. While the term has yet to settle into a stable definition, the idea of the digital humanities is increasingly prominent in research and higher education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474022211426906">1</xref></sup> In November 2010, the <italic>New York Times</italic> published an article equating the digital humanities with data analysis, a move that the author called ‘the next big idea in language, history, and the arts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022211426906">Cohen, 2010</xref>). The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) now includes an Office of Digital Humanities (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.neh.gov/ODH/About/tabid/56/Default.aspx">www.neh.gov/ODH/About/tabid/56/Default.aspx</ext-link>), founded to facilitate the organization’s endeavors for digital scholarship.</p>
<p>An ongoing challenge for this emerging field, however, is how to develop collaborations that bring together the expertise of the various disciplines invested in it. Given the growing interest in the digital humanities, partly as a means of showing humanities scholarship to be still relevant in the age of ubiquitous networked computing, there has also been increasing collaboration between disciplines. The relationships between engineering, humanities, and information studies scholarship can be various and complex. For example, in a collaboration on Russian verse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022211426906">Adams and Birnbaum (1997)</xref>, found that participants need not be sharply distinguished as humanities scholars or engineers, since those who work in the digital humanities often have qualities characteristic of both. In many other contexts, however, the distinction between software engineers, humanities scholars, and information scientists is rooted in academic methodology.</p>
<p>The University of California’s Transliteracies Project has worked to address this challenge by encouraging interdisciplinary work among scholars from a number of UC campuses (including UC Santa Barbara, the project’s host institution, as well as UC Berkeley, UC Los Angeles, UC Irvine, UC Riverside, UC Santa Cruz, and UC San Diego). More specifically, humanities scholars brought critical inquiry to the discussion, suggesting improvements to RoSE and general reflections on the purpose and goals of the project. The information scientists introduced an organizational approach to metadata that mediated the distinction between real entities (persons) and their digital representations. The software engineers translated abstract ideas into formal models that resulted in the material form of the RoSE project as a system. All three groups were essential to our collaboration, but each also brought particular methodological differences which we needed to resolve.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474022211426906"><title>Humanities perspective</title>
<p>Scholars of literature, and of the humanities more generally, are increasingly looking to the ways that technology might productively intersect with traditional critical practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474022211426906">2</xref></sup> As digital tools see more mainstream use in humanities research, it is useful to consider the ways in which theoretical perspectives from the humanities can also productively contribute to the development of such tools. Our experience on the RoSE project highlights one area where we felt the intervention of the humanities perspective to be particularly important: definitions. Semantics matter to the humanities; there is a disciplinary tendency to take care when defining terms, as the act of definition is by nature exclusionary and reifying.</p>
<p>Consider one issue that surfaced during RoSE’s creation: the need to decide on a best-practice measure for defining keywords and relationships in the system. RoSE allows for a high level of granularity in the assigning of relationships among people and documents: <italic>author</italic> and <italic>translator</italic>, for example, but also <italic>colleague</italic>, <italic>mentor</italic>, <italic>rival</italic>, <italic>enemy</italic>. Such nuance can make definitions hard to fix and harder to assign to a particular set of entities. The RoSE team needed to clarify several subjects. How should we define individual relationship options in the system (<italic>colleague</italic> versus <italic>friend</italic>, for example)? What is a <italic>relationship</italic>? Those of us from humanities departments were most concerned with the ordinary sense of the word (a type of connection between two entities); the thorny issue for us was assigning individual relationships. Yet the word <italic>relationship</italic> carried a different meaning for other members of the Bluesky team. Our challenge as humanities scholars was to understand how the standard dictionary definition did or did not fit the way that information scientists and software engineers conceptualized the word. We needed to think about the kinds of relationships we wanted to represent, the way this could be physically coded into the system, and the best way to harvest metadata on these relationships.</p>
<p>The establishment of common definitions is important for collaborative work at both the operational and technological level. For instance, referring to all team members as <italic>developers</italic> was common practice at group meetings – a practice that sometimes led to confusion for the engineers, whose field reserves the word <italic>developer</italic> for programmers who are also software architects. Conflicting definitions were not mere quibbles; rather, they helped to reveal the areas where our fields diverged conceptually. Research on interdisciplinary work suggests that our experiences working on RoSE are representative of a pervasive concern: Borrego and Newswander (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022211426906">2010</xref>: 68) argue that ‘language and terminology differences between disciplines are perhaps the most frequently cited barrier to interdisciplinarity’. These problems are not irresolvable, but scholars working across disciplinary boundaries must be alert for the subtler ways in which their definitions depart from those of their colleagues, and dialogue is necessary to establish common meanings.</p>
<p>This attention to linguistic ambiguity can reveal both the practical limitations of a system and the limits of intellectual concepts that we try to map onto that system. Even apparently self-evident terms like <italic>author</italic> can be difficult to represent in a database. In trying to define <italic>author</italic>, we were less concerned with discussions about the word’s theoretical or philosophical implications than with the pragmatics of how RoSE would represent the idea that Person A had written Document X. For example, our Early Modern Working Group had difficulty entering authors for a number of English broadside ballads because popular texts of the time were more likely to be associated with a publisher or printer than with an author. This was compounded by the fact that many authors simply went by initials, which can no longer be traced to full names.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474022211426906">3</xref></sup> Our work on RoSE challenged the category <italic>author</italic> by revealing the changing historical trajectory of the term and the ways in which our database was better suited to representing authorship from some time periods than others. We needed input from engineers, literary scholars, and information scientists in order to represent authorship appropriately in the system; we also needed the flexibility to remodel our concepts about the significance of authorship.</p>
<p>Data cannot be regarded as neutral in any system that holds meaningful content. Our work on RoSE suggests that it is critical for the teams responsible for the creation of digital tools to acknowledge that acts of interpretation already exist both in the process of inputting data, and in the parameters built into the system to handle and define that data. This insight stands as an important corrective to the fantasy that data and digital tools are somehow objective and value-free. In <italic>Graphs, Maps, Trees</italic>, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022211426906">Moretti (2005</xref>: 9) asserts that ‘quantitative research provides a type of data which is ideally independent of interpretations…: it provides <italic>data</italic>, not interpretation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474022211426906">4</xref></sup> The <italic>New York Times</italic> article quoted above sees ‘data’ as the successor to schools of thought like ‘formalism, Freudianism, structuralism, postcolonialism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022211426906">Cohen, 2010</xref>), as if data itself were an independent and self-evident entity. Such views elide the extent to which data always exist in a particular system as a result of design decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474022211426906">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Any given system can hold only certain types and configurations of data. The humanities perspective reminds us that the relationships and keywords used in a system like RoSE are ideological. They ensure that RoSE’s consideration of an entity as part of larger networks already reflects particular subjective choices. The knowledge object produced – the visualization of James Joyce, or of an early modern ballad – is ultimately dependent upon the interpretive choices of the team that designs and builds the system, and of whoever (or whatever mechanism) enters the data. Our view is not that the applications we use in our research must be perfect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1474022211426906">6</xref></sup> Rather, the lesson is that those who create digital tools must be mindful about the function that their choices implicitly build into a system, and those who use such tools must be aware of the ways that the applications’ structure and content influence what information is produced. We must address these issues explicitly, rather than passively allowing certain theories of knowledge to be embedded in our systems. Interdisciplinary collaboration can be challenging, as we confront the limits of our own academic perspectives and struggle to find common theoretical and practical ground with people from different intellectual backgrounds. Yet as Julie Thompson Klein puts it, ‘interdisciplinarity is a means of solving problems and answering questions that cannot be satisfactorily addressed using single methods or approaches’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022211426906">Borrego and Newsander, 2010</xref>: 63). Such collaboration is uniquely suited to helping us understand and assess the digital tools we create and use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1474022211426906"><title>Software engineering perspective</title>
<p>As software engineers, we view our contributions to RoSE as ongoing and perpetual, not only because this work is never truly complete but because, through the lifetime of the project, we came to recognize that the practice of engineering is always a process of modeling increasingly subtle and complex details. Yet we do not view this as a limitation, since we never expect or imagine engineering to be capable of resolving the depths of human interaction completely – after all, given the scale of modern civilization, the history of these interactions is fading faster than it is being recorded. This realization is rooted in the methodological foundations of the humanities, that is, in its observation of the dramatic impacts of technology. Thus, one question we found necessary to address is: How do software engineers working on collaborative humanities projects respond to critical inquiry, what we perceive as humanities questions regarding the specific impacts of present-day technology, while we simultaneously engage in creating such systems?</p>
<p>Our approach is based on the understanding of software engineering as a computational model, which shares some similarities to Franco Moretti’s ‘abstract models’. Like an abstract model, a computational model involves the re-interpretation of an artifact or text, which is by definition a simplification of the object. However, computational models are applied not to texts (in order to read distant patterns) but to <italic>concepts</italic> in order to develop a formal specification for machines to read. This requirement, that machines be instructed formally, presents a concrete challenge in counterpoint to how societies could or should relate to technology. Computational models do not replace the richness found in these real entities (e.g. texts, social networks), but supplement them by providing compact models for use by both humans and machines.</p>
<p>In working on RoSE, the software engineering team found that our most productive dialogue occurred when it was taken as axiomatic that computational models are inherently limited (not necessarily by any theoretical limit, but by our ability to convey the complexity of the world to machines). This view prompted a basic shift in perspective among all disciplines working on the project. For the humanities, we believe it presented a way for dialogue to proceed without perpetually questioning the inherent, sometimes obvious, limitations of our models – instead the inquiry would become a regular source of constructive design feedback. For the software engineers, it helped us to understand that our work is never complete, but always a series of incremental steps in the direction of an indefinite future ideal. This inherent tension of ideal and real can never be fully resolved, which led to a more natural, cyclic relationship in our efforts and workflow.</p>
<p>Moving beyond these theoretical issues to decide on practical goals was a necessary part of our process as engineers, the primary contribution of which was to determine how abstract ideas can be translated into a formalized system. In relation to RoSE, whose focus was on socially networked knowledge, one of the key concepts we addressed were <italic>relationships</italic> between contemporary and historic persons and documents. In many regards the metaphor of a translation is an appropriate one, since our idea and experience of a relationship is much broader than what might be implemented, so a lived concept is in essence ‘translated’ into a computed structure. Understanding what a relationship is, for a software developer, thus begins with the question: What do <italic>you</italic>, the humanities scholar or information scientist, mean by a relationship? Since there are many ways in life to look at relationships, we want to know what particular aspect of relationships you wish to model.</p>
<p>In the context of RoSE, the answer lies in a deeper semantic connection between people and documents than exists in other systems, which is an ongoing research area in text mining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474022211426906">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>). A <italic>relationship</italic>, according to the software development team, thus became a literal connection between two ideas, objects or things as embodied in the system. As a relationship can take many forms – partners, friends, colleagues – we sought to ‘capture’ this as well in the kinds of relationships that could be expressed by information scientists and applied by humanities scholars. It is important to emphasize that our understanding of relationship was a formal one, that is, it exists as a concept in a machine expressed as a symbolic label connecting two things.</p>
<p>This engineering-oriented definition of a relationship often led to a pedagogical tension between ourselves, information scientists and humanities scholars in the Bluesky research group. One of the forms this dialogue took was in the expression of <italic>counterexamples</italic>, which sought to express ideas that would upset our formal structures with the goal of improving them. Another form of dialogue, with information studies, revolved around the various categories of relationships, which are best viewed as a dynamic, evolving ontology, and thus presented a challenge to our database paradigm. Our response to these critiques was to do our best to incorporate suggestions, but it was still necessary to define some formal structure to create a working system. A digital framework is always ultimately a model.</p>
<p>Collaboration is, in some respects, absolutely essential to software engineering and knowledge production in a networked world. While there is always a place for pure computer science, the majority of socially useful engineering takes place in response to a need from another discipline. One challenge resides in the communication needed to make such collaborations work properly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022211426906">Adams and Birnbaum (1997)</xref> suggested that differences in expertise between the humanities and engineers are not necessarily as stereotypically distinct as one might imagine, and on one level the RoSE collaboration reflects this, as everyone involved could appreciate the structures we were developing together. On another level, however, owing to our methodological backgrounds, we found that there were critical differences in approach. This cultural background, in effect our academic training, is what required us all to reconceptualize the others’ disciplines.</p>
<p>The software engineers among us found it helpful to understand that critical inquiry can coexist with constructive development. Identifying different kinds of criticism was found to be essential in keeping a productive dialogue with others. Broad criticisms might revolve around the impact of technology on society as a whole, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474022211426906">Virilio’s (2000)</xref> <italic>The Information Bomb</italic>, which raises important questions regarding civilizations obsessed with data. Yet these kinds of discussions can sometimes be counterproductive to developing practical technical solutions to present-day problems. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022211426906">Dewar (2005 : 14)</xref> observes, the information age is ‘here to stay’. In another form, critical inquiry provides a basis on which new ideas and new approaches can be generated. It is in this regard that the development team found a productive collaboration as we settled into a cycle of constructive criticism, redesign, and re-implementation.</p>
<p>Another challenge was found in the differing views of what might be easy or difficult to implement. A solution cannot ultimately be completely free-form, as one would like, nor can it be exactly as one imagines, but follows instead a kind of constrained seeking for the right balance between our combined expertise and goals. The software development team found it important to acknowledge that some limits that we faced during programming could be trivially solved by thinking about them in another way. However, other features suggested by the humanities that appeared trivial to implement often were not. Regular communication addresses many of these issues, and we found it especially helpful to have everyone informed, and informing, the <italic>structure</italic> of the data in the system even if the implementation remained hidden.</p>
<p>As a digital humanities project, the question ultimately arises: how well do digital humanities tools such as RoSE serve the community or society at large? In general, a software engineer does not try to answer this question directly, but observes or measures the use of such tools by others. We view software as a perpetual, ever-changing structure that will continue to be enriched over time. Software is a form of human expression which is transient: it exists for a time, serves a purpose, and is replaced by a better version of itself (often quite rapidly). In this respect, it can never meet some ideal we might hold for it, but nor is it ever stationary or static, so criticisms are always momentary and contextual. Its impact, from an engineering perspective, only relates to the degree of its use or adoption by a society of living human beings. Thus, when media theorists speak of what ‘technology does to society’, what we implicitly understand them to mean is ‘what human beings using technology do to other human beings’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1474022211426906"><title>Information studies perspective</title>
<p>Any system of relational modeling that aspires to be useful across disciplines must carefully examine its informational architecture, including the assumptions implicit in the system elements themselves. Although RoSE was careful not to define itself merely as a repository or social network, the project necessarily made use of terminology and modes of inquiry from both of those pre-existing forms of knowledge representation. From the perspective of library science and information studies, however, it is also important to examine the mechanism by which the entities in RoSE (documents, people, and groups) were related. That is, the entities were made more tractable to computerized processing through developer-supplied metadata, which took the form of lists of potential relationships that could exist between pairs of entities. In particular, metadata consisted of relational and temporal information that linked people and documents. These linkages were expressed as social relationships between people in terms of their intellectual output, while for documents the connections were taken from conventions in scholarly, print-based culture (citations of other works, etc.).</p>
<p>Initially there was an attempt to find out how well an established metadata standard could handle the relationships determined within RoSE, so that a controlled vocabulary might be adopted. Dublin Core (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dublincore.org/">http://dublincore.org/</ext-link>) seemed like a promising starting point, since it includes a designated ‘relation’ element with several qualifiers that roughly corresponded to types of document relations that the RoSE team had been considering. However, upon closer examination, it was apparent that there were no means in Dublin Core for noting relations of commentary on a document by another, or for describing person-to-person relations. The ‘groups’ entity within RoSE was also problematic for Dublin Core. A controlled vocabulary became an unrealistic proposition given the eclectic subject matter. A more significant realization, however, was the inadequacy of the very notion of relationship for capturing the complexity of connections between entities as dynamic as people and documents. One way that was proposed to address this shortcoming, borrowing from humanities scholarship, was to re-conceptualize metadata in terms of narrative. This move was partly a result of the developers’ own need to create sample paths (narratives in the form of use cases) through the data and relationships that were being built into the system.</p>
<p>The experience from RoSE encourages documentation of decisions that ultimately shape the perception of interdisciplinary projects’ development and significance. Indeed, the creation of research narratives is a powerful act in any discipline. It is worthwhile to briefly consider the prospects of narrative as a form of information or knowledge. At the most basic level, narrative can be understood as a temporally structured story and its telling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022211426906">Chatman, 1978</xref>). Although there has been extensive theoretical deliberation about the definition of narrative, it can be loosely understood as a sense-making device, a purposeful arrangement of what transpired. This conception puts narrative in line with a constructivist approach to knowledge – just as metadata provides information about information (for formatting, content classification, and so on), narrative can organize information to make it more worth telling, through dramatization or other creative license. Thus, although perhaps most commonly a concern in literary studies, narrative is also employed to share and understand endeavors beyond the fictional. Moreover, as McCarty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022211426906">2005</xref>: 47) has reminded digital humanities scholars, ‘to conjecture is to pretend, to tell a story, literally to imagine… A conjecture is thus a kind of <italic>fiction</italic> in the etymological sense of something shaped, moulded, fashioned, made (L. <italic>fictio</italic>)’. By this assertion, then, much deductive research is not outside the purview of fiction, placing all the more import on collaborations between scholars in literature and those of fields not typically considered humanistic, such as information studies and software engineering.</p>
<p>Attention to narrative brought with it an acknowledgment of the implications for information structure and ontology more generally. Documents and people themselves can provide narrative structure through the stories they tell figuratively or literally (e.g. chronological sequences of events); they can also fit into such structures in relationship to each other. Thus, narrative seems to be both an intrinsic and extrinsic structuring device, enabling modulation of granularity and hierarchical ordering of parts, much like metadata. There are additional aspects of narratological thought that could be of interest for future development of knowledge environments, including an ontology of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474022211426906">Zarri, 2009</xref>) rather than one of concept-objects. Such a leap has interesting implications for humanities scholars and software engineers. In literary studies, for instance, an event-based schema would seem to lend itself organically to fiction and its reliance on plot; stories could be captured as series of happenings rather than hierarchies of concepts. Programmers might muse on the potential not of object-oriented languages, but of event-oriented ones, perhaps emphasizing transactions and holistic informational flows. For now though, it must suffice to say that relationships defined in terms of subjects and predicates, or concepts and their attributes, are binary expressions of phenomena – binaries that should be called into question, not just on the grounds of their reductive dualism, and not only by scholars of information studies.</p>
<p>Another part of the information studies prerogative was to recognize that, even while embracing and experimenting with the logic of social networks, there was dissatisfaction with currently existing conceptualizations of and approaches to relationships. The visualization of these relationships was a rallying point that helped members of each discipline involved to clarify their expectations for the project. Although visualization is sometimes touted as an analytic catalyst for noticing patterns, particular approaches to visualization in digital environments should not be accepted as natural; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474022211426906">Drucker and Nowviskie (2004)</xref> have argued that visualization, not just content, is also the message, with its own ideology and understanding of subjectivity. The work on RoSE highlights a greater need for further efforts to reimagine relationships as iterative, situational, and subjective.</p>
<p>Indeed, the designation of a relationship must involve more than simply being ‘related’ by virtue of shared subject headings (in repositories), more than computational sets or algorithmic processing (text analysis), and more than consensus-building (crowdsourcing) in order for the idea of ‘relationship’ to actually contribute to digital scholarship. In short, RoSE addressed this by facilitating for relationships both a more complex ontology, and flexible visualizations. RoSE and similar projects exist not only to facilitate arguments; they are also arguments in and of themselves by rendering visible the iterative process behind all of the linking activities taking place under the Web 2.0 banner. The entities can be related not merely as a result of historical facts, one-to-one correspondence between author and text, or direct citations. The people and documents in such digital humanities endeavors are themselves agents and products of interpretation, and the end result of visualization is also, in fact, a ‘document’.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1474022211426906"><title>Socially networked knowledge</title>
<p>As has been described, the RoSE team included scholars working in the fields of the humanities, engineering, and information studies. In our experiences as a group, RoSE has suggested an interdisciplinary connotation of ‘socially networked knowledge’, since the system itself is a testament to the collaboration required to build it. The ways in which our own collaborative social network functioned and adapted to develop this project is crucial to the digital humanities, which, by some definitions, is interdisciplinary by its very nature. The practices and fields of study that fall under this general term are diverse, ranging from the use of text analysis tools to analyze the corpus of an author’s work and the creation of digital archives, to the application of traditional humanities methodologies to study new media objects. In all of these examples, scholars must be proficient in multiple areas of study. Our collaboration highlighted the ways in which these various fields of study may at times conflict, in their aims or in their epistemologies. Scholars must be aware of their assumptions about the way objects are represented or coded in their own field; they must be judicious in mapping their own intellectual aims onto the affordances of specific technologies; and they must be willing to experiment with unfamiliar yet exciting new ideas alongside others.</p>
<p>Conceiving of entities as part of a social network thus provides some advantages over the aforementioned limitations of traditional computational models. By its nature, as nodes and links form, a social network provides a matrix of intertextual relations of increasing conceptual complexity such that even non-textual sources of influence can be included in the picture. We would suggest that projects such as RoSE, which offer a glimpse into new knowledge environments, exemplify modeling as a fundamental endeavor of the digital humanities, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022211426906">McCarty (2005</xref>: 37). As a model, socially networked knowledge is a simplification of the phenomena in play, but those omissions and inadequacies may still be useful to those who are ready to critically examine that converse side of models, as McCarty has also pointed out.</p>
<p>Socially networked knowledge is a particularly exciting area in that it represents the combination of several views of epistemology. For scholars in the humanities and literature, knowledge often centers on authorial or textual hermeneutics: in the present context, the concept of the <italic>relationship</italic>. In the field of software engineering, systems for knowledge extend back to the database in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022211426906">Codd, 1970</xref>), while systems for social networks began with Usenet, ARPANET, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474022211426906">Wellman, 2001</xref>). Our engineering efforts here focused on the explicit representation and visualization of semantic depth in complex social networks. In information studies, socially networked knowledge conceives of ontological issues as co-developing with the data and context in which they were created. With RoSE, we addressed this challenge by building a framework which organizes both contemporary relationships (social networks) and historic bibliographic data (knowledge).</p>
<p>The concept of socially networked knowledge has the potential to productively unite these disparate disciplines, while also presenting interesting design and collaboration challenges. The motivation to synthesize these data and knowledge paradigms extends from the observation that, in all disciplines, we would ideally like to think of people and knowledge together, as if phenotypes of the same flower.</p>

<fn id="fn4-1474022211426906"><label>4</label><p>Original emphasis. Moretti acknowledges that this is only an ideal; and he is of course correct that the visualization of a data set is open to subjective interpretation. Our point here is that the data set in question is itself already the product of subjective choices.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn5-1474022211426906"><label>5</label><p>One specific example from RoSE neatly illustrates the way that a data set can be interpretive and subjective. We decided to use the YAGO knowledge base to import data – including keyword tags – into RoSE, in order to accrue the kind of critical mass of data necessary for generating patterns. We understood that this choice ceded the input of data to people who were not necessarily experts in the field. YAGO imported a number of keywords to tag the author James Joyce: English as a Second Language Teachers, Irish Agnostics, Irish Expatriates in Austria–Hungary, Irish Expatriates in Croatia, Irish Expatriates in France, Irish Expatriates in Italy, Irish Expatriates in Switzerland, Irish Novelists, Irish Poets, Irish Short Story Writers, Person, Poet, Teacher, Writer. While this is a substantial set of attributes, it importantly neglects Joyce’s participation in the major literary movement of Modernism. With the data imported from YAGO, Joyce might show up in a network including contemporary Irish novelist Roddy Doyle (who has publicly stated his frustration that all Irish writers are frequently compared with Joyce), but not alongside his literary contemporaries Ezra Pound and Djuna Barnes (both of whom Joyce knew personally). More subtly, the list is fairly split on whether Joyce should be considered in the context of Ireland (Irish Novelists, Irish Poets) or Continental Europe (Irish Expatriates in . . .). Here RoSE microcosmically represents a split within Joyce studies itself.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn6-1474022211426906"><label>6</label><p>It is, of course, useful to be aware of oversights and to attempt to implement corrective measures; in RoSE, for example, a user could notice an omission and add a new keyword (for example, tagging James Joyce with the keyword Modernism).</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
