<p>The articles presented in this issue of PUS show that synthetic biology may be much discussed in elite and expert circles, but is nearly absent in public fora or the media. Even when looking at the amount of research on synthetic biology within some major European countries, it has to be admitted that synthetic biology is not a major field of funding or actual research. True, interest has been rising in recent years and many of its proponents claim that the really interesting breakthroughs are still to come in the near future. Yet, apparently there is the worry that several of the articles have addressed, namely that synthetic biology may eventually elicit the social and political controversies that Europe has experienced with genetically modified crops. One is eager to learn what to expect of the direction of future public reaction to further developments in synthetic biology.</p>
<p>Before engaging too deeply in this discussion, one could perhaps sit back and reflect on some basic, differently contextualised questions, like e.g. why do we worry so much about this possibility of social conflict in the first place, and, indeed, who is doing the worrying? And, if we are worrying about this, does that actually imply dissatisfaction about how the discussion of genetically modified crops eventually turned out? And does this worry imply a distrust of the regulatory mechanisms that resulted from this debate? Again, whose dissatisfaction and whose distrust?</p>
<p>As social scientists we have long accepted that there is no viewpoint from nowhere, that there is implicit commitment and bias in our studies, especially when they pertain to questions of current policy and shaping our scientific and technological world. Furthermore, we have assumedly internalised some common frameworks of reference, like for instance the view that assessments of techno-science are most useful when moving as much as possible upstream, when we are pro-active and precautionary. And we commonly assume that public engagement in one form or another in these assessments and debates is to be taken as a good, as something that appeals to our visions of deliberative democracy and that may contribute to more robust technological development. Together with insights from STS traditions like e.g. the co-evolution of science and society or the role of competing narratives supported by different actors, a framework has evolved that guides us in forming our research questions and justifies as meaningful and relevant our research-based contributions to policy. But times change and what was meaningful once need not remain meaningful forever. Often we pride ourselves on an inbuilt reflexivity, on contextualising technology debates in order to break through naïve schemes of fact and value or benefit and risk. Do we need to contextualise afresh our own frameworks and get in touch with societal realities that have moved beyond our understandings?</p>
<sec id="section1-0963662511434433">
<title>Why should the public be engaged?</title>
<p>In fact, Kronberger, Holtz and Wagner (this issue) stress at one point that “it is important to ask why people should learn about and discuss science and technology at all.” Indeed, why should they? Several researchers have experienced a certain “stakeholder fatigue”, i.e. the difficulty in mobilising sufficient engagement among stakeholders in relation to scientific or technological developments. What if science and technology does not provide enough conflict material? Apparently the societal distrust towards our regulatory mechanisms that was detected in relation to genetically modified crops is not so all-encompassing that it involves all techno-scientific developments. Information technology, medical research and even nanotechnology come out positively in most surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511434433">Gaskell et al., 2010</xref>). That is why a number of the articles in this issue discuss how synthetic biology is cast into more familiar representations, i.e. “anchored” or what Torgersen and Hampel (this issue) refer to as “frozen experiences.” Will the anchoring of synthetic biology within the area of genetically modified crops imply similarity in relation to conflict potential or will an alternative anchoring within engineering imply the absence of such conflicts?</p>
<p>The <italic>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</italic> featured an article in May 2011 which reported a recent survey indicating that (even) in Germany a general belief in progress and science is gaining a significant foothold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511434433">Petersen, 2011</xref>). This seems in line with some of the recent Eurobarometers on this topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511434433">Gaskell et al., 2010</xref>). Those technologies that dominated the media and parts of the public discussion some years ago (e.g. cloning, GM crops, stem cells, research on embryos), seem now peripheral in relation to the promised prospects of other technologies. Engineers and scientists were reported to be the group on which people placed the greatest hopes for a better future. Shall we read this as a green light for technological development <italic>per se</italic>?</p>
<p>We do not believe these are idle questions, rather they may guide us towards theoretical tensions that have built up within our scholarship over the years. With the “coming of age” of public engagement we may now see clearer why younger scholars increasingly may view public engagement as the <italic>problem</italic>, rather than the <italic>solution</italic> as assumedly was the case for their mentors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511434433">Delgado, Kjølberg and Wickson, 2011</xref>). We need to ask (again) why we want the public (or rather the publics) to be engaged in techno-scientific developments in the first place, whether we thus pursue an instrumental, substantial or normative rationale, how this relates to the problem of closure in such exercises, how we construct the public, who is represented, or whether far upstream is indeed always the best starting point rather than later. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511434433">Delgado et al. (2011)</xref> ask these questions from the vantage point of just entering the field, i.e. with relatively little symbolic capital to defend. I believe that the only honest answer to their challenge is that we are indeed not yet totally clear about these issues, and that they crop up as soon as we turn to new areas of interest as in this case synthetic biology. They encountered these questions in relation to nanotechnology and it is interesting to note how similar some of the problems are. Has not nanotechnology been loaded with the same kind of worry from the start, namely not to repeat the societal conflicts that were experienced in regard to GM crops? And is it not the pride of the nanotechnology community that they claim to address the societal issues from the start, much as many synthetic biologists seem to welcome the ELSI activities?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0963662511434433">
<title>No conflict material found?</title>
<p>Now, one of the general conclusions of all the articles presented here is apparently that in regard to synthetic biology so far no signals are being detected which would indicate alarming tendencies of social conflict. The funding of research in this field largely acknowledges the need of accompanying ELSI studies and some are indeed under way (Lei Pei, Sybille Gaisser and Markus Schmidt, this issue); media representations of synthetic biology, at least in the German language media, have been ambivalent between “fascination and repulsion” without over-exposing potential conflict areas (Brigitte Gschmeidler and Alexandra Seiringer, this issue); information uptake and deliberation are based on peer processes in people’s social networks and largely resemble patterns known from earlier discussions, stressing the need to clarify the purpose and goal of public engagement exercises (Nicole Kronberger, Peter Holtz and Wolfgang Wagner, this issue); and, utilising a theoretical model of controversy emergence, it is argued that very little points to the direction that synthetic biology will repeat the earlier controversies on genetically modified foodstuffs (Helge Torgersen and Jürgen Hampel, this issue).</p>
<p>Do we find this result reassuring and promising, or problematic and troublesome? If we find it problematic and troublesome, we may easily find ourselves in the trap of a reversed deficit model. In the reversed model, one would claim that the public do not mobilise sufficient conflict material because they do not yet know enough about synthetic biology. But what is there to know that the public do not recognise? Time and again the studies confirm that issues of benefits, risks, safety, security and ethics are very much at the forefront of public concerns. Apparently these are also the issues which funders turn to in their ELSI efforts and of which regulatory agencies are made aware and try to deal with through public engagement. And anyway, who is to define what relevant knowledge about a techno-science consists of?</p>
<p>Again, this points us in the direction of problematising the notion of the role and nature of expertise. Can we meaningfully differentiate between general questions of politics and more technical questions that are largely internal to science? Facts and values may be intrinsically intertwined <italic>in abstracto</italic>, but will there not be matters of degree when it comes to more specific questions? For instance, should we assume that synthetic biology will create much larger uncertainties and risks than e.g. more traditional molecular biology? After all, many claim that synthetic biology is built on inherent shortcuts with significant knowledge gaps.</p>
<p>But should we find the lack of controversy promising then? Promising for whom? Obviously, technological development without social conflict might imply somewhat less urgency, at least when seen from a policy maker’s perspective, of accompanying social science research. That research is not a goal in itself, it is only instrumental in relation to finding good solutions, among them technological solutions, to pressing problems of our times. Perhaps it is promising for those that work within synthetic biology. It might provide them with enough time to actually come up with some of the goods and benefits that they so emphatically put forward as the goal of the activities. Perhaps the present absence of societal conflict material might give the community of synthetic biologists the time to consolidate its own group identity and understanding of the subject.</p>
<p>Culture, values and identity matter when considering issues of precaution and risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511434433">Jasanoff, 2005</xref>): they have to be taken into account when considering the public understanding of science. The GM controversy in Europe and the lack of public reactions in the USA is a clear example of the latter. While Europeans seem to put emphasis on precaution, Americans by and large seem more risk tolerant. One could think of similar developments for the case of synthetic biology, i.e. a presumed cultural or ideological divide between Europe and the USA. But who is to initiate this process of defining a balanced self-identity of the field?</p>
<p>In passing one might take note of the fact that quite a few scientists working in related fields characterise the discussions about synthetic biology as “hype.” Many claim that the important breakthroughs that synthetic biologists put forward in public discussions are actually not so imminent. The road to concrete products might be long and cumbersome. Or the intended results may not come at all, at least not in the near future. But, of course, that is mere guesswork. In nanotechnology and in information technology we have witnessed developments that have put products on the market even before a thorough assessment or societal discussion has taken place.</p>

<title>Good governance is key</title>
<p>For whom is knowledge about expected or possible societal conflicts over a technology or specific applications of this technology of importance? Assumedly this would be important for designing good governance models. Anticipating conflicts and addressing the problematic issues is part of good governance of science and technology. Governance is needed because decisions are made already now that influence the future path of (European) efforts in synthetic biology: decisions on the level of individual researchers and research teams when it comes to choice and design of projects, decisions on the level of regional authorities and institutions of higher education and research, e.g. when it comes to efforts of building up competence clusters, decisions on the level of national and European funders (ESF or EC) on what projects to fund, how much money to put into this area (in competition with other fields), and what structures to implement for these fundings, and, finally, decisions on the level of regulators who constantly are under pressure to have appropriate, updated regulatory tools at hand to meet the new techno-scientific challenges. If you make investments now, in particular when you make these investments on behalf of society (public spending), if you initiate policies with long-term perspectives, you obviously have a substantial interest in some degree of foresight, in particular with regard to the long-term societal acceptability of these policies, you want to engage in “robust” technologies rather than in developments that might never reach the marketplace.</p>
<p>Synthetic biology seems a favourite candidate for discussing governance issues, in particular social, ethical and legal issues connected with it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511434433">Zhang, Marris and Rose (2011)</xref> report that during the last seven years some 40 reports – all of them written in English – have addressed these issues raised by synthetic biology. This is an impressive record, indicating an intense interest from people who usually deal with such governance issues, in spite of the conflicting narratives that seem to accompany its current status (p. 6). Claims such as those by Kelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511434433">2007</xref>: 4) that “the ability to understand, modify, and ultimately create new life at the molecular level clearly represents a scientific paradigm shift,” help to create an atmosphere of perceived urgency.</p>
<p>The European Union has embraced the concept of good governance, specifically for, but not restricted to matters of science and technology policy. Five principles have been asserted as underpinning good governance: openness, participation, accountability, effectiveness and coherence. At the same time there seems to be a recognition that good governance is a moving target and thus the EC in its sixth framework programme FP6 was among others asking for more flexible frameworks of governance, thus implying that there is at least some need for improvement. The present author is among those who see possibilities for improvement and are engaged in an EU project called Value Isobars (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.value-isobars.eu">www.value-isobars.eu</ext-link>). The rationale of this project is that knowledge about and engagement with people’s underlying values provide for better governance in the sense of strengthening robust technology developments. From this perspective one would be interested to probe deeper than e.g. merely the assertion that ethics plays a role in the evaluation of synthetic biology. The question would then be to describe in more detail the values that come into play in this area and to see whether there are any fundamental value conflicts and dilemmas involved. It is typically when values clash that good governance is most needed. Yet, reliable knowledge about people’s values is difficult to come by, as this project also shows.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0963662511434433">
<title>Further research needed?</title>
<p>One might see a research agenda implied in the above remarks. First, there is the need to gain better empirical insights into the societal values that one is so worried about and that inform our ethical judgements about technologies. Existing value surveys have the disadvantage that they among others do not really couple values to matters of science and technology, and existing surveys on the latter, as e.g. Eurobarometers, have the disadvantage that they focus more on current attitudes and perceptions than on underlying long-term value-identities connected to science and technology. Harvesting good data on values for science and technology from existing materials, and exploring new quantitative and qualitative approaches to uncover underlying values would be a clear research need then.</p>
<p>Second, in governance we typically also employ foresight exercises, like e.g. scenario processes. Future scenarios are usually constructed along two main dimensions: major uncertainties and major drivers. Now, if values are indeed important for designing socially robust technologies, one might venture the claim that major societal values attached to the technology in question should be a third dimension in the construction of the scenarios, or, alternatively, be explicitly included among the major drivers. How to do this in practice is still unclear, and again we might see a research need here.</p>
<p>Third, in order to foreshadow public reactions ELSI studies and participatory exercises are utilised in current governance models, but in the light of the above remarks one might surmise that the conception of the public is still somewhat one-sided. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511434433">Stirling (2008)</xref> argued, there may be three rationales for public engagement: instrumental, substantive and normative. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511434433">Wickson, Delgado and Kjølberg (2010)</xref> argue convincingly that in the case of nanotechnology one has experiences with the first two, but perhaps the greatest challenge arises when we attempt to engage the public as citizens. It is precisely this latter appeal to citizenship which poses a challenge also to synthetic biology. Have we perhaps treated the public in this either as laity or as consumers, while overlooking the importance of the public as citizens? And what would that imply more concretely? Would existing exercises such as citizen juries or consensus conferences remedy this or do we need new participatory mechanisms, and in that case which? If underlying value landscapes in society are indeed important for the social robustness of technology development, then it seems that engaging the public as citizens might at least potentially bring underlying societal values more explicitly up for debate. How best to achieve this in synthetic biology and other areas would assumedly be a third research need.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0963662511434433">
<title>Synthetic biology – a proper object of governance?</title>
<p>Values become clearer when specific, concrete uses and applications are targeted. But in this regard synthetic biology has so far little to offer, it seems. Indeed, reports such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511434433">Zhang, Marris and Rose (2011)</xref> conclude that synthetic biology may not easily fall under traditional conceptions of governance, as these focus too much on evidence and governmental action, but one should rather widen the concept of government into a new “art of governance.”</p>
<p>Now, if that is the case, then one may ask another question, namely whether it does make sense to single out synthetic biology as a major area of scientific funding, as some proponents argue. From a governance point of view, if a techno-scientific field has too little to offer in terms of concrete results, then there might exist very few good reasons to promote it in grand style when resources are limited and other fields seem promising to solve important questions as well. If we detect that public attitude and perception is hard pressed to form any stable opinion, and if all judgements are indeed made only by reference to other areas that are known from earlier and are more concrete, then this might affect not only our expectations about potential societal conflicts but also our reasoning about the weight of potential benefits. When we cannot detect the values that might clash, then we may also not be able to detect the values that would motivate us to single out this area for major funding at the expense of other areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0963662511434433">
<title>Dual-use as a particular challenge?</title>
<p>There are, of course, questions that good governance may need to address that are not easily reflected in value-based deliberations of or with the public. These are questions the significance of which demands some fundamental and technical insights into the practice of synthetic biology. The question of dual-use may be a case in point. Dual-use as an issue falls outside the usual conflict lines between, say, technocrats vs. lay public, corporate interests vs. societal benefits, markets vs. states, progressivists vs. conservatives etc. The interesting feature of dual-use is among others that virtually all actors agree on the necessity to avoid the possibility of military and particularly terrorist uses of the technology. The question is not whether to avoid this, but rather how, without thereby severely limiting the scientific process itself, and what the consequences are when no good mechanisms are found to provide this bio-security. Governance of synthetic biology will have to deal with this question, yet it is by no means clear what increased public engagement might have to contribute on this issue. Perhaps one might want to delegate it to the appropriate experts? Or perhaps soft law with an appeal to the moral responsibility of the individual might help?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0963662511434433">
<title>Outlook</title>
<p>Is there any role at all left for the social scientist or humanistic or STS scholar in regard to synthetic biology, given that we have questioned several standard answers? Maybe we need to remind ourselves what it is that the social sciences and the humanities always have been good at, namely, as we see it, the ability to pose good fundamental questions. There may indeed be a need to challenge the naïve self-understandings of synthetic biologists, to inject a certain amount of reflexivity into the portrayals of their field, and to contextualise their narratives and imageries within their cultural embedding. Good questions do not always presuppose answers, but they may initiate them. Social sciences, the humanities and the STS community can be a mediator within techno-scientific culture, but the process of mediation might require a partial re-evaluation of our standard methodological tools, and, indeed, a reflection on our goals and theoretical outlooks. It may also include the realisation that we need to engage in further research before we are fully up to the tasks ahead of us. The articles presented here may help us to see this challenge more clearly.</p>
<p>So, perhaps it is early still to pass any judgement on synthetic biology, perhaps a wait-and-see attitude is the most adequate basis for good governance in this area, leave developments largely to the actors who are already in the field. We cannot read a governance imperative out of the studies that are presented here. That is no shortcoming of the studies themselves, but rather the consequence of the fact that decision making requires more than factual information, it requires a normative stance, a set goal. It also requires the weighing of implicit uncertainties. And with some further reflection we might find reason in the attitude of the public, reason in the sense of not falling for the hype on the one hand, but also not falling for premature crisis mongers on the other hand. But then, of course, these are our reflections – the reader might find otherwise.</p>
