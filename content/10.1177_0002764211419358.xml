<p>Exposure to the mass media is increasing in the United States and around the world. The US Census bureau reports that by 2010 the average American adult was exposed to 3,620 hours of media a year, up from 3,340 in 2000. This amounts to over 5 months of each year spent watching television, reading newspapers, listening to the radio, and surfing the Internet. Not only has the amount of exposure to the mass media increased, but the type and content of media coverage have also been transformed. One such change is the increased prominence of images in the media, particularly news media. This new prominence is made possible because of changes in printing technology and the rise of mediums, such as the Internet, that allow more images to be included alongside written news stories. In addition, images are placed in more prominent positions within newspapers and online news sources. For example, most newspapers have a large front page photograph that serves to focus reader attention.</p>
<p>While images are clearly an important part of modern mass media, little systematic attention has been given to the messages and meanings that images convey. It is clearly understood that the texts of articles, scripts of television shows, and Internet content shape the public’s understanding of issues and events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764211419358">Entman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764211419358">Shoemaker &amp; Reese, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764211419358">Smith, McCarthy, McPhail, &amp; Augustin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211419358">Snow, Vliegenthart, &amp; Corrigall-Brown, 2007</xref>). However, relatively little attention has been given to the images that often accompany these news stories and programs. This omission is all the more surprising given the increasing importance of images in how news is presented. This special issue brings light to the role of images in a variety of political contexts around the world, including Canada, the United States, the Netherlands, France, and the Middle East. Through these cases, the authors examine how images in newspapers, newswires, television news, and electoral posters shape public understanding of contemporary political and social issues.</p>
<p>Both images and text convey meaning about the social world. However, there is reason to believe that images do not convey meaning in the same way as do texts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764211419358">Messaris and Abraham (2001)</xref> argue that because images seem realistic and appear to simply show the world as it is, framing that occurs through visuals is often harder to distinguish and viewers may be less likely to consider the selection that occurs in this process. Because of this, images can be potentially more effective in communicating specific interpretations of news events than framing that occurs in textual accounts.</p>
<p>The importance of images also stems from the strong physiological and emotional impact images elicit from viewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211419358">Bradley, Codispoty, Cuthbert, &amp; Lang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764211419358">Iyer &amp; Oldmeadow, 2006</xref>), and the emotionality of images is one of the main themes to emerge from the articles in this special issue. Dahmen, for example, reports the results of an experiment she conducted examining how different images accompanying the same article on the stem cell debate in the United States vary in their emotional impact on viewers. She finds that when paired with the same textual article, an image of a man in a wheelchair received more attention than a photograph of U.S. President Barack Obama signing legislation. She posits that this occurred in part because of the heightened emotionality of the first image in comparison with the second. Emotions triggered by images can draw the attention of readers and encourage them to engage with an issue.</p>
<p>Journalists and editors have some agency in the level of emotionality they depict in the images presented in the media. Fahmy’s article on the newswire coverage of the Gaza Conflict 2008-2009 shows how images can frame violence and casualties in a way that humanizes the victims and creates sympathy for them or to justify increased military action. In addition, journalists and editors decide where in the newspaper, news broadcast, or online certain stories and images will appear. Rohlinger and Klein, in their study of news coverage of the abortion debate in the Unites States, find that articles on the first page of a newspaper are more likely to use dramatic visuals. This means that issues such as the abortion debate, that have been in the news consistently over a long period of time, often get less dramatic visuals because they do not make the front page. In addition, earlier coverage of an issue can set the norms of coverage that the issue will later receive. Groups and individuals that primarily engage in protest in the early days of a movement may find these images difficult to move beyond, even if they engage in other types of activities (Rohlinger and Klein, this issue). These decisions of what and where to place visuals can affect the emotional resonance that an issue will have for the public over time.</p>
<p>All of the articles in this issue examine political issues and actions, ranging from traditional elections to contentious mobilizations. These articles emphasize the significance of images in how they can impact our understanding of current and historical events, how they work to legitimate (or delegitimize) groups, and finally, how they can change the ways in which politics operates. The importance of images for shaping politics and the public’s view of events and support for government or other action is the second main theme of this special issue.</p>
<p>Images are important because of how they can impact understanding of current and historical events. Keith’s examination of the commemorative coverage of the Liberation of Paris in this issue illustrates this and shows how visual coverage has the potential to narrow memory (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764211419358">Zelizer, 1998</xref>). She argues that there is a narrowing of what we remember and that the Parisian media visually reduced the story of the liberation, “a complex story with many participants and facets—to a grand party led by an authoritative leader.” Both Wetzel’s article on the occupation of Alcatraz and Corrigall-Brown and Wilkes’ article about the 1990 Oka Crisis also make this point and illustrate how certain images of events stand the test of time and come to represent much larger and more complex historical processes.</p>
<p>Images are also important because they can legitimize (or delegitimize) different groups of people. Wetzel’s examination of the occupation of Alcatraz by the Indians of All Tribes shows that coverage at the time of the occupation focused on “lazing Indians” rather than on agency and organization. In addition, the prominent focus on non-human images, for example panoramic shots of the island itself, took attention and sympathy away from the individuals involved. Corrigall-Brown and Wilkes’ study of the Oka Conflict in Canada also illustrate these processes of de-legitimation and show how images of violence undermine collective actors, in this case Mohawks engaged in resistance blockades.</p>
<p>Images are a central part of how citizens come to understand the actions of governments and elites. And, these images can challenge how governments work and how citizens experience politics. Vliegenthart’s article discusses the hypothesis that there is an increased personalization of politics and that over time, there has become more focus on political leaders and less on ideology and issues. Through a systematic examination of Dutch election posters over 60 years, he shows that though this is true for texts, this is not the case for images. For example, political leaders are referred to less often in texts but are featured more prominently in images over time. In addition, visual representations of ideology are decreasing over time while textual references to ideology are increasing. In fact, consistency between image and texts has decreased over the period of his analysis, 1946 to 2006. This article highlights the importance of examining texts and images separately rather than assuming that what we know about trends over time garnered from texts is also generalizeable to images.</p>
<p>The seven articles in this special issue all highlight the importance of images for conveying messages and meaning about social and political issues. Through systematic analyses of a wide array of issues in international perspective, the authors highlight the unique qualities of images and how they differ from text in the types of messages they are relaying to the public. While there needs to be considerably more attention paid to the visual dimension of the media, these articles begin to address this lacuna in the literature by taking the visual seriously.</p>
