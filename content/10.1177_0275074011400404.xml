<abstract>
<p>The authors examine the influence of teacher and administrator representation by race and ethnicity on disciplinary tools and standardized test scores within traditional public elementary schools and charter schools. The authors argue that school officials within charter schools will be less likely to consider race and ethnicity when making schooling decisions because of their attention to the culture and norms within charter schools. As a result, the authors expect that the translation from passive to active representation will be more difficult in charter schools than in traditional elementary schools. Using data from Georgia, the authors analyze this question empirically and find a statistically significant influence of representation among teachers on disciplinary tools and test scores and a more limited influence of administrative representation on standardized tests. Findings also support the central research question of this study, that is, whether the effects of racial and ethnic representation appear more limited among charter schools than traditional public schools.</p>

<p>Research on representative bureaucracy demonstrates that bureaucratic representation may influence the selection of policy tools and resulting policy outcomes. For instance, when bureaucrats mirror the target population that they serve on key demographic dimensions, they are more likely to formulate positive social constructions of service recipients, which may lead to the selection of more rehabilitative tools and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074011400404">Roch, Pitts, &amp; Navarro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074011400404">Schneider &amp; Ingram, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074011400404">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0275074011400404">1997</xref>). A key question in representative bureaucracy research is how passive representation—the bureaucracy matching the general population on attributes such as race or gender—leads to active representation, which occurs when public officials formulate and implement policies that benefit the interests of represented groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074011400404">Keiser, Wilkins, Meier, &amp; Holland, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074011400404">Meier, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0275074011400404">Selden, 1997</xref>). Research shows that passive representation is likely to “translate” into active representation when bureaucrats are afforded discretion in their jobs through policy making or implementation, when the policy issue is salient to the specific group being represented, and when professional norms appear unlikely to inhibit this transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074011400404">Keiser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074011400404">Meier &amp; Bohte, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074011400404">Sowa &amp; Selden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011400404">Wilkins &amp; Keiser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074011400404">Wilkins &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074011400404">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these relationships are fairly well entrenched in the research literature, the changing landscape of K-12 education suggests that they be revisited due to the growing popularity of charter schools. As we will demonstrate below, charter schools operate very differently from public schools, and some of these differences may hinder the link between passive and active representation. Charter schools appear to be more likely than traditional public schools to socialize administrators and teachers to a core set of specialized norms and values, and this socialization may influence an educator’s behavior more than his or her race and ethnicity. There is evidence that policy contexts with strong socialization practices—public safety organizations, for example—are less likely than others to demonstrate a passive-active representation link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074011400404">Wilkins &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074011400404">2009</xref>). As a result, we believe that charter schools are not as likely as traditional public schools to see passive representation translate into active representation.</p>
<p>This article is an empirical examination of racial and ethnic representation in public schools, with a specific focus on how representation differs between charter schools and traditional public schools. We begin by examining past research on representative bureaucracy, followed by a discussion of representation specifically in the context of charter schools. Next we turn to an empirical analysis, using 3 years of data from Georgia elementary schools. We first examine the relationship between representative bureaucracy and student outcomes in public elementary schools generally and then turn to investigate whether the effect of representation among teachers and administrators in charter schools differs from that in regular public schools. We close by examining the extent to which our findings are driven by the school’s racial and ethnic context by comparing schools with mostly White students to those with mostly African American students and those where no racial and ethnic group comprises the majority.</p>
<sec id="section1-0275074011400404">
<title>Representative Bureaucracy</title>
<p>The link between passive and active representation is based on research showing that people with similar characteristics are apt to have similar values and beliefs (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0275074011400404">Dolan &amp; Rosenbloom, 2003</xref>). Individuals with life experiences and identities that overlap, whether along gender, racial, ethnic, or other lines, are likely to have similar ideas about the role of government. As those individuals “match,” or as bureaucracy becomes representative of the public, those shared ideas translate into benefits for groups that are represented.</p>
<p>Research has identified two necessary conditions for passive representation to translate into active representation. The demographic dimension must be salient to the policy area in question and bureaucrats must have discretion to affect service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074011400404">Keiser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074011400404">Sowa &amp; Selden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074011400404">Wilkins &amp; Keiser, 2006</xref>). The first condition is almost certainly met for racial and ethnic representation in public schools, as student race and ethnicity have historically been key considerations in the formulation of education policy. The second condition should also be met here, as teachers and administrators wield considerable influence over how students are taught, disciplined, and managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074011400404">Keiser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074011400404">Meier &amp; Bohte, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074011400404">Sowa &amp; Selden, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The patterns with which a teacher or administrator uses discretion to affect student outcomes depends on how that individual formulates his or her work role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0275074011400404">Selden, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074011400404">Sowa &amp; Selden, 2003</xref>). School officials determine whether and how their racial and ethnic identity influences decision making by the work role that they establish for themselves. If a teacher or administrator assumes a role as minority advocate, he or she is likely to use discretion to benefit students from the same background. On the other hand, if a teacher or administrator assumes a neutral, more objective role, then he or she is not as likely to make decisions that benefit students from the same racial and ethnic group. Organizational tenure, degree of influence, and membership in a minority racial and ethnic group have been shown to affect whether an individual assumes a work role as advocate or objective bureaucrat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074011400404">Selden, Brudney, &amp; Kellough, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074011400404">Sowa &amp; Selden, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Past research that has examined the influence of racial and ethnic representation within schools has largely shown that there are representational influences among teachers at the street level, though researchers have not found consistent effects among administrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074011400404">Meier, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0275074011400404">Pitts, 2007</xref>). Strong professional norms may lead to weaker representational effects among administrators, causing them to act less subjectively as advocates for the students that they represent. These norms appear likely to discourage administrators from assuming a role of minority advocate, though empirical research has not established the extent to which a school administrator’s role is affected by organizational factors. There is little empirical research on the impact of socialization and professional norms on representation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074011400404">Wilkins and Williams (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074011400404">2009)</xref> found that socialization appeared to prevent African American and Latino police officers from actively representing citizens with similar backgrounds. However, the police community is marked by a high degree of professional socialization—much higher than in public schools—which makes it unclear whether one might expect the same relationship in education. Overall, it appears that racial and ethnic representation among teachers may influence outcomes in the schools, whereas representation among administrators appears less likely to lead to consistent effects.</p>
<p>There are several different ways to consider the effect that representation may have on outcomes within the schools. For instance, teachers or administrators may influence outcomes through their choice of policy tools during the implementation of policy. These choices may support the use of tools that vary in the degree to which they represent the use of more or less punitive actions taken in response to students’ behavior. For instance, we are likely to see this type of variation in the use of tools in areas like student discipline where public officials have significant discretion during implementation. In this case, the school board or superintendent may support a formal discipline policy with strict rules that provide specific consequences for particular infractions. Other times, school-level administrators may have primary discretion over student outcomes instead of the school board or superintendent. In either case, teachers are likely to have a significant amount of discretion over how discipline cases are handled within the classroom and how they describe student behaviors to school administrators. Some teachers may choose to address discipline cases informally and only choose to report more extreme cases to administrators, and others may report minor infractions. Their actions are likely to depend on the extent to which they assume a role of minority advocate, in which case they likely make specific decisions to benefit students from the same racial and ethnic group. Teachers that assume a role of neutral bureaucrat are likely to make an effort <italic>not</italic> to give special preference to students from the same group.</p>
<p>Active representation may result in the use of disciplinary actions that are less severe than strict punitive sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074011400404">Roch et al., 2010</xref>). In the context of student behavioral problems, we can consider policy tools as either more likely to support learning and capacity building or as more closely associated with potentially stigmatizing sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074011400404">Schneider &amp; Ingram, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074011400404">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0275074011400404">1997</xref>). For instance, schools can use more complex and costly disciplinary actions that are also more rehabilitative in nature, such as in-school suspension or alternative school arrangements. Under these types of arrangements, students are kept in a school environment and usually receive some sort of counseling or behavioral therapy to address the reasons behind the student’s misbehavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074011400404">Green &amp; Barnes, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074011400404">Short, Short, &amp; Blanton, 1994</xref>). Otherwise, schools may use simple “punishments” that provide little in the way of rehabilitation—these tools may include expulsion or out-of-school suspension. In general, disciplinary tools involving punitive measures like out-of-school suspension appear to be used disproportionately when students are minorities (U.S. Dept. of Education, 1999). Thus, we expect</p>

</list>
<p>Representation may also influence educational outcomes in the schools, though the evidence is much stronger for teacher representation than administrator representation. Teachers may educate a broader range of students more effectively if there is a high degree of racial and ethnic match between school officials and students. Past research has shown that racial and ethnic representation corresponds to higher minority student test scores, more minority students attending college, fewer minority students dropping out of school, and more minority students taking advanced classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074011400404">Meier &amp; Bohte, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0275074011400404">Meier, O’Toole, &amp; Nicholson-Crotty, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0275074011400404">Pitts, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0275074011400404">2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074011400404">Meier, Wrinkle, and Polinard (1999)</xref> suggest that minority students may benefit in several ways from the presence of minority teachers. Minority teachers may be better at teaching minority students, may be likely to serve as role models, and may help alleviate negative consequences associated with tracking (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0275074011400404">Pitts, 2007</xref>, p. 503). It is important to note that some research finds that gains among minorities in fact cost other students, suggesting that representation works as a zero-sum game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074011400404">Nielsen &amp; Wolf, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0275074011400404">Pitts, 2007</xref>); other research suggests that all students can benefit from representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074011400404">Meier et al., 1999</xref>). In this study, we consider whether all students in a school benefit from racial representation among school officials. Thus, we expect</p>

<title>Representation and Socialization in Charter Schools</title>
<p>Whether charter schools are more or less likely than traditional public schools to promote a passive-active representation link is an empirical question that has not yet been addressed in the public administration or education policy literatures. However, the logic behind such a link is much stronger for traditional public schools than for charter schools, which tend to build and reinforce organizational cultures with specific norms and values about education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074011400404">Deal &amp; Hentschke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074011400404">Hill et al., 2001</xref>). We believe that this encourages employee socialization that, like with police officers, has the potential to outweigh a priori values based on one’s racial and ethnic identity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074011400404">Wilkins &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074011400404">2009</xref>). This socialization would encourage educators to make decisions on the basis of a consistent and coherent educational philosophy, not on the basis of whether the teacher and student come from the same racial and ethnic background.</p>
<p>Charter schools are more likely than traditional public schools to inculcate particular norms and values in their employees for a couple of reasons. First, the charter school movement emerged as a means of introducing market-like competition into K-12 education, so charter schools often mimic the behaviors of for-profit firms seeking to fill a market niche (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074011400404">Buckley &amp; Schneider, 2007</xref>). Charter schools are typically created in reaction to a perceived weakness in existing traditional public schools, with some focusing on an innovative alternative teaching philosophy (e.g., KIPP) and others focusing on the needs of a segment of the target population (e.g., bilingual students, students interested in fine arts). Like for-profit firms, charter schools are more likely to succeed in the market if they create a strong organizational culture that reinforces the organization’s mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0275074011400404">Holyoke et al., 2007</xref>). A charter school’s survival is premised on its ability to fill a market need, and this is likely to motivate employees to rally around a set of guiding principles and goals.</p>
<p>Second, charter schools often attract teachers and administrators with norms and values that are similar to those of existing employees. As discussed by Deal and Hentschke (p. 17), “By virtue of thematic focus, charter schools are able to attract like-minded parents, students, teachers, and administrators, and perforce can form a more socially cohesive community.” School officials may also work to find teachers that fit closely with the objectives of a particular school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0275074011400404">Podgursky &amp; Ballou, 2001</xref>). For example, charter schools tend to be founded by entrepreneurs with very specific educational philosophies and who are very likely to hire others with the same values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074011400404">Deal &amp; Hentschke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0275074011400404">Podgursky &amp; Ballou, 2001</xref>). In general, there exists a strong emphasis on charter schools to compete for talent by presenting a cohesive environment that suggests that the school’s staff and teachers are engaged in a collaborative relationship focused on similar goals and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074011400404">Hill et al., 2001</xref>). These goals and values comprise the mission endemic to each school, resulting in themes such as a focus on self-directed learning or helping low-income urban children prepare for college (e.g., U.S. Department of Education, 2004). Although these themes vary across schools, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074011400404">Malloy and Wohlstetter (2003</xref>, p. 234) find that teachers “emphasized that the school mission was the glue: ‘Our mission unifies us. We’re all on the same team.’”</p>
<p>Thus, we expect to see a greater focus on professional norms and culture within charter schools than in traditional public schools, and this is in turn likely to dampen the translation of passive representation into active representation. Since teachers and administrators enjoy tremendous discretion in both types of schools, the strong professional norms and socialization that is present in charter schools is likely to encourage officials to assume a more neutral role. Unless explicitly specified by the charter, it is difficult for individuals working in charter schools to take on a role of minority advocate, since there is typically a much stronger set of factors that are embedded in the mission and culture that overshadow considerations linked to race and ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074011400404">Hill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074011400404">Malloy &amp; Wohlstetter, 2003</xref>). Schools with a mission that focuses specifically on racial and ethnic issues will be an exception, but in those cases, we do not expect to see a relationship between a teacher’s race and ethnicity and student’s race and ethnicity because <italic>all</italic> teachers—regardless of racial background—are socialized to the same values. If all employees take on roles as minority advocates, passive representation will be largely irrelevant, since active representation will occur on its own.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that charter schools are typically smaller than traditional public schools, which means that administrators and peers can more actively monitor the teaching styles of individual instructors. Those that deviate from the core mission will be incentivized to alter teaching methods in order to be more consistent with school-wide objectives. Even if a charter school teacher feels deeply that his or her work role should be as a minority advocate, the small size of charter schools will make it tough to do so if it means deviating from the core educational philosophy. As a result, we should see little change in charter schools in the areas of discipline and student tests scores as representation changes across schools.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>To examine these research questions, we use data on 1,263 public Georgia elementary schools for the periods 2005-2006, 2006-2007, and 2007-2008. We exclude from our analysis those schools that are not considered regular elementary schools or charter schools. We do not include middle schools or high schools for several reasons. First, student discipline outcomes are qualitatively different among the three levels. We could control for school level as a means of addressing this, but we anticipate that the slopes for many independent variables would be different for the three types of schools, and modeling for that would require a sample much larger than we have at our disposal. Second, at least in Georgia, charter schools are much more common at the elementary level, making it a more logical test sample than middle schools or high schools since our sample of charter schools is already smaller than ideal. Finally, research shows that the impact of teachers is different at the elementary level than at the middle or high school levels, which would imply that the slope for racial and ethnic representation could likely vary by school level. Our sample does not really give us the power necessary to execute a model with the requisite interaction terms for this type of relationship.</p>
<p>As a state, Georgia provides an appropriate setting within which to study this issue since it has substantial racial and ethnic diversity, as well as a growing number of charter schools. We are able to construct racial and ethnic representation variables for each school using teacher and administrative data provided by the state. A critical feature is that Georgia schools are required to report discipline infractions that resulted in disciplinary action to the Georgia Department of Education (GDOE), providing data that allow us to explore the relationship between discipline and representation. We also use data from the Criterion-Referenced Competency Text (CRCT), given annually in the spring at all Georgia schools, as a measure of academic achievement.</p>
<p>Georgia is neither particularly advanced nor particularly behind in the extent to which it has embraced charter schools. Although it was one of the first states to pass legislation permitting charter schools in 1993, it is currently ranked 16th out of 41 states by the Center for Education Reform on the extent to which state laws promote the creation of charter schools. Georgia does not limit the number of charter schools that are created each year, but it holds the initial charter term to 5 to 10 years and limits school-level fiscal and legal autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074011400404">Center for Education Reform, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>There are two sets of dependent variables used in this analysis. First, we examine disciplinary actions taken in response to student infractions. Data on Georgia public schools show that schools report student infractions in almost 30 different categories—some of the most common of which at the elementary school level are disorderly conduct, fighting, and threat and intimidation. Although all schools are required to report discipline infractions and actions to the state Department of Education, school districts have autonomy to determine the appropriate action for any given infraction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0275074011400404">1</xref></sup> We focus on the two most common responses to these infractions at the elementary school level: in-school suspension and out-of-school suspension. We view in-school suspension as a less punitive approach to discipline, as students typically receive some form of counseling or rehabilitation and they are not removed from the school environment. Therefore, this variable will measure the use of more positive policy tools or “learning tools.” The other variable, out-of-school suspension, reflects the use of more negative and punitive disciplinary tools as students are removed from the learning environment completely.</p>
<p>As measures of these variables, we use the percentage of all discipline actions in a school that correspond to either in-school suspension or out-of-school suspension. As previously mentioned, we expect the racial and ethnic representation of a school to be negatively related to the use of more punitive measures (out-of-school suspension) and positively related to less punitive tools (in-school suspension) and for this relationship to be less likely to occur among charter schools.</p>
<p>The average charter school uses in-school suspension in 13.9% of disciplinary actions, compared to 19.0% in traditional public schools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074011400404">Table 1</xref>). The difference between charter schools and traditional schools is more pronounced for out-of-school suspension: 62.8% of actions by charter schools are out-of-school suspensions, compared to only 43.1% in traditional schools.</p>

<p>The second set of dependent variables is student pass rates from standardized tests. In Georgia, all students in elementary schools are required to take the CRCT exam each spring. We use math and reading pass rates for third and fifth grades as dependent variables in the second analysis. As with discipline outcomes, we expect racial and ethnic representation to be positively related to higher scores on the CRCT and for this relationship to be less likely to occur among charter schools. The average math pass rate for charter schools is 79.9% for third graders and 86.8% for fifth graders, compared to 83.3% for third graders and 86.1% for fifth graders in traditional public schools. In reading, the average pass rate for charter schools is 87.1% for third graders and 87.3% for fifth graders, compared to 85.9% for third graders and 85.6% for fifth graders in traditional public schools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074011400404">Table 1</xref>). Only the difference in average third-grade math pass rates is statistically significant.</p>

<sec id="section6-0275074011400404">
<title>Key Independent Variables</title>
<p>The first key independent variable is a dummy variable that indicates whether a school is a charter school. Our data set includes a total of 76 observations that are charter schools: 31 from the 2007-2008 school year, 25 from the 2006-2007 school year, and 20 from the 2005-2006 school year. Of these 76 observations, 39 are start-up schools, 34 are conversions, and 3 are state-chartered special schools. All but the three state-chartered special schools are under the control of the local school board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0275074011400404">Georgia Department of Education, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although our analysis would benefit from a larger sample of charter schools, we do not believe that our sample is peculiar or unrepresentative of charter schools in general. We are reassured on this point by differences between charters and public schools in our sample that mimic differences found nationwide. For example, teachers in traditional schools are more experienced, more likely to have advanced degrees, and better paid on average than those in charter schools. Traditional schools have a higher average student enrollment and lower student–teacher ratio than charter schools. On average, traditional public schools enroll a higher percentage of students with disabilities, students from low-income households, and students with 15 or more absences. These differences reflect trends nationwide. For instance, nationally, the median enrollment is 242 students in charter schools and 539 students in traditional public schools (WestEd, 2000<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.charterschools.org/">http://www.charterschools.org/</ext-link>). In addition, most charter schools across the country are “majority minority”; in the 2006-2007 school year, 61% of students in charter schools were minority students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0275074011400404">National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, 2008</xref>). This is the case in Georgia as well: 66% of charter students, compared to 55% statewide, are racial and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>The representation variables reflect the extent to which the school’s staff is representative of the target population by race and ethnicity. To measure the degree of representation we created two separate indices: one for teachers (R<sub>t</sub>) and one for administrators (R<sub>a</sub>). The teacher representation index was created using the following formula:</p>

<p>Under the radical, the measure reflects the difference in the proportion of the student and teachers that are Hispanic, White, African American, Asian American, and of other backgrounds. The result is a measure of distance, which is inverted so that lower numbers indicate less representation and higher numbers indicate more representation. Thus, in those cases where teachers largely do not represent the school’s students, the index may fall under 0. The teacher representation index ranges from 0.123 to 0.971 for charter schools, with an average of 0.618. In traditional public schools, teacher representation ranges from −0.242 to 1, with an average of 0.599. The difference in means between the two groups is not statistically significant. We relied on the same formula for the administrator representation index, replacing the proportion of teachers with proportion of administrators. In charter schools, the values for administrator representation range from −0.204 to 0.992, with a mean value of 0.542. In traditional public schools, the values range from −0.405 to 1, with an average of 0.604. The difference between charter schools and traditional public schools on this variable is statistically significant at the 0.05 level.</p>

<title>School-Level Control Variables</title>
<p>There is a great deal of literature on the impact of resources and constraints in the environment on student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0275074011400404">Burtless, 1996</xref>). Following this research, we included several control variables to account for factors that might influence student outcomes. First, we included controls for attributes of the teachers and administrators for whom the representation indices were constructed. We use average salary (in thousands) and experience variables for both administrators and teachers and the percentage of each group that holds graduate degrees. Second, we controlled for factors that characterize the school environment, as well as those that might influence the use of disciplinary actions and student performance on standardized exams. For example, we control for the percentage of students who qualified for federally funded reduced-price lunch, the percentage of students with disabilities, the percentage of students with 15 or more absences, and the percentage of students who are limited in their proficiency in English. In the discipline models, we also included control variables for percentage of disciplinary incidents in a set of categories, including those of a personal nature, those involving property, and those involving weapons, misdemeanors, and other minor incidents. Finally, we included a series of control variables to account for additional school-level attributes: the student–teacher ratio, the student–administrator ratio, the total number of students, and whether the school is located in the Atlanta metro area. Two of these variables—student–administrator ratio and total number of students—are included to rule out the possibility that differences between charter schools and traditional schools reflect differences in size or administrator oversight. Descriptive statistics for both charter schools and traditional public schools are included for all of these variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074011400404">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Model</title>
<p>We use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on pooled cross-sectional models to test our hypotheses. We use separate estimating equations for teacher and administrator representation due to their high collinearity. When predicting student performance on standardized tests, we include a lagged dependent variable to help correct for any potential omitted variable bias through the inclusion of prior achievement practices. We do not include lagged variables when studying discipline practices. In both discipline models and achievement models, we cluster the standard errors by school. Thus, the standard errors in our models have been adjusted to take into account dependence among observations in each school.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0275074011400404">2</xref></sup> To control for serial correlation, we include dummy variables representing individual years in the discipline models and performance on standardized test scores. We do not report coefficients for the year dummies in the tables, and in the discipline models, we also do not report results for our control variables representing disciplinary incidents.</p>

<title>Representation and the Use of Student Discipline in Elementary Schools</title>
<p>We begin by examining the relationship between racial and ethnic representation and the use of in-school and out-of-school suspensions within public elementary schools. We first investigate the influence of teachers’ representation on the use of disciplinary practices and then consider the influence of representation among administrators.</p>
<p>In the first two columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0275074011400404">Table 2</xref>, one can see that representation among teachers is positively associated with the use of in-school suspensions. On average, 20 out of every 100 disciplinary practices in Georgia public elementary schools involve the use of in-school suspension. The data show that if the representation of teachers were to increase by its standard deviation of 0.23 points, there would be an average increase (0.077*0.23) of about an additional 2 children out of 100 who receive in-school suspension.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0275074011400404">3</xref></sup></p>

<p>When we examine the relationship between teacher representation and the use of out-of-school suspension, we see that greater representation is associated with a decrease in the use of these tools. For instance, a 1 standard deviation increase in representation results in about 4 fewer students out of 100 being subjected to out-of-school suspension. These results provide support for Hypothesis 1a, which predicted that teacher representation would result in more rehabilitative and less punitive discipline.</p>
<p>In Columns 5 and 6 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0275074011400404">Table 2</xref>, we examine the relationship between administrative representation and the use of these disciplinary practices and see no significant effects for these key variables. These results provide support for Hypothesis 1b, which predicted that administrative representation would not affect the use of rehabilitative and punitive discipline. Thus, these results suggest that teacher representation may be more likely than administrator representation to influence the types of disciplinary policies that are used in response to student infractions. The lack of an effect for administrative representation may be due to professional norms that inhibit the translation from passive to active presentation. That is, administrators may be influenced by a culture of impartiality in the administration of discipline that prevents them from actively representing students from the same racial and ethnic backgrounds.</p>

<sec id="section11-0275074011400404">
<title>The Influence of Representation on Discipline Within Charter Schools</title>
<p>We replicate the same models as in the previous section, also including a dummy variable identifying charter schools as well as an interaction term between charter schools and teacher representation. We find support for our third hypothesis, which stated that teacher and administrator representation would not correspond to more favorable student outcomes in charter schools. Our results, reported in Columns 3 and 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0275074011400404">Table 2</xref>, show effects for our teacher representation variable on in-school and out-of-school suspensions that are similar to our previous set of models. Whereas an increase in teacher representation corresponds to a decline in out-of-school suspensions in traditional schools, the relationship is only marginally significant and in the opposite direction for charter schools (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0275074011400404">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Representative bureaucracy theory suggests that out-of-school suspensions will decline as teacher representation increases, since teachers who match students by race and ethnicity are more likely to “protect” them from punitive outcomes like out-of-school suspension. As we hypothesized, our results support this for traditional schools but not for charter schools, where discipline decisions may be more likely to reflect core norms and values that are more influential in decision-making than an educator’s racial and ethnic identity. Indeed, many charter schools adopt a fairly narrow philosophy on student discipline that is often (but not always) more rehabilitative than punitive in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074011400404">McDonald, Ross, Bol, &amp; McSparrin-Gallagher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0275074011400404">Morrison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0275074011400404">Ritter, Maranto, &amp; Buck, 2009</xref>). By contrast, traditional public schools tend to act more so as loosely coupled systems where teachers are likely to adopt individualized perspectives toward disciplinary actions rather than adopting a centralized mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074011400404">Bidwell &amp; Quiroz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074011400404">Weick, 1976</xref>). Thus, there is less effective socialization in traditional public schools on student discipline matters, leaving educators to make decisions based on their own views and experiences. Our results reinforce this by implying that educator race and ethnicity is brought to bear on discipline decisions in traditional schools but not in charter schools, and though we are unable to test the causal logic directly, we believe that this largely reflects differences in socialization.</p>
<p>When we turn to examine the results for administrators, there again are no statistically significant effects of administrative representation on the use of these different disciplinary practices. It appears that in charter schools and regular public elementary schools, racial/ethnic representation is unlikely to influence administrators’ decisions about student discipline, regardless of context. Administrators may listen closely to the interpretation of events provided by teachers but appear to provide little impetus in changing the pattern of sanctions used within the schools. Given that we anticipate that administrators are unlikely to assume a role of minority advocate in either set of schools, it is not surprising that our results are not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Our control variables all behave as expected across all of the models included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0275074011400404">Table 2</xref>. Use of in-school suspension decreases as schools enroll more students who qualify for free lunch, students with limited English, students with disabilities, and students with extensive absences. Although a substantive treatment of these relationships is outside the scope of our study, it should be noted that the impacts are highly significant for several of these, particularly student absences.</p>

<sec id="section12-0275074011400404">
<title>The Influence of Representation on Test Scores</title>
<p>We begin our analysis of the influence of representation on test scores by investigating the relationship between teacher representation and student pass rates on reading and math achievement tests among third and fifth graders. We present our results for math scores in the first two columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074011400404">Table 3</xref> and for readings scores in Columns 5 and 6 of the same table. We find that a standard deviation increase in teacher racial and ethnic representation, on average, corresponds to about a 0.6 percentage point increase in pass rates on reading and math exams among third graders and smaller effects among fifth graders. Since we include a lagged dependent variable in this analysis, we are examining the change in scores from one year to the next, which underscores the substantive impact shown in our results. These findings provide support for Hypothesis 2a, where we predicted that teacher representation would promote reading and math scores in general. Minority students appear to do better if they are taught by instructors from the same background.</p>

<p>As in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0275074011400404">Table 2</xref>, all of the control variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074011400404">Table 3</xref> are related to outcomes in the direction anticipated. Scores on standardized tests appear to decrease as schools enroll more students who receive free lunches, more students with limited English, and more students with a high number of absences. Student absences appear to have a fairly strong relationship with student test scores, and future research should consider the extent to which incentivizing student attendance has the potential to improve student outcomes.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074011400404">Table 4</xref>, we present our results examining the influence of administrative representation on math and reading scores. In Columns 1 and 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074011400404">Table 4</xref>, the data show that representation by administrators does not appear to have a statistically significant effect on pass rates on standardized math tests. In Columns 5 and 6, one can see, however, that administrative representation appears to have a positive effect on reading scores in Georgia schools, though the impact is smaller than that of teachers. Although it seems that administrator representation matters more for test scores than for discipline, the impacts are still minor relative to those stemming from teacher representation.</p>

<title>The Influence of Representation on Test Scores in Charter Schools</title>
<p>We next turn to consider whether the influence of teacher representation on math and reading scores differs between traditional public schools and charter schools. Focusing first on math scores, in Column 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074011400404">Table 3</xref>, one can see that greater representation among teachers is associated with higher pass rates on standardized math exams among both third and fifth graders in regular public elementary schools. For fifth-grade scores, the data also show positive and statistically significant effects for charter schools and a significant and negative interaction between representation and charter schools. Thus, charter schools, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>, are likely to have higher math scores than regular public elementary schools do when the value of teacher representation remains close to 0.</p>
<p>In Columns 7 and 8 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074011400404">Table 3</xref> we present our results investigating whether the effect of representation differs among charter schools when considering standardized reading scores. For third grade, we observe a similar pattern of results as in the case of fifth-grade math scores. One can see that the effect for charter schools is positive and statistically significant. The effect of teacher representation is positive and statistically significant, and the data again show a decline in the effects of representation among charter schools. Thus, gains in the pass rates of charter schools appear more closely tied to the larger range of attributes associated with these schools than to the influence of teachers’ representation on standardized exams. In the case of fifth-grade pass rates on reading exams, the charter school variable and interaction terms are not significant; there is a positive and statistically significant effect for teachers’ representation.</p>
<p>These findings support Hypothesis 4 and are likely to reflect differences in socialization. As we have discussed in the literature review and findings for student discipline, charter schools tend to adopt approaches to education that are much more specific than those in traditional schools. Charter schools can socialize teachers to their particular learning systems, such that they can draw from a core set of principles in determining how they teach rather than their own experiences and identity (and by extension, whether that identity matches that of a given student). By contrast, teachers in traditional public schools do not typically share a common philosophy about education, making their identity and background much more relevant in their decision making.</p>
<p>Next, we examine whether the influence of representation among administrators on math and reading scores differs between regular public elementary schools and charter schools. As shown in Columns 3 and 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074011400404">Table 4</xref>, administrator representation has no statistically significant effect on pass rates on standardized math exams among both third graders and fifth graders. However, we again find in Columns 7 and 8 a significant positive effect for administrator representation on reading scores. We do not observe significant effects for charter schools or the interaction between representation and charter schools, as expected.</p>

<title>Are These Differences a Function of the Racial Makeup of Schools?</title>
<p>The charter schools and the regular public elementary schools in our sample are on average “minority majority,” though charter schools enroll an average of 10% more racial and ethnic minority students than traditional schools. Although these populations are roughly comparable, it is important to consider whether differences in the grouping of students by race across schools may drive some of the differences within our results. For instance, we may be comparing effects of representation in charter schools, which may be more likely to be comprised of more African American students, to those effects of representation among regular public elementary schools, which may have more schools comprised largely of White students.</p>
<p>We investigate these potential differences across schools by dividing our sample into three different groups of schools and by conducting on each group the same analyses for out of suspension and third-grade reading, as in our previous models. In the first group, African American students are fewer than 20% of students; they are between 20% and 80% of students in the second subsample and constitute more than 80% of students in the last subsample. Thus, these resulting groups are largely White, diverse, and largely African American. When comparing the distribution of charter schools and regular public elementary schools, we see that regular public elementary schools are more likely to be largely White (28% vs. 13%), charter schools appear more diverse (63% vs. 48%), and both appear equally likely to be largely African American (23%). We present the results of our analyses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0275074011400404">Table 5</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0275074011400404">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>We find that teacher representation influences both out-of-school suspension and reading scores in those groups of schools that are comprised mostly of White students and influences the former as well in schools with more diverse student bodies. In these cases, we also continue to see a decline in the effects of representation among charter schools. When schools are comprised largely of African American students, we see no significant effect of representation on the use of out-of-school suspensions or reading scores. Since African Americans make up more than 80% of students in these schools, the need to represent these students more effectively may seem weaker to teachers, or they may be more likely to rely on school-level officials to make decisions that reflect the needs of these homogeneous student bodies. The need for representation may be more salient among teachers in regular public elementary schools, particularly in schools that are primarily White, as well in more diverse student bodies.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>This research has explored the relationship between bureaucratic representation and student outcomes, considering the use of disciplinary tools and student outcomes on standardized exams. We find significant effects of teacher racial and ethnic representation in our models. The results demonstrate that, for schools in which teachers are more representative of their target populations by race and ethnicity, there is less frequent use of punitive disciplinary practices such as out-of-school suspensions. Instead, in schools with higher levels of representation, we are more likely to observe disciplinary practices that may involve a greater rehabilitative component. We also observe that racial and ethnic representation among teachers has a positive influence on the performance of students on standardized math and reading exams. The impacts are substantively important, particularly in light of the fact that these latter models include lagged dependent variables.</p>
<p>We find some limited effects of administrator representation on student outcomes. In particular, we observe a significant, albeit weaker effect of administrator representation on pass rates on standardized reading tests. Thus, in some cases, it appears that administrators may serve as role models for students or may be actively eliminating disparities among groups of students due to procedures such as tracking. These effects we observe are larger than the null effects reported in some other studies; however, they are not as consistent as our results are for teachers. Administrators may actively represent the needs of students indirectly by hiring teachers of the same racial and ethnic background, and this filtering effect would be difficult to detect in an analysis like ours (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0275074011400404">Meier et al., 2004</xref>). It is also possible that the small number of administrators in many schools makes our representation measure too blunt to measure impacts effectively. It could also be the case that minority groups must have a “critical mass” within the organization for representation to make a difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074011400404">Meier, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings also suggest that racial and ethnic context appears to influence the degree to which ethnic representation influences the use of disciplinary tools and educational outcomes. Teachers’ racial and ethnic representation appears most likely to influence reading scores and disciplinary actions within schools that are largely White or diverse. Representation is not significant within groups of schools that are comprised largely of African American students. In these cases, the need for representation may be less salient to teachers or they may rely more on upper-school-level officials to enact policies responsive to the needs of their students. Within these schools, there may be an active subgroup of minority parents, acting much like marginal consumers, who may be likely to pressure school officials to pay attention to values concerning race and ethnicity in schools that are largely white or diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0275074011400404">Schneider, Teske, Marschall, &amp; Roch, 1998</xref>). These parents may be less likely to exist in less well-off schools, which are more likely to be largely African American, or the saliency of the messages delivered by these groups may revolve less around race and ethnicity in these environments. It also may be more likely that the larger school administrative structure and school board more closely represents minority students within the schools.</p>
<p>Charter schools see occasional gains over regular public schools when predicting test scores—perhaps as a function of their mission or responsiveness of the schools. The effect of racial and ethnic representation also appears to decrease among charter schools when compared to regular public elementary schools. It is important to note that we make these observations both when considering student disciplinary outcomes and student test scores. Thus, it is unlikely that charter schools simply approach the study of standardized exams differently than regular public elementary schools; instead, similar mechanisms influence how teachers approach both standardized exams and the use of different disciplinary actions. These results suggest that the translation from passive representation to active representation may be weaker within charter schools than in traditional public schools.</p>
<p>As discussed above in the literature review, the impact of teacher representation turns on the extent to which teachers have the autonomy to make choices about discipline and instruction. It may be that charter schools do not give teachers as much autonomy in these areas, but that seems unlikely given the types of individuals who select into teaching posts in charter schools. Although the size of charter schools makes it possible for administrators to better monitor teacher behavior and limit autonomy, our findings control for school size and thereby rule that out as an explanation. We argue that these differences are likely due to the norms and culture within charter schools. Teachers often choose to work at charter schools so that they can work with others who are focused on a similar professional culture and mission. It is important to note that our observations may in part also be the result of differences in the hiring practices associated with charter schools. Teachers who work at charter schools are more likely to come from highly competitive undergraduate schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074011400404">Baker &amp; Dickerson, 2006</xref>). Certification standards are also more relaxed than for traditional public schools; teachers also are likely to stay at these schools for shorter periods of time and are paid less than those in traditional public schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074011400404">Harris, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074011400404">Miron &amp; Nelson, 2002</xref>). We argue, however, that these effects are unlikely to be the results of socialization processes entirely external to the charter school. Instead, it seems likely that the emphasis on developing and promoting a defined culture and mission within the charter schools is likely to enhance these teachers’ attention to professional norms and consequently limits the translation from passive to active representation. It appears that teachers are less likely in charter schools to assume a role of minority advocate, further suggesting that representational impacts stem from what teachers <italic>do</italic> more than who teachers <italic>are</italic>.</p>
<p>Of course, these results must be considered within the limitations of this research. These variables, models, and findings are context specific, and it is not clear whether the results could be generalized to other settings. We use data from public schools in only one state. Although it is a fairly large and diverse state, and data are at the school level, not the district level, it would still be ideal to have data from all states to provide the most generalizable set of findings. Our analysis is also based on elementary schools; it would be useful for future research to consider the extent to which our findings generalize across all grade levels. In addition, the number of charter schools that we observe in our research is small, which makes conclusions about the role of representation in Georgia elementary schools more tentative than those that we could reach if our work were based on a larger sample. It would also be useful to have finer measures of the practices undertaken by the teachers within their classrooms. For instance, when considering the influence of representation on exam scores, we cannot disentangle whether this relationship stems more from teaching style or mentoring. For example, it could be that minority teachers can better instruct minority students in the material tested by these exams because they are more familiar with minority students’ unique learning styles. On the other hand, it could be that minority teachers serve as informal mentors to minority students in ways that encourage them to work harder and learn more. We also do not have measures of culture and norms across schools; these additional data could to help further illuminate the degree to which values and beliefs associated with charter schools help to drive the different effects of representation that we observe in this study.</p>
<p>Future research should examine whether these findings differ according to the type of charter school. For example, one might expect that conversion schools will operate similarly to traditional public schools, since the environment in those schools will likely retain some characteristics from before it was converted. Conversion schools may carry over recruitment practices and organizational culture characteristics that developed when it was a traditional school. It seems likely that conversion schools are more similar to public schools than to start-up charter schools, but our small sample prevents us from testing this empirically. Research should also consider longitudinal impacts, since schools that are newly created or converted may operate differently from charter schools that have been in existence for longer periods of time. Larger samples would permit a closer comparison of charter schools and public schools that are similar on dimensions like enrollment, resources, and student characteristics.</p>
<p>Despite these methodological caveats, we believe that there are several policy and management implications that stem from these results. There appears to be a tension between attitudes shaped by one’s racial and ethnic identity and those shaped by one’s organizational culture, and our results indicate that socialization’s influence may outweigh that of a teacher’s racial and ethnic background. This tension suggests that socialization may play a larger role in shaping student outcomes than has previously been demonstrated in research. If that is the case, principals and administrators should work to create a strong, cohesive organizational culture that reinforces the objectives outlined by that particular school or district to promote student learning. However, given that there is extensive empirical support for representative bureaucracy by race and ethnicity in public schools, we should not be so quick to reject the relevance of teacher identity. Programs that actively seek to engage both organizational approaches to student learning <italic>and</italic> race and ethnicity–based norms and values may be the most successful, as they could work to combine the benefits derived both from diversity and from a strong sense of organizational mission. Combining mission with diversity management might generate more positive results than representation or culture building on their own, at least in the context of public education. We are unable to test these relationships empirically in our data, but our findings at least hint at a recommendation that school administrators consider such an approach.</p>
<p>In sum, our research suggests that teacher representation, and in part also administrator representation, helps to drive the use of more rehabilitative disciplinary tools and higher scores on exams. It also appears that culture and values associated with charter schools may lead to significant differences in the influence of racial and ethnic representation. The challenges for future research are to address some of the limitations of this current work and to further test the generalizability of these conclusions.</p>
