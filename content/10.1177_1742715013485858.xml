<abstract>
<p>This paper analyses how material places and leadership are related to each other. We do that by exploring the question: How do spaces and places construct and perform leadership? The notion that material places can lead relies on three concepts of leadership. First, we make a distinction between the leader and leadership. Second, we join the growing number of scholars who view leadership as socially constructed, emerging and as meaning making. Third, we consider leadership as an aesthetic, embodied phenomenon and as sensuous experience. Embodiment of leadership refers here to social, relational constructionism as ontology of leadership and to aesthetic epistemology that legitimizes sense-based data such as emotions, bodily sensations, intuitions and mental representations as a basis for knowledge development. To understand the relationship between leadership and material place, we elaborate on the epistemology of embodied experience. We discuss embodied ways of knowing and point out specific aspects of embodied experience with examples from the art field. Our chapter contributes to the understanding the material nature of leadership by conceptualizing the notion of embodiment as an epistemological issue.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742715013485858" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The embodied perspective to leadership has been recently discussed in the literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742715013485858">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742715013485858">Koivunen and Wennes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742715013485858">Küpers, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742715013485858">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742715013485858">Ladkin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742715013485858">Ladkin and Taylor, 2010a</xref>, b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1742715013485858">Ropo and Parviainen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1742715013485858">Ropo and Sauer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1742715013485858">Ropo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1742715013485858">Sinclair, 2005</xref>). The discussion has opened new avenues to conceive leadership as an aesthetic, relational experience rather than an influence from one person to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742715013485858">Ladkin, 2010</xref>). Our aim in this paper is to take the discussion one step further by exploring how leadership and material places are related to each other. Viewing leadership as a social construction at the level of ontology and as embodied epistemologically motivates us to formulate the research question as follows: How do places and spaces construct and perform leadership? By asking this, we join <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742715013485858">Alvesson and Willmot (1992)</xref> who indicate that spatial practices ‘produce people’ and that organizational aesthetics is an issue of politics and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715013485858">Dale and Burrell, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742715013485858">2008</xref>) – and thus of socially constructed leadership. The aesthetic and embodied approach to leadership explores symbolic meanings, inherent power issues and felt experiences that material places entail and produce.</p>
<p>Empirical research shows that the same physical conditions produce different reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742715013485858">Elsbach and Pratt, 2007</xref>) which means that physical conditions affect social space interpretatively and symbolically, albeit not in a determined manner. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742715013485858">Balogun and Johnson (2005)</xref> observe, intended actions easily lead to unintended outcomes. From this perspective, it is notable that places produce and enable certain actions and behaviours, or restrict others and this has not been studied in the leadership field to date.</p>
<p>Our argument is that people make subjective judgments of physical places based on their embodied, sensuous experiences. Material places are powerful in leading people, and spaces and places can thus function as substitutes of individual leaders. However, this does not take place objectively, but rather through subjective personal experience. In other words, the experience of material places cannot be reduced to managerial or architectural plans and intentions to construct certain kind of leadership. The performative nature of material place occurs through subjective embodied experience.</p>
<p>Turning the attention to material place in understanding embodied aspects of leadership emphasizes the importance of revisiting the ontology of leadership. By materiality in leadership, we refer to the material conditions that affect the understanding, creation and maintaining of leadership as a social construction. We pay particular attention to how material places affect the way leadership is constructed and use the term materiality <italic>in</italic> leadership to refer to a relational aspect of the leadership phenomenon, not to any leader-centric qualities, such as the bodily dimensions, body language or personality of a leader-individual.</p>
<p>The discussion of space and place in leading and organizing explores the power of material place to shape people’s actions, interpretations and judgements. To better understand the relationship between leadership and material place, we identify the need <italic>first</italic>, to elaborate on the conceptual distinctions between space and place, and <italic>second</italic>, on the epistemology of experience. We discuss embodied ways of knowing and aspects of embodied experience. Finally, we conceptualize how material places and embodied experiences thereof can construct and even perform leadership.</p>
<p>The paper is structured in the following way: first, we review recent literature that addresses the notion of place and space in organizational and leadership research. While doing this, we identify different ways of conceptualizing place and space in the literature. Second, we discuss how to gain knowledge if leadership is understood as embodied and identify and develop conceptual aspects of embodied experience, illustrating our argument through literary texts, pictures and music. For example, we quote texts of writers who tell stories of various places and spaces and how people including ourselves as readers of the texts are affected by them. By referring to art forms, we draw from the growing literature on leadership as art (e.g. Special Issue of <italic>Leadership</italic> edited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742715013485858">Ladkin and Taylor, 2010b</xref>) and arts-based understanding of leadership (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742715013485858">Adler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1742715013485858">Taylor and Ladkin, 2009</xref>). Finally, we conclude with a preliminary conceptualization of the relationship between leadership and material place through the epistemological notion of embodied experience and the distinction between place and space.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1742715013485858"><title>Place and space in organization and leadership literature</title>
<p>There is recent literature which attends to place and space in organization and management studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715013485858">Clegg and Kornberger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742715013485858">Dale and Burrell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742715013485858">Elsbach and Pratt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1742715013485858">Peltonen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1742715013485858">Taylor and Spicer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1742715013485858">van Marrewijk and Yanow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1742715013485858">Våland, 2010</xref>). In summary, three major streams can be identified: first, an <italic>objective approach</italic> studying the physical environment from architectural and managerial perspective (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715013485858">Bitner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742715013485858">Elsbach and Pratt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742715013485858">Hatch, 1987</xref>); second, <italic>subjectively oriented research</italic> on social space and its experience (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742715013485858">Berg and Kreiner, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742715013485858">Gagliardi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742715013485858">Guillén, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742715013485858">Hatch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1742715013485858">Martin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1742715013485858">Strati, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1742715013485858">Tuan, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1742715013485858">Yanow, 1998</xref>), and third, a <italic>critical, post-structuralist approach</italic> on power, politics and control that spaces shape and maintain (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715013485858">Clegg and Kornberger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742715013485858">Dale, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742715013485858">Dale and Burrell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742715013485858">Foucault, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1742715013485858">Panayiotou and Kafiris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1742715013485858">Tyler and Cohen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Architecture and managerial thinking share a common interest in organizing space for practical, productive and effective use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742715013485858">Arge, 2000</xref>). Dominant management thinking regards space as if a predetermined idea carved into an architectural form (office or factory lay-out) could be conveyed to social reality as such. Apart from the functional managerial interest, there is a new emphasis on physical space in organizations that can be traced back to the Hawthorne Studies in the 1920s and 1930s. These studies challenged the scientific management approach by emphasizing the importance of social interaction: social aspects, instead of being dominated by physical structures, became influential in their own right. The recent interest in organizational space links an objective, managerial and architectural approach to physical work environment (‘this is how it was planned and determined to work’) with understanding the symbolic meaning of physical spaces to social interaction (‘this is how it affects people, relations, processes and work flow, and how people use and interpret it’).</p>
<p>As variations in space and place allow different leadership constructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742715013485858">Elsbach and Pratt, 2007</xref>), this poses a need for re-evaluating the concept of leadership too. Even if leadership research has been conducted in various empirical settings and contexts, material places as such have not been developed conceptually, nor have the relations between physical and social space and organizational leadership been studied explicitly.</p>
<p>There are three notions of leadership that our argumentation relies on. <italic>First</italic>, we make the distinction between leader and leadership (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742715013485858">Bass, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742715013485858">Crevani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1742715013485858">Parry and Hansen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1742715013485858">Salovaara, 2011</xref>). By emphasizing the ‘space between’ leaders and followers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742715013485858">Ladkin, 2010</xref>), we move from a leader-centric concept of materiality toward understanding the notion of material nature of the leadership as a relational phenomenon. <italic>Second</italic>, we join the growing number of scholars who view leadership as a socially constructed and emergent (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742715013485858">Collinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742715013485858">Fairhurst and Grant, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742715013485858">Grint, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742715013485858">Gronn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715013485858">Hosking, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1742715013485858">Meindl, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1742715013485858">Vine et al., 2008</xref>) and as meaning making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1742715013485858">Smircich and Morgan, 1982</xref>). <italic>Third</italic>, we regard leadership as an aesthetic, embodied phenomenon that includes sensuous experience. Leadership occurs and is constructed in and through the sensing and experiencing bodies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715013485858">Hansen and Bathurst, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742715013485858">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715013485858">Katz-Buonincontro, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742715013485858">Koivunen and Wennes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742715013485858">Ladkin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742715013485858">Ladkin and Taylor, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1742715013485858">Ropo and Parviainen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1742715013485858">Ropo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1742715013485858">Sinclair, 2005</xref>). Aesthetics in our view refers to ‘felt experience’ or ‘felt meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742715013485858">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to our view, the prevailing leadership conception is predominantly cognitive and intellectual with the emphasis on the intellectual rather than a sensing activity (for an excellent review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1742715013485858">Yukl, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The aesthetic approach to leadership and space explores the symbolic meanings and inherent power issues which spaces and places produce. The relationship between leadership, material place and social space can be preliminarily seen as follows: Material places lead people through embodied experiences, such as feelings, emotions and memories of the place. These experiences form and shape the direction of their actions, interpretations and judgements. The performative nature of material place is not determined, but symbolic and sensuous.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1742715013485858">Taylor and Spicer (2007)</xref> argue based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742715013485858">Lefebvre’s (1991)</xref> theory of spatial production that understanding of organizational spaces would call for studying them as planned, practiced and imagined. They define space as distance, power and experience. In comparison to other categories of space, distance refers to objective physical place, power to post-structuralist interest in space and experience to subjectively felt space. Our analysis identifies all three aspects of space but focuses on the imagined/conceived space to better understand the material nature in leadership.</p>
<p>As the above discussion indicates, the concepts of place and space have varying meanings in existing studies. Sometimes they are seen as distinct, whilst at other times they are used interchangeably. Before going further with our analysis, we elaborate on the concepts further.</p>
<p>Epistemologically the knowledge attached to a place can be both objective and subjective. The objective knowledge of <italic>place</italic> refers to physical places like an office, a corridor, stairs or any spatial solution. These are perceived as having material qualities, and they thus fall into Aristotle’s ontological categories: they have shape, colour, mass, etc. Most of this kind of information can be represented in pictures and measures. On the other hand, the subjective experiences of a material place can differ dramatically. For someone, a summer cottage in the woods by a lake is idyllic, whilst for another person it can be experienced as prison. We use the term <italic>space</italic> to refer to the subjective, experienced place. Space is without clear boundaries and it is a product of our mental powers and imagination. Whereas place does not have a direct or necessary first-person bodily reference, space comes to exist through somatic and symbolic references and cues. The subjective space can be revealed in stories, images and sensuous experiences.</p>
<p>A basic difference that we will explore later in the paper refers to the epistemology and role of language: place is described in common terms and abstractions such as language and measures, but the experience of space goes beyond language. By this we are not saying there is a ‘mystery’, but rather making a common-sense and everyday epistemological statement that language (e.g. novel, poem, story) can evoke emotions of sadness, grief, excitement or happiness that make us react bodily (we are touched, we might cry, laugh, feel fear or horror), and even if we can turn these embodied experiences into language, they take place beyond linguistic realm. This idea is elaborated further in the discussion of epistemological grounds of our study. We summarize the differences between place and space in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742715013485858">Table 1</xref>.

<p>The recent interest in organizational space is guided by the notion that physical/material space affects the social space. The Cartesian dualistic notion of social space and physical world as separate entities is challenged. Instead of treating physical and social space separately, there is a more advanced mutually constitutive approach to space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1742715013485858">Strati, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742715013485858">Kornberger and Clegg, 2003</xref>) presuming that the physical structures precede and enable, shape and are shaped by social structures in organizations. The conceptualization offered in this paper develops a new understanding of the relations of work, space and leadership. In the next section, we discuss and develop the ontological and epistemological grounds of conceiving leadership as a social construction and as an embodied phenomenon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1742715013485858"><title>Ontological and epistemological discussion of embodiment in leadership</title>
<p>We stated above that we follow the social constructionist ontology and aesthetic, embodied epistemology. We connect social constructionism and aesthetic leadership approach with a phenomenological view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742715013485858">Ladkin, 2010</xref>) which focuses on the study of ‘phenomena’: of things as we experience them, and how they appear in our experience from the subjective or first person perspective.</p>
<p>One of the basic challenges in discussing leadership is that it tends to be taken for granted. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742715013485858">Meindl et al. (1985)</xref> state, ‘leadership has assumed a heroic, larger-than-life quality’ so that organizational performance that can be attached to leadership is more positively evaluated than that which cannot be attributed to leadership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1742715013485858">Rosenzweig (2007)</xref> talks about the ‘halo-effect’ of leadership, a tendency to explain company success by attributing it rather to leadership than conjunctions, competitors or launching new products. This attachment to leadership is a delusion and error of logic, he argues. In this respect, we agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715013485858">Alvesson and Sveningsson’s (2003)</xref> concern that the concept of leadership is far too self-evident, and that we therefore sometimes tend to treat it as an object instead of as a social construction. Regarding it as a social construct, we are well reminded of its nature as a ‘disappearing act’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715013485858">Alvesson and Sveningsson, 2003</xref>). Other social constructionist authors talk about ‘invisible management’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1742715013485858">Sjöstrand et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>How to gain knowledge about leadership that is disappearing or invisible? In a more general form: How to know and articulate tacit and embodied knowledge, or to deal with – as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1742715013485858">Oguz and Sengün (2011)</xref> title it – the ‘mystery of the unknown’? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1742715013485858">Polanyi (1966)</xref> introduced the concept of tacit, personal knowledge, as an opposition to (then popular notion) Popper’s ‘Objective Knowledge’. Drawing on this concept, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715013485858">Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995)</xref> illustrate organizational knowledge-creation process as a continuum of tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715013485858">Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995</xref>: 84). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1742715013485858">Ryle (1946)</xref> famously distinguished between knowing that and knowing how, defining that effective use of knowing that ‘involves knowing how to use that knowledge’ (p. 16). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1742715013485858">Snowdon (2003)</xref> argued that knowing how is just a form of knowing that, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1742715013485858">Young (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1742715013485858">Takaki (2009)</xref> claim that there is knowing how that cannot be reduced into knowing that. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1742715013485858">Young (2009)</xref> calls this ‘an argument against reductionist epistemology’ (p. 341). Discussions about whether one form of knowledge can be expressed in terms of another have a long history in philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1742715013485858">Young, 2009</xref>), and still today a need to acknowledge this reductionism exists, because from the social constructionist perspective there is something ‘missing’ in mainstream leadership discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1742715013485858">Salovaara, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742715013485858">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the knowledge claims of traditional epistemology and how embodied experience falls out of the traditional epistemological continuum.
<fig id="fig1-1742715013485858" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Embodied experience as a knowledge claim.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742715013485858-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Our illustration is not meant as an exact representation of proportions or reach of any epistemological claim; instead, we use it for underlining that knowledge in interpretative research can be based on non-explicable presumptions. That the pre-structure of understanding consists of cultural implications, traditions, history and personal experiences is well worked out in philosophical hermeneutics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742715013485858">Gadamer, 2004</xref>). The illustration does not deny the possibility of tacit knowledge being explicated, but it emphasizes that we acknowledge knowledge claims that are traditionally marginalized – such as knowing and embodied experience. Examples of knowing and embodied experience include motor functions (e.g. balancing act), sensations and emotions that emerge through embodied cues (e.g. goose bumps, fear), and tactual, spatial and kinaesthetic awareness about one’s own body.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742715013485858"><title>Embodied experience in epistemological terms</title>
<p>We will consider embodied experience in more detail as a specific kind of knowledge claim next. Crying, laughing, hick-uping, getting goose bumps or becoming emotional are experiences that we rather experience through our body. We also carry certain ‘bodily memories’ with us. We may have been physically or psychologically hurt (‘broken heart’), and when we later find ourselves in similar kinds of situations, these situations may evoke certain memories and reactions for us. For example, a bike accident can make us ride particularly carefully, or if some negative social situation has created something like ‘scars in the soul’, we might tend to avoid those situations and places. Our body can create stress symptoms by thinking about it or passing by the place. Many of these kinds of bodily instances can be evoked by explicable knowledge like text or film. Forgetting or remembering bodily memories is not fully in our control, yet we carry them with us as latent knowledge. Polanyi states that tacit aspects of knowing are very much embodied and that tacit elements underlie propositional knowledge too. Therefore, representing tacit knowledge as a form of explicable know-how neglects ‘the embodied nature of knowing’, which is ‘a prominent theme in Polanyi’s work’ as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1742715013485858">Takaki (2009</xref>: 26) claims.</p>
<p>How does the term embodiment relate to knowing and epistemology? There are several perspectives to embodied epistemology. First, the organizational aesthetics discussion regards <italic>senses and felt meanings</italic> as valid sources of information (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742715013485858">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1742715013485858">Strati, 2007</xref>). Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1742715013485858">Taylor (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1742715013485858">Wicks and Rippin (2010)</xref> describe how actual <italic>doing</italic>, <italic>crafting</italic> and making process contribute to reflecting our embodiment and self-understanding towards leadership. Third, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1742715013485858">Springborg (2010)</xref> describes how <italic>lingering and staying with senses</italic> are essential elements for a musician in order to relate to and make sense of the world. Sometimes the relaxed awareness produces very different kinds of images and sensations than a forced, pushed need to represent a composition. Fourth, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742715013485858">Bathurst et al. (2010)</xref> note that understanding for instance listening to music requires that the present is understood as composed by the past, and that these, indeed, anticipate future. This ‘<italic>backward reflexivity</italic>’ means that past, present and future are simultaneously present and thus co-create the momentary experience and enable comprehending the composition.</p>
<p>In Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology, however, body is treated and reflected upon in very different terms. Merleau-Ponty talks about ‘body-subject’ which means subjective bodily experiences. Taking an example of shadow limb, Merleau-Ponty reminds us that our body and bodily sensations are not fully in our control. Merleau-Ponty also illustrates spatiality of one’s own body and how we know about its limits and movements without explicating these. He further discusses issues like sexuality and bodily fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1742715013485858">Merleau-Ponty, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>When Merleau-Ponty’s approach is compared with the four previously organizationally oriented views on body, these can be said to focus more on mental and psychic processes, and to take a more spiritual or mind-oriented approach. However, Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological approach concentrates more on the tactual-kinesthetic experience. We observe that these different discussions on embodiment reveal a distinction between <italic>mental, kinaesthetic</italic> and <italic>material</italic> view on the body.</p>
<p>First, organizational research represents mental functions as primary to bodily ones. Based on this starting point, human embodiment becomes reduced into a comprehensive and understandable whole that, even in its peculiar cases, can become known to us. The organizational view of the body accepts that the body and mind depend on each other, but because of its history tied to managerial thinking and quantitative studies, organizational research still begins by presuming the mind as self-evident and the body in need of rationalizing (sic!). Second, the phenomenological view is an approach that emphasizes body’s physicality and tactual-kinesthetic dimensions and its spatiality and fluidity.</p>
<p>The third view that we have not yet explicitly introduced is the material view on the body. This is the view represented in managerial, architectural and space-place discussions. Managerial thinking takes the human as a material body to be placed in the organizational chart which is moved or controlled in certain ways. It does not consider the body as a particular human being, but rather sees it as pure physical and as a subject with certain features or attributes that tend to become rather generic qualities than individual specifications. This body can be changed to a different one, if the new body has similar kinds of competencies and qualities. In this fashion, managerial thinking objectifies humans, or to put it popularly: ‘Objectification of people depersonalizes them, making them non-human. This is what we do when we stereotype or classify others. This is a typical predecessor to discounting, downplaying, victimization and bullying’. (changingminds.org). Consequently, this is what happens when some people are described as ‘change resistant’, which in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742715013485858">Ford et al.’s (2008)</xref> account is nothing but language use of the ‘change agents’ in favour of the change; a sort of power game. Emotions, therefore, are of concern when they coincide with the structure.</p>
<p>The current ways of working such as in virtual teams, distant work, distributed work and the insight that people work in trains, airplanes, parks, cafeterias, pubs, at home or while walking underline that ‘work’ and ‘place’ – and leadership for that matter – have become an issue that needs to be addressed in a new way. As such the more the work in post-modern societies becomes mental and spiritual, the less it is restricted to the notion of place. Yet, this is not to say or anticipate that work place as such becomes less meaningful. On the contrary, we think that work place and the need for building meaningful communities will enjoy growing interest in organizational and management studies in the future. However, we suggest that the current managerial thinking on body as material should benefit from another paradigmatic approach, namely from physical and mental studies to human body at work.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1742715013485858"><title>Literary texts, music and pictures as sources of embodied experience</title>
<p>In this section, we present embodied, empirical examples of senses and emotions producing knowledge (excerpts of texts), of doing and crafting (baking bread), of lingering (music) and of backward reflexivity (photo).</p>
<p>We identified above the experience of <italic>emotion</italic>, which is out of necessity a sensuous experience, as we cannot sense anything without our bodies (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742715013485858">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>). Let us take a look at an extract from Jeannette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1742715013485858">Walls’s (2005)</xref> book ‘The Glass Castle’.<disp-quote>
<p>‘We followed Erma and Stanley and Grandpa inside. It was cold in the house and the air smelled of mould and cigarettes and unwashed laundry. We huddled around a potbellied cast-iron coal stove in the middle of the living room and held out our hands to warm them. Erma pulled a bottle of whiskey from the pocket of her housedress and Dad looked happy for the first time since we'd left Phoenix.</p></disp-quote><disp-quote>
<p>Erma ushered us into the kitchen where she was fixing dinner. A bulb dangled from the ceiling casting harsh lights on the yellowed walls, which were coated with a thin film of grease. Erma stuck the curved steel handle into an iron disk on top of an old cooking stove, lifted it and with her other hand grabbed a poker on the wall and jabbed at the hot orange coals inside. She stirred a potful of green beans stewing in fatback and poured in a big handful of salt. Then she set a tray of Pillsbury biscuits on the kitchen table and ladled out a plate of the beans for each of us kids’.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>We, as readers, are taken into a house that is not a wealthy household. The smells of mould, cigarettes and dirty clothes give some of us unpleasant shivers. Breathing becomes suddenly a bit more superficial, as we do not want to take in the foul air. The damp coldness in the house contributes to the depressing feeling of unromantic poverty. We may get flash images of the homeless people standing around a barrel of burning rubbish warming their callused hands near the fire. As readers of the book, we know that alcohol abuse is a central theme and one of the sources of sorrow in the book, we do not feel upbeat when the grandmother, Erma, pulls the bottle of whiskey from her pocket, but one gets this uneasy sickening feeling of the coming disaster that looms in the very near future.</p>
<p>The greasy kitchen and the dangling lonely harsh light bulb add to the feeling of desperation. The embodied sensory experiences, besides seeing the bulb and the greasy walls, are the smells of the household, the touch of coldness and heat, and the taste of the whiskey and beans, all giving their nuances into the pressing feeling of distress.</p>
<p>At the same time, the text functions at another level as well. The space <italic>leads</italic> us into the psychological state of the young girl, the storyteller. Through her eyes we see how they, she and her siblings, <italic>follow</italic> grandma and Stanley inside and how grandma Erma ushers them into her dirty kitchen and <italic>stucks, lifts and grabs.</italic> Grandma Erma is a doer. She has got the power in the household, but there is something inherently disturbing in her actions. All the others follow her movements as if not to do anything wrong or just to learn how they are supposed to behave in this new environment, in Erma’s house. Though Erma clearly is in charge of the house, it seems not to be anything one associates with a warmth and coziness of one’s grandparents’ place. The scene shows Erma briskly, even somewhat angrily preparing a very simple, poor meal. Despite her energy, the house is in a desperate state, and that is not because of lack of means, but because of having given in. She does not care about the greasy kitchen or the dirty clothes and the foul air inside the house.</p>
<p>For the reader, this is in stark contrast of how grandparental care is usually depicted. This text that describes physiological places and internal spaces alarms the reader. The unuttered unkindness, the desperation of the people and the dirty house makes the reader wish to shout the children to get away from there. This is how this particular place leads us to experience and to make interpretations.</p>
<p>Through another text ‘At Home’ by Bill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742715013485858">Bryson (2010)</xref>, we get an embodied experience of being in the staircase of an odd, unfinished house ourselves:<disp-quote>
<p>‘The oddest feature in the house was the two staircases. Jefferson thought staircases a waste of space so he made them only two feet wide and very steep – ‘a little ladder of a staircase' as one visitor put it. The stairs were so narrow and twisting that almost everything that needed to go up them, including all but the smallest pieces of visitors' luggage had to be winched and hauled in through a window. The stairs were buried so deep in the house that no natural light reached them, so they were forbiddingly dark as well as steep. Negotiating them, particularly in descent, is an unnerving experience even now’.</p></disp-quote>The piece of text describes the staircase in Monticello, President Jefferson’s house. When reading the text, the reader may feel the un-comfortableness of having to use the dark, steep and narrow stairs, putting us in danger of tripping. We can almost feel the walls squeezing our shoulders, the distressing sensation of us being too large or proportionally wrong for this staircase. We may even sense the tightening of the muscles in our legs as we, imagining the descent, try to step very carefully to avoid breaking our neck.</p>
<p>In a very concrete way, this particular place leads us to be extra careful about our movements and to pay close attention to avoid hurting ourselves. In other words, we feel that we are at risk. The place puts us in danger. Our inner space cannot get attention as all the energy is consumed in how to make the next step.</p>
<p>This text is an example of how sometimes, when reading a book or looking at a picture, we experience it with such a force that we get a bodily reaction, i.e. we start for example crying or laughing, or feel the place and fear. This can happen when looking at a picture, hearing a sound or smelling a nostalgic smell. The embodied experiences are subjective in nature. Not every piece of text or work of art causes the same experiences in all people. It is through our embodiment that the reader connects to the place and stairs.</p>
<p>Again, there is also another level of reading and feeling the text. Knowing a bit more of how much President Jefferson put time and energy into that building (which is pretty much all his adult life), we cannot but wonder <italic>why</italic> he has left such an impractical detail in the house which he remade many times, in fact so many times that he never saw it finished. This place, a poorly designed staircase makes us feel for the servants. Imagine the difficulties the staff of the house must have had trying to keep it nice and in order. Hauling visitors’ luggage through windows, having to pass fellow servants in the stairway with hands full of laundry or breakfast plates on trays must have been a constant source of irritation. As the writer puts it, President Jefferson thought building a proper staircase was waste of space (and probably money, since he never had enough of it to properly finish the construction work), we get a feeling of an old stingy tyrant who does not think of the trouble of those who need to carry loads of those who need to master the stairs in long heavy skirts.</p>
<p>A dark and dangerous staircase is a surprisingly threatening element inside a well-lit and well-planned house. It even hints that the neglect of planning the staircase well is somehow purposeful. It hinders movement between floors and sets the users of the house in danger. Our fictional reader is left wondering, impatient and slightly irritated about the whole issue of stairs: what’s the point of building such a non-functional staircase into that kind of grand house?</p>
<p>Our second conceptualization of embodied experience was <italic>doing and crafting</italic>. It is an experience attained for example by working with our hands. When we do pottery, we sense the warmth and softness of the clay and how it moulds in our hands, or when we bake bread, we sense through our hands when the dough is ready to be put into the oven. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742715013485858">Ladkin and Taylor (2010b)</xref>, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715013485858">Darso (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1742715013485858">Taylor (2012)</xref>, give accounts on crafting as a method of embodied experience that helps leaders develop their leadership skills. The making or crafting can foster a deep experience of personal presence and connection, which is often disturbed by the fragmented and hectic modern life. As the researchers put it, the process of crafting itself is an embodied experience, which you will remember when later looking at your work. Artefacts can embody contradictions and tensions beyond discursive forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1742715013485858">Taylor and Ladkin, 2009</xref>). In his book, Mr. Bryson tells the reader more about Monticello, President Jefferson’s house in Virginia.<disp-quote>
<p>‘The Monticello visitors see today a house Jefferson never saw but only dreamed of. It was never finished in his lifetime, or really even in really good shape. For fifty-four years Jefferson inhabited a building site. ‘Putting up and pulling down is one of my favourite amusements,' he remarked cheerfully, and it was just as well for he never stopped tinkering and messing. Because work was so protracted, some parts of Monticello were actively deteriorating while others were still a-building. … Because of financial constraints and his endless tinkering, Monticello never looked its best or even close to it. In 1802, when Mrs. Anna Maria Thornton came to visit she was shocked to find she still had to enter across wobbly planks. By this time Jefferson had been working on the house for over thirty years. “Tho’ I had been prepared to see an unfinished house, still I could not help being struck with … the general gloom”, she marvelled in her diary. Jefferson himself never much minded the inconvenience. ‘We are now living in the brick kiln,' he wrote happily at one point to a friend’.</p></disp-quote>As Bryson writes about the relationship between President Jefferson and his house, the reader can almost smell the sawdust, the sign of something being made, that brought Jefferson so much joy, and to others, including his wife, the uncomfortable and ongoing experience of having to live in the construction site. The unfinished space leads the inhabitants and visitors to be alert, to live in a constant change.</p>
<p>It seems that President Jefferson took pleasure out of the possibilities and endless new ideas that the construction allowed him. Despite the obvious financial trouble that prolonged the building of the house, the <italic>process</italic> of building and being in touch with something incomplete had to be much more meaningful and fulfilling for him than the goal of finishing it. The allegories between the endless process of building of a house, or, let alone, a nation, are almost too obvious here.</p>
<p>The third way we conceptualized embodied experience was <italic>lingering</italic>, staying with the perceptions that one receives from the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742715013485858">Ladkin and Taylor, 2010b</xref>). Taking examples from art, especially music, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1742715013485858">Springborg (2010)</xref> suggests that the essence of the practice of art is in how one experiences and makes sense of the world. Artists do this in an embodied way by staying with the senses, i.e. lingering with the perceptions they (choose to) receive, rather than methodically collecting data and cognitively analysing it. Springborg thinks that sense-making based on habitual modes of analysis tend to get fixated, returning continually to old ways of understanding the world, because methodical analysis cannot refer outside itself suggesting some other kind of understanding. According to Springborg, the leader can avoid that fixation by keeping on coming back to what his or her physical senses and thus the environment suggest, making sense in ways congruent with this emergent data and promoting opportunities for their organizations and communities to ‘stay with their senses’.</p>
<p>Staying with the senses is hard to pin down. The sense-making processes are subjective and elusive. We might perhaps think about Picasso producing the painting of the dark haired woman again and again, gradually breaking the ground to a new kind of seeing where the woman is captured by a couple of lines thus creating a new way of seeing the world and as such examined the environment and themselves. Picasso stayed with the senses and lingered with the challenge as long as he could interpret it into a new way of seeing or doing things.</p>
<p>In addition to sensing, crafting and lingering with the senses, we identified embodied experience as <italic>backwards reflexivity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742715013485858">Bathurst et al., 2010</xref>). A practical example of it is music. The ability to think backwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742715013485858">Moore, 1996</xref>) can be illustrated in musical perception where good listening skills require a ‘backward reflex’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715013485858">Ingarden, 1986</xref>: 72) where the listener is continually referring within a piece to the past melodic and harmonic sections as a reference point for present sound. The listener develops a perception of the piece of music’s ideas as they develop over time through its rhythmic, harmonic and melodic changes and adaptations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742715013485858">Hepburn (2002: 27)</xref> calls this phenomenon a ‘paradoxical co-presence’ where the present, past, and future simultaneously construct the experience that underpins aesthetic engagement. When thinking how this connects to leadership, we suggest that the leader uses backward reflexivity by acknowledging and understanding that the present is informed by the past and anticipates the future. Translated into leadership practice, the idea of backward reflexivity encourages leaders to explore what is happening in their organization at any given moment by attending to past experiences and using those to inform the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742715013485858">Bathurst et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The picture of a classroom from the 1960s is a good example of backwards reflexivity: desks in a row, or auditorium seats in similar kinds of rows, if you like – the form has remained the same for over 100 years. We believe that our readers can relate to that setting. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742715013485858">Picture 1</xref> shows the tradition.</p>
<p>When looking at the picture, we almost instantly remember our own experiences from school. The old fashioned wooden desks filled with marks from other generations come instantly in our mind. The uncomfortable seats as well as the inclined table remind us of the difficulties to get out of the desk and stand up straight when the teacher asked us something. What do these memories tell us about the hierarchy, atmosphere and order in the classroom? In managerial terms, the organization of classroom space with desks in this manner is designed to control the situation. Who controls? The teacher or the leader, of course. The picture shows nicely how the aim of the organized space is to control children’s bodies. They are not allowed to move freely, they should raise their hand and to speak; these are practices for controlling the mind from wandering around. Body and mind, and basically the whole human organism, is put under restrictions and directive means by the organization of the material place.</p>
<p>We are aware that the four conceptualizations of embodied experience are overlapping and not exhaustive. Still, we think these are important dimensions when beginning to understand how leadership and material places and subjective spaces are related to each other and what kind of implications the embodied, aesthetically informed understanding of leadership has both in theory and in practice. As this way of knowing is very different from objective, measurable knowledge that has a long tradition in scientific reporting and writing, our challenge has been and remains, how to convey to the reader the concept of embodied experience. It is subjective, elusive, and even though in some cases textually introduced, it takes place beyond any language.</p>
<p>The above examples illustrate ways of how spaces and places can lead people. The examples point out the distinctions between spaces and places (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742715013485858">Table 1</xref>): places are concrete, physical and objective; they can be experienced physiologically, whereas an experience of space can be spiritual or mental, the state of mind or inner space that one can find within himself/herself. Our illustrations suggest that different art forms can inform us about how places and spaces construct and perform leadership though embodied experiences.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1742715013485858">Strati (2007)</xref> states that not all knowledge, not even sensible knowledge, is induced by sensations. Sensible knowledge is not restricted ‘to the mere direct, physical and objectively observable relation; instead, it accounts for the subject’s intimate, personal and corporeal relation with the experience of the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1742715013485858">Strati, 2007</xref>: 62). This means that we cannot experience other people ‘as such’, but we attach experiences, instant feelings and intuitions and sometimes long-term memories and mutual histories to them. Thus, sensible knowledge includes aspects that are not directly observable. Applying this to materiality of leadership, we conclude that it has to do with aspects that we cannot directly observe, show or explicate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1742715013485858"><title>Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>In this paper, we have discussed the material nature of leadership from a spatial perspective. Seeing leader and leadership as distinct and relying on socially constructed and embodied nature of leadership we asked the following question: How do places and spaces construct and perform leadership? We acknowledge the role of leaders, but beyond that, we are led by our subjective experiences of the places we live in. We conceptualized distinctions between place and space by saying that place is conceived as objective from a realist perspective whereas space is subjectively experienced. Furthermore, we discussed embodied experience in epistemological terms. Following our argumentation and illustrations of artistic texts, music and pictures, we conclude that material places and subjectively experienced spaces construct ways of conceiving leadership and can thus perform leadership.</p>
<p>We wish to underline the following contributions of this chapter to the special issue. <italic>First</italic>, leadership does not equal leader-centric conceptualizations. This distinction shows how we speak about materiality through spaces, not through leader-person’s material body. <italic>Second</italic>, a central question has been: how does embodiment construct leadership? This question is, again, easily read as a realist question asking ‘how does leader-person’s bodily awareness affect leading people?’ But, we do not mean this, our argument is an epistemological, rather than a physical argument. We have discussed different ways of knowing and elaborated on what embodied experience is about in epistemological terms. Knowledge about leadership as a relational phenomenon is aesthetic and embodied by nature. By this we refer to knowing through senses. <italic>Third</italic>, the definitions of place and space are discussed from an ontological point of view, which highlights that materiality is not only about objective materiality, but can also be experienced, imagined or a social construction. <italic>Fourth</italic>, we find that the four conceptualizations of embodied experience advance the study of embodiment in the leadership field.</p>
<p><italic>Finally</italic>, the textual, pictorial and music illustrations contribute to the understanding of the relationship between leadership and space. The illustrations can be seen from two perspectives. On one hand, we can follow how the people in the texts experience the spaces and are led by them. On the other hand we, as readers, can ‘feel’ the space and have embodied experiences. Artistic examples illustrate the performative nature of space in these two ways. When we experience the spaces, it is not about the exact measurements of the place, but the feeling, smelling, touching, seeing and listening that delivers us the personal understanding of the space, or the music, or the picture.</p>
<p>This line of argument raises empirical and methodological challenges for future research. Although there are encouraging signs of empirical studies made through aesthetic, embodied and epistemological lenses (e.g. the Special Issue of <italic>Leadership</italic> from 2010), more systematic research is needed. One of the main tasks in the future research is to develop ways of accessing, studying and reporting on sensual knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1742715013485858">Warren, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1742715013485858">2008</xref>). Our preliminary input in this direction is a documentary film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742715013485858">Salovaara, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Future research on the material and embodied nature of leadership should emphasize studying leadership as a social construction and as a collective effort instead of focusing on the sole leaders’ material bodies. We wish to have been able to advance the discussion of materiality in leadership from this perspective. For us the materiality in leadership refers to physical materiality that pervasively leads us but is often not explicitly noted. Spaces and places are such instances. We experience places through our bodies what to do, how to do it and how it feels. Thus, the material places and subjectively experienced spaces construct ways of conceiving leadership and, in fact, perform leadership. From the spatial perspective, leadership is truly an embodied phenomenon.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1742715013485858"/>
