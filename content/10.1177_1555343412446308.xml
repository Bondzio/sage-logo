<abstract>
<p>The objective of this study was to determine whether eye and head-based psychophysiological cues were indicative of vigilance levels during long-duration tasks. For this study, 48 participants reviewed 600 visual search images to determine whether any hazardous items (guns or knives) were present. Individual vigilance levels were determined by scoring the number of correct detections during eight 5-min periods (total study length = 40 min). With an eye-tracking machine, four concurrent eye and head activity measures (blink rates, saccades, pupil diameter, and head position) were used to model changes in vigilance level throughout a simulated baggage screening task. At the end of the study, changes in blink rates and saccade rates proved to be significant predictors of an individual’s ability to detect the presence of hazardous items among other nonsignificant baggage items.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A nation’s first line of defense often relies heavily on the men and women who monitor people and baggage entering the country. Although the vast majority of arriving people abide by the host country’s laws prohibiting the import of certain banned items, a small but potentially dangerous percentage of individuals attempt to smuggle illicit items across the border. As a result, to keep a nation secure, it remains the primary job of screeners to detect the presence of illegal items before they cross the border. Effective screeners must maintain a high level of cognitive readiness to perform their task.</p>
<p>In addition to situational awareness and vigilance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412446308">Morrison and Fletcher’s (2002)</xref> constructs of metacognition and automaticity may offer further insights into screener cognitive readiness. <italic>Metacognition</italic> refers to the “knowledge and regulation of one’s own cognitive processes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412446308">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>, p. 21). Successful screening demands continuous focused attention, which often requires screeners to have significant control over their own cognitive processes. Morrison and Fletcher also point out that metacognition allows an individual to bring an “automated (unconscious) skill under conscious cognitive control” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412446308">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>, p. 21). <italic>Automaticity</italic>, defined as automated processing, implies that as individuals become increasingly familiar with the screening task, item detection moves from controlled processing to a more automatic processing, requiring fewer attentional resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412446308">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, from a vigilance perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412446308">Ditmar, Warm, Dember, and Ricks (1993)</xref> reported that decreases in attentional resources dedicated to a task can lead to missed detection of critical stimuli. In the context of a visual search task, such as baggage screening, automated processing of the detection task may lead to missed detections if conscious cognitive control, perhaps as described in the metacognition construct, is not exerted. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assert that to sustain cognitive readiness, it is imperative to devise methods that encourage cognitive control over the task to maximize screeners’ vigilance. The question then becomes how to recognize when an individual begins to lose cognitive control over the task and his or her vigilance suffers.</p>
<p>Extensive research has been conducted with the ultimate goal of developing methods to improve human ability to accurately detect hidden items. However, even with the aid of technology, most studies have shown that humans are not very good at maintaining a constant state of situational awareness or vigilance for extended periods of time, especially when the task is of long duration, repetitive, and tedious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412446308">Molloy &amp; Parasuraman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1555343412446308">Weiner, 1987</xref>). Baggage-screening tasks exemplify situations in which the effects of metacognition and automaticity could significantly influence screener vigilance and situational awareness. Unfortunately, by the time a noticeable change in vigilance is observed, missed detections are likely to have already occurred. Therefore, a first step toward sustaining cognitive readiness is to accurately recognize when vigilance begins to change. Consequently, this research focuses on determining which eye- and head-based psychophysiological cues are indicative of changes in human vigilance levels over time.</p>
<sec id="section2-1555343412446308">
<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<p>In a series of studies commissioned by the United Kingdom Royal Air Force, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555343412446308">Mackworth (1948</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555343412446308">1957</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412446308">1961</xref>) observed that individual vigilance levels significantly deteriorate over time. Subsequent research confirmed this finding and concluded that in general, the longer an individual remains in a vigilance-type task, the greater the decrease in detection accuracy and speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412446308">Parasuraman &amp; Davies, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1555343412446308">Singh, Molloy, &amp; Parasuraman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412446308">Wickens &amp; Hollands, 2000</xref>). By <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412446308">1996</xref>, Molloy and Parasuraman were able to empirically demonstrate that vigilance can decline in as little as 20 min. The state of readiness described by Mackworth and the reported decline in vigilance over time imply that humans require a certain sustained attention or alertness to predefined, specified targets identified as requiring detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412446308">Dittmar et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The inability to maintain vigilance levels has since been labeled the “vigilance decrement” and has been noted to have a particularly strong effect when the specified targets are infrequent and random in occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555343412446308">Balakrishnan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412446308">Davies &amp; Tune, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412446308">Parasuraman &amp; Davies, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1555343412446308">Singh, Molloy, &amp; Parasuraman, 1993</xref>). Specified targets within a national security context could include weapons hidden within baggage screened at an airport or drugs smuggled under clothing at a border crossing. Clearly, long-duration tasks, such as screening passengers and luggage, represent a situation in which maintaining high vigilance levels is critical.</p>
<p>If vigilance is the key to preventing threats to national security, the problem of vigilance decrement must at the very least be controlled. However, before it is possible to devise mechanisms to mitigate decreased vigilance, the underlying causes of vigilance decrement must be understood. Currently, the literature suggests two competing but related theories about why individuals are unable to maintain vigilance over time. The first, as initially reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555343412446308">Wickens (1984)</xref>, is resource theory, which purports that people have limited attention resources available for information processing during vigilance tasks. This theory builds on the capacity theory of attention, in which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555343412446308">Kahneman (1973)</xref> argues that each individual has a unique and finite capacity to pay attention to given stimuli. This theory implies that certain people with “high enough” capacity levels are better suited for tasks that require sustained attention.</p>
<p>Resource theory refines capacity theory by minimizing individual differences and instead focuses on the amount of cognitive resources required to complete a task and the rate at which those resources can be restored after they have been used. Resources in this case can be thought of as reservoirs of cognitive energy dedicated to the performance of a given task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555343412446308">Hirst &amp; Kalmar, 1987</xref>). During vigilance tasks, these reservoirs of energy are used up more rapidly than they can be replenished, resulting in vigilance decrement over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555343412446308">Mathews, Davies, Westerman, &amp; Stammers, 2000</xref>). According to resource theory, vigilance decrement is directly attributable to reduced cognitive ability resulting from depleted mental resources, not simply an individual’s capacity’s having been exceeded. Without some external infusion of energy, perhaps in the form of arousal, the individual is unable to maintain adequate attention levels for the task at hand.</p>
<p>The second theory, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555343412446308">Langer and Newman’s (1979)</xref> work on mindlessness in social psychology is the mindlessness theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412446308">Manly, Robertson, Galloway, &amp; Hawkins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1555343412446308">Robertson, Manly, Andrade, Baddeley, &amp; Yiend, 1997</xref>). According to Langer and Newman, people develop a certain level of skill or proficiency with a task and can then continue to complete the task without constant control from their attentional systems, thus allowing them to entertain additional thought processes while essentially working the original task on autopilot. Similarly, proponents of mindlessness theory for vigilance tasks believe that as people perform long-duration vigilance tasks, their supervisory attentional system loses focus and their mind begins to drift or disengages from the task and becomes preoccupied with task-unrelated thoughts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555343412446308">Giambra, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555343412446308">Smallwood, Baracaia, Love, &amp; Obonsawain, 2003</xref>). In effect, individuals begin to treat the vigilance task in a thoughtless, automatic manner. At some level, the individual maintains control over the task but also adds unrelated thoughts to pass the time. These extra thoughts actually increase cognitive load to the point that the vigilance task gradually becomes subordinate to the task-unrelated thoughts, thus causing the vigilance decrement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555343412446308">Helton &amp; Warm, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, both theories are grounded in the concept that vigilance levels are influenced by changes in availability of or competition for cognitive resources. Since both theories attribute vigilance decrement to underlying changes in cognitive resources, it logically follows that to improve or at least sustain vigilance levels, restoration of cognitive resources is imperative. Fortunately, related research has provided one proven way to influence (at least temporarily) cognitive function: arousal or stimulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412446308">Paus and colleagues (1997)</xref> define arousal as “the psychophysiological condition that increases alertness” (p. 394). In this context, arousal then can be any stimulus, typically audio or visual in nature, that elicits a psychophysiological response in the participant, which increases his or her state of awareness. By arousing participants, researchers have empirically demonstrated a method to enhance performance while participants are performing a vigilance task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555343412446308">Houston, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555343412446308">Loeb &amp; Alluisi, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412446308">Parasuraman &amp; Davies, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Although numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of providing arousal stimuli, regardless of arousal method used, the stimuli have remained effective only for brief periods before another arousal treatment was needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555343412446308">Dwivedi, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412446308">Hackly &amp; Valle-Inclan, 1999</xref>). Participants quickly attenuated to the stimuli and began to block out the vigilance stabilizing effects. In previous research, the stimuli have been typically applied in a random fashion. However, random application may not be the most effective means of stimulating participants, because the stimuli may not coincide with actual decreased vigilance levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1555343412446308">Weiner, 1987</xref>). As a result, if it were possible to accurately detect the moment individuals begin to experience a decrease in their vigilance levels, it may be possible to effectively stimulate them to higher levels of performance for longer periods, thus mitigating the deleterious effects of vigilance decrement.</p>

<title>Eye- and Head-Based Psychophysiological Cues</title>
<p>Perhaps one of the best ways to determine when vigilance decrement begins is to look at a participant’s psychophysiological cues. Often, participants are not aware of when their vigilance levels begin to wane, but changes in their subconscious psychophysiological cues may precede any actual decrease in performance. Given that the prevalent vigilance theories both attribute changes in vigilance levels to fluctuating availability of or competition for cognitive resources, it makes sense to explore cues that reflect a participant’s cognitive functions. Furthermore, such cues may be detectable with the use of nonintrusive methods while an individual is engaged in the vigilance task without impeding performance. Numerous studies, as illustrated in the next paragraphs, within the neuroscience and medical fields have linked changes in eye- and head-based psychophysiological cues with changes in cognitive function or state. However, such cues have not been studied as direct indicators of changes in vigilance levels. It is the focus of this article to explore which, if any, eye-and head-based cues are useful in predicting changes in participants’ vigilance levels.</p>
<p>One psychophysiological cue that has been closely tied to changes in cognitive levels is blink rates. Blink rates typically increase over time, especially as cognitive ability deceases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555343412446308">Stern, Boyer, &amp; Schroeder, 1994</xref>). While individuals are actively engaged in tasks requiring visual effort, the human blink mechanism is suppressed to allow increased consumption of visual data. However, when the mind begins to process task-unrelated thoughts or loses resources required to maintain high cognitive function, the blink suppression mechanism may deteriorate. Such a change may indicate the onset of vigilance decrement. Given that vigilance decrement occurs in as little as 20 min and is believed to be caused by a change in cognitive effort, it is logical that as vigilance decrement occurs, the participants would experience an increase in their blink rates. This assertion leads to Hypothesis 1: As vigilance levels decrease, there will be a corresponding increase in blink rate.</p>
<p>Unlike blink rates, several studies have demonstrated that saccade frequencies decline as time on task increases, especially when the tasks require significant visual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412446308">Parasuraman &amp; Davies, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555343412446308">Schmidt, Abel, Dell’Osso, &amp; Darhoff, 1979</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555343412446308">Stark and Ellis (1981)</xref> empirically linked an increased number and frequency of saccades to greater cognitive processing of visual images. These findings suggest that if cognitive abilities are reduced and less visual processing is taking place (leading to vigilance decrement), saccades should also decrease. Given the long duration and cognitive nature of vigilance tasks, the next hypothesis predicts that as a participant’s vigilance level decreases, his or her saccades would also decrease. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 is as follows: As vigilance levels decrease, there will be a corresponding decrease in saccade rate.</p>
<p>Another eye-based measure is pupil diameter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412446308">Peavler (1974)</xref> demonstrated that pupil diameter is sensitive to cognitive workload, especially for visual tasks. As cognitive processing of images increases, pupil diameter correspondingly increases as well. When the levels of cognitive processing decrease or are no longer required, the pupil will begin to constrict. Other researchers have also discovered that pupil diameter decreases with the length of task duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412446308">Lowenstein &amp; Lowenfeld, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1555343412446308">Yoss, Moyer, &amp; Hollenhorst, 1970</xref>). Inasmuch as vigilance is both a cognitive task and a long-duration event, one would expect that as vigilance begins to decrease, there would also be a corresponding decrease in pupil diameter, especially for visual vigilance tasks. Thus, Hypothesis 3 is as follows: As vigilance levels decrease, there will be a corresponding constriction of pupil diameter.</p>
<p>Related to eye movement is head movement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555343412446308">Heitmann, Guttkuhn, Aguirre, Trutschel, and Moore-Ede (2001)</xref> demonstrated that increased changes in head position, including increased nodding, were associated with a loss of attention. In these situations, people frequently tilted their heads in various directions in an attempt to fight off boredom and fatigue and to return focus on the task. Although the premise of this article is that vigilance decrement is caused by changes in cognitive function, not fatigue, the concept of boredom often is accompanied by the introduction of task-unrelated thoughts, thus causing increased cognitive demand. Inasmuch as vigilance decrement is thought to occur when individuals begin to lose cognitive ability, it is logical to propose that as individuals begin to experience a vigilance decrement, they will also experience an increase in head movements. Hypothesis 4: As vigilance levels decrease, there will be a corresponding increase in head movement.</p>

<sec id="section4-1555343412446308" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>To test the four hypotheses, an experiment was created to simulate the real-world vigilance task of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials viewing X-ray scans of hand-carried luggage. Similar to the TSA screening task, this experiment required participants to review 600 visual search images for 40 min while attempting to identify which images contained randomly inserted banned materials. The visual search images were created in Microsoft PowerPoint and consisted of 20 to 25 random black-and-white pictures selected from a pool of more than 200 pictures. Of the 600 images created, 32 included banned items, and the remainder contained only innocuous items commonly carried in baggage. Images containing banned items were randomly presented to participants at a rate of four per 5-min time period. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1555343412446308">Figure 1</xref> is an example of a visual search image the participants reviewed. Incidentally, this figure includes one of the banned items.</p>

</fig>
<p>In real life, numerous items are banned from air travel, but for this experiment, banned items were limited to four distinct pictures: two handguns and two knives (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1555343412446308">Figure 2</xref>). We used pictures of only these items to simplify training and limit the negative impact of employing relatively inexperienced screeners.</p>

<label>Figure 2.</label>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1555343412446308-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Prior to the start of the experiment, participants received training on which guns and knives they would encounter throughout the study and were provided a 5-min training period during which they had the opportunity to practice their screening techniques on up to 60 visual search images and ask questions.</p>
<p>During the experiment, participants were given approximately 4 s to view each visual search image, which was based on the current TSA requirement for agents to scan each passenger and his or her luggage in 3.5 to 5 s (TSA, 2008). Also, to ensure that unintended confounds were not introduced in the creation or presentation of the visual search images (i.e., easier ones first), we presented even-numbered participants the images in opposite order of that for the odd-numbered participants. After the study was finished, a repeated-measure ANOVA was conducted, and we determined that the order of image presentation did not affect vigilance levels significantly, <italic>F</italic> = 3.27, <italic>p</italic> = .298. When participants identified an image that contained a banned item, they were instructed to press the number <italic>1</italic> key on a keyboard, which recorded their observation within the eye-tracking system for subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>While participants performed the screening task, an Applied Science Laboratories (ASL) D6 Remote Eye-Tracking System was used to monitor their eye and head movements. Without physically touching or interfering with the participant’s ability to perform the screening task, the eye tracker recorded each participant’s saccades, blink rates, pupil diameter, and head movements at 60 frames (recordings) per second. The eye tracker employed both head tracking software and bright-eye technology to maximize tracking accuracy. With bright-eye technology, infrared light is reflected off a participant’s retina, which causes the pupil to show as a bright disk, allowing for easy recognition of pupil location and diameter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1555343412446308" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 48; 27 male, 21 female, mean age = 25.2, age range 19 to 55) were recruited from students enrolled in summer term Management Information Systems courses and Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) cadets from the Air Force ROTC Detachment 20 at the University of Arizona. Participants were awarded extra credit by their instructors for participating in the study.</p>
<p>Data analyses began by calculating vigilance levels for each participant. Vigilance was defined as the percentage of correct detections for each segment of the study. The 40-min study was divided into eight 5-min segments, which contained four errors each. We calculated each participant’s individual vigilance level by analyzing how many banned items he or she correctly identified during each segment, which resulted in a score of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1555343412446308">Figure 3</xref> represents the vigilance rates when averaged across all participants as recorded during the experiment.</p>
<fig id="fig3-1555343412446308" position="float">

<caption><p>Overall vigilance level (all participants).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1555343412446308-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Overall, 45 of the 48 participants experienced some degree of vigilance decrement. Three participants recorded a perfect score by identifying all 32 banned items. Interestingly, 46 of the 48 participants correctly identified the first 6 banned items before starting to experience varying degrees of vigilance decrement, and 81% of the participants identified the first 12 banned items before missing any.</p>
<p>In addition to calculating the vigilance levels for each participant, the eye-tracking system also reported the pupil diameter, blink rates, number of saccades, and number of head movements for each participant. One of the primary challenges in analyzing the data from this study was the sheer amount of data collected. The eye-tracking system captured 60 data points each second, which equated to approximately 145,000 data points for each of the four variables at the end of the 40-min screening task. Periodic missing data further complicated the analysis. Although the eye tracker performed extremely well, the system occasionally lost track of an individual’s measurements, especially after the participant moved or shifted in his or her chair. This problem resulted in a momentary loss of data, usually fewer than 60 frames (1 s). To deal with these challenges, we averaged each participant’s data in 4-s segments corresponding to each of the 600 slides. This method effectively reduced the number of data points to a manageable amount for each participant.</p>
<p>After the data were segmented, they were then normalized by calculating the percentage change from the participant’s baseline. The first 10 min of the study were chosen to establish each participant’s baseline. The 10-min time frame was chosen because all participants performed very well during this period, and their individual measurements were consistent compared with later segments of the study. All of the following analyses were accomplished with the normalized data.</p>

<p>The overall goal of this study was to determine whether any of the four cues individually or in combination were indicative of the vigilance levels of the participants. To explore the usefulness of the participants’ psychophysiological cues, we analyzed bivariate correlations between the psychophysiological cues and vigilance levels using Pearson product-moment bivariate correlation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412446308">Table 1</xref> reports the correlations of the four eye- and head-based activities with vigilance level as well as with the other cues.</p>

<p>Using the Bonferroni approach to control for Type I error across the four correlations, we set a <italic>p</italic> value of less than .0125 (.05/4) as a requirement for significance. In these conditions, blink rates and saccades were both significantly correlated with participant vigilance levels (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0125), whereas head movement and pupil dilation were not significantly correlated with vigilance. At <italic>r</italic> = –.56, the correlation matrix indicates that low blink rates are strongly correlated (large effect size) with high vigilance scores, and high blink rates are strongly correlated with low vigilance scores, which supports Hypothesis 1. Additionally, <italic>r</italic> = .34 for saccades indicates that low saccade rates are highly correlated (medium effect size) with low vigilance rates, which supports Hypothesis 2. Since head movements and pupil dilation were not correlated with vigilance, there does not appear to be any support for Hypotheses 3 and 4 from the correlation matrix.</p>
<p>To test for multicollinearity among other potential predictor variables, in addition to the correlations identified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412446308">Table 1</xref>, we also examined other potential factors, such as age, gender, eye conditions (i.e., glasses or contacts), and self-reported experience levels with guns and knives, to see whether they could also explain the vigilance levels. All other factors considered did not show any significant correlation (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) with vigilance levels and were not studied further.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1555343412446308">
<title>Regression Model</title>
<p>The next step in the analysis included developing a regression model for the variable or variables that significantly influence participant vigilance level. For the regression analysis, a multilevel binary logistic regression was chosen because vigilance, the dependent variable, was coded as either 1 (vigilant) or 0 (nonvigilant), thus causing the dependent variable to follow a binomial distribution. It is also important to note that after inspection of the correlation matrix in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412446308">Table 1</xref>, some of the cues, such as blink rates and saccades, were correlated with each other as well as with vigilance levels. When multicollinearity exists among independent variables, using all predictors (pupil diameter, blink, saccade, and head movement) in a single model may control for the correlation effects. As a result, a single regression model was developed to determine how much each independent variable helped explain the dependent variable (vigilance levels). Subsequent models excluded redundant predictors.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412446308">Table 2</xref> shows the results of the regression models with all or several of the cues. First, with all independent variables across all participants, the regression model yielded a Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of .495, with both blink rates and saccades as significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0025) predictors of vigilance levels. The second model included only blink rate and saccade variables. This model lowered the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>N</sub> to .48, and blink rates were the only significant variable (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0025). Finally, with a stepwise regression analysis, the resulting model for blink rates lowered the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>N</sub> to .406. This result was not unexpected since blink rates and saccades were so highly correlated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412446308">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Classification Modeling</title>
<p>Using the results of the regression models, we created two classification models to see how well vigilance levels could be predicted on a subset of the original data set. Since blink rates and saccades were found to be the most significant through the correlation and regression analysis, they formed the basis of the classification model. The first model included only blink rates. In the regression model, for each of the 600 time segments, the participant was classified as either vigilant or not vigilant, and the predicted scores were compared with the actual participant score (1 or 0). The second model included both blink rates and saccades and the same scoring as previously mentioned. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1555343412446308">Table 3</xref> summarizes the accuracy of the two classification models.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1555343412446308">Table 3</xref> depicts how well each model predicts the actual observed vigilance level in terms of 1 (vigilant) or 0 (nonvigilant) for each of the 32 banned items across all 48 participants. The blink-only corrected classification model achieved an overall accuracy of 91.3%, meaning that more than 91% of the time, the model correctly indicated the participant’s vigilance level. When saccades were added to the model, the overall accuracy decreased to 89.7%. For example, when the participants were observed to be nonvigilant, the blink model correctly predicted this state 74.3% of the time, whereas the blink-and-saccade model predicted the correct state 77% of the time.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when the model included both blink rates and saccades, the overall accuracy decreased. Initially, we expected that by adding a second variable, the model accuracy would improve. However, adding a second variable served only to introduce additional nonvigilant classifications when the participant actually correctly identified the presence of a banned item (or was truly vigilant). In essence, the models require a trade-off between missed classification of nonvigilant states and false alarms or incorrect classifications of nonvigilant when the participants truly were vigilant.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best explanation of this phenomenon is the distribution of vigilant versus nonvigilant states. Less than 10% of the time, participants were observed to be non-vigilant. This low frequency rate strongly skews the binomial distribution toward 1. Classification models for infrequent events often produce higher rates of “false alarms” if the desired effect is to catch all of the infrequently presented signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1555343412446308">Williams, 1982</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-1555343412446308" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we were able to successfully induce a vigilance decrement in participants beginning in as few as 10 to 15 min (for some participants) that continued to dampen performance levels throughout the duration of the study. This result confirms previous studies that concluded that the vigilance decrement does begin within a relatively short time for repetitive tasks, although in most previous studies, the vigilance decrement did not occur until after approximately 20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412446308">Molloy &amp; Parasuraman, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The previous section’s analysis also seems to indicate that changes in blink rates may play a significant role in predicting participant vigilance levels, supporting Hypothesis 1. The data also suggest that decreased saccades rates may also indicate decreased vigilance levels, providing some support for Hypothesis 2, but since saccades are highly correlated with changes in blink rates, their unique contribution appears to be minimal. Pupil diameter and head movements may be important predictors for a limited number of individuals, but in a general sense, they did not prove significant across all participants; thus Hypotheses 3 and 4 were rejected. However, it is important to note that although Hypotheses 3 and 4 were not supported within the context of this study, the fact that previous studies found that changes in pupil diameter and head movements were related to changes in cognitive function indicates that they should not be discounted, since in this study, we were looking at changes in vigilance level, not just cognitive function.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, the analysis did yield a classification model that exceeded 91% accuracy for predicting whether a participant would successfully detect when a banned item was actually present. This finding is especially encouraging because the classification model may be useful for predicting the critical moments when vigilance levels begin to decrease and when arousal stimuli can be applied effectively.</p>
<p>The lower overall accuracy rates may be explained by previous research that showed that vigilance levels do tend to vary over time, albeit with an overall downward trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1555343412446308">Singh, Molloy, &amp; Parasuraman,1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412446308">Parasuraman &amp; Davies, 1984</xref>). The classification models may be sensitive to these periods of decreased vigilance, but there was no banned item present to confirm the participant’s actual vigilance level. Follow-up studies that apply stimuli on the basis of the classification models created in this study should help improve the overall classification levels by arousing participants back to their original baseline measurements.</p>
<p>Finally, it was interesting to note that 3 individuals were able to successfully identify all attempts at deception. Given the relatively small sample size (<italic>N</italic> = 48), they represent a small but significant subset of the population. In a review of the demographics of the 3 participants, no single characteristic stood out to indicate any unusual uniqueness of the individuals (e.g., gender, age). Furthermore, in a comparison of their self-reported feelings regarding guns and knives as well as their self-reported strategies for finding banned items, all participants fell within what could be considered normal for the population as a whole. In future studies, researchers would be advised to seek additional psychological or behavioral information on the participants who score particularly well to determine whether certain personalities may be more inclined to detect banned items in a similar setting.</p>
<sec id="section10-1555343412446308">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although every effort was made to ensure the realism of this experiment, this study was conducted in a controlled laboratory setting in which variables such as lighting, external sounds, and even the simulated visual search images were all controlled. In real-world applications, the environment would likely be very different, which could affect the ability of the eye-tracking system to accurately track an individual or even the individual’s actual performance levels. Similarly, although the eye-tracking system was autonomous, it did require a brief calibration period for each participant. On occasion, it required several calibration attempts before providing accurate data. Such system requirements could affect how easily the eye tracker could be fielded and may have contributed to a decreased sense of realism in this experiment. In future studies, researchers may wish to use head-mounted eye-tracking systems that still allow for free mobility but offer the advantage of calibration file reassignment for individual users, thus eliminating the need for recalibration measures throughout the study.</p>
<p>A second limitation of this study included the brief training period the participants received prior to beginning the task. Participants were provided 5 min of training that included examples of the banned items as well as a series of practice visual search images. However, it is unlikely that they would be as proficient as full-time screeners, who have months if not years of experience. Previous vigilance research has indicated that sufficient training can have a mediating effect on vigilance decrement, although it does not completely remove the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412446308">Parasuraman &amp; Giambra, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Another potential limitation of this study was the actual visual search images. Although the order of the hand-created images was controlled for, the possibility exists that rapid familiarization to the limited number of banned items (two guns and two knives) could cause the participants to become desensitized to the target items, thus hastening the vigilance decrement. Additionally, the methods by which the visual search images were created allowed for disproportionate size of different items that is not likely to occur in real life. The size differences could have a negative effect on naturalistic scanning of the images. Participants did not report any problems with the individual image sizes or familiarization with the target items; however, researchers should consider these potential confounds in designing future studies.</p>
<p>A final, albeit important, limitation of this study is the relatively small number of participants. Future studies should be conducted with a far larger population to improve the overall validity of the vigilance regression and classification models.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the fundamental findings of this study are valid. Changes in blink rates, and to a lesser degree, saccades, were significantly linked to vigilance levels. Training, environmental conditions, and task realism may mediate the extent that these factors have on vigilance but likely would not eliminate it. Further research needs to be done to develop a system to stimulate participants on the basis of their changing blink (and possibly saccade) rates to validate whether arousal stimuli applied on the basis of these criteria are more effective at sustaining overall vigilance levels than are randomly applied stimuli.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1555343412446308">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The ability to detect the moment an individual begins to experience decreased vigilance levels or situational awareness could have a significant impact on improving overall cognitive readiness. If situational awareness is the foundation for cognitive readiness, as purported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412446308">Morrison and Fletcher (2002)</xref>, maintaining the highest levels of situational awareness is critical to ensuring that additional components of cognitive readiness are also maximized. By identifying eye-based cues indicative of decreased vigilance, one may be able to design a feedback system that can stimulate individuals to higher levels of cognitive readiness. For border screeners, using such a system would equate to being constantly ready to detect the presence of banned items. In a complex operational environment, such readiness can be the difference between mission failure and success.</p>
<p>Additionally, the results of this study seem to indicate that psychophysiological cues exist that can indicate changes in state for individual cognitive readiness. Traditionally, cognitive readiness had to be estimated, primarily because readiness refers to a potential to accomplish some task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412446308">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>). By identifying eye-based cues that may indicate current states of vigilance, which is closely related to cognitive readiness, one may also be able to discover and use other psychophysiological cues to accurately assess an individual’s cognitive readiness at any time. This study lays the groundwork for such future work.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, this study was able to demonstrate that eye- and head-based psychophysiological cues, particularly, changes in blink and saccade rates, may be indicative of individual vigilance levels. The study also confirmed the ability to track and accurately record these cues during a 40-min task. Although further research is required to determine exactly how these cues can be exploited to improve overall vigilance levels, the results from this study are encouraging and should provide direction for the next series of studies that delve into how to effectively use precisely applied arousal methods to improve vigilance levels.</p>
