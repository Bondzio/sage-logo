<abstract>
<p>Recent changes in the U.S. nonprofit sector reflect the influence of market-based public policies and values. In this article, the authors suggest a framework to assess the effects of these policies and values on nonprofit sector characteristics. They propose three models of the state along with three corresponding models of the nonprofit sector. Using recent implementation of market-based policies in two policy domains, foster care and job training, they find that the market-based policies have significantly altered nonprofit behavior and structure. They conclude with suggestions for research using their models of the state and the nonprofit sector.</p>

<body>
<p>Many recent changes in the U.S. nonprofit sector reflect a transition to market-based public policies and the influence of marketplace values. Sector language increasingly reflects “sector bending” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711432276">Dees &amp; Anderson, 2003</xref>), that is, the integration of market-oriented management with social purpose organizational goals. Social entrepreneurs—individuals embracing market alternatives to address social issues—are creating new social enterprises: organizations practicing professional business management while pursuing social improvement. “Blended value” strategies are attracting capital to social causes while promising a return on investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399711432276">World Economic Forum, 2006</xref>). Business productivity measures have been adapted for the nonprofit sector which now seeks to quantify social return on investment through such techniques as double/triple bottom-line accounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711432276">Galvin, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The recent market transformations of the nonprofit sector raise a number of interesting questions, the most basic of which asks whether nonprofits, or at least some nonprofits such as hospitals, can be justified as separate legal entities enjoying special government subsidies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711432276">Colombo, 2006</xref>). Perhaps it will prove to be a “resilient sector” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711432276">Salamon, 2002</xref>), able to integrate new market demands with more traditional practices, preserving its special legal status. Or the United States may increasingly utilize new legal forms such as the Low-Profit Limited Liability Company (L3C), adopted by many states, which occupy a space in the economy combining charitable and for-profit features.</p>
<p>To assess the effects of market policies and values, there must be a sense of the original character of nonprofits. How do we gauge overall nonprofit sector changes over time? By what benchmarks can change be measured? In this article, we suggest a framework to aid such research identifying nonprofit sector characteristics as they have transitioned over time and as currently evolving. Our approach is based on an assumption prevalent in the theoretical literature that the state exerts strong deterministic effects on the structure and behavior of the nonprofit sector. Among the classic commentators on the state and the nonprofit sector, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711432276">Salamon (1981)</xref> proposed that the U.S. nonprofit sector, far from being overwhelmed, grew in size and scope as the welfare state expanded its reach into society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711432276">Weisbrod (1990)</xref> showed how state failure to supply goods and services might stimulate nonprofit sector development as an alternative supplier, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399711432276">Hansmann (1980)</xref> hypothesized that in the face of market failure, government aided nonprofit development by imposing the nondistribution constraint as a protection to consumers and donors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711432276">Salamon and Anheier’s (1997)</xref> survey of nonprofits across several nations draws a connection between state financial support and sector development. Influences arising from civil society, religious beliefs, or for-profits cannot be ignored, but there is no questioning the powerful effects of government laws, regulatory policies, and financial instruments on shaping the nonprofit sector.</p>
<p>Here, three models of the state (national government) are proposed along with three corresponding models of the nonprofit sector. Each state model assumes distinct administrative characteristics for formulating and implementing public policies which in turn influence distinctive nonprofit sector structures and behaviors. Because of its breadth of purpose, the nonprofit sector is hard to capture in a single model. Therefore, we apply the following analysis to the large segment of social service nonprofits which have extensive interaction with the state. The premise that social service nonprofits can be modeled together is based on their similar treatment in federal law and policy. Large-scale changes in federal social policies in the 1960s contributed to the growth of social service agencies and their increased reliance on government funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711432276">Rosenthal, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711432276">Smith &amp; Lipsky, 1993</xref>). Recent implementation of market-based policies, which reduce direct payments to private providers, have again significantly altered nonprofit social service behavior and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399711432276">Gronbjerg &amp; Salamon, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Our models are not meant to be exact depictions of either the state or social service nonprofits at particular times in history but are analytic tools to help distinguish more recent and past transitions in the nonprofit sector. Applying them to the present day, we find that characteristics of all three states are exhibited across the public policy arena. Consequently, nonprofits show a mix of characteristics from all three sector models. In a sense, the state and the nonprofit sector each show three “faces.” Neither the state nor nonprofits presently are fully marketized but continue to exhibit strong characteristics of previous eras.</p>
<p>We then suggest conducting research into policy domains as a method for employing the models as analytical tools. Policy domain histories can help isolate significant changes in policy tools along with potential nonprofit sector changes. This can lead to detailed studies documenting the changes that have in fact occurred in the nonprofit sector as state policies changed. Foster care and job training are offered as illustrations of policy domains where this type of research might be conducted.</p>

<title>Administrative State</title>
<p>The administrative state dominated during the first thirty years or so of the 20th century. Public administration scholars such as Woodrow Wilson, Luther Gulick, Frederick Mosher, and Dwight Waldo wrestled with the administrative demands and implementation duties of public servants in the administrative state. This is the state of Weberian bureaucracy with respect to structure and its foundation of legal rationality. The state leads in the articulation of social and economic problems and subsequent policy response and implementation. Political and administrative processes determine policy alternatives, resulting in state-funded programs. A principle function of state administration is command and control of the implementation of uniform, nationwide social and economic policies. Although other institutions, such as nonprofits, may actually deliver programs, the state is the key player, not only providing necessary funding but also enforcing strict rules and regulations of implementation. The state retains the responsibility for delivering public goods and services, and uses laws and administrative rules to insure pursuit of broad public interest values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0095399711432276">
<title>Privatized State</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711432276">Smith and Lipsky (1993)</xref> declared the onset of a contracting regime in the United States by the 1980s. A set of institutional norms, rules, and behaviors had been established as a result of increased state spending on social services and the extensive practice of contracting with private entities for service delivery. Increasingly, the state contracted out its work to business and the nonprofit sector, issuing contracts for services ranging from cleaning offices to mental health counseling to providing security for American embassies. The state moved from “governing by authority” to “governing by agreements” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711432276">Cooper, 2003</xref>, p. 46), from exercising the state’s legal and administrative powers to govern service delivery to reliance on contractual agreements to determine service delivery conditions. The privatized state is guided by the firm belief that the private sector is more efficient, flexible, and innovative than government. Thus, policy formation and authorization (a state function) is separated from policy implementation (a private-sector function).</p>
<p>In the privatized state, the state’s responsibility moves from direct delivery of service to contracting for and monitoring service delivery. The values the state pursues are competition and efficiency. Competition among service suppliers for contracts presumably unleashes private sector energies to effect cost-efficiencies, innovation, and program flexibility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0095399711432276">
<title>Marketized State</title>
<p>The 21st century has witnessed the emergence of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711432276">Kamarck (2002)</xref> called “market government” or the marketized state. In the marketized state, market forces determine policy demand, and market tools for implementing public policies are substituted for administrative rules and contractual arrangements. The state retrenches even further from exercising direct authority in order not to interfere with the efficient operation of the market. Individual citizens are freed up to use their own assets or the assets given to them by the state to maximize their own personal welfare. Thus, for example, citizens are issued vouchers to purchase job training or housing from qualified vendors, are granted income tax credits to adopt a child instead of receiving direct state payments, or are permitted to claim tax deductions to purchase health insurance thereby taking care of their own health benefit needs. The regulatory regime of the state is reduced, moving away from state regulations and controls to use of market forces to regulate behavior. For example, instead of imposing strict effluent standards, industries are permitted to buy and sell pollution credits to reduce air pollution. The state leaves the market to determine the most cost-efficient plants and technologies to reduce emissions. The marketized state shifts the mix of public and private values and policy tools distinctly toward the private, for-profit sector, broadening the scope of that sector’s influence and role in society. Individual preferences and self-interest are the guiding values in the marketized state. Risk is no longer socialized but is individualized.</p>
<p>Obviously, a single model cannot be strictly applied to the United States in any specific era. The state, for instance, does not now depend entirely on market-based policy tools nor has it fully abandoned its role as a direct service provider. These are ideal types meant to draw attention to major changes in the role of the state in recent political history. We do see characteristics of all three “faces” or models manifested at the present time. Privatization by contracts and other means is extensive and the application of market-based policies is growing. Often within policy domains, all three faces are expressed—state imposition of program controls, extensive privatization of service delivery, and application of market policy tools.</p>

<sec id="section5-0095399711432276">
<title>Three Models of the Social Service Nonprofit Sector</title>
<p>Each state model, we propose, elicits different nonprofit sector characteristics. Three sector models—public charity, agent, and social enterprise—correspond to the three state models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095399711432276">Table 1</xref>). Each model assumes different forms of state financial support for the nonprofit sector. State financial instruments contain varied but powerful demands and assumptions respecting recipient performance. For nonprofits, these affect characteristics of accountability, management, mission, and values. As with the three state models, the nonprofit sector models are meant to be analytical tools. The models aid in comprehending major changes in nonprofit sector structure and behavior as influenced by transformations of the state. The nonprofit sector also expresses three faces in its current makeup.</p>
<sec id="section6-0095399711432276">
<title>Public Charity</title>
<p>This is the traditional model of nonprofit sector organizations: dispensing charitable services to indigents and the community at large.</p>
<p>Grants are the primary means by which the state issues financial aid to nonprofits in this model. The state attempts to attract nonprofit engagement in service delivery through the offering of attractive grant dollars. Despite the flexibility recipients have to propose and design service delivery methods, grants impose numerous administrative requirements, typical of the command and control administrative state. For this reason, nonprofits hesitantly move from a donative financial base to greater reliance on grants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711432276">Rosenthal (2000)</xref>, for example, documented how many child welfare nonprofits in the 1950s and 1960s opposed legislation authorizing use of federal funds to purchase private charity services. Among their concerns were loss of autonomy to government, bureaucratization, weakening of ties with their communities, and, for faith-based organizations, fear of government prohibition of religious practices in service delivery. Rosenthal remarks that in the 1960s, despite a long history of partial government funding and severe financial distress, child welfare agencies “looked primarily to expand the public sector as the primary vehicle to enhance comprehensive services” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711432276">Rosenthal, 2000</xref>, p. 294). These nonprofits preferred to remain distinct from the state and preserve their traditional charitable form.</p>
<p>At this mixed stage of engagement with the state through grants and lingering preference for a strong donative base, nonprofits maintain many of their traditional characteristics. Public charity model management is often nonprofessional in the sense that chief executives and office managers rise to their positions through the ranks of their occupational disciplines (e.g., arts, nursing, education, social work). Their education and training is largely directed toward occupational skill development (e.g., curation, physical care, teaching, counseling) and not toward the management of people, money, communications, and grants. Volunteer labor fits well within this management framework. Connection with the community forged through volunteerism is rated more highly than management expertise. Process accounting (i.e., number of children placed in foster homes or housing units constructed) that accounts for line item budget expenditures and output measures fits comfortably in this management framework. In respect to mission and values, nonprofits in the public charity model are explicitly focused on public service and the pursuit of public welfare.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0095399711432276">
<title>Agent</title>
<p>Nonprofit organizations in the privatized state can be seen as agents, meaning that they “act as representatives of another” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711432276">American Heritage Dictionary, 1988</xref>). Nonprofit sector organizations act on behalf of the state through legal contractual relationships.</p>
<p>The contracting regime of the privatized state requires the state to explicitly articulate what services or products it wants to purchase. It selects a bidder based on ability to deliver the good or service in the most cost-effective manner. The state enters into legally binding contractual arrangements through which it acquires goods and services in the private sector. Contracted agents are held accountable often through performance accounting methods requiring them to produce outcomes, instead of outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711432276">Smith &amp; Lipsky, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>As agents, nonprofits in this competitive, performance-based environment turn toward professional management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399711432276">Froelich, 1999</xref>) and are much less reliant on volunteer labor. They need managers who can understand contracts and competition, can manage performance-based human and budgetary resource systems, and are skilled at networking and knowledgeable about laws and public policies. Professional management discourages volunteerism and thus weakens the connection between the nonprofit and the community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711432276">Nowland-Foreman (1998)</xref> succinctly observed, “purchase-of-service contracting itself gives preeminence to service delivery over participation” (p. 116).</p>
<p>Due to the more businesslike nature of the nonprofit world in the model, client service becomes the key mission orientation. The broad concept of serving the public is translated into serving a clientele. Clients are persons eligible to receive a set of services based on the criteria of the contract arrangement. The client is assessed to determine service eligibility; services are delivered in the amount required and at a cost determined in the contract agreement, and service data on the individual are retained for accounting purposes.</p>
<p>Efficiency is a principal organization value. To insure financial stability under the strictures of contract payment conditions, the nonprofit is induced to seek cost-efficiencies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0095399711432276">
<title>Social Enterprise</title>
<p>In this model, the nonprofit sector moves inexorably toward profit-oriented management while retaining social missions. Social enterprise combines economic and entrepreneurial behaviors from the private business sector with the social betterment and service dimensions of the charitable, nonprofit sector model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711432276">Defourny, 2001</xref>). In the words of Charles King, founding chairman of the Social Enterprise Alliance, social enterprise is about “the business of changing the entire paradigm by which not-for-profits operate and generate the capital they need to carry out their mission—a new paradigm based on sustainability and social entrepreneurship” (Social Enterprise Alliance, 2006). Social enterprises are explicitly conceived to compete in the marketplace, selling services from which they seek to return profits. Instead of being distributed to investors, profits are plowed back into the business operation to bolster service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711432276">Social Enterprise Coalition, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In the marketized state, market tools like vouchers and tax credits place monetary assets in the hands of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711432276">Salamon, 2002</xref>). Social enterprises become deeply embedded in a competitive market, competing against other social enterprises and for-profits for the dollars from individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711432276">Salamon, 2002</xref>). To the extent that they continue to cultivate private donations, nonprofits may more often utilize market tools to obtain those dollars. This would include, for example, charitable remainder trusts that enable donors to take advantage of tax laws to reduce their income tax obligation and avoid payment of capital gains, all the while earning an annual return on their donation.</p>
<p>Instead of external accountability to donors or contract principles, these nonprofits measure performance by market standards. The principal measures of accountability are profit and market share. Now in the position of having to be largely self-financed, the nonprofit is forced to seek ways to guarantee profits from their mix of social programs and profit centers. Expansion of market share, such as capturing a larger percentage of the business of holders of housing vouchers, enhances opportunity for gaining profit and is a measure of competitive success.</p>
<p>Enterprise management prevails in this nonprofit model, meaning that managers seek opportunities to not only sustain but also strengthen their position in the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711432276">Spall &amp; Zetlin, 2004</xref>). They search for efficiencies in their business operations and seek to reduce money-losing services and strengthen profit-making activities. They monitor the marketplace for opportunities to expand their market presence and for threats to their position from competitors and from changes in the economy and the polity.</p>
<p>Customer satisfaction is now the mission. Nonprofits have to market their product in the marketplace to capture customers and be more attentive to pleasing customers so that they will return with their business. Competing successfully becomes the primary value for the nonprofit sector. The value of competition permeates the organization, affecting the structure and content of service delivery, relationships with customers, and human resource management.</p>
</sec>

<title>The Models in Practice</title>
<p>We suggest that these state and nonprofit sector models can facilitate research on individual policy domains in which nonprofit sector organizations have a significant presence. Such research would trace changes in state policies over time within a domain and examine nonprofit sector behavioral response to the new policy conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399711432276">Burstein (1991)</xref> defined a policy domain as “a component of the political system that is organized around substantive issues” (p. 328). He notes that policy domain research grew out of the recognition that the state controls huge resources and its policies have wide societal effects, and the recognition that policies emanate from policy domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399711432276">Burstein, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711432276">Sanfort and Stone (2008)</xref> recommended analyzing policy fields as a tool to understand policy complexities, leading to informed action.</p>
<p>Policy domain histories could show the extent to which administrative, privatized, and market tools are utilized, as well as changes in the mix of tools over time, and current trends toward marketization. This would lead to tracing corresponding effects of the mix and change of policy tools on the structure and behavior of nonprofit organizations as suggested by our nonprofit sector models. Such close scrutiny of policy domains and organizational responses would help reveal how the nonprofit sector has altered over time in relation to state administrative and policy practices. Under the right circumstances, it may be possible to compare policy performance under the simultaneous, but separate, implementation of administrative, privatized, and market models, as has been done with a Dutch reemployment program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711432276">Svensson, Trommel, &amp; Lantink, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Foster care and job training case studies suggest how investigating changes over time in a policy domain can aid comprehension of changes in the nonprofit sector. Both foster care and job training policies currently contain a mix of features from the administrative, privatized, and market state models. Both are also policy domains in which nonprofit organizations have an extensive presence. Brief reviews of the two domains are offered here for purposes of illustration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0095399711432276">
<title>The Foster Care Policy Domain</title>
<p>Foster care is a child welfare program for the “placement of children out of the custody of their parents or legal guardians after a court finding that they have been abused or neglected, are a person in need of supervision (status offender), or have committed delinquent acts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711432276">Downs, Moore, &amp; McFadden, 2008</xref>, p. 274). Children may be placed in temporary care in a certified private family home or treatment facility. Permanent placements (permanencies) are sought through adoptions, placement with extended family, or return to the child’s home.</p>
<p>The foster care policy domain displays characteristics of the administrative, privatized, and marketized models of the state. The regulatory function of the administrative state is clearly present. Federal foster care aid to the states flows through authorization by Title IV-E of the Social Security Act of 1980. The federal government regulates implementation of foster care through program requirements that accompany receipt of aid. Title IV-E imposes on states numerous program mandates such as reasonable efforts to prevent child removal from the home, reunification and prevention programs, 6-month reviews of the status of each child in any nonpermanent setting, court determination of child’s future status within 18 months of foster care placement, and adoption assistance payments. With respect to expenditures, the law mandates foster care maintenance payments by the states and sets the conditions under which federal reimbursements qualify, links maintenance payments to states’ Medicare matching rates, and sets differential matching rates for administrative and training services. Since 2000, federal Eligibility Reviews have been used to monitor state compliance with eligibility rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711432276">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>States, contracting for foster care services from private vendors have also become a prominent feature in the provision of foster care services. Contracting for foster care services by the states has grown such that “the question as to whether child welfare services should be privatized has already been largely answered” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711432276">Freundlich &amp; Gerstenzang, 2003</xref>, p. 13). Today, foster care is highly privatized, mainly with nonprofits but also for-profits, managing networks of service providers, certifying foster homes, placing children and monitoring their care, and providing institutional care for children with special needs.</p>
<p>By the mid-1990s the federal government and the states became alarmed at the rapidly growing number of children in foster care. In response, more emphasis was placed on managed care and performance-based contracts which shifted financial risk to the private child welfare organizations. Under managed care, private organizations were, for example, paid on a case rate basis whereby they are paid a specific amount to deliver a set of services to a child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399711432276">Meezan &amp; McBeath, 2007</xref>). Thus, the nonprofit service providers have an incentive to hold down service expenses by reducing costs so as not to exceed the amount they receive for a case, or even to earn a profit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711432276">McCullough &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>). With performance-based contracts, “revenues received are a function of agencies’ ability to reach contractually-specified objectives related to either service delivery or client outcomes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399711432276">Meezan &amp; McBeath, 2007</xref>, p. 389). Illinois provides an example. Foster care service providers there are required each year to accept a certain percentage of new cases while achieving a certain percentage of permanencies. Foster care organizations must therefore balance their inflow and outflow of cases to prevent a reduction in total caseload payments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711432276">McCullough &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Two states, Kansas and Florida, restructured their child welfare systems in dramatic ways that illustrate the movement toward privatization. Kansas, in 1996, went from state management of family preservation, foster care, and adoption services to a largely privatized network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711432276">Unruh &amp; Hodgkin, 2004</xref>). A state agency retained responsibility for investigating child abuse and neglect cases and making recommendations for action to the courts, but case management and direct care became the responsibility of contract agencies. The state contracted with one agency to manage adoption services on a statewide basis, whereas for foster care, the state was divided into five regions, each with management contracts. The private, nonprofit management organizations then subcontracted with other nonprofits for various foster care services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711432276">Unruh &amp; Hodgkin, 2004</xref>). The Florida legislature in 1998 mandated privatization of the state’s foster care and family preservation program. In what became known as community-based care, the state now contracts exclusively with nonprofit, community-based organizations throughout the state to serve as lead agencies for managing and providing child welfare services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711432276">Freundlich &amp; Gerstenzang, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has also shown changes in the structure and behavior of nonprofits as the state policy has changed. For foster care and social service agencies in general, privatization has driven nonprofits to become more bureaucratized, formalized, and professional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711432276">Kramer, 1994</xref>). Nonprofits tended to mold their internal service procedures and structures so as to conform to the state’s policy norms, even when those norms conflicted with their own service ideologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711432276">Hasenfeld &amp; Powell, 2004</xref>). Fiscal pressures resulting from reimbursements lower than service costs led to reduction in services to clients, reduced capacity to serve indigents, and increased staff workload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711432276">Alexander, Nank, &amp; Stivers, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399711432276">Martin &amp; Kettner, 1996</xref>). There was also a “devoluntarization” effect, meaning nonprofits made much less use of community volunteers as they bureaucratized and professionalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711432276">Alexander et al., 1999</xref>, p. 462; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711432276">Kramer, 1994</xref>, p. 51).</p>
<p>The change to new market-based policies has also had distinctive effects on child welfare and other social service nonprofits. Because service agencies must produce certain measurable outcomes within a time frame (e.g., move a child to permanency within a set number of months) or incur the cost of extended service, there is concern that they will be more calculating in their allocation of services. A financial philosophy that limits the number of services available to children, restricts time in specialized programs (mental health counseling, education assistance), or favors cases which can be most speedily moved through the foster care system, might substitute for the service mission and professionally based systems of care.</p>
<p>Two studies of foster care in Wayne County, Michigan, illustrate the compromises nonprofit child welfare agencies make. One study found that children and families served by the performance-based contract agencies “received 43% fewer nontherapeutic service contacts, 83% fewer therapeutic service contacts, and 20% fewer completed referrals for out-of-agency services” than those served by fee-for-service providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711432276">McBeath &amp; Meezan, 2008</xref>, p. 38). There is little evidence that these reductions in services were made possible by gains in efficiency. A second study, comparing the final disposition of cases, found that children under the supervision of performance-based contract agencies were more likely to be adopted or placed in kinship foster homes than to be reunited with their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399711432276">Meezan &amp; McBeath, 2007</xref>). One possible reason for this outcome was that the performance agencies received bonuses for moving quickly to permanency which was easier to achieve through kinship placement than family reunification.</p>
<p>These studies give us a glimpse into the kinds of behavioral changes market policies may have on nonprofit organizations. They indicate transformations in social service organizations in the direction outlined in our social enterprise model of nonprofits in the marketized state. Research suggests that foster care nonprofits are becoming more interested in factors like market share, successful competition, and pleasing funders. This follows on the heels of the agent model established through extensive contracting with the state. Whether they are able to successfully blend social service missions with market practices as suggested by the social enterprise model is an important question. These issues need closer scrutiny and observation over time.</p>

<title>Job Training Policy Domain</title>
<p>Employment and job training policy in the United States is of relatively recent origin and quite limited in scope, conceived primarily as being concerned with low-income and disadvantaged groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399711432276">Bakke, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711432276">Clague &amp; Kramer, 1976</xref>). There was no significant federal government manpower development and training policy prior to the enactment of the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962. “The training program under MDTA was federally administered, with training providers subcontracted or contracted directly with the federal government” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711432276">Javar &amp; Wandner, 2004</xref>, pp. 136-137).</p>
<p>In 1973, Congress passed the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), superseding Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA). “CETA required the creation of local ‘prime sponsors’ to coordinate CETA programs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711432276">Javar &amp; Wandner, 2004</xref>, p. 137). Under the Act, state and local governments were designated as the prime sponsors, totaling approximately 470 prime sponsors nationwide. The prime sponsors were the direct recipients of the federal funding. Local governments were prime sponsors in all urban areas (i.e., cities and counties with populations of 100,000 or more), whereas the states were prime sponsors for all nonurban areas. State and local governments, as prime sponsors, directly received federal grants to administer job training activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399711432276">Guttman, 1983</xref>). Under CETA, prime sponsors could deliver services themselves or contract with any organization, including for-profits for the delivery of job training activities. About 60% of the prime sponsors did so. Community-based nonprofit organizations (CBOs) saw “significant increase in work and funding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711432276">Javar &amp; Wandner, 2004</xref>, p. 137).</p>
<p>The impact of the program, in terms of private sector jobs for the eligible clients, was minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711432276">Ripley &amp; Franklin, 1983</xref>). The Reagan administration, with its strong antipathy to the public sector and preference for the private sector, considered CETA’s performance unacceptable as, among other reasons, the role for business in the design or implementation of the job training program was limited. President Reagan signed, on October 13, 1982, the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), replacing CETA. Under JTPA, “decision making on employment and training programs went from CETA prime sponsors [state and local governments] to JTPA private industry councils (PICs), which required private sector majority representation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711432276">Javar &amp; Wandner, 2004</xref>, p. 138).</p>
<p>PICs generally contracted out for the services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711432276">Javar &amp; Wandner, 2004</xref>). The federal funds went to the PICs (through state governors) in each of the designated 640 service delivery areas (SDAs). JTPA did not allow paying for public service jobs for trainees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711432276">Svorny, 1996</xref>) and emphasized an increased role for business in the job training programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711432276">Congressional Quarterly, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711432276">Ripley &amp; Franklin, 1983</xref>). It created opportunities for private businesses to engage in federally funded job training programs. However, under Reagan, all social service spending was reduced, including job training and services. By the mid-1990s, it was increasingly clear that the highly decentralized design and privatized delivery of the federal job training program under JTPA had resulted in much duplication and disorganization in the delivery of job training services.</p>
<p>In 1998, JTPA was replaced with the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). WIA included an important change by explicitly introducing a direct market instrument in the Act. It included an important provision called Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) that are like vouchers, along with explicit and measurable performance indicators and one-stop employment and training service centers. Under WIA, only those who are most difficult to employ qualify for training and are eligible for a voucher-like ITA. WIA combines features of the privatized and marketized state. It created significant opportunities for private businesses in the delivery of federally funded job training services, through competition, for one-stop centers and for ITAs. ITAs marked a fundamental shift in federally funded job training from places to persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399711432276">King, 1999</xref>). ITAs are designed to “promote individual responsibility and personal decision making . . . which allow adult customers to ‘purchase’ the training they determine best for them” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://usworkforce.org/runningtextz.htm">usworkforce.org/runningtextz.htm</ext-link>, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711432276">Shaw &amp; Rab, 2003</xref>, p. 180). “WIA . . . affected local training programs in a significant way, by requiring the use of individual training accounts (ITAs) and state ETPLs [Eligible Training Provider List] to provide increased customer choice while holding training providers accountable to performance measures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711432276">Javar &amp; Wandner, 2004</xref>, p. 152). An individual “customer” working with her or his case manager at a one-stop employment and training center may choose any training provider from the ETPL.</p>
<p>To be included in the ETPL, training providers have to submit performance and cost data. This often requires providers to create new systems of data collection and reporting which small nonprofits and CBOs have found onerous and expensive. Educational institutions, especially community colleges which historically have been major training providers, have been adversely affected by these performance and reporting requirements because they normally do not collect these data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711432276">Macro, Almandsmith, &amp; Hague, 2003</xref>). For-profit proprietary schools, however, collect such data for their own use and thus are not adversely affected financially by these requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711432276">Javar &amp; Wandner, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Under WIA, each state is required to compile an ETPL and to annually evaluate providers’ performance. Providers must provide data on “completion rates, placement, and earnings” of their trainees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711432276">Macro et al., 2003</xref>, p. 11-1). They must satisfy required performance standards to remain on the ETPL.</p>
<p>The performance measurement requirements in WIA have likely resulted in the loss of nonprofit training service providers. One study of five localities found “loss of CBOs and nonprofits . . . likely due to required performance benchmarks.” The study also found that in two localities, Boston and Philadelphia, there was an increase in for-profit providers who were “new to the system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711432276">Javar &amp; Wandner, 2004</xref>, p. 152).</p>
<p>In addition to the performance requirements, an attempt by some local workforce agencies to “benchmark” provider payments to customer outcomes increased financial risk for providers. Many CBOs and small nonprofits are unable or unwilling to take such financial risks, even when they have a long record of high customer outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711432276">Javar &amp; Wandner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711432276">Macro et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Under WIA, with its ITA-based market competition, locally based nonprofits with strong community ties have experienced significant decline in their participation in providing training services in many communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711432276">Buck, 2000</xref>). To compete successfully in the ITA market, some nonprofits, including CBOs, have adopted training program formats similar to those of the proprietary schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399711432276">D’Amico, Martinez, Salzman, &amp; Wagner, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Under competitive market conditions, small, poorly capitalized organizations, whether nonprofit or for-profit, are disadvantaged compared with larger, better capitalized organizations. Larger organizations have better access to capital, greater financial stability, and the ability to take advantage of economies of scale in providing services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711432276">Macro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711432276">Winston, Burwick, McConnell, &amp; Roper, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In a study of 591 training providers in 16 areas across eight states, the authors found that 70% of them were for-profit providers and 23% were educational institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711432276">Macro et al., 2003</xref>). Among the nonprofits, community and technical colleges are the largest group of providers. Community colleges have historically been major providers of federally funded training programs. Under JTPA, community colleges were deeply involved in delivering training programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711432276">Shaw &amp; Rab, 2003</xref>). They competed for vendor grants from the federal government to provide training services. However, under WIA “the vendor is not the central element,” but instead “two sets of customers—the business sector and the WIA clients who become students—drive the model” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711432276">Shaw &amp; Rab, 2003</xref>, p. 179). Under the ITA system, therefore, community colleges compete for individual students, not for a training contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711432276">Shaw &amp; Rab, 2003</xref>). This has often led to “creaming” (i.e., providing services to only those clients who are most likely to succeed, as the payments are “benchmarked” to customer outcomes) and limiting the access to training for those who need it most. It has “encouraged community colleges to provide fewer programs and only those programs that produce the best outcome measures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711432276">Shaw &amp; Rab, 2003</xref>, p. 186), and has sometimes led to nonparticipation of the community colleges in providing training programs altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711432276">Shaw &amp; Rab, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Market-driven ITA systems for providing federally funded training has “tightened the ties between them and the business sector” and “increased pressure . . . to become more business focused” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711432276">Shaw &amp; Rab, 2003</xref>, p. 192). This market-driven approach has created, within the community colleges, what Grubb calls “the entrepreneurial college” with “strong allegiance to employers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711432276">Grubb, Badway, Bell, Bragg, &amp; Russman, 1997</xref>) and created tension regarding the allocation of “profits” generated by “the entrepreneurial college” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711432276">Grubb et al., 1997</xref>). It has also had a strong symbolic impact. In Illinois, for example, WIA appears to have transformed some community colleges into “those that embrace workforce development as a primary mission that is equally if not more important than the academic mission” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711432276">Shaw &amp; Rab, 2003</xref>, p. 189). One community college in Illinois “reorganized its organizational structure, moving workforce development to a more prominent place in the hierarchy of the structure of the college” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711432276">Shaw &amp; Rab, 2003</xref>, p. 189).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The two brief policy domain histories above illustrate how the state and nonprofit models presented here can be used to frame the relationship between changes in state policy and administration and changes in the organizational structure and behavior of social service nonprofit organizations. Over time foster care nonprofits forged strong links with the state, becoming the principal deliverer of foster care services on behalf of the state. Performance-based contracting by the state for foster care services created incentives for nonprofits to cut costs, reduce services, and engage in “creaming.” There is little marketization of foster care services; instead there has been increased contracting by the state. The contracting relationship has elicited bureaucratic, professionalized management behaviors. Specific performance criteria and performance-based payment systems are forcing foster care nonprofits to take strict measures to protect their bottom line. In the case of job training, there has been both privatization, that is, contracting for services, and marketization of service delivery systems through the creation of ITAs. The ITAs work within state-mandated performance measurements and standards. Both for-profit businesses and nonprofits compete for individual training business. There is no direct contracting for job training services by the state. Instead, for-profit and nonprofit agencies compete for ITA holders’ business by offering competitive training “products” that account holders want to purchase. The state requires providers to collect and publish information about their “product” such as cost, completion, and placement rates, and earnings of their customers (graduates). Nonprofits have seen steady growth in competition with for-profit businesses in shaping and implementing job training programs. Large-scale nonprofits like Goodwill have been able to compete with for-profit businesses for ITAs in the growing marketized policy environment, but many smaller nonprofits have not been able or willing to compete in the new training services market.</p>
<p>Small community-based nonprofits that have traditionally played a significant role in providing training services to low-income hard-to-place and disadvantaged individuals have seen a significant decline in their role in the new marketized system. Nonprofits that have continued to provide job training services, to compete in the ITA market, have adopted practices similar to those of for-profit providers. In the case of community colleges, traditionally a major nonprofit provider of job training services, the market-driven ITA system has resulted in emphasis on marketplace competition, customer satisfaction, and entrepreneurial management.</p>
<p>More in-depth policy domain research is needed to address a number of important questions. These would include, among others, the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0095399711432276" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>What is the mix of state policy models exhibited in different policy domains?</italic> Different policy domains (e.g., housing, employment, child health care, substance abuse, environmental protection, child care) may exhibit different mixes of the state policy models. Empirical research that constructs policy histories, tracks changes over time in funding patterns and policies, and determines the mix of state model influences are needed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>How dependent on state funding must a nonprofit be for state influences on organizational characteristics to be felt?</italic> Nonprofit organizations vary in the extent to which they depend on state money as a source of income, ranging from very little to almost totally dependent. At what point do the factors associated with the funding regimes begin to shape nonprofits’ values and characteristics?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>How dominant is an individual state model in a given policy domain?</italic> Within individual policy domains, how influential is each state model? When, for example, might we say the administrative state model dominates in a policy domain? What are the measures of dominance? How precise should they be?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>How does the actual mix of state models within a policy domain affect nonprofit characteristics?</italic> Here, attention is on the mix. Assume, for example, that privatization is a predominant feature within a policy domain. At what point does the use of market tools tip the balance and influence changes in nonprofit management behavior? Do existing administrative state model features continue to influence nonprofit characteristics in this mix?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>How does the mix of funding sources and services of a nonprofit affect state model influences on it?</italic></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although, for example, a nonprofit may rely on state contract(s) as its primary source of income, it may still provide some services with little or no state support. A foster care nonprofit may also provide counseling services to children and families or to special populations which are funded by its own source of revenues and/or private grants. The organization may rely on volunteers to do such things as raise funds to support those services or to help deliver the services. Dependence on voluntary aid is a feature of our model of the administrative state. Research would need to account for this organizational variable in determining state model influences in a policy domain.</p>
<p>There is a need to take a look at the accumulation of state policy effects on the nonprofit sector. No single state or nonprofit model is fully dominant today. Rather, they are all operational to some extent. Because of the mix of “faces” the state shows, it is difficult to obtain a comprehensive sense of their effects on the nonprofit sector. Studying policy domains with their distinctive state policy characteristics would help make this endeavor more manageable. The effects of state policies on the nonprofits that operate within a domain could be isolated and comparisons made across domains to obtain a more nuanced sense of how the nonprofit sector is changing, and of what problems and shortcomings we may expect to see with each model.</p>

<p>The models suggest times in which each model held sway. However, assigning time periods to each model is arbitrary and misleading as elements of all three have operated in the past and continue to operate in the present. Even so, we can suggest the following dates in which characteristics of each model emerge in administration and policy:<italic>Administrative state, 1933-1966</italic>. Roosevelt’s New Deal administration took office in 1933 launching the beginning of the U.S. welfare state.<italic>Privatized state, 1967-1995</italic>. Johnson’s Great Society and War on Poverty further enlarged the state in social and economic affairs. In 1967, amendments to the Social Security Act authorized use of federal funds for purchase of services. Later the Reagan administration articulated a strong political philosophy of privatization.<italic>Marketized state, 1996-present</italic>. The Personal Work Opportunity and Responsibility Act of 1996 introduced a new paradigm of individual responsibility for one’s own welfare. The state assists the individual through stimulating market opportunities, but citizens ultimately are responsible for making personal welfare choices.</p></fn>
