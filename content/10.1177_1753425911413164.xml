<abstract>
<p>Intragastric growth of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> and non-<italic>Helicobacter</italic> microorganisms is thought to be associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the production of NO these effects can lead to chronic inflammation. Microorganisms can activate the expression of iNOS and the production of NO by macrophages through stimulation with bacterial LPS. <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> can evade these vigorous immune responses, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we used a murine model of macrophage infection to demonstrate that <italic>H. pylori</italic> inhibits LPS-induced expression of iNOS and production of NO by macrophages. Suppression of LPS-induced NO production by macrophages led to elevated survival of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in a trans-well system. This effect was abrogated in macrophages from iNOS<sup>–/–</sup> mice. Analysis of iNOS mRNA and protein levels revealed that <italic>H. pylori</italic> inhibits iNOS expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and that these effects occurred with live bacteria. Furthermore, the effect of <italic>H. pylori</italic> involved down-regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the translocation of active NF-κB into the nucleus. Taken together, our results reveal a new mechanism by which <italic>H. pylori</italic> modulates the innate immune responses of the host and maintains a persistent infection within the stomach.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1753425911413164" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is the most common causative agent of gastrointestinal disease in humans. Infection with this pathogen usually occurs in childhood and the bacteria can persist in the stomach for the lifetime of an individual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425911413164">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425911413164">2</xref></sup> Persistent infection with <italic>H. pylori</italic> in the gastric mucosa induces the expression of NF-κB and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911413164">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425911413164">4</xref></sup> Other inflammatory mediators, such as NO, a bactericidal agent generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) during the conversion of <sc>L</sc>-arginine to <sc>L</sc>-citrulline, are activated by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in both macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425911413164">5</xref></sup> and the gastric epithelium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425911413164">6</xref></sup> These findings indicate that <italic>H. pylori</italic> is an important factor for the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO in the host stomach.</p>
<p>Nitric oxide is derived from iNOS in LPS-activated macrophages during inflammatory responses. Following treatment of macrophages with LPS, the NF-κB heterodimer rapidly translocates to the nucleus where it activates the transcription of target genes, including iNOS and several pro-inflammatory cytokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911413164">7</xref></sup> In addition, p38 MAPK, protein kinase C and ERK are also involved in the activation of NF-κB and the expression of iNOS in response to LPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425911413164">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425911413164">9</xref></sup> Several microorganisms disrupt the activation of MAPKs or the NF-κB signalling pathway in macrophages to evade immune attack.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911413164">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425911413164">14</xref></sup> The effect of <italic>H. pylori</italic> on the modulation of LPS-activated molecules in macrophages remains unknown.</p>
<p>In addition to <italic>H. pylori</italic>, non-<italic>Helicobacter</italic> microorganisms are found in the gastric environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425911413164">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911413164">16</xref></sup> One study reported that <italic>H. pylori</italic>-associated gastritis was associated with the presence of several other microbes in the stomach, including <italic>Enterococcus</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and <italic>Stomacoccus</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425911413164">17</xref></sup> A more recent study identified 128 phylotypes in 23 gastric biopsy samples; however, the presence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> did not affect the composition of microbiota in the gastric microbial community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911413164">18</xref></sup> These findings indicate that <italic>H. pylori</italic> and non-<italic>Helicobacter</italic> microorganisms are present in the microbiota of the human stomach, and these microbes can elicit pro-inflammatory mediators and induce vigorous immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425911413164">19</xref></sup> These findings also raise the question of how <italic>H. pylori</italic> persists in the microbial ecosystem under the harsh environment of the stomach.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to address thequestion of how <italic>H. pylori</italic> evades the vigorous antimicrobial activities of macrophages. We established an <italic>invitro</italic> murine model system and an <italic>ex vivo</italic> murine model system to examine whether this bacterium could suppress LPS-induced NO production through theMAPK or the NF-κB signalling pathways. We showed that <italic>H. pylori</italic> inhibits iNOS expression and NO production by murine macrophages stimulated with a high dose of LPS. We further demonstrated that <italic>H. pylori</italic> down-regulates the LPS-induced activation of phosphorylated p38, ERK1/2 and NF-κB, and it subsequently suppresses LPS-induced macrophage responses. Thus, our study revealed that <italic>H. pylori</italic> attenuates LPS-induced NO production inmacrophages and consequently evades early host immune responses.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1753425911413164"><title>Preparation of murine peritoneal exudate macrophages</title>
<p>C57BL/6 iNOS knockout (C57BL/6-Nos<sup>tm1Lau</sup>) (iNOS<sup>–/–</sup>) and wild-type mice of the same age and gender were used to assess the role of iNOS in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced suppression of LPS-induced NO production by macrophages. Murine peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEMs) were obtained after euthanasia by lavaging each mouse with 10 ml of cold PBS three days after intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of 3% thioglycolate in PBS. Two h after seeding the cells in culture plates, the non-adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS and the adherent cells were used for further experiments.</p>

<p>Total RNA was extracted from PEMs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 1 µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the oligo(dT) primer. Quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Green I Master Mix and a model 7900 Sequence Detector System was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). After pre-incubation at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, PCR was performed with 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The threshold was set above the non-template control background and within the linear phase of target gene amplification in order to calculate the cycle number at which the transcript was detected (denoted as C<sub>T</sub>). The oligonucleotide primers were: iNOS, forward, 5’-CCCAGAGTTCCAGCTTCTGG-3’, and reverse, 5’-CCAAGCCCCTCACCATTATCT-3’; and GAPDH, forward, 5’-CTCAACTACATGGTCTACATGTTCCA-3’, and reverse, 5’-CTTCCCATTCTCAGCCTTGACT-3’.</p>

To mimic the hostile gastric environment with activated macrophages and co-infection of <italic>H. pylori</italic> and non-<italic>Helicobacter</italic> bacteria, purified LPS or PGN were added to the macrophage culture system to determine the effects on NO production. In a preliminary study, we found that treatment with PGN (10 µg/ml) for 24 h resulted in an approximately four-fold increase in nitrite (8 µ<sc>m</sc>) over basal levels in RAW 264.7 cells (Supplementary Figure 1). After 24 h of treatment with LPS (2 µg/ml), there was an approximate 8- (22 µ<sc>m</sc>) and 150-fold (158 µ<sc>m</sc>) increase in nitrite over basal levels in RAW 264.7 cells and PEMs respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425911413164">Figure 1</xref>). Murine macrophages were also more sensitive to LPS than PGN. Because of the results of our preliminary studies, we chose LPS for use in the current study.</p>
<p>In the present study, we used <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> murine model systems to reveal how <italic>H. pylori</italic> evades LPS-dependent killing by macrophages. To demonstrate that the rational design of our murine model systems mimic a real-life <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, we used wild-type C3H/HeN and TLR4-deficient C3H/HeJ mice to study the role of LPS in killing gastric <italic>H.pylori in vivo</italic>. As shown in Supplementary Figure 2, <italic>H. pylori</italic> was more significantly eradicated from the stomachs of LPS-administered C3H/HeN mice than from the stomachs of LPS-administered C3H/HeJ mice. The response of LPS-administered C3H/HeN mice was approximately 11-fold greater than that of LPS-administered C3H/HeJ mice. This result confirmed that LPS enhanced <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> activity in LPS-responsive mice (C3H/HeN). In addition, the results of this experiment proved our assumption from the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> murine models as the responses were mimicked in the <italic>in vivo</italic> setting.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that LPS-induced NO production by macrophages was suppressed by <italic>H. pylori</italic> and that this effect was dependent on the presence of live bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911413164">Figure 2</xref>). Neither heat-killed bacteria nor crude extracts of <italic>H. pylori</italic> suppressed LPS-induced NO production. Likewise, the work of von Bothmer <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that <italic>H. pylori</italic> water extract and whole-bacterial suspension produced an <sc>L</sc>-arginine-sensitive inhibition of NO synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1753425911413164">40</xref></sup> These data raise the issue as to why the bacteria need to be alive. One possibility is that the effect is mediated through the <italic>cag</italic>-pathogenicity island (<italic>cag</italic>-PAI) or VacA. Our results using isogenic mutants of <italic>ΔcagA</italic> or <italic>ΔvacA</italic> indicated that mutant <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains also inhibited LPS-induced NO production in a manner similar to the effects observed with wild-type <italic>H. pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425911413164">Figure 3</xref>). Despite our results suggesting that the suppressive effect is mediated through direct interaction of <italic>H. pylori</italic> with macrophages, the extent to which virulence factors are associated with the inhibition of NO remains unknown. Future studies also are needed on genetic analysis of the virulence factors in different <italic>H.pylori</italic> strains.</p>
<p>Several reports have shown that NO can kill <italic>H.pylori</italic> in cell culture systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911413164">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1753425911413164">41</xref></sup> Our data indicated that <italic>H. pylori</italic> could survive when <italic>H. pylori</italic> was co-cultured with LPS-activated macrophages in a trans-well system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425911413164">Figure 4</xref>).

Another explanation for the mechanisms through which <italic>H. pylori</italic> inhibits NO production is a decrease in the concentration of <sc>L</sc>-arginine in culture medium, which interferes with the <sc>L</sc>-arginine/NO pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1753425911413164">40</xref></sup> A reduction in <sc>L</sc>-arginine availability inhibits iNOS expression and attenuates NO-dependent bactericidal activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1753425911413164">43</xref></sup> Apart from competition or inhibition of NO production by macrophages, previous studies showed that <italic>H. pylori</italic> induces apoptosis in both macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1753425911413164">44</xref></sup> and T lymphocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1753425911413164">45</xref></sup> In the present study, we did not add <sc>L</sc>-arginine to cultures; we used a high dose of LPS to induce iNOS expression, and the effect of LPS was independent of the concentration of <sc>L</sc>-arginine, as previously demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1753425911413164">40</xref></sup> Cell viability was not influenced when cells were incubated with <italic>H.pylori</italic> at a high MOI of 100 and in the presence of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425911413164">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>H. pylori</italic> appears to have intricate mechanisms to regulate the activity of macrophages and to maintain bacterial survival under various infectious conditions.</p>
<p>Lipopolysaccharide stimulates iNOS gene expression and NO production. Stimulation is positively regulated by NF-κB, which is normally bound to its inhibitor, IκB, in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of IκB by IκB kinase results in the degradation of IκB, which dissociates NF-κB and leads to the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and the up-regulation of downstream gene expression. In addition to NF-κB, LPS can activate MAPK pathways in macrophages, including p38, ERK-1/2, and JNK-1/2. A common strategy for pathogens to overcome host defense is interference with the activity of NF-κB or MAPKs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911413164">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425911413164">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425911413164">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1753425911413164">46</xref></sup> In the present study, <italic>H. pylori</italic> may have suppressed LPS-induced NO production by macrophages by inhibiting LPS-stimulated NF-κB activation. Our data demonstrated that the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 was attenuated by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection at an early stage of infection, whereas JNK-1/2 was not affected. These results suggest that <italic>H. pylori</italic> targets p38 and ERK 1/2, but not JNK1/2. Our data are consistent with previous findings that pathogens can exploit NF-κB to manipulate cellular responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911413164">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425911413164">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425911413164">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1753425911413164">47</xref></sup> Together, these findings support our hypothesis that <italic>H. pylori</italic> modulates hostsignalling to evade the host immune system. Inaddition, our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms through which indigenous <italic>H.pylori</italic> survive commensurately in the stomach with non-<italic>Helicobacter</italic> microorganisms that induce potent immune responses.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that infection with live <italic>H. pylori</italic> attenuates LPS-induced iNOS gene transcription and NO production in a mouse macrophage model. We further find that <italic>H. pylori</italic> inhibits LPS-induced MAPK signalling and NF-κB activation in macrophages. Collectively, this study reveals a new mechanism through which <italic>H. pylori</italic> modulates host cell signalling to protect itself from inflammatory responses and to survive in the harsh environment of the stomach.</p>
