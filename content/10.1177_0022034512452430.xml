<abstract>
<p>The success of tissue-engineering therapies is dependent on the ability of scaffolds to guide differentiation of progenitor cells. Here we present a new approach using a biomimetic construct composed of hydroxyapatite modified with an <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived extracellular matrix (HA-ECM) and seeded with periodontal ligament progenitor cells (PDLCs). The study aimed to investigate the effect of HA-ECM on osteogenic differentiation of PDLCs and <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of the PDLC-seeded HA-ECM constructs using a rat calvarial critical-sized defect model. After flow-cytometric phenotyping of PDLCs for typical mesenchymal stem cell markers, the PDLCs were cultured on HA-ECM or HA alone in osteogenic media and assessed by MTT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assays, and real-time qPCR at different time intervals after seeding. New bone formation induced by PDLC-seeded constructs was assessed by histomorphometric analysis at 12 weeks post-operatively. The PDLCs seeded on HA-ECM showed significantly higher ALP activity and up-regulation of bone-related genes. The treatment with PDLC-seeded HA-ECM significantly improved calvarial bone repair, with the highest amount of newly formed bone elicited by cell-seeded constructs cultured for 14 days. Our results highlight the PDLC-seeded HA-ECM constructs as a promising tool for craniofacial bone regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The fundamental goal of bone tissue engineering is to produce a construct that manifests strong osteogenic properties both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mesenchymal progenitor cells found in the dental tissues can be efficiently harvested and are capable of committing to the desired phenotype in combination with prefabricated scaffolds and might be used for various regenerative therapy applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512452430">Gronthos <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512452430">Seo <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Periodontal ligament progenitor cells (PDLCs) are possibly good candidates for both cementum/periodontal ligament complex as well as adjacent bone tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512452430">Hiraga <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512452430">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512452430">Kato <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). However, PDLC proliferation and differentiation are impaired <italic>in vivo</italic> where hypoxia and host immune response threaten the viability of the implanted cells. The cell delivery vehicle may be an important regulator of the PDLC performance <italic>in vivo</italic>, and might dictate the success of the regenerative therapy.</p>
<p>Generation of bio-scaffolds incorporating extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins offers significant advantages for tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512452430">Badylak, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512452430">Cordonnier <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). We have recently reported a biomimetic approach to enhancing the osteogenic potential of hydroxyapatite scaffold by using ECM (HA-ECM) derived from dermal fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512452430">Tour <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). In the current study, we aimed to investigate the effect of HA-ECM on the <italic>in vitro</italic> osteogenic differentiation of rat-derived PDLCs, and to assess <italic>in vivo</italic> the osteogenic properties of the PDLC-seeded HA-ECM constructs using a rat calvarial critical-sized defect model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0022034512452430" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<p>The HA-ECM constructs were produced <italic>in vitro</italic> in static culture conditions with synthetic HA microparticles and rat dermal fibroblasts, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512452430">Tour <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-0022034512452430">
<title>PDLC Isolation and Culture</title>
<p>Mandibles were dissected from 6 adult Sprague-Dawley rats and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline solution (DPBS; GIBCO, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin (GIBCO), and 0.25 µg/mL of amphotericin B (GIBCO). The first and second molars were extracted from each mandible, and PDLCs were obtained by the explant method. The explants were cultured in alpha-minimum essential medium (alpha-MEM; GIBCO) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Outgrowth cells were seeded in T-75 flasks (GIBCO) in the same media and incubation conditions. The PDLCs at passage 4 were used for the experiments.</p>
<p>Additionally, PDLCs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were used for <italic>in vivo</italic> tracking experiments (see Appendix Materials &amp; Methods).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022034512452430">
<title>Phenotypic Characterization of PDLCs</title>
<p>Viable PDLCs at passage 4 were labeled with respective antibodies (Appendix Table 1), washed, and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) according to standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512452430">Moll <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022034512452430">
<title><italic>In vitro</italic> Mineralization Assay</title>
<p>PDLCs were seeded into 24-well plates (Costar, Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA; 4 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) and cultured in standard osteogenic media [alpha-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid, and 10<sup>–8</sup> M dexamethasone (all from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)] for 21 days. The cell monolayer was washed with DPBS, and the mineralization was visualized by staining with 2% solution of Alizarin Red S (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), pH 4.2, for 5 min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034512452430">
<title>PDLC Seeding</title>
<p>For alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), MTT, and gene expression assays, the HA microparticles or HA-ECM constructs were placed into 96-well culture plates (Costar, Corning Inc.; 10 mg HA/well), and PDLCs were seeded onto the scaffolds (1.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) in alpha-MEM culture media for 24 hrs, then switched to standard osteogenic media in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. The experiments were performed as 2 independent runs, with cell seeding performed on 2 different occasions. Bone marrow stromal cells were used as control (see Appendix).</p>
<p>For the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, HA-ECM constructs were placed into 24-well culture plates (30 mg HA/well); a 400-µL quantity of PDLC suspension in alpha-MEM was added to each construct at an initial density of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> viable cells <italic>per</italic> well. After 30 min of incubation in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C, alpha-MEM was added to a final volume of 1 mL <italic>per</italic> well. After 24-hour incubation, the PDLCs were cultured in standard osteogenic media for 3 or 14 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022034512452430">
<title><italic>In vitro</italic> PDLC Viability</title>
<p>The MTT colorimetric assay was used to assess PDLC proliferation and viability according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512452430">Tour <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). The MTT assay was performed in triplicate at days 1, 3, 7, and 14 of culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022034512452430">
<title>ALP Assay</title>
<p>The assay was performed on cell lysates in triplicate at days 1, 3, 7, and 14 of culture as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512452430">Castano-Izquierdo <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). To normalize ALP activity, we measured total protein content using the Pierce 660-nm protein assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022034512452430">
<title>RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis</title>
<p>The cell-seeded HA microparticles and HA-ECM constructs were rinsed twice with sterile DPBS, then a 100-µL quantity of cell lysis buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was added to each sample. The contents of the wells were transferred to a QIAshredder column (Qiagen) for homogenization, followed by total RNA extraction according to the manufacturer’s protocol (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen). The cDNA synthesis was carried out with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a T1 Thermocycler (Whatman Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) followed by spectrophotometric quantification and quality assessment with the NanoVue spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).</p>

<title>TaqMan Gene Expression Assays</title>
<p>The list of bone-related genes and TaqMan assay IDs are presented in the Appendix Table. Fold differences were calculated by the delta-delta <italic>C</italic>
<sub><italic>T</italic></sub> method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512452430">Schmittgen and Livak, 2008</xref>), with GAPDH as the endogenous housekeeping gene. The results were calibrated to PDLCs seeded on HA prior to the osteogenic treatment (day 1). Three samples for each set-up (substrate; time-point) were used. The experiment was repeated twice with the same batch of cells and a different batch of biomimetic constructs. The presence of proteins encoded by OPN and BMP2 genes in the HA-ECM constructs seeded with PDLCs was assessed by immunocytochemistry (see Appendix).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022034512452430">
<title><italic>In vivo</italic> Experimental Design</title>
<p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Karolinska University Huddinge Hospital in accordance with the policy on human care and use of laboratory animals, and the ARRIVE Guidelines. The critical-sized (8-mm) calvarial defect model was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512452430">Tcacencu and Wendel, 2008</xref>). Twenty-four adult Sprague-Dawley male rats (weight ~ 350 g each) were randomly and equally divided into 4 groups (n = 6 animals each) with regard to the type of local treatment: HA alone, HA-ECM, HA-ECM+PDLC3, or HA-ECM+PDLC14 (HA-ECM constructs seeded with the PDLCs and cultured in standard osteogenic media for 3 or 14 days, respectively).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022034512452430">
<title>Tissue Preparation, Histology, and Histomorphometry</title>
<p>The rats were sacrificed by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation at 12 wks post-operatively. The calvarial bone was surgically retrieved and histologically processed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512452430">Tcacencu and Wendel, 2008</xref>). Five-µm serial sections were prepared parallel to the sagittal line and stained with Masson’s trichrome for the assessment of the general morphology, new bone formation, connective tissue ingrowth, and the residual scaffold area. The amount of the newly formed bone was expressed as the percentage of total newly formed bone area (NFB) relative to the total possible area (defect area without HA scaffold) for new bone ingrowth = NFB/(total defect area – scaffold area) × 100%.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> Characterization of PDLCs</title>
<p>The isolated PDLCs maintained typical spindle-shaped fibroblast-like morphology and a high proliferation rate throughout passages. Flow cytometry phenotyping of undifferentiated PDLCs revealed positivity for typical mesenchymal markers CD90, CD29, and CD73 and negativity for representative lymphoid (CD3 and CD45), myeloid (CD11b), and endothelial markers (CD31) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512452430">Fig. 1B</xref>). Upon osteogenic stimulation of PDLCs, mineral depositions were detected as early as day 10, followed by a robust osteoblast-like differentiation by day 21 in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512452430">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>The PDLCs seeded on the biomimetic constructs proliferated and actively secreted ECM, resulting in a dense pellet-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512452430">Fig. 3B</xref>). Immunocytochemistry revealed the presence of OPN and BMP-2 in the ECM of the cell-seeded constructs at both 3 and 14 days of culture (Appendix Fig. 2). The rate of PDLC proliferation was already significantly higher on HA-ECM constructs, compared with HA or plastic, at day 3 in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512452430">Fig. 1D</xref>). No significant difference in ALP activity was found between the 2 substrates at day 3. However, ALP activity gradually increased during culture, exhibiting significantly higher values on HA-ECM after 7 days in osteogenic culture, with the highest value on day 14 in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512452430">Fig. 1C</xref>; Appendix Fig. 1).</p>
<p>RT-qPCR revealed that most of the osteoblast-related genes were strongly up-regulated on both substrates, with the exception of Runx2 on HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512452430">Fig. 2</xref>). OC and ALP genes were highly up-regulated on HA-ECM at all time intervals, reaching a 300- and 100-fold increase on day 14, respectively. Col1 was continuously expressed on both substrates, displaying higher expression levels on HA-ECM than HA at days 3 and 7, followed by an activity decrease at day 14. There was a significant OPN up-regulation in PDLCs seeded on HA at days 3 and 7, with no difference compared with HA-ECM at day 14. BMP-2, BMP-4, IGF-1, and FGF-1 had similar expression patterns, featuring higher levels on the HA at day 3 followed by a significant up-regulation on HA-ECM at both days 7 and 14. FGF-2 and VEGF expression levels were characterized by a temporal increase at day 3, returning to baseline after 7 days of osteogenic treatment. PDGF was continuously up-regulated on both substrates, with significantly higher levels detected at day 3 only. BMP-7 was down-regulated in all groups, with the lowest level detected at day 14.</p>

<p>Cell-delivery substrates capable of mimicking the extracellular environment of bone tissue are considered to be essential for the outcome of bone tissue-engineering therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512452430">Mauney <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512452430">Pham <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, various experimental settings have demonstrated the importance of osteogenic induction of mesenchymal stem cells in culture prior to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512452430">Castano-Izquierdo <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512452430">Washio <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>) or after (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512452430">Sikavitsas <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512452430">Uchida <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>) seeding onto the scaffolds.</p>
<p>In the current study, we aimed to investigate the effects of <italic>in vitro–</italic>generated biomimetic constructs on PDLC osteogenic differentiation by evaluating temporal gene expression and ALP activity. The PDLCs were cultured in standard osteogenic media starting directly from day 1 in culture. Our results demonstrated that the biomimetic constructs significantly enhanced PDLC osteogenic differentiation (increased ALP production and up-regulation of bone-related genes). Furthermore, the gene activity heat map facilitated the screening of the constructs for <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the OPN gene was expressed to a larger extent on HA alone compared with HA-ECM. We may speculate that OPN mediates PDLC adhesion to HA by means of a cell-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512452430">Siebers <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Since the PDLCs seeded on HA alone were more exposed to the mineral surfaces compared with PDLCs seeded on the HA-ECM construct, we may think that the higher OPN up-regulation is induced by cell adhesion to HA. Second, the rate of OPN gene expression may be influenced by other cytokines and growth factors stored in the ECM component, and may be due to different mechano-inductive forces elicited at cell-adhesion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512452430">Sodek <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>We believe that seeding PDLCs onto HA-ECM constructs and culturing them in osteogenic media for 14 days prior to implantation might facilitate the accumulation of osteogenic growth factors within the biomimetic construct and improve cell adaptation to the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512452430">Yoshikawa <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512452430">Uemura <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The MTT values and the typical morphology of the seeded PDLCs demonstrated that both HA microparticles and HA-ECM constructs supported PDLCs attachment and exhibited high cellular compatibility.</p>

<title>The Effects of PDLC-seeded HA-ECM Constructs on Bone Repair</title>
<p>Another objective of our study was to evaluate how the <italic>in vitro</italic> osteogenic pre-culture period of PDLCs on HA-ECM constructs influences the cells’ ability to regenerate bone <italic>in vivo</italic>. Based on our <italic>in vitro</italic> data, 2 types of PDLC-seeded constructs (HA-ECM with PDLCs cultured for 3 days and 14 days) were selected for implantation into calvarial bone defects in rats. We have demonstrated that the 14-day culture period of PDLCs on HA-ECM constructs in osteogenic media is more optimal for calvarial bone regeneration compared with the 3-day culture period. In contrast to our results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512452430">Castano-Izquierdo <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> showed that rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells stimulated with osteogenic media for 4 days induced the largest new bone formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, they used a different substrate (titanium fiber mesh) and a different cell-culture set-up prior to implantation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Those findings may indicate that culture protocols must be adjusted for each type of scaffold and progenitor cell to achieve the best outcomes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>We also evaluated the PDLC survival post-implantation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The PDLC number decreased significantly over time, and no PDLCs were integrated into the newly formed bone. However, the significant increase in new bone formation induced by treatment with the PDLC-loaded scaffolds suggests that the long-term survival and engraftment of the donor PDLCs may not be required for the enhanced bone repair. It is likely that the implanted PDLCs reveal pro-regenerative effects by means of soluble factors and direct interactions with host cells, without generating new bone tissue themselves.</p>
<p>Altogether, our findings demonstrated that <italic>in vitro</italic>–generated ECM deposited on HA significantly enhances the <italic>in vitro</italic> osteogenic differentiation of PDLCs. Furthermore, HA-ECM constructs seeded with PDLCs in osteogenic culture for 14 days generated larger amounts of newly formed bone <italic>in vivo</italic> compared with the constructs cultured for 3 days. Moreover, HA-ECM constructs are easier to handle and have better mechanical and hemostatic properties compared with HA microparticles alone. Our results highlight the PDLC-seeded HA-ECM constructs as a promising tool for craniofacial bone regeneration.</p>
