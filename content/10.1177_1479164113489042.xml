<abstract>
<p>The lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) has gained attention for its pro-inflammatory potential in atherogenesis. This study evaluates LOX-1 receptor modulation in the presence of an atheroprotective cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10). Both oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and IL-10 stimulated LOX-1 cell surface expression on THP-1 macrophages. However, our study demonstrates differential roles of oxLDL and IL-10 on LOX-1 functionality. Seemingly, oxLDL-induced LOX-1 promoted pro-inflammatory signalling by increasing intracellular NO, a substrate for pro-inflammatory peroxynitrite. In contrast, IL-10-induced LOX-1 facilitated scavenging of extracellular oxLDL without any effect on pro-inflammatory signalling. The atheroprotective effects of IL-10 were demonstrated by both facilitation of cellular oxLDL uptake and expression of LOXIN, an atheroprotective haplotype of the <italic>LOX-1</italic> gene. Thus, increased expression of IL-10 may help to attenuate the risk of atherosclerosis developed by pro-inflammatory signal(s) generated through the interaction of oxLDL with its cognate receptor LOX-1 on macrophages.</p>

<p>Resistance to clearance and persistence in blood vessels promote chemical oxidation of existing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles by dissolved oxygen and other oxidizing entities such as myeloperoxidase, lipoxygenases and oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1479164113489042">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1479164113489042">2</xref></sup> Arterial lipoprotein modification generates chemically reactive lipid peroxidation and aldehyde products such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal. Ongoing lipid peroxidation also triggers inflammatory reactions in vascular cells to accelerate internalization of lipoprotein-derived lipids, eventually leading to cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479164113489042">3</xref></sup> Modified lipoproteins such as oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and acetylated LDL escape detection by native LDL receptors and trigger recognition by families of macrophage receptors capable of unregulated uptake.

<title>Reverse transcriptase and semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction</title>
<p>A measure of 1000 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase enzyme (Fermentas, New Delhi, India) and random hexamer primers. Semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out to amplify all three transcript variants (TRVs) of LOX-1 individually from cDNA using LOXTRV primers (FP – CAGATCTCAGCCCGGCAACAAGC; RP – GGAGACAGCGCCTCGGACTCTA). The LOXTRV primers were designed in an exon-specific manner to pick up all three splice variants of LOX-1 under common amplification conditions with different amplicon lengths owing to the respective lacking exon (namely, TRV1-456 bp, TRV2-316 bp and TRV3-340 bp). Amplification was carried out in 20 µL volume for 35 cycles – denaturation at 95°C/15 s, annealing at 62°C/45 s and extension at 72°C/45 s.</p>

<title>Cell surface expression of LOX-1 protein by fluorescence-assisted cell sorting analysis</title>
<p>The 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> THP-1 monocytes/well were differentiated with 100 nM of PMA in a six-well plate format into macrophages, which were washed and incubated with media containing either oxLDL and/or IL-10. The cells were scraped off in ice-cold 10 mM of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. The pellets were incubated with human anti-LOX-1 mouse IgG2B antibody (specific for the C-terminal extracellular domain of LOX-1; 1:200) in 1% BSA/1 h. A parallel IgG2B isotype control was included to negate non-specific interactions. The cells were then washed and incubated with anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein conjugated goat F(ab′)2 for 1 h/4°C.

<title>Dil-oxLDL uptake assay</title>
<p>The functional activity of LOX-1 was explored on the basis of its ability to bind and internalize oxLDL. Following pretreatment of THP-1 macrophages with varying concentrations of IL-10 for 19 h, 20 µg/mL of Dil-oxLDL was added to the system, and the cells were incubated in dark under standard growth conditions for 5 h. Furthermore, the cells were washed with incomplete RPMI 1640 medium and incubated with dextran sulphate buffer [10 mg/mL of dextran sulphate, 50 mM of NaCl and 10 mM of 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)] for 1 h at 4°C to remove cell membrane–bound Dil. A volume of 1 mL of isopropanol was added per well, and the system was incubated for 25 min at RT with constant mixing. The isopropanol was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g, and fluorescence was read at 520 nm of excitation and 574 nm of emission wavelengths in a spectrofluorimeter (Bio-Rad Technologies, PA, USA). A standard curve using ‘Dil’ in isopropanol was made from the same Dil stock used to tag oxLDL. Parallel readings of the standards and tests were taken in order to avoid major fluctuations in voltage associated with spectrofluorimetry. Also, for every batch of Dil-oxLDL prepared, a standard of 5 µg/mL of Dil-oxLDL in isopropanol was taken. The amount of Dil internalized was determined from the standard curve. The standard Dil-oxLDL was read using the same standard curve. The amount of ‘Dil’ determined from the graph was tabulated against the Dil-oxLDL standard and represented as Dil-oxLDL internalized per milligram of oxLDL protein.</p>

<title>Functional activity of LOX-1 (Dil-oxLDL uptake)</title>
<p>We explored the functional aspect of LOX-1 by monitoring the uptake profile of Dil-oxLDL in the presence of varying concentrations of IL-10 in the medium. A volume of 20 µg/mL of Dil-oxLDL was added in the last 5 h of pretreatment with varying concentrations of IL-10 (24 h). The incubated THP-1 macrophages showed a significant increase in uptake of oxLDL at 5 ng/mL of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1479164113489042">Figure 3(a)</xref>). To confirm the significance of this concentration, we carried out an uptake curve with varying concentrations of oxLDL in the presence and absence of 5 ng/mL of IL-10. Clearly, there was a significant increase in Dil-oxLDL uptake at all concentrations in the presence of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1479164113489042">Figure 3(b)</xref>).

<title>Fixation of in vitro metabolic study duration (pulse–chase study)</title>
<p>In order to understand the effect of oxLDL on iNOS expression based on its signal advancement with respect to time, we designed an in vitro metabolic satire by first treating differentiated THP-1 macrophages with oxLDL (pulse) and then withdrawing the ligand and monitoring its remnant, time-dependent effects (chase).

<p>PMA-differentiated macrophages once seeded cannot proliferate. Trypan blue exclusion (data not shown) in pulse–chase study with oxLDL showed that THP-1 macrophages remained viable up to 72 h.

<p>A 5-h pulse with 20 µg/mL of oxLDL inhibited iNOS messenger RNA (mRNA) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1479164113489042">Figure 4(b)</xref>); 72 h chase without any oxLDL in the medium recovered the mRNA level up to baseline (PMA-induced expression in THP-1 macrophages). Induction of iNOS is important for NO synthesis in macrophages. Previous reports have shown that the interaction of oxLDL with LOX-1 reduces intracellular NO concentration by converting it to peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>−</sup>), which promotes NF-κB activation and a pro-atherogenic response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1479164113489042">18</xref></sup> However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1479164113489042">Figure 5</xref>, oxLDL demonstrated a stimulatory effect on intracellular NO pool (DAF-FM fluorescence) as compared to PMA baseline. IFN-γ was used as a positive control for NO generation. Ironically, a dual role of oxLDL is apparent from the existing report and our data. On the one hand, oxLDL inhibits iNOS, and on the other hand, it increases intracellular NO concentration to promote pro-inflammatory signalling by facilitating peroxynitrite formation. We believe that a probable underlying mechanism could be the induction of endothelial NOS (eNOS) activity in macrophages. This is also in concordance with a previous report that has demonstrated the existence of eNOS [or constitutive NOS (cNOS)] in macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1479164113489042">19</xref></sup> The presence of IL-10 alone or in combination with oxLDL did not show any significant change in the intracellular NO pool as compared to that induced by oxLDL alone levels. This shows that IL-10 is not involved in intracellular NO synthesis and hence is not a partner to LOX-1-mediated induction of pro-atherogenic modulators.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>IL-10 has been thought to act via anti-apoptotic pathways to induce plausible protective mechanisms in the atherogenic arena.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164113489042">11</xref></sup> LOX-1, a receptor for oxLDL, has been shown to be stimulated by pro-inflammatory signals, but remains under-evaluated for its role in response to anti-inflammatory stimuli. We used 100 nM PMA treatment for 24 h in our study to differentiate THP-1 monocyte into macrophages, as PMA is known to induce a basal LOX-1 expression in macrophages. These expressed LOX-1 receptors actively react with the moderately oxLDL used in our study, without producing any significant cell death.</p>
<p>Only a partial antagonistic effect of 100 nM of PMA on cellular expression of IL-10 was apparent during our study (Figure S2). Incubation with oxLDL (20 µg/mL for 5 h) was found to be most suitable for maximal cell surface expression of LOX-1 protein, comparable to that induced by 5 ng/mL of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1479164113489042">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1479164113489042">2</xref>). Although both oxLDL (20 µg/mL) and IL-10 (5 ng/mL) induced LOX-1 expression to a similar extent, IL-10 interestingly decreased cell surface expression of LOX-1 protein in the presence of oxLDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1479164113489042">Figure 2(b)</xref>). In fact, IL-10 at a concentration of 5 ng/mL in the culture medium was found to be atheroprotective by enhancing cellular uptake of oxLDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1479164113489042">Figure 3(a)</xref>). It is also apparent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1479164113489042">Figure 3(b)</xref> that in the presence of this concentration of IL-10, a significant increase in uptake was maintained at all concentrations of oxLDL. Furthermore, the IL-10-induced cellular uptake of oxLDL was found to be LOX-1 mediated as evident from confocal microscopy using two fluorescent labels, fluorescein-linked anti-LOX-1 antibody (green) and Dil-oxLDL (red) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1479164113489042">Figure 3(d)</xref>). The resulting yellow colour demonstrates the interaction of oxLDL with LOX-1. Its existence in cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1479164113489042">Figure 3(c)</xref>) provided evidence for cellular uptake of oxLDL.</p>
<p>oxLDL demonstrated its atherogenicity by inhibiting iNOS transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1479164113489042">Figure 4(b)</xref>), which should have ideally reduced intracellular NO levels in macrophages. However, paradoxically, there was an increase in intracellular NO concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1479164113489042">Figure 5</xref>), which serves as a substrate for pro-inflammatory peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>−</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1479164113489042">21</xref></sup> This was interesting, since one of the chief ROS known to be induced in endothelial cells is NO and induction of eNOS activity in endothelial cells by oxLDL has already been demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1479164113489042">22</xref></sup> However, in our study, unexpectedly, the predominant iNOS mRNA in macrophages was notably inhibited by oxLDL. This, along with the increase in NO radical itself suggested the induction of an NO source independent of iNOS in the presence of oxLDL. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of trace amounts of eNOS/cNOS mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1479164113489042">19</xref></sup> in macrophages. So, our results suggests that when LOX-1 signalling takes priority, oxLDL probably induces eNOS in macrophages as well, a phenomenon previously reported only in endothelial cells.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been shown that LOXIN, a TRV (TRV3, 22 kDa) of LOX-1, reduced the risk of myocardial infarction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1479164113489042">20</xref></sup> while the other variants of <italic>LOX-1</italic> gene, namely, TRV1 and TRV2 did not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1479164113489042">23</xref></sup> Since IL-10 has so far demonstrated an atheroprotective response, we wanted to evaluate the status of the atheroprotective LOXIN in response to IL-10 treatment. We found that IL-10 increased the expression of LOXIN and hence reduced the ratio of TRV1/TRV3 in THP-1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1479164113489042">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, our study shows that oxLDL exhibits its atherogenicity by increasing intracellular NO concentration, a substrate for pro-inflammatory ‘peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>−</sup>)’. Earlier reports have shown that the intracellular increase in ONOO<sup>−</sup> (reaction product of NO and superoxide anion) is mediated by the interaction of oxLDL with LOX-1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1479164113489042">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1479164113489042">24</xref></sup> Since oxLDL inhibited iNOS in our study, the results suggest an alternative source for NO generation by oxLDL. The probable effecter here could be the constitutive/endothelial NOS (cNOS), which has been reported to be present in macrophages of physiological origin as well as in cell line–derived macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1479164113489042">19</xref></sup> Alternatively, IL-10 is atheroprotective by committing LOX-1 receptor towards scavenging of extracellular oxLDL, rather than signalling.</p>
<p>While the maintenance of cell surface expression of LOX-1 is probably taken as a common responsibility by both oxLDL and IL-10, the differential regulation of receptor functionality (signalling/uptake) was evident. Interaction of oxLDL with LOX-1 induced downstream pro-inflammatory signalling cascade, whereas IL-10 reduced the atherogenic profile of the extracellular environment by facilitating clearance of accumulating oxLDL particles via LOX-1-mediated cellular uptake (probably followed by lysosomal digestion). Hence, IL-10 behaves as an athero-protectant by suppressing oxLDL-triggered LOX-1 signalling. In addition, IL-10 also promotes expression of the non-risk LOX-1 splice variant ‘LOXIN (or TRV3)’, an atheroprotective competent for the atherogenic, namely, TRV1 and TRV2 LOX-1 variants.</p>
