<abstract>
<p>Patients commonly experience some physicians’ ways of interacting with them as detached and indicating a lack of concern for their welfare. This is likely to add to the distress experienced by a person seeking healing, as well as interfering with the exchange of information required for good medical care. Despite contemporary medical schools’ focus on clinical communication, and on training for ‘patient-centred’ practice, problems with the relations between doctors and patients are still widely acknowledged. The importance of demonstrating empathy, compassion and caring has been highlighted in the literature. In this article I draw on a clinical narrative to elucidate my interpretation of engagement, which entails practices of attentiveness, respectful dialogue and commitment. I propose that practising engagement may help medical students and doctors to infuse their clinical encounters with empathy and compassion, with the aim of providing care that is experienced as being more humane. This practice has the potential to contribute to innovative pedagogical approaches to clinical communication.</p>

<title>The problem of detachment</title>
<p>Despite the undoubted benefits of modern medicine and the respect many people have for their medical attendants, it is common to hear people express disappointment about the ways in which doctors relate to them. A considerable amount of literature addresses the perception by many patients of inadequate concern, or insensitivity, on the part of some doctors and other health care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459311416834">Bail, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311416834">Frank, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311416834">2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459311416834">Suchman et al., 2004</xref>). This can add to the suffering due to the illness, as well as impeding information exchange needed for good medical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459311416834">Roter and Hall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363459311416834">Siegler, 1981</xref>). This concern is particularly expressed in relation to the training of future doctors, to the extent that a decrease in students’ capacity for empathy during their time in medical school has been observed in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311416834">Egnew and Wilson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459311416834">Feudtner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311416834">Hojat et al., 2009</xref>). Aspects of the learning environment and culture of the teaching hospital, collectively referred to as the ‘hidden curriculum’, have been implicated as contributing to this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311416834">Hojat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459311416834">Suchman et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Empathy is acknowledged as an important element of clinical practice, and students and physicians are encouraged to demonstrate empathy towards patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311416834">Crandall and Marion, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459311416834">DasGupta and Charon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311416834">Halpern, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459311416834">Haslam, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311416834">Hojat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363459311416834">Spiro, 2009</xref>). However, there is a lack of consensus as to whether a clinician’s emotions are an integral part of the experience, or whether it is an exclusively cognitive skill. In addition there is limited guidance for those who do not find that empathizing with patients comes naturally.</p>
<p>Recently, several authors have proposed that acts of caring and compassion may be more helpful than empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311416834">Marshall and Bleakley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363459311416834">Weiner and Auster, 2007</xref>). In this article I will discuss the usefulness and limitations of these approaches. I will propose that engagement could be a way of guiding actions motivated by compassion and empathy within the clinical encounter.</p>
<p>Based upon an exploration of relevant literature, I would like to offer an account of engagement that entails practices of attentiveness, respectful dialogue and commitment to action. I will present a clinical narrative, along with an interpretation informed by the idea of the practice of engagement. While this approach would be of relevance to medical students, educators and physicians generally, it may be particularly useful for those treating people with persistent or serious illness. For when a person’s life is threatened or forever changed by illness, the potential is greater for clinical relationships either to promote healing, or conversely to exacerbate suffering.</p>
<p>The degree to which detachment is fostered by the culture of medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459311416834">Montgomery, 2006</xref>) is my reason for focusing on the problem for medical encounters specifically, although similar issues exist for all health professionals.</p>

<sec id="section3-1363459311416834">
<title>The importance of context</title>
<p>What transpires between two or more people in any clinical interaction is influenced by many aspects of the context in which it takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311416834">Berg, 1992</xref>). Physical environments vary widely: in a primary care setting, a doctor and patient may complete their interaction undisturbed. In a hospital ward, things tend to be more complex and messy, with frequent interruptions and a need to collaborate with colleagues and other care providers along the way.</p>
<p>Contextual factors such as time, patient finances and organizational practices, alongside the medical history, examination and investigation findings, influence the types of medical solutions devised for a patient’s presenting problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311416834">Berg, 1992</xref>). However, there is scant mention in Berg’s article of the patient as an agent in the process, or of the potential influence of emotion on decision making.</p>
<p>Attributes of both physicians and patients may have a profound influence on how interactions unfold, and can be considered as social and cultural aspects of context. These include gender, socio-economic status, educational level and ethnicity as well as the expectations and assumptions each brings to the meeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459311416834">Roter and Hall, 2006</xref>). The potential for an engaged interaction may be enhanced through consideration and modification of the context in which it takes place, such as the time and location, the presence or absence of other people and the length of time made available for the meeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459311416834">Marshall and Bleakley, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Collaborative work in multi-disciplinary teams is usually part of the context of contemporary health care practice. Distributed cognition theory has been applied in critical health care environments in order to produce models for decision making and develop technologies to support effective practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311416834">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>). In teamwork, the decision-making process is shared or distributed across team members, as well as across artefacts, such as case notes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311416834">Bleakley and Bligh, 2009</xref>). The increasing reliance on imaging and other technologies for diagnosis, often supplanting physical examination, extends the distribution of cognition beyond those in direct contact with a patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311416834">Bleakley and Bligh, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The strength of the team lies in the extension of its collective cognitive capacity beyond that of any one team member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311416834">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>). However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311416834">Bleakley and Bligh (2009)</xref> point out, cognitive distribution carries with it a propensity for fragmentation and dispersal of the clinical gaze. Rather than leading to a productive sharing of responsibility for health, this dispersal may instead lead to ‘the emergence of a vacuum in which responsibility disappears or becomes distorted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311416834">Bleakley and Bligh, 2009</xref>: 381). Patients may experience this vacuum as disengagement on the part of their doctor.</p>
<p>Yet, within the possibilities and constraints of context in any particular encounter, there is the potential for physicians to act in ways that better meet the emotional and social needs of their patients. While acknowledging the important communication-related issues within and between clinical teams, this article will focus on the ways in which students’ and physicians’ practices within their encounters with patients could contribute to change.</p>

<sec id="section4-1363459311416834">
<title>Distance and connectedness</title>
<p>A tension exists between the need for a degree of distance and the desire for a sense of connectedness between the parties to the clinical encounter. It has long been assumed that an attitude of detachment is essential for professionalism in medicine. It is a way of relating to patients that is inculcated by both overt and tacit means into medical students and physicians from the earliest stages of their clinical education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459311416834">Montgomery, 2006</xref>). A greater degree of distance may also be preferred by patients in particular situations, as demonstrated by the observation that they tend to look away from the doctor during physical examinations, particularly those of an intimate nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311416834">Robinson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it has been argued that the degree of detachment characterizing many contemporary clinical interactions can add to the suffering of patients, in particular those with chronic or life-threatening illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311416834">Halpern, 2001</xref>). This way of relating can also have a negative impact on physicians’ well-being in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459311416834">Bleakley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311416834">Kleinman, 1988</xref>). Physicians’ capacity to provide good medical care is also at stake since, when a lack of a sense of connectedness limits the exchange of important information, data which are critical to good diagnosis or treatment may fail to be communicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459311416834">Kleinman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459311416834">Roter and Hall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363459311416834">Siegler, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363459311416834">West, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>A degree of emotional distance of doctors from their patients is considered necessary, both to facilitate rational clinical decision making, as well as to enable clinicians to carry out tasks which might otherwise be emotionally overwhelming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459311416834">Holt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459311416834">Montgomery, 2006</xref>). Physicians’ emotions within clinical encounters have received limited research attention, and they may either be unaware of them or take steps to suppress them deliberately. Doctors may orchestrate medical visits in such a way as to protect themselves from uncomfortable emotions, by, for example, restricting the talk to highly structured data-gathering activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459311416834">Roter and Hall, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Following her ethnographic studies on medical education beginning in the 1950s, Fox described the attitude towards patients developed by medical students as one of ‘detached concern’, detailing how students began with what they perceived to be excessive emotional involvement, passing through a stage of increased detachment to one in which, by the end of their studies, they were able to ‘blend objectivity … with compassionate concern’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311416834">Fox, 1989</xref>: 87). However, this description suggests a state that is universally achieved, and fails to address the question as to whether in some circumstances excessive detachment (or excessive concern) might persist or intensify beyond graduation into clinical practice. In addition, this interpretation is based upon students’ views, to the exclusion of patients’ or others’ perceptions of their actions.</p>
<p>In her exploration of the meaning and importance of clinical empathy, psychiatrist and philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311416834">Jodie Halpern (2001)</xref> disputes the appropriateness of an attitude of detached concern. She contends that the medical profession promotes a norm of emotional detachment for fear that clinicians’ emotions will have a negative influence on their decision making. However, she argues that the denial of one’s own emotional reactions does not prevent them from exerting an influence on the decision-making process. Her account of empathy is one which entails an exercise of the imagination which is guided by emotional processes, and she advocates that doctors learn to ‘become more reflective about their own emotional responses and learn to use these responses skilfully, rather than try to detach from them and be influenced by them anyway’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311416834">Halpern, 2001</xref>: 10).</p>
<p>Following recognition of the link between communication and emotion, interest has developed among medical education researchers in the construct of Emotional Intelligence (EI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459311416834">Jensen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363459311416834">Stratton et al., 2008</xref>). It has been described as the capacity to recognize and adapt to one’s own and others’ emotional states, encompassing verbal and non-verbal emotional appraisal, expression, regulation and the utilization of emotional content of an interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363459311416834">Stratton et al., 2008</xref>). There is no universally accepted measure of EI, and many are entirely based on self-assessment. In one study, changes in EI scores and in a measure of empathy were measured from the first to the third year of students’ clinical training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363459311416834">Stratton et al., 2008</xref>). There were modest but significant reductions over time in students’ ability to regulate their own emotions and to develop empathic concern, as well as an increase in personal distress in relation to that of others. The significance of these findings is uncertain, and there is no justification for utilizing measures of EI for screening or evaluation of students or trainees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459311416834">Jensen et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>I will now examine some of the achievements and limitations of medical students’ education in clinical communication, highlighting some of the difficulties students face when they enter clinical environments after learning about clinical communication in the classroom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1363459311416834">
<title>Clinical communication and medical education</title>
<p>A critical site for potential change is the medical school, where students first learn through the examples of their teachers, other clinicians and their peers how to relate with patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459311416834">Montgomery, 2006</xref>). Researchers have studied the ‘socialization’ of students into the values and behaviours of medical culture during their training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311416834">Becker et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311416834">Merton et al., 1957</xref>). The problem of how to educate future doctors so as to enable them to provide both technically competent and humane care continues to occupy both researchers and medical educators.</p>
<p>There has been international recognition by medical educators that patients in contemporary health care systems expect doctors to relate to them in different ways from those which were expected in the past. Given its critical importance in the clinical encounter, effective communication needs to be recognized as a health intervention in its own right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459311416834">Roter and Hall, 2006</xref>). Responding to the need for change, the teaching and assessment of clinical communication are now included in curricula for both medical students and junior doctors in a number of countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459311416834">Association of American Medical Colleges, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459311416834">Confederation of Postgraduate Medical Education Councils, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459311416834">General Medical Council, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459311416834">Tuning Project (Medicine) Steering Group and Task Force, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the teaching, assessment and research on clinical communication are based on one-to-one encounters either employing fellow students, ‘simulated patients’ (actors or volunteers trained to play the part) or real patients in primary care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459311416834">Ishikawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363459311416834">Ruusuvuori, 2001</xref>). In this way, students are taught instrumental skills and strategies for building rapport, eliciting and giving information. In contrast, the teaching hospital, in which most students’ earliest encounters with real patients take place, is a complex and messy environment, with competing demands on the time and attention of all concerned. The emotional content of simulated or peer-to-peer encounters is likely to be quite different from those with hospital patients, who may be in some degree of concern or emotional distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459311416834">Malhotra et al., 2009</xref>). In addition there is little or no training for clinical teachers in how to help students learn about this domain of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311416834">Egnew and Wilson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Concern has been expressed in relation to the heavy reliance on simulation in contemporary medical education, and in particular with the integration of technical skills training with the teaching of specific communication ‘skills’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311416834">Bleakley and Bligh, 2009</xref>). In simulated, standardized clinical encounters, students lack opportunities to ‘attune to complexities of patient communication that are liminal or unconscious’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311416834">Bleakley and Bligh, 2009</xref>: 381) Simulated learning may be perceived by students as more authentic than that done with real patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311416834">Bleakley and Bligh, 2009</xref>), particularly when grading of their performance often involves simulated encounters. An assessment process has been designed, known as the Integrated Procedural Performance Instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459311416834">Kneebone et al., 2006</xref>), which utilizes inanimate models combined with simulated patients, and is claimed to allow the evaluation of both communication and technical skills, However, it may be argued that such an approach neglects the embodied subtleties of human interaction, and risks dehumanizing an encounter which should be ‘subjective and humane’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311416834">Bleakley and Bligh, 2009</xref>: 371).</p>
<p>Many aspects of the learning environment in the medical school may present resistance to the changes which innovations in the formal curriculum are intended to bring about. The term ‘hidden curriculum’ refers to the processes of everyday practice from which students learn, which lie outside of an official academic agenda, and which usually remain unarticulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459311416834">Browning et al., 2007</xref>). The social environment of the teaching hospital is highly influential and leads students to ‘internalize and perpetuate patterns of behaviour that surround them – the way they see people treating each other and the way they themselves are treated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459311416834">Suchman et al., 2004</xref>: 501). Students observe interactions between clinicians and patients that, in many cases, contrast sharply with the ways in which students have been taught in the classroom about appropriate communication practices. In addition, the ways in which some doctors interact with their fellow team members, including nurses or junior colleagues, do not present a positive model of collaborative dialogue.</p>
<p>In an illuminating reflection on clinical communication, drawing on insights from a reading of Homer’s <italic>Iliad</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459311416834">Marshall and Bleakley (2008</xref>: 30) argue that, if communication is taught merely as a set of skills to be acquired and competencies to be assessed, interactions may result which are ‘mechanistic, shallow and simplistic’. If teaching and observed practice do not pay attention to the social and emotional content of the interaction, the potential benefits of addressing communication in medical education may not be realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311416834">Marshall and Bleakley, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Engaging with empathy</title>
<p>A focus of intense contemporary interest in the field of patient–physician relations, empathy is a relatively modern term in English, having been translated from the German word <italic>einfühlung</italic>. This term was first used in art appreciation, as a way of describing an observer imaginatively ‘entering into’ a work of art. Its ancient Greek meaning entailed ‘a state of emotional engagement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311416834">Marshall and Bleakley, 2009</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>In the literature relating to empathy in clinical settings, the meaning of the term is elusive and somewhat contested. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311416834">Halpern (2001)</xref>, sees it as entailing emotional responses on the part of the clinician, whereas others exclude these completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311416834">Hojat et al., 2009</xref>), perhaps in order more easily to assess it quantitatively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459311416834">Norfolk et al. (2007)</xref> acknowledge that clinician emotional responses may be involved, but focus predominantly on the cognitive and behavioural aspects. Haslam defines empathy in the medical context as the ‘appreciation of the patient’s emotions and the expression of that awareness to the patient’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459311416834">Haslam, 2007</xref>: 381).</p>
<p>In the practice of psychotherapy, the metaphor of blurring boundaries between the self and other, followed by restoration of separateness, has been used to describe the experience of empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459311416834">Schafer, 2004</xref>). Halpern presents an account of empathy which she considers to be achievable within clinical settings more generally, which involves the doctor attuning or attempting to perceive and match inwardly the patient’s emotions, while demonstrating curiosity, to seek actively the confirmation or correction of one’s interpretations. As well, the importance of being open to one’s own emotions including anger, frustration or shame, and recognizing them as one’s own rather than as coming from the patient, is emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311416834">Halpern, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459311416834">2003</xref>). Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459311416834">Haslam (2007)</xref>, she makes the case that practising empathy can reverse the tendency towards dehumanization which can occur during medical interactions.</p>
<p>Potential changes to curricula within medical schools to counteract the reported decline in empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311416834">Hojat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363459311416834">Spiro, 2009</xref>) have been advocated, including recording encounters for feedback, reflective writing activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311416834">Kind et al., 2009</xref>), close reading of literature and narrative work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311416834">Charon, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459311416834">DasGupta and Charon, 2004</xref>) and participation in Balint groups exploring the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311416834">Lustig, 2008</xref>). However it is argued that profound changes to the way clinicians behave in everyday practice would also be necessary to have a major impact on students’ decline in empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459311416834">Halpern, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311416834">Hojat et al., 2009</xref>), since this is identified as a strong influence upon students’ own attitudes and behaviour.</p>

<title>Rediscovering compassion</title>
<p>A number of authors have expressed concern about the focus on empathy as the solution to the perceived problem of medical detachment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311416834">Marshall and Bleakley (2009</xref>: 9) problematize the concept of empathy as used in the context of general medical practice, arguing that the term appears to have lost its early meaning and may now represent an construct, ‘what empathy scales measure’, rather than ‘a tangible state of being’.</p>
<p>They advocate a revival of the ideas of compassion and pity as a way of describing the human response to suffering. The word pity has come to imply superiority and distance, but is defined by the <italic>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</italic> as ‘a feeling of tenderness aroused by the suffering or misfortune of another, and prompting a desire for its relief’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311416834">Marshall and Bleakley, 2009</xref>: 9). Compassion has a similar meaning, and since it appears to be free of the negative connotations attached to the word pity, may be more appropriate to use in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311416834">Marshall and Bleakley, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Weiner and Auster define caring acts as those which are taken in order to meet another’s needs, in order to improve their human condition. They are described in the context of patient-physician interactions as requiring ‘an intense effort to appreciate a patient’s situation by asking the ‘right’ questions and then listening precisely in a manner that is unselfconscious, non-judgemental, and open fully to the other’s perspective’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363459311416834">Weiner and Auster, 2007</xref>: 126). To listen precisely, close observation of the patient and an understanding of the context of the clinical meeting are required.</p>
<p>The importance of asking ‘the right question’ is also emphasized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311416834">Frank (2004a</xref>: 220), who goes on to suggest that ‘asking the right clinical question involves more unlearning than learning’. In other words, in some circumstances the novice or layperson may find it easier to elicit the patient’s most pressing concern than the trained practitioner. This may be related to medicine’s tendency to focus on the disease rather than the person and to the relative neglect of the subtleties of human interaction in medical education.</p>

<title>Practising engagement</title>
<p>In order to illustrate better what I mean by practising engagement, I would like to present a clinical narrative based on a situation I encountered in my clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363459311416834">1</xref></sup> I have told the story in such a way that only the doctor’s point of view has been presented, which allows the reader insight into the imagined thoughts and emotional responses of the doctor, but they are only able to speculate about those of the other characters. I have chosen this approach because I am focusing on the way in which changes in physicians’ practices within the consultation might influence its nature and outcome. Subsequently, I will reflect upon the story, to discuss how engagement practices involving attentiveness to self and the other, respectful dialogue and commitment may represent a way of enhancing clinical communication with empathy and compassion.</p>

<title>Simon’s story</title>
<p>‘That man is his own worst enemy!’ Simon’s frustration was high as he drove home after a busy day in his primary care practice, including an afternoon of visits to residential care facilities. As he walked with his dog by the river that evening, he was still thinking about Michael, an elderly patient he had seen that day, but the calm induced by the serenity of the setting put him in a more reflective mood. Simon had only been Michael’s doctor for a few months, and when he had first started seeing him, the senior nurse Jenny had told him that Michael had previously dismissed two other doctors. She had described him as a difficult patient, who was frequently non-compliant with recommended treatments.</p>
<p>Michael had undergone an amputation of his left foot several years earlier, and recently had developed swelling and ulceration of his right leg. During Simon’s visit, Michael had not made eye contact with him and had hardly spoken. Since Jenny had dressed the wound that morning, they agreed there was no need to examine him on this occasion. As they stood before his wheelchair, the major concern for both Jenny and Simon was the swelling of Michael’s leg.</p>
<p>‘He won’t put his leg up as I have asked him to, Simon’, said Jenny pointedly. ‘Or if he does, he puts it down again as soon as we leave the room.’</p>
<p>‘You know you need to do as Jenny says, Michael’, Simon added, ‘or that leg won’t get better.’ He had to raise his voice, since Michael was hard of hearing and reluctant to wear his hearing aids. He and Jenny discussed what kind of dressing and bandage would be best, and as they began to move on to the next resident, Michael hardly seemed to notice their departure.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the encounter that evening, Simon felt uneasy. He realized that he needed to take a different approach with Michael, to try and understand his reluctance to follow advice.</p>
<p>When Simon entered his room several days later, Michael was sitting in his wheelchair, looking down, and Simon noticed a pained expression on his face. There was a noticeable odour in the room and a wet stain on the bandage. Simon asked him if he would lie on the bed, then found a chair and sat down beside him. After Michael had settled himself, Simon asked ‘What’s bothering you most about your leg, Michael?’</p>
<p>In response to Simon’s question, Michael revealed more in a few minutes than he had in the months since they had met. He described ‘terrible pain’ which started soon after he put his leg up on the bed at night, keeping him awake. He could only find relief by hanging his leg over the side of the bed for a while. But when he put it back on the bed, the pain would start up again.</p>
<p>‘Did you tell anyone about this?’ Simon asked. ‘I’m sure the nurses would want you to let them know if you’re in pain, so they can give you something for it.’</p>
<p>‘I didn’t think anyone would be interested, so I thought I just had to put up with it,’ replied Michael.</p>
<p>His story suggested severely impaired circulation, and Simon’s examination was consistent with this diagnosis. Michael’s foot was pale and cool with no pulse, and there were signs that infection was complicating the poor circulation.</p>
<p>Realizing that Michael had suffered distressing pain which had been unrelieved, Simon felt regret and a degree of shame that he had not made the effort to hear Michael’s story earlier. He had interpreted Michael’s failure to follow advice about putting the leg up as ‘non-compliance’ rather than considering the reasons for his actions. He now felt kindness towards him, which moved him to act to relieve Michael’s suffering as best he could.</p>
<p>‘Am I going to lose this leg too?’ Michael asked. Simon assured him he would do everything he possibly could to avoid this happening, by treating the pain and infection and seeking expert advice about the circulation.</p>
<p>He arranged an urgent consultation for Michael with a vascular surgeon in the hospital clinic, to see whether anything could be done to improve the circulation to the leg. He prescribed antibiotics and stronger pain relieving drugs, and Jenny suggested a pain chart to help in the monitoring and control of Michael’s pain.</p>
<p>Recognizing that the hospital doctors might have problems communicating with Michael, Simon described Michael’s experience of pain in his letter and even included some of the patient’s own words to get the message across. He requested that the doctor seeing Michael call and let him know what was planned, and was relieved to hear that Michael was to be admitted that day for investigation, with a view to restoring the blood flow to his leg.</p>

<title>Reflecting on practices of engagement</title>
<sec id="section12-1363459311416834">
<title>Practising attentiveness</title>
<p>To make the connection that is vital for engagement, an attitude of openness is required, so that the doctor is able to be attentive to the patient as well as to his or her own responses. It is necessary to attend to the patient’s bodily as well as verbal communication, including their posture, tone of voice and facial expression, which may provide clues to their emotional state. These clues may help move the doctor towards an empathic understanding, but they need to be checked for accuracy through respectful dialogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311416834">Halpern, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459311416834">Norfolk et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Attentiveness may be manifest in language: the spoken word, the use of silences or written representations of the patient’s story; or embodied in a glance, gesture, touch, tone of voice or the position of the bodies of the doctor and patient in relation to one another. While some forms of non-verbal expression such as gaze direction or postural orientation may be adopted deliberately, more subtle phenomena such as changes in facial expression and tone of voice may take place in response to internal emotional states. While physicians may seek to conceal the outward display of some emotions such as anger or disgust, the display of emotions such as kindness or compassion revealed in tone of voice or facial expression is likely to form a stronger bond than the recitation of lines learnt in communication skills classes alone.</p>
<p>The consequences of a lack of embodied attentiveness are evident in a story told by Arthur Frank about a woman receiving treatment for ovarian cancer. On the night after undergoing surgery, she tries to activate her patient-controlled analgesia machine to obtain intravenous pain relief, only to find the machine is not working. A number of clinical staff arrive, but focus only on the machine, and when they cannot fix it, they exit the room leaving the patient feeling abandoned. In her words: ‘no one made eye contact with me. No one reached out to touch me’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311416834">Frank, 2004a</xref>: 211).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311416834">Charon (2006a</xref>: 134) links attentiveness with empathy by characterizing it as being essential to making a connection between the physician and patient, allowing the doctor to ‘glimpse the sufferer’s needs and desires, as it were, from the inside’.</p>
<p>A second form of attentiveness involves being more aware of one’s <italic>own</italic> cognitive and emotional responses. In contrast to the first visit described in the story, Simon entered Michael’s room the second time with an attentive mind, curious to find out from him what was the matter. This led him to frame his opening question in a way that indicated his willingness to hear Michael’s story on his own terms.</p>
<p>In addition, he found himself paying more attention to his own senses, noting the expression on Michael’s face, the odour from the wound and the coolness of his foot to the touch. He sat beside Michael, rather than standing over him, moving closer to accommodate his hearing impairment, and these acts elicited a more engaged reception from him in return. He also became more aware of his own emotional responses to the situation. Simon’s acts of attentiveness to both Michael and himself opened the possibility for the two men to enter into a respectful dialogue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1363459311416834">
<title>Practising respectful dialogue</title>
<p>In using the term <italic>dialogue</italic> I refer to the work of Mikhail Bakhtin, who is perhaps best known for his writings on literary criticism, but who has also been described as a social philosopher and cultural theorist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311416834">Gardiner and Bell, 1998</xref>). Bakhtin argued that human existence is always an <italic>event</italic> – not something given to us, but an ongoing project to be accomplished, and always an event that is shared with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459311416834">Holquist, 2002</xref>). A dialogical view proposes that as individual subjects, we are constituted and can know ourselves only in relation to others. In the context of clinical communication, this has relevance for the ways in which knowledge and understanding are produced.</p>
<p>In his meditation on generosity in health care, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311416834">Arthur Frank (2004b)</xref> explores the idea of alterity and its relation to dialogue, drawing on the work of Lévinas and Todorov. Alterity is a term which alludes to the recognition of the other as being separate from oneself; respecting this truth can be considered as a requirement for ethical interaction. It is common, argues Frank, for doctors to interpret patients’ motivations and actions solely from a biomedical perspective, so that understanding the patient’s experience is not considered relevant to the process of healing.</p>
<p>A person’s alterity may be understood as having been violated if the message is conveyed that they ‘should not be who they are, or that they fail to understand who they ought to be’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311416834">Frank, 2004b</xref>: 115), or that the history, values and culture influencing their priorities and choices are not worthy of respect.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a doctor may identify too closely with a patient, to the extent that they may take on a patient’s perspective without being able to see an alternative view; perhaps it is the fear of this outcome which drives many clinicians towards detachment. This way of relating could be understood as resulting from an inability to accomplish the ‘separating’ component of empathizing as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459311416834">Schafer (2004)</xref>. Again, in this situation there is no opportunity for genuine dialogue. Both of these ways of relating can be understood as essentially monological, since in each situation, only one ‘voice’ is able to be heard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311416834">Frank, 2004b</xref>).</p>
<p>Genuine dialogical interaction is only possible when both these pitfalls are avoided, and when the physician neither tries to assimilate the voice of the patient into the biomedical perspective, nor to lose sight of any but the patient’s view, thereby denying them the potential benefit of the doctor’s interpretation of the situation. This type of encounter is one in which each of the participants is able to give voice to their separate viewpoints; in other words their alterity is respected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311416834">Frank, 2004b</xref>).</p>
<p>Awareness of the threats to genuine dialogue, such as either disregard for, or conversely over-identification with, the patient’s subjective experience, may assist in achieving a necessary degree of distance while maintaining a connection. Further, I would contend that only by recognizing and respecting the alterity, or ‘other-ness’ of patients can a physician truly make a connection – something that can only be forged between two separate individuals. The salience of this depiction of different types of human interactions is discussed below in relation to Simon’s story.</p>
<p>It may be claimed that the language conventions of medical case histories simply produce a genre from which all but the information essential to making a diagnosis has been excluded. Although the capacity of this form to transmit certain information succinctly is valuable in a range of contexts, it also serves other ends, which may not be recognized. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311416834">Anspach (1998)</xref> has studied the rhetorical practices of the medical case presentation and argues that they contribute to depersonalization, through avoidance of patient names; abrogation of individual clinician responsibility, through the use of the passive voice; and the use of terms which devalue or discredit a patient’s account. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311416834">Donnelly (1997)</xref> concurs, and recognizes these devices in written case notes as well as oral presentations. He proposes a series of changes to the use of language in this setting, which might allow the return of the patient’s voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311416834">Donnelly, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311416834">2005</xref>). These include using patients’ names, including their own expressions to describe their experience and avoiding terms that cast doubt on their credibility.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311416834">Charon (2006a</xref>) has described the performance of a respectful dialogue as entailing reciprocal and iterative acts of attention and representation. The narrative product of this collaboration should be a story in which the voices of both patient and physician can be discerned. Therapeutic engagement is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311416834">Charon (2006a</xref>: 138) as a state of affiliation, that is, one which brings people closer together, which she argues is one of ‘the inevitable and powerful dividends of achieving attention and representation’.</p>
<p>In Simon’s story, Jenny’s labelling of Michael as ‘non-compliant’ could be seen as an instance of the assimilation of the patient’s perspective into that of medicine, which forestalled the possibility of meaningful dialogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311416834">Frank, 2004b</xref>). Simon initially assented to this characterization, but rejected it later when he explored Michael’s experience and his reasons for choosing not to follow the advice.</p>
<p>Simon’s question, ‘What is bothering you most about your leg?’ signalled that he needed Michael’s perspective to make sense of the situation. He recognized Michael as the expert on his own experience. Simon’s technical knowledge and skill could not be properly utilized until he acknowledged the domain in which Michael was expert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459311416834">Roter and Hall, 2006</xref>). The subsequent conversation allowed a narrative to be constructed, which highlighted the patient’s experience, adding this to the doctor’s interpretation of its meaning and consequent diagnostic and treatment decisions. This story with its two distinct voices was recorded in Simon’s clinical notes as well as in his letter to the hospital doctors, so that this representation formed an extension of his dialogue with Michael.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1363459311416834">
<title>Practising commitment</title>
<p>I consider that engaged clinical practice requires a commitment to action, and will explain my reasons by reference to the literature and also to the origins and shared understanding of the term engagement within the wider community.</p>
<p>Many of the contemporary uses of the word engagement are linked to its origin in the old French word <italic>engager</italic>, meaning to be under a pledge or promise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459311416834">Hoad, 1996</xref>). The term carries connotations of a commitment to future action; for example, that two people will be married.</p>
<p>The nature of compassion is such that it entails not only an emotional state of tenderness or kindness towards one who is suffering, but also a desire to act to alleviate that suffering. In this way compassion could be said to be complementary and intimately related with empathy, in that appreciating the nature and extent of a person’s experience through the practice of empathy may elicit feelings of compassion, motivating a desire to help.</p>
<p>The nature of the commitment between physician and patient will depend upon the context. It may involve a promise to seek a diagnosis and to advise on treatment, or to ease suffering, and not to abandon the person, even if a cure cannot be found. In her discussion of therapeutic engagement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311416834">Charon (2006a)</xref> makes reference to commitment, particularly to the patient’s hope that they will not be abandoned to face their suffering alone. The story about the woman whose pain machine stopped working and the clinical staff who left her alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311416834">Frank, 2004a</xref>) is a story about abandonment, as well as inattentiveness.</p>
<p>Simon gave an explicit commitment to Michael that he would do all he could to relieve his immediate suffering and to try and prevent the loss of the leg. He anticipated potential barriers to Michael having his voice heard in the hospital setting, so that he described Michael’s experience in his letter and requested a follow-up phone call, so he could advocate for him if necessary.</p>
<p>In clinical settings, health professionals are usually subject to competing demands upon their time and attention. In the interests of justice and the well-being of the physician, the time and effort which can be given to any individual at a particular time will be limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311416834">Frank, 2004b</xref>). In reflecting on this state of affairs, the physician may be in a better position to negotiate with the patient a degree of involvement that is acceptable to both parties. This source of tension will remain, however, due to the finite nature of human and other resources in health care systems.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, I have asserted that there is a problem within contemporary health care which has been a long standing area of concern to many patients, their families and social science researchers as well as many within the medical profession including those involved in medical education. I argue that there is a need to address the problem of excessive detachment, which is often perceived by patients in their interactions with some doctors and other health professionals, in order to promote the provision of care that is more consistently humane, as well as effective and appropriate.</p>
<p>Students and experienced clinicians alike may struggle to sustain appropriate measures of both distance and connectedness in their encounters with patients. In contemporary health care environments where demand seems to increase as resources become ever scarcer, this may seem an impossible task. Yet compassion and kindness are still expressed and experienced within medical practice on a daily basis.</p>
<p>There has been a welcome increase in attention within medical schools to learning about clinical communication, but there are limitations in the applicability of pre-clinical learning to clinical practice, especially in the complex environment of the teaching hospital. The importance of empathy, allowing an appreciation of the experience of the patient, has been widely accepted but there is no consensus as to its exact meaning and there has been little help to guide either clinical teachers or medical students in how to practise it. Recognition of the importance of compassion in promoting humane care is becoming evident within the academic literature. It is advocated by some as an alternative to empathy, and by others interpreted as referring to the emotional aspects of clinical interactions when related to a purely cognitive interpretation of empathy.</p>
<p>In this article I have proposed that practising engagement is a means by which clinical communication might be infused with empathy and compassion, resulting in more humane care for people suffering due to illness or injury. I have suggested that engagement entails acts of attentiveness to the patient and one’s self, respectful dialogue and commitment to action to alleviate suffering. My literature review and the reflection on a clinical story have supported this interpretation of engagement. Empirical research is required in order to investigate this idea further, and to explore its potential to develop medical students’ capacity for humane practice through their early clinical interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363459311416834">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>Simon’s story could be described as a fictionalized account of an actual experience, based on events in the life of a patient with whose care the author was involved. Names have been changed, and two visits to the patient by a single doctor have been depicted, whereas in the real life situation, a different doctor carried out each visit. This change was made so that the story emphasizes the differences in outcome which might be achieved by practising in a more engaged manner, rather than implying that one doctor was intrinsically better than the other.</p>
