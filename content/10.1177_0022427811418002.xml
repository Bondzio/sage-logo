Given the key place that legitimacy has gained in policing, the antecedents of legitimacy have also become an important focus of research. One of the main findings of such studies is that perceptions of procedural justice, which are concerned with the fairness and appropriateness of police processes, are the most important factor in predicting evaluations of police legitimacy. Assessments of police performance, while also significant as an antecedent of legitimacy, were generally found to play a less important role (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427811418002">Murphy et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427811418002">Sunshine and Tyler 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427811418002">Tyler 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427811418002">2004</xref>).</p><p>It is not clear, however, if procedural justice and performance evaluations would play similar roles as antecedents of police legitimacy under conditions of acute crisis or threat, such as terrorism threats. Since the terror attack of 9/11, homeland security has become a growing responsibility for police forces in numerous countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811418002">Bayley and Weisburd 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427811418002">International Association of Chiefs of Police [IACP] 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427811418002">Weisburd, Jonathan, and Perry 2009</xref>). At the same time, the effects of this role on police–community relationships and perceptions of police legitimacy are just beginning to be disentangled. While recent research suggests that terrorism threats may bring about a short-term rise in public evaluations of the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811418002">Jonathan 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022427811418002">Shaw and Brannan 2009</xref>), the predictors of police legitimacy and their relative importance under such conditions have not been examined.</p><p>In this study we utilize a unique situation in Israel, which allowed for a natural experiment examining antecedents of police legitimacy under conditions of severe security threats among majority communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022427811418002">1</xref></sup> We use survey data to compare the importance of police performance and procedural justice evaluations as antecedents of police legitimacy in the Israeli town “Sderot,” which has been suffering from severe security threats, to antecedents of legitimacy in other cities and towns in Israel, which were not faced with similar threats in recent years.</p><p>We begin by reviewing the concept of “police legitimacy,” focusing specifically on the interplay between procedural justice and police performance/effectiveness as its antecedents. We continue by discussing the responsibility of the police in fighting terrorism and the importance of examining predictors of police legitimacy in this context. We then review the literature on the effects of security threats, and particularly the impacts of terrorism threats on policy choices, which give rise to the hypotheses of the present study. Our focus then is on our study, the sample selected and the survey methods used to collect our data. Using a quasi-experimental design and a multivariate regression approach to control for possible lack of equivalence in sample characteristics across the sites, we compare the importance of assessments of procedural justice and police performance in Sderot with other Israeli communities, located within five police districts. Consistent with the literature on the effects of security threats, we find that the role of performance evaluations in predicting police legitimacy was significantly stronger under conditions of severe, acute security threats. At the same time, we find that procedural justice <italic>was not</italic> less important, and indeed remained the primary antecedent of legitimacy in both conditions.</p><sec id="section1-0022427811418002"><title>Procedural Justice and Performance as Antecedents of Police Legitimacy in Situations of Security Threats</title><p>Increasing public evaluations of the legitimacy of the police is considered one of the most important goals of policing in democratic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811418002">National Research Council 2004</xref>). While there are numerous discussions of “legitimacy” in the literature, here we follow Tom Tyler’s conceptualization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427811418002">Tyler 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427811418002">2009</xref>), which, following ideas set forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022427811418002">Weber (1968)</xref> and others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811418002">Kelman and Hamilton 1989</xref>), suggests that police legitimacy is “the belief that the police are entitled to call upon the public to follow the law and help combat crime, and that members of the public have an obligation to engage in cooperative behaviors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427811418002">Tyler 2004</xref>:86-7).</p><p>When people perceive the police to be legitimate, cooperation with the police and with the law more generally stems from internal feelings of responsibility and obligation, which are self-regulated, and are thus less dependent on sanctions or incentives provided by the authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427811418002">Tyler 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427811418002">2009</xref>). Indeed, public evaluations of the police as legitimate have been found to be associated with numerous positive outcomes, such as compliance with the law and general cooperation with and acceptance of police authority (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427811418002">LaFree 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811418002">Mastrofski, Snipes, and Supina 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427811418002">Murphy et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427811418002">Paternoster et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427811418002">Reisig et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022427811418002">Sampson and Bartusch 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427811418002">Sunshine and Tyler 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022427811418002">Tyler 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022427811418002">Tyler and Fagan 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022427811418002">Tyler and Huo 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022427811418002">Tyler and Wakslak 2004</xref>).</p><p>Considering the importance of police legitimacy, it is not surprising that much attention has been given to its antecedents. Previous studies examining general evaluations of the police have frequently demonstrated that the primary determinant of police legitimacy is perceptions of <italic>procedural justice</italic>, which refer to the appropriateness and fairness of the <italic>processes</italic> by which the police exercise their authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811418002">Hinds and Murphy 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811418002">National Research Council 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427811418002">Reisig et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427811418002">Tyler 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427811418002">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427811418002">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022427811418002">Tyler, Schulhofer, and Huq 2010</xref>). Evaluations of police <italic>performance/effectiveness</italic>, including, for example, the ability of the police to catch rule breakers and accomplishments in fighting crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427811418002">Sunshine and Tyler 2003</xref>) were also found to play a significant, though weaker, role than that of procedural justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427811418002">Murphy et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427811418002">Sunshine and Tyler 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427811418002">Tyler 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427811418002">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427811418002">2009</xref>). While some cross-cultural variations were found in the importance of police effectiveness and fair processes for the public (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811418002">Brockner et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811418002">Hinds and Murphy 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022427811418002">Tankebe 2009</xref>), there is strong support for the proposition that procedural justice is generally the main predictor of police legitimacy, while perceptions of police performance are also important in this context, albeit to a lesser extent.</p><p>However, to date studies examining antecedents of police legitimacy have not been carried out under extreme conditions of crisis or threat, such as intense terrorism threats or attacks. As detailed in subsequent sections, we might expect that under such circumstances the relative importance of the factors predicting police legitimacy may change, since in the face of threat, when the public is affected by uncertainty and insecurity, citizens may be more concerned with outcomes than with fair processes. However, before turning to this discussion, we think it is important to review the relationship between policing terrorism and public attitudes toward the police more generally, and the importance of examining antecedents of police legitimacy in this context.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0022427811418002"><title>Policing Terrorism and Public Attitudes toward the Police</title><p>Since the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, police forces in the United States, as well as in other democratic countries, have increased their involvement in counterterrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811418002">Bayley and Weisburd 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427811418002">IACP 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427811418002">Weisburd et al. 2009</xref>). At the same time, policing scholars have begun to raise questions about the implications of this role for the police, particularly with regard to the character of policing and police–community relationships. While concerns were often raised in the context of minority Muslim or Arab communities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811418002">Hasisi, Alpert, and Flynn 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811418002">Henderson et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427811418002">Thacher 2005</xref>), some police scholars and practitioners have discussed more general implications of policing terrorism, which may impact the relationship between the police and both majority and minority communities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811418002">Bayley and Weisburd 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811418002">Fishman 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427811418002">Mastrofski 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427811418002">Murray 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427811418002">Weisburd et al. 2009</xref>).</p><p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811418002">Bayley and Weisburd (2009)</xref> argue that a focus on counterterrorism may result in the police emphasizing “high policing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427811418002">Brodeur 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427811418002">Brodeur and Dupeyron 2003</xref>) strategies and tactics, which focus on macro-level problems, utilize covert methods, and are generally considered less transparent and accountable. Such approaches may also result in the police becoming more control- rather than service-oriented, all of which may, in turn, hamper public evaluations of the police and its legitimacy. Public perceptions of the police may also decline as a result of a zero-sum game of resources, whereby policing terrorism may come at the expense of fighting crime and addressing other issues that are troubling communities at the local level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811418002">Bayley and Weisburd 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811418002">Fishman 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811418002">Hasisi et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427811418002">Weisburd et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022427811418002">Weisburd et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p>At the same time, it has also been suggested that police involvement in counterterrorism may actually <italic>improve</italic> public evaluations of the police, since they may be perceived as addressing the issue that is most troubling to the public at the time. Moreover, quick and efficient responses to terrorism may contribute to the image of the police as professional and successful, and counterterrorism activities may directly encourage collaboration between the police and the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427811418002">Weisburd et al. 2009</xref>; see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811418002">Jonathan 2010</xref>). It appears, therefore, that police involvement in counterterrorism may impact public perceptions of the police and police–community relationships in multifaceted ways. However, beyond the absolute levels of trust, procedural justice, or performance as measured in surveys, it is not clear how threat influences the <italic>processes</italic> by which evaluations of legitimacy are formed. Do the same factors play a role? Does their relative importance remain consistent, or does the public value determinants of legitimacy differently under threat conditions?</p></sec><sec id="section4-0022427811418002"><title>Security Threats and Public Attitudes</title><p>Findings from the threat literature provide important insight in this context. Threat, conflict, or acute national crises are known to have numerous and diverse effects on cognitions, emotions, attitudes and behavior (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811418002">Bettencourt et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811418002">Gordon and Arian 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811418002">Gross and Ní Aoláin 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022427811418002">Shamir and Sagiv-Schifter 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022427811418002">Struch and Schwartz 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427811418002">Sullivan et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427811418002">Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus 1982</xref>).

Their conclusions are in line with other studies carried out in the United States and Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427811418002">Bar-Tal and Labin 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427811418002">Davis and Silver 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811418002">Friedland and Merari 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811418002">Gordon and Arian 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427811418002">Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427811418002">Huddy et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811418002">Jentleson 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427811418002">Jentleson and Britton 1998</xref>).</p><p>In sum, the literature suggests that there may be a zero-sum game between security and fair processes in public priorities. When terrorism threats become a priority, vulnerability, uncertainty and fear appear to bring about a desire to “terminate the threat at all costs,” which may take the form of processes that are highly outcome-oriented, but at the same time less careful with respect to procedural fairness. In this context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427811418002">Maslow (1943)</xref> provides additional clarification. In his hierarchy of human needs, the need for safety and security are placed just above basic physiological needs, and below needs such as respect of and by others and morality (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811418002">Inglehart 1997</xref>).</p><p>Returning to policing and procedural justice versus performance evaluations as antecedents of police legitimacy, as reviewed earlier, studies have generally found procedural justice to be the primary predictor of legitimacy, while performance assessments were found to be secondary in their importance. However, as a result of the effects of security threats reviewed above, we might expect that in situations of acute terrorism threats the role of police performance/effectiveness in shaping legitimacy would be enhanced, while the importance of procedural justice would weaken. Further, this trend may result in performance overtaking procedural justice and becoming the main antecedent of police legitimacy. It is important to clarify in this context that police agencies have come to play a major role in handling terrorist threats in many democratic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811418002">Bayley and Weisburd 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427811418002">IACP 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811418002">National Research Council 2004</xref>) and particularly in Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427811418002">Weisburd et al. 2009</xref>), and thus we expect that these processes would apply to evaluations of the legitimacy of the <italic>police</italic> (in addition, perhaps, to evaluations of other government agencies that take part in the struggle against terrorism).</p><p>Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427811418002">Sunshine and Tyler (2003)</xref> found that while legitimacy influenced willingness to empower the police both before and after the terror attack of 9/11, after the attack empowerment was also directly influenced by performance evaluations.

In accordance with the literature on the effects of security threats, we hypothesize that (1) when faced with severe and immediate security threats, the role of performance in shaping police legitimacy will be stronger than when there is no specific threat in the background. (2) Under the same conditions, we expect the role of procedural justice to weaken. Finally, (3) we raise the question of whether the rise in the importance of performance, along with the hypothesized drop in the significance of procedural justice, will result in performance overtaking procedural justice and becoming the primary antecedent of police legitimacy.</p><p>Survey data collected as part of a larger study examining public attitudes toward the police in Israel<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022427811418002">2</xref></sup> enabled us to compare the two threat situations.

Five other stations in the study, where residents did not experience security threats during a similar period, provided an opportunity to compare the influence of perceptions of procedural justice and performance on legitimacy. Both samples, as well as their comparison and the expression of our general hypotheses within this specific context, are described below.</p><sec id="section6-0022427811418002"><title>Sderot: A City under Severe Security Threats</title><p>Sderot is a small city of about 19,800 residents, located in the southwest of Israel, approximately one kilometer from the Gaza Strip. It was established in 1951 as a transit camp for new Jewish immigrants, and over the years continued to absorb new immigrants from North Africa, Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia. The town grew rapidly and was declared a city in 1996. Overall, Sderot is a relatively disadvantaged community (ranked 4 out of 10 on the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics' socioeconomic scale),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022427811418002">4</xref></sup> with many of its residents employed as production workers in the numerous factories in the area, retailers and other service providers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022427811418002">5</xref></sup></p><p>As a result of its proximity to the Gaza Strip, and the fact that it is the most densely populated community in that area, Sderot has been the primary target for missile threats and attacks originating from the Gaza Strip, and since the outbreak of the Second Intifada had suffered more rocket threats and attacks than any other Israeli community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022427811418002">6</xref></sup> Not surprisingly, studies have revealed high levels of PTSD and other stress-related symptoms among Sderot residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427811418002">Dekel and Nuttman-Shwartz 2009</xref>). The threat of rocket fire from the Gaza Strip increased considerably between 2006 and 2008,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022427811418002">7</xref></sup> and during the survey period (October 27 to December 3, 2008) there was a major peak in rocket threats and attacks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022427811418002">8</xref></sup></p><p>As noted earlier, the Israel National Police (INP) plays the lead role in handling terrorist threats and attacks within the pre-1967 border (for a detailed description of the Israeli model for policing terrorism, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427811418002">Weisburd et al. 2009</xref>). As part of this responsibility, the INP responds to scenes of missile landings, both in Sderot and in other communities in Israel that have faced similar threats in the past (such as Tel Aviv and Haifa during the Gulf War and communities in the North of Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War). The police do not take part in interdicting the launch of missiles or posing obstacles in their way (as is the case with “classic” terrorism threats; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427811418002">Weisburd et al. 2009</xref>); however, they are the first responders and hold overall responsibility for handling the scenes of missile landings; their bomb squads treat the remains of the missiles; and police officers are responsible for directing traffic and crowds around the scene and assisting local residents. All responsibilities and activities that apply to what has been termed “the third circle of intervention” in policing terrorism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427811418002">Weisburd et al. 2009</xref>) apply when handling this type of scene as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022427811418002">9</xref></sup> Thus, situations of missile threats and attacks allow us to examine public priorities and expectations from the police under conditions of security threats.</p><p>Nevertheless, we recognize that the Sderot context differs from policing other, more common terrorism threats (such as bombings, shootings, or stabbings), where the police presumably have some control over the source of the threat, and thus in trying to prevent attacks may carry out aggressive stopping, searching, and questioning with less concern for fair processes. Nonetheless, given the prior literature in this area, in situations of high threat and insecurity we expect concerns for safety to take priority over issues of fair processes, such as respect, dignity, and participation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427811418002">Maslow 1943</xref>).</p><p>More specifically, due to the critical role of the INP in handling the aftermath of missile landings, we expect Sderot residents to be highly concerned with adequate police performance, including, for example, rapid responses and sufficient presence at missile landing sites, which would enable efficient handling of the scenes and quick return to routine. At the same time, we expect these citizens to be less worried that such focus may come with the price of impatient treatment of “ordinary” calls for service; officer fatigue, which may hamper overall quality of service; or that in efforts to return life to normal quickly, officers handling the scene may treat bystanders impolitely, with little patience to explain the situation and answer questions, all of which are important elements of the procedural justice model (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427811418002">Tyler 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427811418002">2009</xref>). In this context, it is important to stress that concerns about “high policing” are not limited to the source of the terrorism threats (e.g., Muslim/Arab communities or terrorist suspects), as this policing style may impact the character of the police, their priorities and nature of interaction with the public more generally (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811418002">Bayley and Weisburd 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427811418002">Mastrofski 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section7-0022427811418002"><title>Comparison Districts</title><p>We chose to compare Sderot to five of the eight police districts that were included in the larger study from which our work was drawn.

This finding is in line with our first hypothesis, as well as with the literature on behavior and policy preferences under threat. However, contrary to our second hypothesis, we find that the role of evaluations of procedural justice in predicting police legitimacy <italic>was not</italic> significantly weaker under threat. Moreover, similar to previous studies on antecedents of legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811418002">National Research Council 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427811418002">Reisig et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427811418002">Tyler 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427811418002">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427811418002">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022427811418002">Tyler et al. 2010</xref>), we found that procedural justice remained the <italic>primary</italic> antecedent of legitimacy in <italic>both</italic> conditions. That is, although performance evaluations did increase in importance under threat, they still remained secondary to procedural justice in determining legitimacy in our samples.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022427811418002">19</xref></sup></p><p>Why, contrary to our expectations, did procedural justice <italic>not</italic> decline in importance? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427811418002">Tyler’s (2004)</xref> discussions about the significance of procedural justice may provide some clarification. Tyler argues that when interacting with the police or with government agencies more generally, people often lack the proficiency to judge whether actions or decisions made by authorities are reasonable and appropriate. Similarly, they seldom know what the “correct” outcome should be. Consequentially, citizens need to feel that the decision makers acted out of true concern for their well-being, and look for evidence that the <italic>process</italic> <italic>itself</italic> was neutral and fair. Tyler further explains that contact with government agencies carries for the people involved “important messages concerning their social status, their self worth and their self-respect,” and thus becomes a key issue, particularly under situations that challenge one’s status and position in the community, such as falling victim to a crime or being suspected of committing one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427811418002">Tyler 2004</xref>:95).</p><p>Accordingly, the results of the present study suggest that the desire for procedural justice is an enduring, stable, trait, regardless of the security situation. Under conditions of security threats, individuals do value police performance to a greater extent when forming evaluations of police legitimacy. However, there does not seem to be a zero-sum game between performance and procedural justice: under threat, while performance increases in importance, procedural justice does not decline in importance and indeed remains the primary antecedent of legitimacy, as is the case when there is no security threat in the background. Albeit in a different context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022427811418002">Tyler et al. (2010)</xref> recently reached similar results in an analysis of attitudes of Muslim Americans. These authors conclude that “…procedural justice is always important, regardless of views about the magnitude of the terrorist threat or the efficacy of the police. So whatever people feel about the threat of terror or police effectiveness against it, unfair police action consistently leads to less legitimacy and lower levels of cooperation” (p. 385). It is important to acknowledge, however, that at a certain level of threat, perhaps under extreme existential threat, procedural justice may become less important in shaping perceptions of police legitimacy.</p><p>In this context, broader consideration of the generalizability of our results is in order. We believe that our research setting enabled an adequate examination of public priorities and expectations from the police in periods of severe security threats, in a democratic society where local police play a major role in responding to such threats. Caution should be taken, however, when generalizing our results to periods where levels of threat are lower (or higher), or to situations where the police are less involved in handling the threat. Thus, we encourage future research to replicate our analysis in different settings, and particularly under different conditions of security threats.</p><p>Before concluding, other limitations of our research should also be discussed. In our analysis we utilized a severe security situation in the “real world,” which enabled a natural experiment. While the multivariate regression framework allowed us to control for numerous factors at the individual level, it is not a randomized trial in which similar individuals are randomly assigned to test and control groups. Additionally, there is the risk that a factor other than the security threats contributed to the differences between public priorities in Sderot and our comparison communities. However, as mentioned earlier, district level variability in the comparison group was controlled for in the analysis, and, in addition to comparing Sderot to our comparison group as a whole, we carried out the same analysis with each of the districts separately and reached similar results.</p></sec><sec id="section12-0022427811418002"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study raises some important considerations, both theoretical and practical. First, our findings draw attention to the growing significance of police performance under threat. While past research has pointed to performance/efficiency evaluations as the second most important antecedent of police legitimacy, we show that under security threats their impact significantly rises. This finding highlights the importance of considering the <italic>context</italic> when examining public opinions and predictors of attitudes toward the police. Our findings also show, however, that the rise in the importance of police performance in situations of acute security threats does not take away from the central role of procedural justice, which <italic>did not</italic> decline in importance, and, what is more, remained the primary antecedent of legitimacy.</p><p>With regard to police practice, the police may be aware of the growing importance of performance under threat and may alter their priorities and strategies accordingly. Emphasizing end results in the face of high security threats may not only seem intuitive, but also appears to be supported by the public. At the same time, it is imperative for decision makers to consider that even under conditions of high security threats, the public still appears to value fair, transparent, respectful processes <italic>more</italic> than they value high performance and end results when forming evaluations of police legitimacy. Indeed, in the face of security threats there seems to be a growing desire for forceful action and end results, but not at the expense of an expectation of high standards of procedural fairness.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn20-0022427811418002"><label>Authors’ Note</label><p>The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), or the National Institute of Justice.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn21-0022427811418002"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn22-0022427811418002"><label>Funding</label><p>The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Science and Technology directorate of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under Grant Award Numbers N00140510629 and 2008-ST-061-ST0004, made to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.start.umd.edu">www.start.umd.edu</ext-link>), and by the U.S. National Institute of Justice under Grant Number Z909601.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><fn-group><title>Notes</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0022427811418002"><label>1.</label><p>By “majority communities” we are referring to Jewish adults, not including “Haredim” (Ultra-Orthodox Jews).

This concept has often been operationalized in previous studies as a combination of trust in the police, obligation to obey the police and the law, and sometimes affective feelings toward the police (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811418002">Hinds and Murphy 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427811418002">Sunshine and Tyler 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427811418002">Tyler 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427811418002">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022427811418002">Tyler and Fagan 2008</xref>).
