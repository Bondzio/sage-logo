<abstract>
<p>This study focused on literacy-related barriers to understanding the rights of students with disabilities and their parents within the special education system. SMOG readability scores were determined for procedural safeguards documents issued by all state departments of education. The average reading grade level was 16; 6% scored in the high school range, 55% scored in the college range, and 39% scored in the graduate or professional range. Comparisons of national literacy data and national data on the educational attainment of parents of students with disabilities suggest that there is a disproportionate burden of limited literacy among these parents compared to the general population. The significance of results is discussed with respect to relevant regulatory requirements, case law, and evidence from the legal and health literacy fields.</p>

<title>Parental Involvement and the Procedural Safeguards</title>
<p>Research in the fields of early intervention and primary and secondary education has consistently demonstrated that parental involvement in education and child development is an important predictor of cognitive and social-emotional development and academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022466910362774">Duncan &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022466910362774">Henderson &amp; Mapp, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022466910362774">Reynolds, 1991</xref>). For children and youth with disabilities, parental involvement has been shown to be an important protective factor against adverse educational, social, and employment outcomes in young adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022466910362774">Wagner, Blackorby, Cameto, &amp; Newman, 1993</xref>). However, evidence from national longitudinal studies of students with disabilities suggests that parents of children with disabilities who are most vulnerable to poor educational, social, and employment outcomes—those from disadvantaged backgrounds—may also be those most likely to experience difficulty being involved in their children’s education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022466910362774">National Longitudinal Transition Study–2 [NLTS-2], 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022466910362774">Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study [SEELS], 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, SEELS and NLTS-2 show that substantially larger proportions of low-income parents and non-White parents of students with disabilities reported a discrepancy between their desired and actual levels of involvement in decisions regarding the individualized education program (IEP). The literature on parental involvement suggests that these disparities may be because of multiple factors, including structural barriers such as lack of paid leave and flexible work schedules, family–school relationship dynamics including discrimination and cultural divides, and parental literacy- and language-related barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022466910362774">Harry, Allen, &amp; McLaughlin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022466910362774">Heymann, 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022466910362774">2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022466910362774">Heymann &amp; Earle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022466910362774">Robinson-Zanartu &amp; Majel-Dixon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022466910362774">Tellier-Robinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022466910362774">Torres-Burgo, Reyes-Wasson, &amp; Brusca-Vega, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022466910362774">Weiss et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0022466910362774">
<title>Policy Context</title>
<p>Education law in the United States clearly recognizes the importance of parental involvement. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022466910362774">Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 2004</xref> legally mandates opportunities for involvement in the “procedural safeguards.” These procedural safeguards guarantee parents’ rights to share in decision making with the school regarding identification and diagnosis, evaluation, placement, services, individualized educational planning, and transition to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022466910362774">IDEA, 2004</xref>). Schools are legally required to give parents written notification of their procedural safeguards at specified times. These documents represent the primary way in which schools provide written notice to parents of their rights and their children’s rights in the special education system. The Arc, one of the oldest national organizations on intellectual disability, states that the procedural safeguards “provide standards for accountability, consistency across classrooms, districts, and states, and detail a process for settling disputes in a fair and equitable manner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022466910362774">Arc, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Education law also clearly recognizes the potential for literacy and language barriers to get in the way of parental involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022466910362774">IDEA, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022466910362774">National Education Goals Panel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022466910362774">U.S. Department of Education, 1996</xref>). Specifically, IDEA contains explicit language that pertains to the readability of procedural safeguard documents issued by the school or public agency. The law demands that the notice must be written in language understandable to the general public and must be provided in the native language of the parent or other mode of communication used by the parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so. The law also indicates that the public agency must take steps to ensure that the notice is translated orally or by other means to the parent in his or her native language or other mode of communication, that the parent understands the content of the notice, and that there is written evidence that the requirements of this section have been met (§§ 300.503–504). The clear intent of this section of legislation is that the parent understands the content of the procedural safeguards notice.</p>
<p>In addition to legislation, two particular court cases have addressed individuals’ rights to receive written notice of their rights in understandable language. In the first case, involving noncitizens versus the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022466910362774"><italic>Walters v. Reno</italic>, 1998</xref>), the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the complex, legal language of certain INS forms violated noncitizens’ procedural rights to receive critical information and instruction regarding their legal status. In its written opinion, the court cited the “complexity and ineptness of the forms and the fact that they [were] designed to provide essential information of constitutional significance” in its ruling for the noncitizen plaintiffs. In the second case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022466910362774"><italic>Max M. v. Thompson</italic>, 1984</xref>), decided by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the school failed to provide psychiatric services to the plaintiff, a young man with a psychiatric disability. Through the course of his high school experience, his parents were unaware of the procedures for disputing the school’s decisions regarding services and placement. In its decision, the court noted that the explanation of procedural safeguards was written in “unembellished technical language” and so did not meet the standard for providing written notice.</p>
<p>In sum, the policy context for readability of procedural safeguards establishes standards for readability through IDEA and suggests the potential for public agencies to be held accountable for ensuring effective communication with their target audiences. Given the importance of the procedural safeguards to the realization of parental involvement in special education, several studies including the present one have specifically examined the readability of these and related documents using readability formulas that are applied to samples of text.</p>

<title>Overview of Readability Analysis</title>
<p>Excellent histories and overviews of readability analysis are provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022466910362774">Dale and Chall (1948)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022466910362774">Klare (1974–1975)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022466910362774">Contreras, Garcia-Alonso, Echenique, and Daye-Contreras (1999)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022466910362774">DuBay (2004)</xref>. Readability formulas are mathematical equations derived by regression analysis, in which the best fitting model or equation is that which best predicts the reading grade level of readers who comprehend a set percentage of questions (i.e., 50%, 75%, 100%) pertaining to a given text. Most formulas predict 50% to 75% comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022466910362774">Klare, 1974–1975</xref>); for example, predicted values using the Dale–Chall formula correspond to reading grade levels of readers who are able to answer at least half of the test questions on a piece of text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022466910362774">Dale &amp; Chall, 1948</xref>). Most readability formulas use two linguistic aspects of text to predict difficulty level: (a) average sentence length, which reflects the complexity of grammatical structure, and (b) word difficulty. Word difficulty is measured either by the number of polysyllabic (three or more syllables) words, which is presumed to reflect the level of precision of the vocabulary used, or by the number of “hard” words (i.e., words that do not appear on a list of common words familiar to most fourth grade students; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022466910362774">Dale &amp; Chall, 1948</xref>).</p>
<p>Readability formulas cannot provide a full picture of readability, as they do not take into account other features of text that contribute to difficulty, such as the use of specialized professional jargon, ordering of ideas, sentence structure, style, content, physical presentation, spacing, and use of illustrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022466910362774">Davison &amp; Kantor, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022466910362774">Doak, Doak, &amp; Root, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022466910362774">Sydes &amp; Hartley, 1997</xref>). Nor do they consider characteristics of the reader that affect comprehension, including motivation, interest, and prior knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022466910362774">Sydes &amp; Hartley, 1997</xref>). However, they provide a tool for an initial assessment of the difficulty materials may present to a reader.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022466910362774">
<title>Previous Studies</title>
<p>Most recently, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022466910362774">Fitzgerald and Watkins (2006)</xref> examined the readability of procedural safeguard documents from all state departments of education (with the exception of Ohio). They report a modal reading grade level of 11–12, using the new Dale–Chall formula, and a median reading grade level of 13, using the Flesch grade level formula. This study also assessed qualitative aspects of the documents (e.g., print size, length, number of unique acronyms, presence of glossary) that contribute to readability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022466910362774">Imber and Radcliffe (2003)</xref>, as part of a historical review of policy regarding independent educational evaluations (IEEs), assessed the readability of federal and state regulations for seven states as well as state educational agency manuals from two states regarding IEEs. Using the Flesch grade level formula, they concluded that the majority of documents assessed required a 12th grade education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022466910362774">Pruitt (2003)</xref> examined the readability of special education documents and forms used by one elementary school in Tennessee, including a procedural safeguards document. Pruitt also assessed how the readability levels of these documents (using the Flesch grade level formula) compared to the reading levels of 30 parents to measure discrepancy and then examined the relationship of this discrepancy to parental attendance at IEP meetings and knowledge about the IEP. Pruitt’s analysis determined that the reading difficulty of the documents and forms averaged Grade 12, exceeding the reading grade level of the average parent in her sample (Grade 9) by three grade levels. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022466910362774">Roit and Pfohl (1984)</xref> conducted a readability assessment of parental rights manuals used by 25 state educational agencies, using four different readability formulas: Flesch, Fog, Dale–Chall, and New Reading Ease. They concluded that parents needed at least a sixth grade education to be able to understand the manuals. This study was published more than two decades ago, and the results must be interpreted in light of the evolution and strengthening of the role of parents in special education decision-making processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022466910362774">Turnbull, Wilcox, &amp; Stowe, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>These studies of procedural safeguards and related documents have used readability formulas that predict 50% to 75% comprehension, and none have used the SMOG. Therefore, the estimates of reading difficulty documented by these studies are likely to be underestimates. The present study thus aims to provide a complementary analysis using a different readability formula, the SMOG, which predicts full comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022466910362774">McLaughlin, 1969</xref>). Furthermore, prior studies have not examined available evidence of limited literacy in the intended readership of procedural safeguard documents, namely, parents of students with disabilities. This study presents readability results in the context of national data on adult literacy as well as national data on the educational attainment of parents of students with disabilities.</p>

<title>Sample and data collection</title>
<p>The first author collected procedural safeguard documents from state department of education Web sites for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia during the spring of 2006. Some documents were issued in draft form because, although the 1997 regulations were still in effect, the 2004 draft regulations had been made public in June 2005.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022466910362774">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>The readability of procedural safeguards documents was manually assessed with the SMOG readability formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022466910362774">McLaughlin, 1969</xref>). The SMOG formula was selected for its higher predictive validity (i.e., 100% vs. 50%–75% comprehension) compared to other readability formulas commonly used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022466910362774">Contreras, et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022466910362774">DuBay, 2004</xref>). Readability assessment using the SMOG formula involves taking three samples of 10 sentences each from different parts of the text, counting the number of polysyllabic words contained within each sample of 10 sentences, and adding the total number of polysyllabic words across the three sections. The formula requires taking the nearest square root and adding a constant of 3, yielding a score that estimates the reading grade level required for 100% comprehension of the text, with an error margin of 1.5 grades. Three sections across the 51 procedural safeguard documents were systematically assessed: parental consent, due process impartial hearings, and discipline. In general, these three sections were located at the beginning, middle, and end of the documents, respectively. In addition, it can be argued that these sections represent the range of procedural complexity that parents are expected to understand.</p>
<p>The SMOG requires strict attention to periods (or question marks, exclamation points) at the end of sentences. There are many instances in which text is presented in bullet format. In many of these cases, each bullet reads as a complete thought alone or combined with the introductory text, often ending in a semicolon, and may be more sensibly counted as a complete sentence. Therefore, all documents were also manually assessed using this more liberal application of the SMOG; this latter score is referred to as the revised SMOG score. The revised SMOG score is more consistent with principles of clear legal writing regarding the use of bulleted lists (i.e., that it is acceptable to present information in bulleted lists as long as certain conditions are followed, such as each bullet makes a complete thought when combined with the stem; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910362774">Office of the Federal Register, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022466910362774">2006</xref>). A trained research assistant independently assessed a random subsample (20%) of documents using this revised SMOG scoring method.</p>

<sec id="section9-0022466910362774">
<title>Estimate of Literacy of Intended Audience</title>
<p>To estimate the magnitude of limited literacy among parents of students with disabilities, we used publicly available data from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) to generate frequencies for educational attainment levels for U.S. adults between the ages of 25 and 49, the age range representing the majority of the special education parent population, and percentages of adults in the “below basic” or “basic” prose literacy levels within each age–education category. Those who scored “below basic” and “basic” are likely to experience “considerable difficulty in performing tasks that required them to integrate or synthesize information from complex or lengthy texts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022466910362774">Kirsch, Jungeblut, Jenkins, &amp; Kolstad, 1993</xref>). In other words, these groups can be described as having “limited literacy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022466910362774">Neilsen-Bohlman, Panzer, &amp; Kindig, 2004</xref>). We then generated frequencies for educational attainment levels for parents of students with disabilities, using publicly available data from SEELS and NLTS-2.</p>

<title>Readability Assessments</title>
<p>Few states provide documents scoring in the lowest reading levels. The mean and median grade level was 16 for the 51 documents assessed using the revised SMOG. The reading level scores range from a low of 10 to a high of 19. Results of the readability assessment for the 50 states and D.C. using the exact SMOG score and the revised SMOG score are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022466910362774">Table 1</xref>. The principal difference between the two sets of scores is in their distribution: Using the revised scoring method resulted in a downward shift of the upper scores. In terms of the revised scores, very few (6%) scored in the high school reading level range (10–12), whereas more than half (55%) scored in the college reading level range (13–16). The remaining 39% scored in the range considered graduate or professional (17 or more). Interrater agreement based on a random 20% subsample of documents was calculated at 90% (κ = .87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). Four samples of text with different revised SMOG scores, ranging from 10 to 19, are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022466910362774">Table 2</xref> to give the reader a sense of the meaning of these differences.</p>

<title>Literacy Estimates</title>
<p>The 2003 NAAL indicates that an average of 11.5% of U.S. adults aged 25 to 49 scored “below basic,” 26.0% scored “basic,” 46.0% scored “intermediate,” and 16.5% scored “proficient” in prose literacy. Among those aged 25 to 49 with less than a high school education, 54% scored in the “below basic” range and 32% scored in the “basic” range, corresponding to the need for basic adult literacy instruction and GED preparation services, respectively. Among high school graduates and those with GED or high school equivalency aged 25 to 49, 11% scored in the “below basic” range and 40% scored in the “basic” range for prose literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022466910362774">U.S. Department of Education, 2003</xref>). Fully 86% of those aged 25 to 49 with less than a high school education and half of those with a high school education or equivalent may be considered to have limited literacy. Thus, a majority of U.S. adults have difficulty using print to accomplish everyday tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022466910362774">National Research Council, 2005</xref>). These findings parallel those reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022466910362774">Rudd (2007)</xref>, which indicated that almost half of the U.S. population lacks the skills necessary to function effectively in complex health-related contexts.</p>
<p>The SEELS and NLTS-2 data on the educational attainment of parents of students with disabilities suggest that parents of students with disabilities are more likely to have limited literacy than the general population. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022466910362774">Table 3</xref>, this pattern holds true for parents of students with mental retardation, parents of students with emotional disturbance, and parents of students with learning disability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study are consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022466910362774">Fitzgerald and Watkins (2006)</xref> and others, which indicate that procedural safeguards documents provided by state departments of education are written at excessively high levels. Using a more conservative readability formula that has not been previously used with these documents, we found that more than half of state procedural safeguard documents scored in the college reading level range for readability, and almost 40% scored in the range considered graduate or professional. The levels of reading difficulty found in this study are substantially higher than those found in previous recent studies mentioned, as expected, because of the differences in predictive validity of the various readability formulas used. Furthermore, comparisons of national literacy data and national data on the educational attainment of parents of students with disabilities suggest that there is a disproportionate burden of limited literacy among these parents compared to the general population.</p>
<sec id="section15-0022466910362774">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has several limitations that should be noted. This study did not consider whether parents in each state received the procedural safeguards documents issued by their state department of education. This assumption may hold true for some states that require local districts to use state forms. However, other states may simply provide state forms as samples. In addition, this study did not directly measure parental involvement or parental literacy. It is also important to note that this study did not consider any supplemental or alternative modes of communication. Although the focus of this analysis was on the <italic>written</italic> notice of procedural safeguards, the law states that the content of the notice ought to be “translated orally or by other means to the parent in his or her native language or other mode of communication,” which may include other spoken or written languages, braille, and sign language.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the SMOG tool, as with other readability assessment tools, relies on a sample of text rather than the entire text. Therefore, the readability scores for each document assume that the difficulty of the sample of text assessed is representative of the entire document. As previously mentioned, the SMOG takes a larger sample of text (30 sentences) compared to other readability tools, potentially increasing its reliability. For this reason, the SMOG may be especially suitable for long pieces of text. We also tried to address this issue of variability within the text by purposefully selecting samples of text from the same sections across all documents assessed, with the intention of making the documents comparable in terms of content.</p>
<p>Finally, this study did not take into account factors that <italic>promote</italic> comprehension, such as the support and help provided by parent advocacy organizations (e.g., presentations, workshops, plain language parents’ rights booklets), teachers (e.g., informal conversations, conferences, etc.), other parents, and family and friends. In fact, as pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022466910362774">Lee, Arozullah, and Cho (2004)</xref>, national literacy data show that individuals with low literacy are far more likely than the average population to report getting help with literacy-related tasks (reading print material, filling out forms) from family and friends.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0022466910362774">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The literature in health literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022466910362774">Rudd, Anderson, Oppenheimer, &amp; Nath, 2007</xref>) and the stories reflected in the court cases described earlier suggest that when literacy and language demands exceed people’s skills, access to information, services, and rights is compromised. People may not understand important processes and may feel ashamed, intimidated, or excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022466910362774">Baker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022466910362774">Hironaka &amp; Paasche-Orlow, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022466910362774">Neilsen-Bohlman, et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022466910362774">Rudd, 2007</xref>). Some evidence from special education research implicates literacy-related features of special education systems that may impede parental involvement. For example, the ethnographic work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022466910362774">Harry and colleagues (1995)</xref> suggests that parents’ advocacy efforts are frustrated by an emphasis on documents rather than participation, the use of jargon, a confusing classification system, and power dynamics that tend to silence and limit parental participation. In a national survey of Native American parents of children referred to special education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022466910362774">Robinson-Zanartu and Majel-Dixon (1996)</xref> found that parents experienced difficulty understanding evaluation, intervention, and placement processes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022466910362774">Brantlinger (1987)</xref>, in her study of low-income parents of children receiving special education services, found that many parents were confused about the classification system, placement and service options, and concepts such as due process, least restrictive environment, and mainstreaming. Thus, evidence from special education and public health studies suggests that literacy-related skills and demands may influence the ability of the parent or caregiver to advocate on behalf of his or her child with a disability within multiple service settings.</p>
<p>Finally, although we have focused on parents as the target audience for procedural safeguards documents, student self-advocates must also be considered a target audience. In fact, IDEA requires that students aged 16 and older be invited to participate in IEP meetings. Given the results of this study, the implications for self-advocacy may well be compromised and ought to be directly measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0022466910362774">
<title>Recommendations for Research, Policy, and Practice</title>
<p>Procedural safeguards documents need to be written in plain language. Plain language is defined as “language that is easy to read, understand, and use. It is characterized by logical organization, direct communication with the reader, use of the active voice, short sentences, use of common, everyday words, and easy-to-read design features” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022466910362774">Plain Language Action and Information Network, n.d.</xref>). In the literature on legal writing, critics of plain language argue that it is impossible to express complex ideas in plain language and that clarity and precision are incompatible goals. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022466910362774">Kimble (1994–1995)</xref> asks, “What is the point, after all, of being precise but unclear? The result is what Robert Benson calls ‘unintelligible precision’” (p. 55). In fact, plain language improves comprehension compared to traditional legal writing, as demonstrated in studies of comprehension of written legislation, jury instructions, medical consent forms, insurance policies, tax forms, benefits information for veterans, and various legal documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022466910362774">Charrow &amp; Charrow, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022466910362774">Kaufer, Steinberg, &amp; Toney, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022466910362774">Kimble, 1994–1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022466910362774">Masson &amp; Waldron, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Further research with a focus on the consequences of excessive literacy demands of procedural safeguard documents is needed. Research questions may include the following: Does increased understanding of procedural safeguards translate into increased parental self-efficacy and participation in decision making? Does this increased involvement, in turn, translate into better outcomes for students? Do the high readability levels of procedural safeguard documents prevent some students with disabilities from acting as self-advocates? Do other factors, such as staff training, affect parental comprehension of procedural safeguards? Answers to such questions may encourage more attention to the significance of this issue and foster change at both state and local levels.</p>
<p>Furthermore, future research should assess the readability of procedural safeguards documents provided in other languages. According to NLTS-2 data, 14% of students with disabilities speak a language other than English at home; this proportion jumps to 20% of low-income students, 54% of Asian or Pacific Islander students, and 67% of Hispanic students with disabilities (NLTS-2, 2003). A study by Torres-Burgo and colleagues (1999) highlights the need for attention to this issue: They found that very low-income Hispanic parents of children with learning disabilities were less likely to have their rights explained to them in their native language (Spanish for 70% of parents), less likely to be asked by staff if they understand their child’s IEP, and less likely to understand the content of the IEP and services available to their children compared to the non-Hispanic parents in their study.</p>
<p>Existing law and IDEA requirements indicate that at all levels of school governance, educational agencies have a legal obligation to communicate procedural safeguards in language understandable to the general public, in print and in other modes of communication. National literacy data combined with national special education data provide strong support for defining what “understandable to the general public” means in this context. The U.S. Department of Education as well as state departments of education should lead by example by providing clear, simple template language for local educational agencies to follow, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022466910362774">Paasche-Orlow, Taylor, and Brancati (2003)</xref> with regard to the readability of informed consent forms in medical and public health research. Their study showed that medical schools’ informed consent forms and templates often failed to meet their own institution’s readability standards but that federal oversight that had been implemented for a proportion of those schools was associated with lower readability levels. Clearly, there is an important role for special education leaders to play in ensuring the readability of procedural safeguards, in terms of both availability of appropriate templates and provision of oversight. Given the current difficulty of many of these documents, however, it may be necessary to train and support direct service providers to “translate” written, documented rights to parents and self-advocates.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study provides further evidence that the literacy demand on parents navigating the special education process is too high. This mismatch may significantly impede meaningful parental and student involvement in special education—an issue of great concern to advocates and educators alike. The goal of clearly communicating procedural safeguards to parents is to facilitate a more effective partnership and to ensure a fair process when the interests of students with disabilities and their families conflict with the interests of schools. Although clear communication involves many steps, plainly written procedural rights documents should be a minimum requirement.</p>
