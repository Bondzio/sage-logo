<abstract>
<p>This article examines the <italic>structured panel discussion</italic> as a new form of broadcast news interaction. This involves live conversation among the anchorperson and news journalists on political news stories. The article draws upon the conversation analytic literature on news interviews, as well as detailed discourse analysis of journalistic discourse. By analysing data from Greek commercial prime-time news, it is argued that both the sequential organization and intra-turn design of journalists’ talk help construct their professional role as that of an authoritative expert (analyst and opinionated commentator) on political current affairs. The rhetoric of expertise legitimizes the journalists’ attribution of accountability, as well as their formulation of personal points of view. Given the absence of political actors from such extended exchanges, journalists are enabled to ‘impose’ their preferred readings of political actions and events on the audience. The structured panel discussion is a unique inter-journalistic conversational format, which exists alongside the more standard news interview, and is consequential for the representation of politics and political actors by the broadcast media.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The news interview is a landmark genre of broadcast journalism, occupying a prominent position in political communication from the early days of its institutionalization in the 1930s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957926511431505">Schudson, 1994</xref>) up to the present. In fact, 20th-century society has been described as the ‘the interview society’, as the news interview has evolved into the fundamental form of text and talk production in the mass media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957926511431505">Ekström et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>From a discourse perspective, the news interview is perhaps the most systematically researched genre of broadcast interaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957926511431505">Clayman and Heritage’s (2002)</xref> pioneering work has laid out the procedural properties of the news interview as a form of ‘talk-in-interaction’, focusing on its distinctive turn-taking structure, which differentiates it from ordinary conversation and accounts for its unique institutional character. Following the premises of Conversation Analysis, the object of enquiry in analysing interview discourse is to uncover the understandings and inferences that participants themselves, rather than external researchers, visibly orient to in the turn-by-turn flow of interaction.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957926511431505">Clayman and Heritage (2002)</xref>, what sets the news interview apart as a form of institutional interaction is the pre-allocated character of the turn-taking system, whereby the interviewer is asking questions and the interviewee generates answers. What is more, in contrast to other types of institutional interaction (e.g. interaction in courtrooms or medical encounters), news interviews are marked by a special ‘footing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957926511431505">Goffman, 1973</xref>), where both the interviewer and the interviewee produce talk – not so much for each other but for an absent, overhearing audience. This is visible in the design and sequential properties of contributions by the parties involved.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the notion of accountability has been raised to a public and institutional demand for political journalism. Holding political figures to account is a primary aim of political interviewing, and, as a result, the style of journalistic discourse has shifted toward more confrontational forms of interviewing.</p>
<p>However, journalists’ actions and their control over interaction are constrained by the institutional requirement of impartiality. Neutrality is a perennial requisite of news journalism: ‘News journalism seeks legitimacy by diverting attention away from journalism as a producing, interpreting and arguing activity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957926511431505">Ekström, 2002</xref>: 278). Neutrality, more specifically, the dubious neutrality of the news, is a pervasive theme of media research.</p>
<p>Clayman and Heritage see journalistic questioning as involving a balancing act or tension between two major professional norms: ‘objectivity and adversarialness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957926511431505">Heritage and Clayman, 2010</xref>: 227). Thus, although it is recognized that ‘strict neutrality (or impartiality or freedom from bias) in questioning is impossible’ (p. 228), the journalist’s phrasing of turns as questions, as well as the attribution of views and statements to third parties (named or not), protects journalists from accusations of bias, thus safeguarding their formally neutral or ‘neutralistic’ stance. The conversational–analytic literature of the late 1980s through to the present day has provided ample documentation of the conversational strategies through which news interviewers (but also interviewees) orient to the principle of journalistic neutralism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957926511431505">Clayman, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957926511431505">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957926511431505">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957926511431505">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957926511431505">Clayman and Heritage, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957926511431505">Greatbatch, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957926511431505">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957926511431505">Heritage, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957926511431505">Montgomery, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957926511431505">Rendle-Short, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A defining feature of the news interview as a form of news is the capacity of interviewees as public figures. Clayman and Heritage distinguish among different interviewing genres, namely the newsmaker interview, the background interview and the debate interview, each of which entail a different interviewee role as ‘participant’, ‘expert’ or ‘advocate’, respectively. Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957926511431505">Montgomery (2007)</xref> identifies four news interview sub-genres, which are differentiated by the social identity and role of the interviewee and his/her principal contribution to the interview, but also by the types of lead-in that set the interviewing agenda and the kinds of questions asked. These are: the experiential interview (with ordinary people), the expert interview (with experts on designated topics), the affiliated interview (with correspondents) and the accountability interview, involving ‘public figures with some kind of responsible role in relation to the news event (accounting)’ (146).</p>
<p>This article focuses on a newly evolved type of broadcast interview on Greek prime-time commercial television, which I call the <italic>structured panel discussion</italic> (henceforth, SPD). This involves intra-professional, multi-party live interaction among the anchorperson and a panel of news journalist–commentators.</p>
<p>Here, it is worth noting that journalist-centred panel discussions are not limited to the Greek broadcasting context. In the USA, this format is featured in several weekly current affairs programmes, most notably <italic>Washington Week</italic> (on PBS), <italic>Capital Gang</italic> (aired by CNN from 1988 to 2005 and replaced by <italic>On the Story</italic>, also featuring a studio audience), <italic>The McLaughlin Group</italic> (on public and CBS-affiliated stations) and <italic>This Week</italic> (on ABC). However, unlike the Greek case, these programmes are weekly (rather than daily), and are broadcast on weekends. Finally and, most importantly, they are self-contained broadcast products, i.e. they are not part of the structure and routine of daily news. What is distinctive about the SPD is that it is a news sub-genre per se, namely it is part and parcel of live news discourse on the central (evening) news bulletin of commercial television.</p>
<p>The SPD does not fall into any of the aforementioned news interview categories; rather than addressing official policy makers, eyewitnesses of news events, field correspondents or other experts through face-to-face questioning, here, the anchorperson and news journalists jointly articulate the deeper meaning and implications of political news stories, and, in so doing, attribute accountability in third-person references to political actors.</p>
<p>Overall, the SPD is a dynamic process of performing the news though minute- by-minute conversational interaction. What is more, it will be shown that it creates an interactional ‘space’, where the constraints on the interviewer’s contributions are non-operative, and, as a result, news journalists can systematically step out of formal neutralism, while eloquently voicing personal views.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0957926511431505">
<title>Prime-time news on Greek commercial television</title>
<p>In the past seven years, television news in Greece has undergone a generic transformation. More specifically, the predominantly reportorial mode of news has given way to diverse interactive formats, such that prime-time commercial news bulletins are dominated by dialogic modes of discourse. In this context, the anchorperson, journalists, politicians and other news actors share the task of discussing or debating a central news story.</p>
<p>The research data come from a corpus of more than 20 hours of commercial prime-time news from two of the most high-rating national channels, MEGA channel and ALPHA channel, recorded between 2006 and 2009. The excerpts analysed later originate from MEGA channel, which typically leads the race as the most high-rating prime-time news bulletin. These news programmes were broadcast in 2009.</p>
<p>The year 2004 marked an important innovation in the presentation of the central (evening) news bulletin, first introduced by MEGA channel. Most of the major private channels soon followed suit. The hitherto one-way presentation of news has given way to a conversational scheme, whereby the prestigious anchorperson is currently surrounded by a panel of journalist–commentators. The role of the latter is to elaborate on the news stories following the anchorperson’s cue. Political news on prime-time commercial television is therefore delivered, either in an intra-professional conversational format involving a panel of news journalists without the participation of politicians, or between journalists and political spokespersons. As a result of this, prime-time news today is overwhelmingly political and contains fewer news stories (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957926511431505">Patrona, 2009</xref>: 178).</p>
<p>Accordingly, the visual format of electronic news presentation has changed into that of the television screen split into multiple participant ‘windows’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957926511431505">Figure 1</xref> below).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957926511431505-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>This is an important technological advancement in the sense that it ensures that multi-party interaction in the studio, or even with live feed from remote locations, can take place, while, at the same time, preserving the participants’ direct gaze on viewers. As a result, the audience can see the facial expressions of each and every speaker and listener as they interact with one another on the electronic ‘windows’. Mainstream TV stations have raised multi-party interaction on ‘windows’ to an important component of prime-time news, as they devote to it a significant amount of air time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957926511431505">Doudakis, 2004</xref>). On occasion, such as in cases of extraordinary, ‘hard’ news, conversational interaction can take up as much as 90 per cent of the total bulletin time (which is about 50 minutes long).</p>
<p>Concerning the issue of change in broadcasting practices, and its origin, Clayman and Heritage recognize the possibility of change as an intrinsic feature of interviewing:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Changes in the broad pattern of questioning of public figures can develop with great rapidity in response to economic and other trends …. Within this context, what is treated as fair questioning and what as foul can also change rapidly. The parameters of the permissible can expand, and they can also contract. Yesterday’s ‘fairness’ can seem quaint, while tomorrow’s may appear shocking. Of all the institutions we examine in this book, the news interview is the most nakedly exposed to raw processes of social change. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957926511431505">Heritage and Clayman, 2010</xref>: 243–4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the Greek broadcasting context, changes in the social organization of news have extended far beyond the mere question design and the strategies used for journalistic questioning; rather than questioning public figures, the SPD has evolved into an alternative, albeit dominant, pattern of inter-journalistic interviewing, allowing ample turn-space for journalistic monologues that generate – and constitute – the news.</p>
<p>In the next section, I will show that, in the SPD, news discourse is typified by an argumentative rhetoric embedded in a conversational format.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0957926511431505">
<title>The structured panel discussion as news</title>
<p>The structured panel discussion (SPD) is a unique interviewing format which is part of the news, but is markedly different from the conventional news interview, both in terms of the participants involved and its structural properties. First, in contrast to the news interview, in this format, political actors and news protagonists are talked about in the news studio, but are notably absent from the immediate participation framework; rather, the talk unfolds between the anchor and a panel of news journalists. What is more, the sequential organization of the SPD is such that the constraint of asking questions does not apply to journalists’ contributions. Instead, the interaction develops in the form of multiple reports on the news item offered by the commentators in a serial manner, i.e. one after the other following the newscaster’s prompt:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>anchorperson’s comment + cue</italic></p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>panel journalist A</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p><italic>anchorperson’s comment + cue</italic></p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>panel journalist B</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p><italic>anchorperson’s comment + cue</italic></p>
<p>↓</p>
<p><italic>panel journalist C</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The SPD may also exemplify a freer structural pattern, where conversational rights are locally negotiated among panel journalists, in a way similar to informal conversation. Here, intervention by the anchor is minimal, while s/he expresses opinions almost on an equal basis to the rest of the panel.</p>
<p>In the first format, sequentially, the interaction begins with the newscaster providing background information and commenting on the story. S/he then allocates the floor to panellists, who take turns to provide insider details and evaluate and interpret the events for viewers in extended, uninterrupted turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957926511431505">Patrona, 2009</xref>: 180). Thus, while in its more structured form, the anchor elicits responses from the journalists, the talk is still overwhelmingly not organized as a series of question–answer sequences, typical of the news interview; rather, the host is more interested in prompting her colleagues to develop their views, by nominating them or raising issues for discussion that are pertinent to a central news story.</p>
<p>In extract 1, the topic discussed is the recommendations made by the Bank of Greece Governor, George Provopoulos, while presenting the central bank’s interim report on monetary policy to the Parliament’s Economic Affairs Committee in February 2009. The Governor urged drastic reforms for the restructuring of the Greek economy, which was already impaired at the time by the global economic recession<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0957926511431505">1</xref></sup> (the ‘beating of tax evasion’, line 1, being one of the proposed measures). The anchorwoman and her panel jointly express their stance towards the Governor’s proposals, and analyse their repercussions for government policy. In lines 1–9, the anchorperson sets the scene by providing an initial assessment of the events surrounding the news story; she then nominates the panel journalists, who take turns to spell out the implications of these recommendations for the government, the economy and the Greek people, respectively:</p>

<p>19 at all ((pause)) the <underline>difference</underline> which makes this report now have a</p>

<p>21 economic <underline>crisis</underline>, of economic <underline>pressure</underline>, of econo – of an international</p>
<p>22 economic, <underline>crash</underline>, and mainly, that we are expecting the [European]</p>
<p>23 Commission <underline>too</underline> to come out and talk on Wednesday ((pause)) and to tell</p>

<p>25 it’s not about predictions ((pause)) I have said it before here I <underline>don’t</underline> pay any</p>
<p>26 attention to these predictions, rather ((pause)) I pay <underline>minimal</underline> attention,</p>
<p>27 because whoever is so ((coll.)) <underline>streetwise</underline> that as early as <underline>February</underline></p>
<p>28 ((pause)) of <underline>two thousand nine</underline>, can predict in the midst of an international</p>
<p>29 <underline>crisis</underline>, political <underline>measures</underline>, and all these things, whether at the end of the</p>
<p>30 year growth will be at one point one or zero point eight, well then he is</p>
<p>31 either too ((coll.)) <underline>streetwise</underline> or we must ass – assign him the economy for</p>
<p>32 life, (0.1) to manage – now because <underline>nobody</underline> is <underline>that</underline> <underline>much</underline> ((coll.)) streetwise</p>
<p>33 and I’m certain of this, I assure you that all these are, ((pause)) working</p>
<p>34 prognostics – working hypotheses for them to work on ((pause)) but that</p>
<p>35 which is <underline>indeed true</underline> ((pause)) is that Provopoulos today rings ((lit. sends</p>
<p>36 out)) <underline>a little bell</underline></p>
<p>37 mmm,</p>
<p>38 and <underline>that little bell</underline> is a little bell after the <underline>second</underline> little bell, (0.1) that will</p>
<p>39 come, on Wednesday (0.1) and I have to say that in contrast to what most</p>
<p>40 people say, this is <underline>not</underline> an outbound little bell, it’s an <underline>inbound</underline> little bell,</p>
<p>41 ((pause)) to at last enable the Greek society to understand, the state it is in</p>
<p>42 ((pause)) to look at itself in the <underline>mirror</underline> ((pause)) because at the moment,</p>
<p>43 <underline>nobody</underline> in Greece seems to s – to – to – understand where we are ((pause))</p>
<p>44 and that’s why we are, ((refrain of popular old Greek song; idiom.)) we are</p>
<p>45 <underline>completely carefree</underline> ((pause)) well in order ((repeats refrain of popular old</p>
<p>  Greek song; idiom.)) <underline>not to be completely carefree</underline>, we had better, start</p>
<p>  taking these little bells into account –</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In her opening utterance, the anchorperson expresses scepticism with regard to the Governor’s recommendations. First, she uses a metaphorical phrase alluding to Shakespeare’s well-known play (‘midsummer night’s dream’, lines 1–2); she then casts doubt on whether the Governor’s recommendations can bring about immediate benefits (‘about the issue at hand about today <italic>I don’t know</italic> if he says something concrete something which could materialize in the immediate future’, lines 6–8). Her personal opinion is signalled through the first-person verb form (‘δe gzero’/‘I don’t know’).</p>
<p>Rather than toning down the authority of expressed views, markers of personal opinion are used to facilitate the exchange of arguments in the process of spontaneous interaction, calling attention to the personality and intellectual positioning of individual speakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957926511431505">Patrona, 2009</xref>: 184; for the increasing use of subjectivity markers in interview discourse, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957926511431505">Thornborrow and Montgomery, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of the panel journalist’s first name (Yannis, line 3) serves as a prompt, allocating the next turn at talk to the journalist. Finally, the anchorwoman provides the gist of the Governor’s proposals in a categorical closing statement (lines 8–9) punctuated by a high modality adjunct (‘definitely’/‘siγura’, line 8). In this way, she calls attention to the reliability of her talk as an authoritative source of information (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957926511431505">He, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957926511431505">Patrona, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In lines 10–34, the first panel commentator (P) echoes the anchorperson’s scepticism in a series of statements interspersed with the expression of his personal opinion. The first-person pronoun is italicized in the following excerpts: ‘<italic>I</italic>’ve been hearing this for about twenty to twenty five years at least that <italic>I</italic>’ve been watching this story’, lines 13–14; ‘<italic>I</italic>’ve been hearing the same stuff’, lines 14–15; ‘<italic>I</italic> don’t pay any attention to these predictions, rather <italic>I</italic> pay minimal attention’, lines 24–5. Again, ‘I think’ (line 13) does not serve to hedge the propositional meaning of talk; rather, it projects the speaker’s personal attitude as author of the unfolding argument. The journalist then moves on to formulate what he considers to be the meaningful aspect of the Governor’s recommendations (lines 17–23). His statement is cast in the generic present tense, which is the typical grammatical means for asserting the validity of a proposition at all times. The statement specifies a cause-and-effect relationship between the Governor’s report and the reaction of the European commission in the midst of the international financial crisis, and ends with a meta-discoursal clause (‘this is essentially the crux of the matter, it’s not about predictions’, lines 22–3). The clause retrospectively frames the previous segment of his talk as the main point of discourse.</p>
<p>Expressions of meta-talk are typical in the discourse of experts in televised discussions. They highlight the main point of upcoming or previous stretches of talk in a way that focuses the attention of listeners, and enables them to interpret the information as the core discourse message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957926511431505">Patrona, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Again, the journalist underlines his authority with the high modality verb (‘I assure you’, line 31). What is more, the expression of the journalist’s standpoint is rhetorically constructed through stylistic shifts to informal and colloquial language. Colloquial items and phrases help create a recognizable public idiom, allowing the studio participants, and, more importantly, viewers to identify with the speaker’s argument as it is delivered. Repetition and other rhetorical devices work to amplify the rhetorical resonance of his message: ‘the same <italic>stuff</italic>’ (line 15), ‘to tell us its own <italic>stuff</italic>’ (line 22), the repetition of ‘streetwise’ (‘magas’) twice in the same utterance (lines 25–9), and the effect of alliteration created by the repetition of ‘little bell’ (‘kabanaci’) six times in an extended utterance that elaborates the journalist’s statement: ‘Provopoulos today rings ((lit. sends out)) a little bell’ (lines 33–4, 36–8).</p>
<p>Finally, P communicates a sense of urgency, calling upon Greek society to ‘look at itself in the mirror’ (line 40), abandon its relaxed stance and recognize the severity of the economic situation and the need for action (‘we had better, start taking these little bells into account’, lines 44–5). He achieves this by invoking and repeating the refrain of a popular old Greek song, cast in a highly idiomatic slang: ‘we are completely carefree’ (‘ena δio tria o:p, to riksame sto sorlolop’), lines 42–3; ‘well in order ((repeats refrain of popular old Greek song; idiom.)) not to be completely carefree (‘ja na mi do riksume sto sololop’), lines 43–4. Necessity statements are further rhetorical tools: they are linguistic means used for argument-building and serve a persuasive function in public talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957926511431505">Patrona, 2005</xref>: 246).</p>
<p>In extract 2 below, the discussion is also focused upon the central banker’s recommendations for strict austerity measures, and the projections about the indicators of the Greek economy included in the Governor’s interim report (see the anchor’s references to ‘numbers’ in lines 108–10):</p>

<p>In line 106, the anchorperson nominates panellist ‘O’ as the next speaker, and introduces the topic of the human dimension underlying the financial planning made by institutional policy makers (‘the European Commission … the International Monetary Fund, or … some governor of a central bank’, lines 106–8), implying that the latter have neglected this aspect (‘in any case I don’t see <underline>the people</underline> anywhere’, lines 110–11). Notably, the caption appearing on screen while her talk is in progress takes a specific stand towards one of the Governor’s financial policy proposals, namely the freezing of salaries, calling attention to its consequences for citizens (‘FREEZING’ REQUESTED OF … STARVATION SALARIES). The caption is implying that blocking any increase in already low salaries (note the loaded term ‘starvation’) will reduce citizens to poverty.</p>
<p>Overall, captions appearing in the course of live conversation serve as an important communicative function: they summarize the gist of the journalist’s point at the exact moment in the speaker’s utterance where the point is first introduced, or even <italic>before</italic> the point is introduced. Accordingly, the sequence of topics, as well as the ordering of viewpoints voiced by journalists, actually conforms to a pre-planned agenda. This is corroborated by Olga Tremi,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0957926511431505">2</xref></sup> the prestigious anchorwoman of prime-time news on MEGA channel:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am not caught by surprise [on the air], because what is said on the news bulletin are views and topics that have been discussed during the team meeting. This is what we have been doing for more than two years. We don’t go on the air with each one of us saying whatever crosses his mind at the time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is clear, therefore, that apparently spontaneous conversation on the news is in fact a well monitored and carefully rehearsed <italic>performance</italic> for viewers.</p>
<p>In line 112, the panellist takes up the anchorperson’s point in order to articulate his personal perspective against the proposed measures for economic reform. He achieves this by alluding to the anticipated counter-arguments of institutional centres of power, and refuting them through vivid images of the plight of ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>He begins his talk with a metaphorical statement illustrating the gap between institutional policy makers and the common person: ‘locked inside their glass castle as a rule, they make plans’ (line 112). Note the parallel structure punctuated with the repetition of ‘hide’: ‘two million Greeks who live below the threshold of poverty’, ‘thousands of young working kids, of University degree holders, who are jammed at the offices of MPs and others’, ‘four hundred thousand, unemployed’, ‘thousands of employees’ (lines 117–25).</p>
<p>In line 129, the discourse marker ‘so’ (‘lipon’) signposts a change in the speaker’s stance, from a description of a state of affairs to prescriptive commentary about the desired attitude of the government towards poverty and social problems: ‘the government will have to look with this kind of sensitivity ((raised pitch)) beyond technocratic analyses’ (lines 129–30).</p>
<p>The journalist’s emotional involvement is signalled by the rhetorical question ‘how is it possible’ (line 134) and the paralinguistic features of his talk (increased volume and raised pitch). In lines 138–40 there follows another parallelism, namely the repetition of ‘let anyone’: ‘<italic>let anyone</italic> of them live, on seven hundred and eight hundred euros and have to pay for his children’s studies?’; ‘<italic>let anyone</italic> of them stay in the street’; lines 143–4 ‘<italic>let anyone</italic> go and live on borrowed money and ask his son – aged twenty five, for pocket money in order to go and buy his aspirins?’.</p>
<p>As the example illustrates, the journalists’ monologues often draw heavily on ‘poetic’ or expressive sources of meaning. Here, these resources are enlisted in order to build a persuasive argument against the technocratic discourses of official policy makers, advocating a humane approach to fiscal problems.</p>
<p>While extracts 1 and 2 illustrate the core format of the SPD, excerpt 3 exemplifies its less structured variant, where conversational management by the anchor is minimal and journalists secure the floor mainly by self-selecting.</p>
<p>In the example below, the panel journalists criticize politicians in general (journalist P) and government members (journalist O) for spreading rumours about early parliamentary elections. At the beginning of 2009, there were widespread rumours that the New Democracy prime minister would call early general elections<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0957926511431505">3</xref></sup> in the hope of securing a fresh mandate for economic reform. This ‘election talk’, which was pervasive among both government and opposition members, is thematized by the news journalists in the extract. The latter take a stand against those who are disseminating these rumours, on the grounds that early elections would harm the country’s already embattled economy:</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>In line 8, the panellist (P) self-selects in order to state his own view on the topic. Notably, he underlines the subjective dimension in his standpoint (‘because I don’t like’) and resorts to the idiomatic expression ‘to not chew one’s words’, meaning ‘to speak directly, openly’. Thus, through an unhedged assertion, he portrays himself as an outspoken critique of what he sees as political misconduct (‘whoever today, talks, or thinks about elections in Greece, does enormous, harm, to the country’, lines 8–10). Note that the indefinite pronoun (‘whoever’) leaves the agents of what he casts as politically irresponsible behaviour unspecified.</p>
<p>In the next turn (line 11), another panellist (T) retorts that, in fact, everyone is currently talking about elections in Greece. The use of the informal particle ‘vre’ followed by the friendly address form ‘my [first name] Giannis’ (‘hey ((par.)) vre ((lit. my)) Yannis’/‘e vre jani mu’) echoes everyday conversation among friends. The effect of spontaneous, informal interaction is also created by the conversational timing of participant contributions through latched turns and overlapping talk.</p>
<p>In line 13, P includes the broadcast media in the criticism concerning the dissemination of election rumours in a self-reflexive manner. In lines 15–23, he upgrades his criticism in the same categorical tone. The screen caption appearing in the course of the speaker’s turn (line 15) reformulates the essence of his talk in an epigrammatic manner (A BLOW TO THE ECONOMY, THE EXTENDED ELECTION TALK), thus focusing his argument against the propagators of election rumours. Again, P’s point is cast in the form of unmitigated statements conveying certainty (‘whoever talks and whoever thinks, ((pause)) is committing a major national faux pas’, lines 15–16). The same rhetorical effect is achieved by repeating ‘it is impossible’ (lines 16, 18). In lines 18–21, the journalist’s criticism is targeted at ‘politicians’ in general. In other words, he does not hold any specific political players, group or party accountable for the reprimandable behaviour. Through a three-part<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0957926511431505">4</xref></sup> simile marked by the repetition of ‘as if they live’, the journalist accuses politicians of being detached from the life-world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957926511431505">Habermas, 1989</xref>): ‘as if they live in a cage, as if they live in a glass, as if they live in a laboratory, [that is] protected from all that happens in the world’ (lines 19–21).</p>
<p>He proceeds, once more, to foreground his personal opinion as an expert analyst, in a resonating critique of politicians who engage in election talk: ‘this, <italic>personally</italic>, allow me to say this, <italic>I consider</italic>, unacceptable’ (lines 21–2).</p>
<p>In line 69, a third panellist (O) takes the floor in order to further elaborate on the topic of who is responsible for spreading election rumours. He prefaces his turn with emphatic agreement on the points previously made (‘that’s exactly how it is’, line 69), thus showing solidarity with his colleagues. In the extended turn that follows, O paints a gloomy picture of political reality (‘we live a <italic>sad</italic> reality’, line 69). Here, the inclusive ‘we’ shows that he formulates his critique as a spokesperson for citizens. However, in contrast to the previous speaker, ‘O’ openly attributes responsibility to government members for focusing on how to secure their re-election, rather than on the burning problems faced by the country.</p>
<p>Tellingly, the screen caption in line 72 (MINISTERS’ OFFICES ARE ‘EMPTY’ FRIDAY–MONDAY) anticipates the journalist’s main point <italic>before</italic> it is actually made. In fact, the point about government ministers missing from their offices from Friday to Monday is not initiated until line 78. This corroborates the fact that apparently spontaneous talk on the central news bulletin is, in reality, aligned with a pre-existing agenda. The journalist begins his talk by attributing accountability exclusively to the government (‘the only one who could have closed the election case is the government itself’, lines 69–71). His ensuing clause ‘what the main opposition party is asking for as it is entitled to’ (lines 72–3) absolves the PASOK opposition from political accountability. In other words, by re-affirming the opposition’s entitlement to request premature elections, the journalist legitimates their actions; on the contrary, he discounts the reliability of the government and its representatives (‘[it is] a <underline>different</underline> issue how the <underline>government</underline> works, the ministers’, lines 73–4).</p>
<p>Here too, the journalist resorts to ‘poetic’ devices, namely metaphors and imagery (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957926511431505">Tannen, 2007</xref>). In line 74, he begins to develop his point about the allegedly unacceptable conduct of ruling party politicians, by quoting the lyrics of a popular Greek composer and song writer: ‘so now during these hours, that as ((popular Greek song writer and singer)) Savopoulos would say <italic>everything changes down here with an impetus</italic>, ((pause)) we are watching – literally from Friday according to the reportages we have been carrying out to Monday the whole universe fall apart’. The word ‘reportages’ calls attention to his capacity as an investigative political journalist, and is used as evidence in support of his point: ‘we are watching … the whole universe fall apart’ (lines 77–8). The journalist therefore underscores the gravity of the situation with a metaphorical hyperbole cast as an unmodified statement.</p>
<p>He proceeds to illustrate his point by listing specific examples of the apparently trivial and self-centred activities that government members engage in. He achieves this by painting vivid images of political misbehaviour. Note the metaphorical ‘<italic>running</italic> to their constituencies in order to collect votes’, ‘ministers push each other elbow to elbow’ and the constructed speech with conspiratory overtones in ‘Vatopedans<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0957926511431505">5</xref></sup> start <italic>whispering</italic> that we must undoubtedly be in the [election] lists’ (lines 79–84). The assertion ‘this is the reality’ underlines the validity of his point as it is delivered. In lines 84–5, the journalist closes his turn with a metaphorical statement apparently addressed to the anchorwoman; the statement animates a contrast between the pressing urgency of the situation on the one hand (‘so at a time when our house is burning ((pause)) Ms. Tremi’) and the trivial pursuits of government members on the other. The two journalists jointly construct the point at hand, as the second part of the contrast is filled in by the anchor (‘Mr. Oikonomeas our MPs are slicing New Year pies’, line 87); the point is further developed by the panellist in an overlapping turn (‘and is on fire’, line 88), followed by a latched elaboration (‘they are cutting pies and they are running beauty contests’, line 89). The accusation refers to the traditional cutting of New Year pies by MPs as a means of boosting their popularity, while the phrase ‘beauty contests’ alludes to the popularity surveys commissioned by MPs.</p>
<p>The extensive use of metaphorical language creates ambiguity and presupposes shared assumptions with the studio participants, but, also, the viewer audience. Metaphors create a sense of in-group solidarity between the speaker and the public, in effect positioning viewers as equally familiar with and critical of the government’s misconduct. The journalist tacitly calls upon the public to fill in the gaps in his discourse and, thereby, share his assumptions (for indirectness or ‘ellipsis’ as one of many strategies building involvement in conversation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957926511431505">Tannen, 2007</xref>). Overall, the recurrent use of ‘literary’ devices, such as figures of speech, is part of an overtly argumentative rhetoric, and is a rather unexpected attribute of mainstream broadcast news discourse. It is significant in so far as it reveals the role of the SPD in creating an interactional space where journalists can be uninhibited in taking a stand on political current affairs.</p>
<p>The panellist closes his turn by voicing a personalized hope for the future: ‘<italic>I hope</italic> that until the end <italic>we</italic> will not prove [to be] too small’ (line 90). Note that the attribution of accountability is unspecified in his statement (‘we’), but based on his preceding talk, the audience knows that he is referring to ruling party politicians.</p>

<sec id="section4-0957926511431505" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, I have argued that the <italic>structured panel discussion</italic> is a new form of broadcast news interaction, where prominent journalists engage in live conversation on a designated news story. More specifically, they articulate markedly personal opinions about high-standing public officials and their proposed policies, and about the actions of the government and/or the opposition. Finally, they formulate prescriptive comments about desired action or policy (in the examples at hand, in favour of a humane economic policy). In this way, panel journalists redefine the conventionally questioning role of the news journalist, who sustains a formally neutral posture.</p>
<p>The SPD is a unique format of broadcast news talk. This is because its participation structure and sequential properties allow for novel communicative entitlements for news journalists in terms of what they are allowed to do on air, thus uncovering evolving interviewing practices and the demise of neutralism. What is more, it sheds light on how this form of interviewing fits into the news-making process. In fact, one could see the SPD as a realization – in public – of the news team meeting, namely as a formal re-enactment of the news-making process, or news making <italic>in</italic> process, where the subjectivity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0957926511431505">6</xref></sup> of the news journalists is foregrounded and is a catalyst in <italic>performing</italic> the news. Finally, the SPD constitutes an alternative to the news interview for performing (attributing and negotiating) accountability in the news.</p>
<p>In the participation framework at hand, journalists are shown to possess insider knowledge of political reality; what is more, they are positioned as being entitled to express personalized, albeit expert, views on the motives of political actors, and the far-reaching ramifications of their actions for the government, the economy and the people. The journalists’ monologues function much as opinion articles in the print press. In other words, they aim at enlisting audience alignment with the views expressed. To this end, journalists deploy an elaborate, ‘poetic’ rhetoric.</p>
<p>In the SPD, both the anchor and the panel take a stand on topical political issues. More specifically, this stand-taking involves (1) expressing scepticism about politicians and public officials’ statements and their ability to realize their stated goals or promises; (2) voicing the deeper meaning of the words (and actions) of official policy makers (‘reading between the lines’); and, finally, (3) criticizing politicians in general or government members for being out of touch with ordinary citizens, and for acts of political misdemeanour; in essence, for promoting their self-interests as opposed to the interests of the people and the country. However, news journalists do not explicitly align with or criticize any of the main political players or the parties that they represent. This indicates that there are still limits to journalists’ licence to express a particular standpoint.</p>
<p>The scepticism expressed towards politicians echoes a ‘problem of trust’ characterizing contemporary journalistic discourse on politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957926511431505">Tolson, 2011</xref>). Thus, according to Tolson, political statements, decisions and policies are articulated by news journalists as ‘stories’ told to people, who may or may not believe them, in a type of ‘skeptical pragmatics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957926511431505">2011</xref>). The rhetoric of mistrust is also indexical of the preoccupation of news media with politics as a ‘game’, political jockeying and strategizing at the expense of policy substance and substantive reporting (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957926511431505">Patterson, 1993</xref>). What is more, the journalists’ rhetoric echoes one of the implicit news values proposed by news sociologist Herbert Gans, namely that the public and government officials are often positioned in conflict between one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957926511431505">Gans, 1979</xref>). As far back as 1979, Gans stressed the need for more ‘bottom–up’ news on how policies affect citizens, and more representational news, namely finding out and reporting on what matters to people from all walks of life. Indeed, this perspective is embodied in the central news bulletin in the incisive rhetoric of George Oikonomeas, one of the MEGA channel commentators, thus showing a need to connect official discourses about policies to the lives of everyday people.</p>
<p>Overall, both the sequential management and the design of journalists’ extended turns help construct their professional role as that of an authoritative expert (analyst and opinionated commentator) on political current affairs. This role epistemologically positions the journalist as superior to the general public. At the same time, the journalist is played out as a ‘tribune of the people’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957926511431505">Clayman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957926511431505">Clayman and Heritage, 2002</xref>), prioritizing the concerns of everyday citizens (the life-world), and passing value judgements for what they cast as political misconduct and lack of social sensitivity. However, in the SPD, the ‘tribune of the people’ is performed on different terms: Clayman and Heritage emphasize the strategic use of this stance in news interviewing, where inviting public officials to address the concerns or criticisms of citizens protects journalists from accusations of bias. In the SPD, by contrast, the constraint of attributing journalists’ adversarial statements to third parties or to citizens at large is non-operative, as this is a legitimate locus for journalists-taking-a-stand.</p>
<p>Overall, the rhetoric of expertise legitimizes the journalists’ attribution of accountability, as well as their overt expression of personal points of view. Given the absence of political actors themselves from such exchanges, journalists are enabled to ‘impose’ their preferred readings of political actions and events on the audience. The freedom to engage in the rhetoric of argument and opinion bestows conversational – and symbolic – power upon media representatives and the media at large.</p>
<p>Both the SPD and the more standard interviews with politicians have been commonly encountered in the central news bulletin of prime-time commercial news for the past six to seven years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0957926511431505">7</xref></sup> However, despite the absence of face-to-face debate with politicians, the SPD is a particularly economical, engaging and lively pattern of political interviewing, capitalizing on the authenticity of live conversational interaction. This explains why it has gained ground as an alternative scheme for disseminating political news to national audiences, to the extent that it is now a sine qua non component of the evening news bulletin. This entails a narrowing of accessed voices on the news, and also echoes the finding that it is currently more common to interview journalists, rather than politicians, in political news programmes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957926511431505">Kroon Lundell and Eriksson’s 2010</xref> comparative study in Sweden and the UK).</p>
<p>To conclude, the SPD emerges as a powerful new form of inter-journalistic interviewing, creating a whole new range of possibilities for the representation of politics and political actors by the broadcast media.</p>

<p>‘Vatopedans’ invokes a real-estate scandal involving the Holy Monastery of Vatopedi situated on Mount Athos. The term, coined by the journalist in the extract, is an allusion to prominent government members who allegedly maintained strong contacts with some Vatopedi monks, and there was speculation that they played a part in securing suspicious real-estate deal benefits for the monastery.</p></fn>
