<abstract>
<p>Britain initiated an extensive pro-democracy propaganda campaign during its wartime occupation of Iraq from 1941–5. Organizations such as the Brotherhood of Freedom aimed to instil civic pride in disaffected Iraqi youth, and the propaganda message was accompanied by a call for internal political reform as a means of protecting against growing communist influence. Allied declarations such as the Atlantic Charter played a key role in this campaign designed to win Iraqi support for the war effort, but the publicity drive also opened up new avenues for protest. The war saw the revival of leftist groups that harnessed this rhetoric to their call for British evacuation. The confluence of Allied democracy propaganda, Iraqi reformist movements, and widespread demands for British withdrawal and political reform served as a catalyst for postwar political change. Yet the reality of the occupation, in particular Britain’s bolstering of the old regime in the interest of wartime stability, ultimately hampered the development of a viable democratic system.</p>

<p>T.E. Lawrence observed, in his reflections on British tactics during the Arab Revolt of the First World War, that ‘A province would be won when we had taught the civilians in it to die for our ideal of freedom.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009413481825">1</xref></sup> Allied propaganda campaigns worldwide during the Second World War echoed this sentiment. British officials in Iraq faced a particular challenge in this regard in the aftermath of the 1941 pro-Axis Rashid ‘Ali coup, and democracy was at the heart of their campaign to woo young Iraqis away from the siren calls of both fascism and communism. Led by the Publicity Section of the British Embassy in Baghdad, the pro-democracy blitz proceeded on a number of fronts simultaneously. Traditional propaganda was wrapped in creative packaging and supplemented with a renewed focus on building personal ties between British officials and Iraqis. The wartime declarations of the Allied powers, such as the Atlantic Charter and United Nations Declaration, aided the local campaign to win the Iraqi public’s support for the Allied war effort. Britain also called for top-down political reform, in the hope that a more responsive political system would appease the younger generation of Iraqi nationalists and legitimize Britain’s presence in the country. Iraq was buried, as Iraqi scholar Majid Khadduri later noted, in an ‘avalanche of declarations, broadcasts, and propaganda literature extolling merits of the democratic way of life and promising improvement in the internal conditions of the country if the democratic countries won the war.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009413481825">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Britain did find some eager pupils, for example the members of the British-sponsored Brotherhood of Freedom, and Iraq remained in the Allied camp for the duration of the war. However, most of the pro-democracy publicity fell flat given the realities of the ‘Second British Occupation’ of Iraq from 1941–5.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009413481825">3</xref></sup> British embassy officials warned of the Pandora’s Box of nationalist demands that the democracy campaign could unleash. Allied wartime declarations and British democracy propaganda served as a handy rhetorical toolbox for Iraqi politicians and intellectuals opposed to the British occupation, and Kurdish nationalists harnessed the Allied vocabulary of reform to call for greater self-determination. Opposition groups, such as the moderate leftist Ahali group and the underground communist party, used the opportunity provided by the loosening of press controls in 1944 to revive long-standing debates about democracy in Iraq that had been quieted by the political tumult of the late 1930s. The Publicity Section attempted to keep the discourse of democracy purposefully vague and discouraged grassroots efforts at reform, but Iraqi sources reveal how intellectuals appropriated and rebranded this campaign to challenge British control. In light of recent interest in the internationalist rhetoric of both world wars, Iraq’s experience provides a useful case study for the local reception of this message.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009413481825">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the mandate period in Iraq (1920–32) has been the subject of renewed attention in the aftermath of the US invasion in 2003, the lesser known ‘Second British Occupation’ of the Second World War provides additional insight into the challenges of fostering democracy in the midst of an occupation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009413481825">5</xref></sup> In the view of Iraqi opposition leaders, democracy and foreign occupation were incompatible and Britain’s wartime democracy campaign was mere hypocrisy. Britain’s support for the ‘old gang’ of Iraqi politicians served its wartime strategic interests but limited its ability to appeal to the younger generation, a dilemma that would haunt the British long after the war ended.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009413481825">6</xref></sup> Many Iraqis bought the product that the British were selling, leading to the postwar revival of what Adeed Dawisha described as the ‘“liberal” impulse’ in Iraqi politics, but just as the original marketers feared, in the end Iraq rejected the seller and transformed ‘democracy’ into a keyword for independence and an Iraq free of British interference.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009413481825">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The April 1941 Rashid ‘Ali coup, which returned to power an Iraqi Prime Minister known to have pro-Axis sympathies, served as the turning point in Iraq’s wartime experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009413481825">8</xref></sup> The Royal Air Force (RAF) took military action against the Iraqi army on 2 May after Iraqi troops surrounded the Habbaniyah air base. When Rashid ‘Ali al-Kailani and the army officers behind the coup fled Iraq at the end of the month, British troops reoccupied the country. Iraq experienced profound internal disruption in the early months of this ‘Second British Occupation.’ The new government was pro-Allied but weakened due to its reliance on British support and the economic upheaval caused by the war effort. Iraq’s Shi‘i majority and Kurdish minority renewed calls for greater political participation, and the army had been discredited by its role in the coup.</p>
<p>In the post mortem of British policy following the events of May 1941, officials pointed to two main factors leading to the coup. The decline of British influence in the 1930s made Iraq fertile ground for Axis infiltration, and the decrepit state of Iraqi politics spiraled into a cycle of coups and intrigues far removed from the representative government promised in the Iraqi constitution. In principle, Iraq had a parliamentary system following the British model. The 1925 Organic Law, promulgated under the British mandate, provided universal suffrage for Iraqi men over the age of 20, with voters indirectly electing members of the Chamber of Deputies. The Senate consisted of representatives appointed by the Regent, who also chose the prime minister. The 1921 provisional government envisioned a ‘constitutional, representative and democratic’ system, in which, as the Organic Law stated, ‘sovereignty belongs to the people.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009413481825">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In practice, the system did not function as well as had been hoped due to a number of inherent flaws. Glubb Pasha, who led the Arab Legion in Iraq during the May 1941 operations, observed that Britain had provided Iraq with ‘an exact copy of the British constitution’ in the expectation that this would provide the Iraqis with ‘all these blessings of democracy which the British people enjoy with such relish.’ Yet the result was far from democratic, as politicians had hijacked the rhetoric and institutions of democracy for their own gain: ‘Thus, to the uninitiated observer, Iraq gave the impression of a model little democracy in action. In reality, a gang of political hacks were grinding out the same old tunes on the democratic barrel organ.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009413481825">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Iraqi constitutional scholar Majid Khadduri identified the weaknesses of this system in a 1944 pamphlet. Successful democracy in Iraq was undermined by the inherent tension between the ‘form’ of the Iraqi government, which was shaped by the British on western democratic models, and the ‘forces arising from local conditions,’ in particular the socio-economic status of Iraq at the time of the mandate. As a result of the tension, the ‘form’ was forced to conform to the local ‘forces,’ undermining its effectiveness. The British occupation heightened this tension, resulting in even greater stress on the already vulnerable Iraqi political system. The absence of viable political parties meant that Iraqi politics centered on personal loyalties rather than party platforms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009413481825">11</xref></sup> The result, as one Iraqi commentator observed, was that ‘though the Constitution was formally retained, it went into cold storage …’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009413481825">12</xref></sup> The scaffolding of Iraqi democracy was built on a weak foundation, and the military coup of 1936 led to the series of rapid cabinet shuffles and coups that culminated in the events of 1941.</p>
<p>Britain addressed the first problem, Axis influence and sympathy for the Axis cause, by bolstering its publicity campaign to counteract German propaganda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009413481825">13</xref></sup> Britain poured resources into the Publicity Section of the embassy in Baghdad, which was, by 1944, its largest department, employing over 100 people and with branches in the major cities of Basra and Mosul.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009413481825">14</xref></sup> Stewart Perowne, director of the Publicity Section, described the goals of British publicity in Iraq as ‘first sympathy, and second power,’ winning Iraqi support while also convincing the local population of Britain’s strength and that the Allies would indeed win the war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009413481825">15</xref></sup> The turning tides of the war and the Allied victories of 1943 helped Britain to achieve the second goal, but the first proved more elusive in the context of a British occupation. Given the lingering concerns about fifth columnists in Iraq and fears of Axis influence in neighboring Iran and Syria, it was imperative to show educated Iraqis, the disaffected youth in particular, that the Allies were acting in their interests, and that Allied war aims aligned with their own values and priorities. Democracy became the keyword at the heart of the new publicity campaign, as it was the thing that set the Allies apart from their fascist enemies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009413481825">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to traditional forms of print and broadcast media, the Publicity Section employed a host of innovative avenues for spreading the British message.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009413481825">17</xref></sup> Glossy magazines and pamphlets were aimed at the more influential segments of the population, while cinema vans, display cases, cigarette cards and radio broadcasts ensured that the message reached Iraqis outside of the circle of power, even in remote locations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009413481825">18</xref></sup> British publicity efforts extended beyond the Embassy through the work of the British Council, the BBC, and ‘Enlightenment Bureaux’ scattered throughout the country. These initiatives were expensive but paled in comparison to the cost, in both money and manpower, of a full-scale military occupation of the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009413481825">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The publicity campaign emphasized that democracy had deep roots within the Islamic tradition itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009413481825">20</xref></sup> One of the more creative products designed for distribution throughout the Arab world was a brightly colored poster, decorated with Arabic calligraphy and arabesques reminiscent of an illuminated Koranic text, which declared: ‘The religion of Islam is the spirit of democracy … Democracy is the essence of the Koran and Islamic teaching, her triumph would be the final triumph of the principles of Islam.’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022009413481825">Figure 1</xref>) Drawing on the authority of the Koran to support this statement, it quoted Sura 42 which refers to the tradition of consultation in the early Islamic community. From this lens, democracy was not an alien imposition but a homegrown institution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009413481825">21</xref></sup>

</p>
<p>Public declarations of the Allied powers, such as the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Declaration, provided rich fuel for Allied publicity campaigns worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009413481825">22</xref></sup> In the Iraqi context, the timing of the Atlantic Charter was fortuitous, following as soon as it did after the dramatic events of spring 1941. The embassy lost no opportunity to point out the stark contrast between the hardships facing countries under Axis occupation and the liberating postwar vision of the Allied powers encapsulated in the charter. As <italic>The Iraq Times</italic>, the primary English-language newspaper in Baghdad and a well-known avenue for Britain’s publicity message dramatically stated: ‘In a world faced with the prospect of a return to the Dark Ages, this declaration offers the people, not of one country but of the whole earth, light, peace and happiness, and the liberty to enjoy peace and happiness in one’s own way. The alternative is insupportable …’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009413481825">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Blanketing Iraq with pro-democracy propaganda, however well designed, would not be enough to repair the years of damage to the Anglo–Iraqi relationship. The British highly valued personal relations with Iraqis as a means of healing the wounds of 1941. In the 1930s the embassy had developed a reputation for aloofness, in stark contrast to the welcoming attitude of the German Legation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009413481825">24</xref></sup> Ambassador Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, a strong believer in the role of personal relationships in diplomacy, revived the Political Advisory system of the mandate period, placing British officers with extensive experience in Iraq in the provinces to serve as the ‘eyes and ears’ of the embassy and maintain good relations with the Kurds and tribal leaders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009413481825">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>A bigger challenge lay in winning over Iraqi youth who had been fed a steady diet of vitriolic Arab nationalist and anti-British propaganda through the Iraqi educational system in the 1930s. The British viewed the publicity challenge in generational terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009413481825">26</xref></sup> Historian Albert Hourani, working for the Foreign Office Research Department during the war, posed a question to British officials that also served as a warning: ‘Can Great Britain afford to allow the Arab youth to become bitter and hostile?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009413481825">27</xref></sup> Freya Stark, a famous travel writer who joined the British Ministry of Information when war broke out, observed that Iraq’s leaders were on the side of the British and democracy,<disp-quote>
<p>But Youth she had lost, or almost lost. It was caught, like many of its brothers in Europe, by the totalitarian mirage. It looked upon Britain as one and the same with the middle-aged status quo against which the German whisperers and the course of Nature impelled it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009413481825">28</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>In the British view, young, educated middle-class Iraqis, collectively referred to as the <italic>effendiyya,</italic> had just enough education to make them dangerous to British interests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009413481825">29</xref></sup> The combination of an ultra-nationalist educational system, Axis influence and the economic hardships of the 1930s had turned the <italic>effendiyya</italic> into a potentially powerful force of opposition to British control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009413481825">30</xref></sup> The United States shared Britain’s concern about the destabilizing influence of Arab youth, issuing a January 1944 propaganda directive that stated: ‘One of the essential tasks of our propaganda to the Middle East is to try to win over the minds and hearts of youth in that area, especially the educated among them.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009413481825">31</xref></sup> Stark introduced the Brotherhood of Freedom as a means of addressing these concerns by building personal ties with Iraq’s youth.</p>
<p>First established in Egypt, the Brotherhood was organized on the model of the Arab secret societies of the early twentieth century, with numerous cells spread throughout the country. By 1943 the organization had dropped the façade of secrecy and counted over 7000 members in Iraq spread across 650 committees, including separate women’s organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009413481825">32</xref></sup> British influence over the Iraqi press ensured that the message of the Brotherhood was spread through the local newspapers, allowing its organizers to reach a wider audience beyond its formal membership. The daily newspaper <italic>al Akhbar</italic>, for example, frequently published speeches given by its British and Iraqi leaders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009413481825">33</xref></sup> The Brotherhood appropriated the Muthanna Club in Baghdad, a hotspot of Arab nationalist and pro-Axis sentiment among the <italic>effendiyya</italic> before 1941, as their new headquarters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009413481825">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Britain identified the decrepit Iraqi political system as the second main cause of the 1941 coup. Democracy had foundered in part because, in the opinion of British officials, Iraqis simply did not understand how the democratic system they had been given was supposed to function. As a result, Major Scaife, Stark’s successor as leader of the Brotherhood, suggested in 1943 that the organization’s focus should switch from fighting Axis influence to ‘education for citizenship’ as a means of remedying this deficiency. The purpose of the organization was primarily educative, and the Brotherhood’s democracy message fused the internationalist rhetoric of the war with local concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009413481825">35</xref></sup> On the one hand, it aimed to help Iraqis better understand the democratic principles on which their own constitution was based. At the same time, ‘The Society believed that by spreading understanding of democracy at home it is working for the application of democratic principles throughout the world.’ It hoped to promote ‘the principles of international co-operation in general,’ and better relations between the British and the Iraqis in particular. The Brotherhood’s main goal was to equip Iraqis to bring about change and promote democracy in their country, rather than suggesting specific remedies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009413481825">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The British were well aware that preaching democracy in the midst of an occupation was playing with fire. Britain enjoyed close and generally friendly relations with the government of Nuri al-Sa‘id, who served as prime minister from October 1941 until June 1944, yet this support came at a price. Nuri exemplified the status quo in Iraqi politics, and Stewart Perowne had warned in 1943 that ‘Iraqi youth feels largely that it is the victim of the old gang, the safe old stooges who do what the British want them to.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009413481825">37</xref></sup> Britain faced a dilemma; continued support for the ‘old gang’ would alienate the same youth the embassy hoped to win over through the Brotherhood of Freedom, yet by placing the tools of democracy in their hands the Brotherhood might undermine the authority of the government that was ensuring Iraqi cooperation in the war effort. Major Scaife reassured British officials that the group would serve as a ‘moderating influence’ on the agents of change and also equip future leaders knowledgeable in the working of democracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009413481825">38</xref></sup> As one Ministry of Information official noted, ‘We do see its dangers – namely that unless carefully handled it might develop into a kind of opposition movement to political regimes which hold their position by corruption. We think, however, that the risk is worth taking.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009413481825">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Brotherhood tried to limit this danger by keeping its definition of democracy purposefully vague. The organization was defined primarily by its opposition to fascism, and Freya Stark was adamant that her organization ‘apart from being democratic, is a non-political society.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009413481825">40</xref></sup> Stewart Perowne reassured critics by noting: ‘Discussion of internal politics is taboo.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009413481825">41</xref></sup> Vyvyan Holt, the Oriental Counsellor, saw the inherent flaw in this argument, and pointed out that an organization designed to promote democracy as a form of government could not, by definition, entirely avoid internal politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009413481825">42</xref></sup> The Publicity Section encouraged abstract discussions of democracy as a means of bolstering the war effort, but distanced itself from grassroots efforts to apply these ideals to local administration.</p>
<p>In August 1942, Ambassador Cornwallis called for cautious optimism about the political situation in Iraq, and predicted:<disp-quote>
<p>Thanks in some measure to the work of our Public Relations Department, there is evidence that at last a belief in the rightness of the principles of democracy is beginning to grow … provided the enemy can be kept from her frontiers, Iraq will now stand true to her alliance to the end of the war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009413481825">43</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The supporters of the Rashid ‘Ali coup had been forced into exile or interned, and pan-Arab nationalist sentiment quelled through censorship. At the same time, the Soviet Union’s alliance with Britain in 1941 after the German invasion opened the door for the revival of leftist political activity in Iraq, including the underground communist party.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009413481825">44</xref></sup> The British in Iraq became increasingly concerned not by the lingering threat posed by fascism, but by what it viewed as the far greater threat of communism.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union opened a legation in Baghdad in February 1944, and met a mixed response in Iraq. British officials reported that leftist intellectuals and underground communists were tripping over themselves trying to make contact with the new Soviet minister, but as one embassy official melodramatically explained, the ‘creeping shadow from the north’ elicited paranoid fear on the part of Iraq’s elite. The growing Soviet presence in neighboring Iran and fears of Soviet contacts with the Kurds meant that ‘the fevered imagination of the privileged detects a bearded Bolshevik peering round every corner.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009413481825">45</xref></sup> Britain’s wartime alliance with the Soviet Union complicated Britain’s democracy agenda. Wadie Jwaideh, an Iraqi historian who toured the Kurdish provinces of Iraq during the war through his work as an inspector of supply, observed that the Soviets and the British were selling the same message: ‘Both Soviet and Western propaganda denounced the Axis for enslaving and exploiting other nations, extolled political freedom and the self-determination of peoples, and promised the inevitable overthrow of the tyranny of the strong over the weak.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009413481825">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Soviet Union offered a new locus of political activity for those dissatisfied with the stagnant political situation in Iraq, and the communist threat galvanized the British push for real political reform. While concerned about Soviet infiltration, the British dismissed the influence of communism as a political ideology. They firmly believed that Iraqis did not really understand the precepts of communism and were only attracted to it as a means of protest against both the government in power and British intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009413481825">47</xref></sup> If they could address the general grievances of the country, such as concern about the economic impact of the war and the unresponsiveness of the Iraqi government, the communist menace would disappear. The <italic>effendiyya</italic> were seen as particularly susceptible to communist influence and a British Council official noted that the British would fight this new threat in the same way they had opposed fascism: ‘The reply to Communism is to preach sound democracy on the British pattern … The Effendi class should be able to find as great satisfaction in planning for social reform along orthodox democratic lines as they do for dabbling in Communism.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009413481825">48</xref></sup> Good governance, political reform, and civic education were the preferred antidotes to communist infiltration, and were vital to ensuring Britain’s long-term influence in Iraq.</p>
<p>By 1944 Iraq was awash in the rhetoric of democracy, and while Axis sympathies had been weakened, a host of new problems had been created. The establishment of so many British organizations under the guise of public relations did not escape the notice of the Iraqi public and added further fuel to the belief that the British were pulling the strings of the government. Newspapers and speeches mentioned by name the various British organizations trying to influence public opinion in order to expose the reach of the embassy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009413481825">49</xref></sup> Fahd, Secretary-General of the Iraqi Communist Party, issued a scathing critique of British influence in a 1944 speech. He targeted the many avenues of British influence in the country, from the Political Advisers in the provinces, to the print and broadcast propaganda, to the Brotherhood of Freedom, which claimed to be fighting Axis propaganda with democratic propaganda, but was in fact spreading British imperial propaganda instead. The staff of the various British Institutes spread throughout the country were ‘missionaries’ propagating new political ideas rather than religious ones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009413481825">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Personal relationships between the British and Iraqis were also suspect. Muhammad Hadid, an Iraqi politician and industrialist whose views were representative of Iraqi leftist reformers, noted that many of the new staff added to the embassy after the 1941 coup were ‘intellectuals’ with expertise in Arab affairs. Their democratic and leftist sympathies and social contacts with Iraqis helped them win the favor of young men who were attracted to Roosevelt’s declarations and the postwar promises of the Allies. The British Council and the embassy held parties and cultural events to which Iraqis were invited. The Iraqis, for their part, used these meetings to convey to the British how much the Iraqi people were suffering under the wartime conditions. The Iraqis attracted to Stark’s organization and meetings were, in Hadid’s estimation, merely British clients.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009413481825">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even Britain’s allies were alarmed by the reach of the Publicity Section. The American Legation went to great lengths to record the various facets of what it called the ‘British control apparatus … an elaborate apparatus composed of British nationals in the country which endeavors to safeguard British interests in practically every field of Iraqi national life and to direct trends of Iraqi internal and external policies into channels which will serve the well-being of the British Empire.’ Comparing its influence and reach to that of the British administration under the mandate, the legation lamented that it was ‘practically impossible’ to work with the Iraqi government without also coming into contact with a British adviser.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009413481825">52</xref></sup> The irony of Britain’s publicity blitz was that, while ostensibly instituted to sell the message of democracy and win support for the war effort, it was viewed locally as a weak cover for British control and surveillance over all aspects of Iraqi life. The wide reach of these institutions ultimately undermined the effectiveness of their message.</p>
<p>The embassy’s efforts to promote a vague vision of democracy while limiting local application also backfired. Publication of the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Declaration raised both local expectations and uncomfortable questions. Whatever Roosevelt and Churchill’s original intentions for the charter might have been, its principles were soon appropriated by a number of states in the fight against imperial intervention, most notably Article 3 which states that Britain and the United States ‘respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009413481825">53</xref></sup> Iraqi leaders, having learned the lessons of the First World War when the Arabs were effectively shut out of postwar negotiations, were determined to avoid a repeat performance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009413481825">54</xref></sup> The earlier experience and the disappointment that resulted from unfulfilled expectations shaped the ways in which Iraqi politicians and intellectuals used the declarations of the later conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009413481825">55</xref></sup> For example, Dr. Fadhil al-Jamali, a prominent Iraqi educator and politician, wrote in a secret memo presented to the American Legation during the war that:<disp-quote>
<p>The Arabs were deeply disappointed by the breach of promise by the Allies after the last World War. The nationalist hope did not materialize; no Arab unity; Palestine promised to the Jews; Syria cut to pieces; Iraq under mandate. President Wilson’s promise of self-determination was thrown in the waste-basket.</p></disp-quote>Yet he ended the memo by stating: ‘It is my sincere hope that the Atlantic Charter will have its true spirit applied to the Arabs and I pray that the Allies will not repeat the mistakes committed during the last war.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009413481825">56</xref></sup> The Second World War provided the Arabs with an opportunity to hold the western powers accountable for the promises made and broken during the earlier conflict.</p>
<p>The influence of Allied rhetoric is most evident in the debate surrounding the Iraqi declaration of war against the Axis Powers in January 1943. A group of deputies raised the issue in November 1942, noting that one of the best ways for the Arabs to achieve their goals of independence would be for Iraq to adhere to the principles of the Atlantic Charter and thereby secure her seat at the peace conference.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009413481825">57</xref></sup> Prime Minister Nuri al-Sa‘id, in a memorandum on this topic, argued that Iraq was a democratic state, whose roots had been weakened by Axis intrigue. The principles of the Atlantic Charter, the second and third articles in particular, ‘light the way before the Arabs’ and hold the promise of a cure to problems that ail them. The subsequent United Nations Declaration stipulated that all countries that provided support to the war effort could be included in its provisions. Based on these two declarations, it was in Iraq’s interest to support her British ally by declaring war. However, Iraq’s obligations would not exceed the responsibilities stipulated in the Anglo–Iraqi Treaty or the League of Nations charter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0022009413481825">58</xref></sup> The official decision of the Cabinet to declare war on the Axis Powers was based on a similar premise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0022009413481825">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>The British did not expect Iraq’s declaration to have much effect on the actual prosecution of the war, but as Cornwallis noted, it was symbolically quite significant:<disp-quote>
<p>For the first time in history an independent Moslem state entirely on its own free initiative has declared war as Ally of Great Britain thereby setting example to the whole Moslem and Arab world by coming down unequivocally on our side.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0022009413481825">60</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The Publicity Section made much of the Iraqi declaration, widely distributing posters and postcards displaying the flags of the United Nations, with the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union prominently displayed up front, and Iraq among the many nations arrayed in a long line behind them. [See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022009413481825">Figure 2</xref>] Yet the British grew increasingly alarmed at rising Iraqi expectations as to the benefits to be reaped from this declaration, an attitude perhaps best summed up by a headline in <italic>al Akhbar</italic> proclaiming that the declaration of war earned Iraq ‘our place in the sun.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0022009413481825">61</xref></sup> Rather than a solemn obligation demanding great sacrifice, Nuri al-Sa‘id treated it as a quid pro quo. Embassy officials acknowledged that Nuri needed to emphasize the potential benefits of a declaration of war to win cabinet support, but they were dismayed when he took a similar line in his correspondence with Churchill:<disp-quote>
<p>We are certain that you and President Roosevelt the authors of the Atlantic Charter will not fail to find a way for the United Nations to secure this for the Arabs, [i.e. the independence of Arab countries] which are not yet free.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0022009413481825">62</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>
Nuri’s vision extended beyond Iraq’s borders, and he used the language of the charter to rally support for the independence of Syria, Lebanon and Palestine and for his Arab unity project, which would culminate in the founding of the Arab League in 1945.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0022009413481825">63</xref></sup>

</p>
<p>Leftist groups also appropriated the language of the Atlantic Charter, often in ways that proved to be uncomfortable for the Iraqi government itself. This stance was most forcefully held by the moderate leftist Ahali group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0022009413481825">64</xref></sup> Democracy was an important cornerstone of the Ahali group’s platform well back into the 1930s, and one of its founders later defined its core principle of <italic>al-sha‘biyya</italic>, or ‘populism,’ as ‘A political and social movement which believed in the ability of democracy to improve the general conditions of the population, seeking to achieve a form of national sovereignty which would bring about the political and economic independence of Iraq.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0022009413481825">65</xref></sup> The Ahali group’s ideology was shaped by a variety of forces, including the British Fabian Society, Marxism, early socialist organizations in the Arab world, Egyptian political thought and the Indian independence movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0022009413481825">66</xref></sup> Their newspaper, suppressed in the late 1930s, was revived in 1942 and published under the new title <italic>Sawt al-Ahali</italic>, or ‘Voice of the People.’ Taking advantage of the loosening of government controls on the press in 1944, it soon became an influential advocate for government reform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0022009413481825">67</xref></sup> This newspaper was of interest to the embassy because its target readership, which the American Legation described as ‘the working class and young intellectuals,’ included the same Iraqis, the <italic>effendiyya</italic>, which were the focus of the Brotherhood of Freedom and the democracy campaign, and its complex relationship with Iraqi communists made it suspect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0022009413481825">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Iraqi government used the Atlantic Charter as a call for self-determination, but the Ahali group’s appropriation of this text was more complex. It clearly linked the self-determination promised in the charter with real democracy at home and used the Allied rhetoric to criticize both the Iraqi government and, by implication, the British occupation that was supporting it. In an August 1944 editorial the paper argued that by adhering to the charter and joining the United Nations through its declaration of war, Iraq became beholden to the standards embedded in these documents. The government had an obligation to improve the general public’s standard of living as well as opening up the political system to democratic reform. Failure to do so would mean violating both international responsibilities and the government’s duties to the people. The editorial challenged the Iraqi government to demonstrate that it adhered to the Atlantic Charter in word and spirit, as well as in form.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0022009413481825">69</xref></sup> A later editorial warned all colonized people, once freed from exploitation by colonial powers, not to fall to a new form of abuse at the hands of their own politicians, exchanging imperial despotism for a more local variety.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0022009413481825">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the Ahali group, democracy and self-determination were mutually reinforcing concepts, and an open political system was impossible in a country experiencing foreign occupation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0022009413481825">71</xref></sup> While Article 3 of the Atlantic Charter does not explicitly use the term ‘democracy,’ only in a democratic system, where sovereignty resided in the people, could they be truly free to determine their own form of government as the charter promised. The paper repeatedly warned that the limitations on democratic freedoms imposed in the name of the war effort not only contradicted the public declarations of the Allies but also undermined the very cause for which the Allies were fighting. People who had experienced true democratic freedoms were more likely to fight to protect them and oppose any regime that tried to take them away. Democratic freedoms were enshrined in the Iraqi constitution, and yet the people had not had the opportunity to put them into practice. How could those who had never truly experienced democracy be asked to sacrifice to preserve it?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0022009413481825">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>The influence of the Atlantic Charter in Iraq extended beyond government circles and the Baghdad intellectuals represented by the Ahali group. Two Shiite leaders in the southern city of Najaf, in discussions with American Minister Loy Henderson, expressed their hopes that the United States would ensure the application of the Atlantic Charter to the case of Palestine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0022009413481825">73</xref></sup> To the north, Kurdish nationalists incorporated this internationalist rhetoric into their numerous petitions to the great powers calling for the redress of their grievances against the governments of Iraq, Iran and Turkey.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0022009413481825">74</xref></sup> A January 1946 petition from the Rizgare Kurd Party of Iraq turned the promises of the Atlantic Charter into a threat:<disp-quote>
<p>If the great nations gave the brilliant promises to the small nations in their hour of distress in order to leave those promises ink on paper and forget them subsequently in the ecstasy of victory, the small nations will not give them up but will take them as a legal concession for claiming their rights.</p></disp-quote>Like the Ahali group, the Rizgare Kurd party explicitly made the link between self-determination and democracy and viewed political reform in Iraq as a vital first step to the realization of Kurdish aspirations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0022009413481825">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>The approaching end of the war raised expectations for the fulfillment of all of the ideals embedded in the Allied declarations, yet Iraq’s attempts to hold the British accountable for their wartime promises were disappointed, both locally and at the international level. Numerous <italic>Sawt al-Ahali</italic> editorials in the spring and summer of 1945 focused on the San Francisco Conference and the failure of the great powers to deliver on their promise of post-war self-determination. For Iraq, the issue was not just local but also part of the larger Arab question, encompassing the future of Palestine, Syria and Lebanon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0022009413481825">76</xref></sup> <italic>Sawt al-Ahali</italic> traced the genealogy of colonized peoples’ post-war expectations for self-determination, starting with the Atlantic Charter, reasserted in the United Nations Declaration, and then ignored at Dumbarton Oaks and only addressed at the San Francisco Conference in the context of trusteeship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0022009413481825">77</xref></sup> The paper pointed out the hypocrisy of the trusteeship plan, with the great powers setting conditions on the suitability of territories for self government that would be exploited in the interests of the imperial powers, contradicting the principles for which the war was fought. It warned that the failure to address the issue of imperialism would undermine the goals of the new United Nations as a means of guarding peace and security and avoiding future wars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0022009413481825">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both British and American observers recognized the danger of these unrealized hopes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0022009413481825">79</xref></sup> As with the Wilsonian rhetoric of the First World War, the Allies’ wartime declarations created local expectations that the British were ultimately unwilling or unable to meet. By explicitly tying the declaration of war to the Atlantic Charter, Iraq created powerful ammunition for its postwar demands for treaty revision and an end to British influence. Iraq acted on these demands when, in March 1946, Iraqi Prime Minister Tawfiq Suwaydi raised the issue of revising the Anglo–Iraqi Treaty with the British ambassador ‘so as to make the existing alliance a normal one befitting progress made by Iraq and in harmony with world developments within the spirit of the United Nations Charter.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0022009413481825">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>The limitations of Britain’s commitment to Iraqi democracy became increasingly apparent in the immediate postwar period. In November 1945 the underground communist party in Iraq circulated a memorandum to the government and the embassies of the great powers calling on them to follow through on wartime promises. The Iraqi government tried to project the image of a democratic, constitutional state to the other Arab states and the world at large in the international conferences. Iraqis supported the Allied war effort in the hopes that they would receive the freedoms promised by Roosevelt and Churchill, as well as the Iraqi government, once the Axis Powers were defeated. Yet the war had ended, the emergency laws remained in place, communists were targeted for harassment and imprisonment, and the Iraqi people as a whole were denied basic freedoms such as the right to form political parties and a free press. The memo attacked the British for supporting a repressive government and using the war effort as an excuse to exploit Iraq, in violation of her wartime promises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0022009413481825">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>Leftist critiques of British support for the ‘old gang’ of Iraqi politicians and its continued abuse of wartime controls highlight the fundamental dilemma for any occupying power attempting to establish democratic government. Iraqis of various political stripes viewed the British occupation as the main culprit behind Iraq’s diseased political system and the clear solution was an end to British intervention. The British agreed that democratic reform was vital but their main goal was protecting their long-term interests in the country. Imposed democracy required a high level of intervention and ran the risk of alienating the population, further weakening support for the occupation, and harming Britain’s war effort in the region. One embassy official posed the question in a different way shortly after the 1941 coup, namely whether it was in British interests to have a well-run Iraq or a friendly Iraq. A well-run Iraq, ‘where all men are equal before the law, where officials serve the public and not their own interests, where economic resources are developed and trains run to time’ would require greater British intervention in day-to-day administration. This official believed that Britain could run the country better than the Iraqis themselves, but this did not necessarily mean that ‘Iraq is going to be contented and we beloved … However antisocial it may be, the right of a country to go to the devil in its own way (more commonly known as “independence”) is a powerful fetish.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0022009413481825">82</xref></sup> The British ultimately decided that, given the requirements of the war effort, a friendly Iraq was more valuable, and they were willing to accept the inefficient and often corrupt Iraqi state, with all of the dangers this posed to Britain’s long-term interests. It was not just a question of will, but one of resources. They were hampered by the larger realities of the war and the need for troops elsewhere, which necessitated holding Iraq with minimal British forces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0022009413481825">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>This attitude shaped Britain’s response to the reintroduction of political parties after the war. In a December 1945 speech the Regent asserted Iraq’s identity as an independent, democratic monarchy and issued a call for the formation of political parties to pursue an agenda of social reform and justice and ensure equality for all Iraqis. The Regent also specifically targeted Iraq’s youth, calling on the country’s leaders to allow the next generation to bear part of the burden of governance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0022009413481825">84</xref></sup> While skeptical of the effectiveness of political parties, the embassy supported their development as a means of achieving a number of objectives at once by addressing Iraqi frustrations with the political status quo. Parties had the potential to bring fresh faces into Iraqi politics, limit the Regent’s influence, undermine communist critiques of the British-backed system, and open the door for real social reform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0022009413481825">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>The new government of Tawfiq al-Suwaydi, formed after the Regent’s speech, instituted significant reforms, including the release of the Iraqis held in detention, a lifting of marshal law and an end to press censorship. Five political parties were founded in early 1946, the most influential being the National Democratic Party (NDP), the latest manifestation of the Ahali group, and Hizb al-Istiqlal, comprised of the pan-Arabists released from detention with the end of the war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0022009413481825">86</xref></sup> The NDP’s party program codified many of the long standing goals of the Ahali group dating back to the 1930s, envisioning the transformation of Iraq ‘from its underdeveloped state into a modern democratic nation.’ In the political realm the party called for the formation of a democratic parliamentary system with the government responsible to an elected assembly, a direct electoral system, and support for democratic freedoms, as well as protection of personal freedoms and economic justice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0022009413481825">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>The British admitted that there was much to admire in the NDP’s platform for internal reform but its foreign policy priorities, including complete independence for Iraq and other Arab states, and opposition to the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, proved problematic. Douglas Busk, an embassy official observed, ‘We are thus faced by the alternative between a Conservative Prime Minister indulging in repressive measures of which we heartily disapprove and progressives whose programme, while in some ways admirable, is basically fatal.’ He suggested that they encourage the formation of a new party to be led by an experienced Iraqi politician that ‘while advocating reform, would also be in favour of the British connexion.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0022009413481825">88</xref></sup> Other officials added to the list of desiderata: the ideal candidate would be a ‘moderate, youngish leader’ with administrative experience, perhaps to be found languishing in the provinces as a Mutassarif, waiting to be plucked out of obscurity and ensconced in the new cabinet in Baghdad.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0022009413481825">89</xref></sup> Busk optimistically believed that it would be ‘perfectly easy’ to form a new party that would meet Britain’s requirements while also attracting the support of ‘younger Iraqis who are only awaiting a lead’ as well as the tribes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0022009413481825">90</xref></sup> All they needed was a leader who would appeal to the younger generation and advocate reform at home while maintaining a pro-British attitude in foreign affairs.</p>
<p>In the end, this ideal candidate proved elusive, and Britain once again reverted to supporting the ‘old gang.’ The lingering question, as Muhammad Hadid stated in a 1946 memo presented to the embassy, was: ‘what is the position of Britain in this conflict which is going on in Iraq between the progressive elements composed of the young generation, and the reactionary forces composed of the old generation?’ Britain’s influence in Iraq increased during the war and as a result:<disp-quote>
<p>the general opinion is that Britain has something to do with every major event in Iraq. If the country has remained backward, or if its general standard of life is terribly low, or if things were going wrong, the most accepted reason among the public is that British policy positively wants it to be so, or else, because British support of the present regime has negatively prevented matters to be otherwise. In the present situation, the British are believed to support the reaction by ruling class against progressive reforms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0022009413481825">91</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The American Legation made similar observations. Britain cracked down on any officials demonstrating anti-British sentiment, but remained silent when its supporters engaged in corruption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0022009413481825">92</xref></sup> The demands of the occupation thereby undermined the very democracy Britain claimed to promote.</p>
<p>The wartime campaigns for democracy and self-determination proved highly problematic for both the British and the Iraqi government. Anti-British sentiment and demonstrations increased in the postwar period, and the debate about treaty revision set in motion a series of negotiations that would culminate in the disastrous 1948 Portsmouth Treaty and widespread anti-British riots.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0022009413481825">93</xref></sup> The opening of Iraqi politics to parties and opposition held promise, and a number of younger politicians, including Muhammad Hadid of the NDP, were included in Suwaydi’s cabinet. The Regent developed cold feet, however, and in May 1946, after only three months in power, Suwaydi’s government was replaced by the repressive regime of Arshad al-‘Umari. The postwar ‘democratic moment’ in Iraq ended as abruptly as it had started.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0022009413481825">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>Upon leaving Iraq in March 1945, Ambassador Cornwallis noted that he had had three main tasks after the 1941 coup: to secure Britain’s wartime requirements, purge Iraq of pro-Nazi sympathizers and shape public opinion in favor of the Allies. He also had an unofficial fourth task, ‘to influence the administration as far as possible, but not to the extent of causing a crisis’ which might threaten the other, more important aims. By all accounts he achieved the first three tasks, but the fourth goal, governmental reform, proved more elusive and, in the long term, destructive to British interests in Iraq. By failing to reform the Iraqi administration, the British were blamed for all of its shortcomings. Cornwallis rejected these charges: ‘The real trouble lies not with us, but with the rulers themselves, who obstinately refuse to give up any of their privileges or prerogatives to others.’ As for Iraq’s youth, the Ambassador dismissed them as ‘a generation of Hamlets.’ To the end, Cornwallis denied any intervention in Iraqi internal affairs, noting that ‘in a war in which so many frontiers have been obliterated we have held these inviolate without ever, even after 1941, encroaching on Iraq’s internal independence.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0022009413481825">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>Iraqi opposition figures saw the case differently. The Iraqi historical narrative presents the war as a time when great promises were made and subsequently broken. Muhammad Hadid, whose views are representative, observed that during the Second World War ‘security laws and regulations limited political activities, but at the same time a great political consciousness was aroused, particularly among young men, by the stream of declarations from the Allied countries about the better life which was to come if democratic forces were to win the war.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0022009413481825">96</xref></sup> The democracy campaign was driven partly by the wartime rhetoric but also by the lessons Iraqi intellectuals drew from their own recent history. The mandate had left Iraq with a democratic form of government on paper, but without the institutions to implement it in practice. The period of coups, political instability and Axis influence that followed convinced them that democracy in form but not function was worthless. A fundamental weakness of Britain’s democracy campaign, not only in Iraq but the larger Arab world as well, was that its interests were closely tied to the preservation in power of reactionary leaders who stifled political reform, and as a result the ideals of democracy were repeatedly sacrificed on the altar of Britain’s long-term strategic interests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0022009413481825">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is easy to dismiss these democracy debates and calls for political reform in wartime Iraq as mere words, exemplifying the disconnect between lofty rhetoric and <italic>realpolitik</italic>. And it is easy to dismiss Allied wartime declarations such as the Atlantic Charter as opportunistic statements merely designed to achieve the short-term goals of the war effort. The ‘Second British Occupation’ of Iraq, however, is just one case study among many that highlights the role that this Allied wartime propaganda played in postwar decolonization, demonstrating that propaganda has often unintended consequences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0022009413481825">98</xref></sup> The yawning gap that emerged between the wartime rhetoric of the Allies and Britain’s policies in Iraq provided space for a galvanized opposition to emerge. Iraq was certainly not alone in this truly international phenomenon; Elizabeth Borgwardt notes in her comments on the Dumbarton Oaks and San Francisco negotiations that the ‘gap between rhetoric and reality became an engine of change in its own right.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0022009413481825">99</xref></sup> This was just as true for the local level of the Iraqi experience as it was at the international level.</p>
<p>By the end of the war, despite the efforts of the Brotherhood of Freedom and the Publicity Section, Britain had clearly failed in its objective of appealing to young Iraqis, as the ‘old gang’ proved to be more cooperative to the British than the younger alternatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0022009413481825">100</xref></sup> A representative for the Ministry of Information defended the Brotherhood of Freedom as ‘a most valuable training ground for democratic procedure and political growth,’ yet he also warned: ‘Unless we can promote these last-named developments, we will indeed have won a war for the M. East, but at the same time have deprived ourselves of the fruits of our victory.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0022009413481825">101</xref></sup> In this particular case, Britain won the proverbial battle in Iraq, successfully keeping the country in the Allied camp, and yet lost the greater war, failing to win the hearts and minds of Iraq’s youth, at great long-term cost.</p>

<fn id="fn16-0022009413481825"><label>16</label><p>The 1942 print propaganda directive for Iraq reflects these priorities. Britain needed to convince Iraqis that Britain supported their aspirations and that ‘these aspirations can be fulfilled only if Britain maintains her own strength in the Middle East’ and that Britain was ‘Youth Conscious’ while at the same time pointing out German exploitation of its youth, noting that Hitler Youth was ‘designed solely to provide a large and docile supply of cannon fodder’ and ‘the Nazi youth Movement would break up the family and tribal life of Iraq.’ Overseas Planning Committee (OPC) Plan for Iraq, Working Schedule of Printed Matter, General Production Division, 28 Oct. 1942, Ministry of Information (INF) 2/38, TNA. Axis propaganda, by contrast, took the line that Britain’s promises of democracy were false, and that the Arabs could only achieve true freedom through an Axis victory. A May 1941 German propaganda directive set out the main propaganda line as: ‘A victory for the Axis … will bring about the liberation of the countries of the Middle East from the English yoke and thus realize their right to self-determination. Whoever loves freedom will, therefore, join the front against England.’ Quoted in Herf, <italic>Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World</italic>, 3. Haj Amin al-Husseini, writing to Hitler from Iraq in January 1941 stated: ‘England, that relentless and crafty enemy of the true liberty of peoples, has never tired of forging chains to enslave the Arab people, sometimes in the name of the perfidious League of Nations and sometimes by flaunting false and hypocritical sentiments of humanity for the others, but always in truth, for the most imperialistic designs camouflaged by the principles of democracy and of a mendacious internationalism.’ Quoted in Herf, <italic>Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World</italic>, 55. Britain, then, faced the challenge of winning the trust of Iraqis and convincing them of Britain’s commitment to fostering democracy in the country.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn17-0022009413481825"><label>17</label><p>British officials at the Publicity Section drew careful distinctions between publicity and propaganda. As historian Philip Taylor defines these terms: ‘Publicity may therefore be defined as the supply or release of information of a factual nature which is designed to provide the public in general with an opportunity for each individual member to formulate opinions for himself and to act according to his own conscience’ whereas ‘Propaganda can be defined as an attempt to influence the attitudes of a specific audience, through the use of facts, fiction, argument or suggestion – often supported by the suppression of inconsistent material – with the calculated purpose of instilling in the recipient certain beliefs, values or convictions which will serve the interests of the author, usually by producing a desired line of action.’ P. Taylor, <italic>The Projection of Britain: British overseas publicity and propaganda 1919–1939</italic> (Cambridge 1981), 4–5. As Taylor notes, British overseas propaganda was geared towards educated, influential audiences rather than the masses. Publicity was more effective in reaching this targeted audience than outright propaganda. Taylor, <italic>The Projection of Britain</italic>, 3.

Herf notes that ‘Nazi broadcast stressed affinities between what they called the “values of Islam” and those of National Socialism. Both, for example, favored piety, obedience, community, unity rather than skepticism, individualism, and division.’ Herf, <italic>Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World</italic>, 45. Herf describes a June 1942 Italian Arabic-language broadcast titled ‘Islam and Anglo-Saxon Democracy’ that built on this theme: ‘Democracy was “a sweet word” that the Anglo-Saxons repeated to convince Arabs to believe that Britain was “a traditional friend of the Arabs” and that British democracy was “similar to Islamic democracy.” Yet “the British are liars when they say this, as Islamic democracy is based on justice, equality and fraternity and not on oppression, tyranny and exploitation.” There was a “great difference between false democracy and the democracy of our great leader Mohammed whose armies conquered the world and made everyone equal …. Islam was not only a democracy but also admitted a dictatorship based on justice and equality.”’ Herf, <italic>Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World</italic>, 109.</p></fn>

Wien also warns that the British and American diplomatic records labeled as ‘fascist’ ideas that had a much more complex genealogy. Wien, <italic>Iraqi Arab Nationalism</italic>, 3. Wien highlights the concept of generational conflict as a means of understanding this period in Iraqi history. The formative experience for the Sherifians, military officers who came to power in Iraq during the mandate period, was their experience at the Ottoman military schools and in the First World War. Over time they were viewed as the reactionary, status quo forces in the country, against which a younger generation, formed in the pan-Arab nationalist environment of Iraqi education in the interwar period and attracted to authoritarian models due to the failure of liberalism in Iraq, revolted between 1936–41 in the cycle of coups that culminated in the events of April–May 1941.

The third class … consists of the junior Army officers.’ The embassy already had close ties with the first group, and the Military Mission maintained contact with the third, so the real focus of concern was the second group. Stonehewer-Bird to Bevin, 10 March 1947, FO371/61538, TNA. Eppel notes that while the <italic>effendiyya</italic> are often described as the ‘new middle class,’ the designation ‘had less to do with economic status and social origins, than with education, culture, style of dress, and Westernized behavior.’ Eppel, ‘The Elite, the Effendiyya, and the Growth of Nationalism’, 231.</p></fn>

They are also very nationalistic and idealistic, and are amenable to propaganda which plays upon their national pride.’ In order to appeal to Arab youth, the directive recommended emphasizing Nazi exploitation of youth in occupied territories as contrasted with the freedoms enjoyed by youth in Allied territories, and highlighting the ways in which Allied declarations such as the Atlantic Charter provided opportunities for youth to assume new responsibilities in the postwar period.</p></fn>

Members of the Publicity Section wrote many of these articles themselves. Spring 1944 saw a round of articles on the theme of democracy, many of them publicizing the work of the Brotherhood of Freedom. For example, lawyer Najib al Rawi gave a lecture entitled ‘The Nature of Democracy’ at the Brotherhood of Freedom’s club in Baghdad in which he pointed to the ‘new world’ that would emerge with the victory of the democratic powers. He used the classic definition of democratic government as a government of the people, with the caveat that the level of participation of the people in government would vary depending on the material conditions of the country. <italic>Al Akhbar</italic>, (21 and 22 April 1944).

This wording became highly contested, as Churchill later argued that it only applied to war-torn Europe whereas Roosevelt viewed it as global in scope. The technicalities of the wording of Article III could be read to exclude Britain’s formal empire, but the Labour party viewed the Atlantic Charter in broader terms, applying its mandate to the whole world. Louis, <italic>Imperialism at Bay</italic>, 123–6. The countries of the informal empire such as Iraq, which had treaty relations with Britain but was formally an independent, sovereign state despite Britain’s renewed post-1941 presence, occupied a grey area. In its appropriation of the Atlantic Charter to call for an end to British imperial control, Iraq was part of a much larger international movement. Nelson Mandela later wrote: ‘Some in the West saw the [Atlantic] Charter as empty promises, but not those of us in Africa. Inspired by the Atlantic Charter and the fight of the Allies against tyranny and oppression, the ANC created its own Charter … We hoped that the government and ordinary South Africans would see that the principles they were fighting for in Europe were the same ones we were advocating at home.’ Mandela, <italic>Long Walk to Freedom</italic>, quoted in Borgwardt, <italic>New Deal for the World</italic>, 29. For wartime debates about the charter’s applicability to India, Indochina and the French colonies, see W. Kimball, ‘The Atlantic Charter: “With All Deliberate Speed”,’ in D. Brinkley and D.R. Facey-Crowther (eds),<italic> The Atlantic Charter</italic> (New York 1994), 83–114.

Majid Khadduri provides an interesting character sketch of Chadirchi in M. Khadduri, <italic>Arab Contemporaries: The Role of Personalities in Politics</italic> (Baltimore, MD 1973). While Chadirchi claimed to be a moderate leftist, he was often accused of being a communist, a point discussed at length in the American Legation documents. Many of the splits within the Ahali group occurred between members who pushed for a more pro-communist line and others, like Chadirchi, who supported a moderate stance.

As Amin notes, the definition of <italic>al-sha‘biyya</italic> was fluid but was based on the general principles of constitutional democracy and socialism: ‘the state must control the economy and the organisation of society, while the state in its turn must be controlled by democratic forces.’ Amin, ‘Jama‘at al-Ahali’, 120. Chadirchi, in the first issue of the revived newspaper, emphasized the sense of continuity between the revived group and its predecessor: ‘We do not want today anything different from what we wanted yesterday: we seek to achieve an order based on equality of rights and responsibilities for all, to create a space for people to express their opinions and participate in government.’ <italic>Sawt al-Ahali</italic> (23 September 1942) reprinted in Jamil, <italic>Al-Hayat al-Niyabiyya fi’l ‘Iraq</italic>, 355.

<fn id="fn67-0022009413481825"><label>67</label><p>One must be cautious in using wartime Iraqi newspapers as sources because they were highly circumscribed in what they could publish due to censorship and the wartime emergency laws, and the fact that the British embassy was very successful in planting its material in the local press. Despite these limitations, <italic>Sawt al-Ahali</italic> was able to take a more independent line than most of its rivals. The American Military Attaché described it as ‘a good, honest paper.’ The editor, Chadirchi, had an independent income and therefore ‘is said to be one of the few editors who does not let himself be influenced by subsidies, and he does not kow-tow to the government or any other agency.’ A. Roosevelt, American Military Attaché, Baghdad, ‘An Outline of the Press in Iraq,’ report no. 337, 17 August 1944, Box 15, RG84, NACPM. At the same time, Amin notes that Chadirchi and Hadid consciously drew the newspaper back toward the political center, moderating their critique of the government so as to avoid government persecution and to attract the widest readership possible. Amin, ‘Jama‘at al-Ahali’, 354. As with all other Iraqi Arabic newspapers, <italic>Sawt al-Ahali</italic>’s wartime circulation was limited to between 1000–2000 due to restrictions on newsprint supplies. The American Legation believed that if it were not for these limits the paper would have had a much larger circulation given its popularity and that its influence on Iraqi thought extended well beyond what was indicated by its circulation numbers.

Muhammad Hadid was himself put forward by the British as a possible ideal candidate to lead this hypothetical party, as he had studied at the London School of Economics, was ‘consistently friendly to the British connection,’ and was ‘the first of the young “intellectuals” to attain Cabinet rank. He holds what in England would be accounted moderately progressive views.’ He was also extremely rich, which in the embassy’s estimation made it less likely that he had ties to the communists.

Albert Hourani had issued a similar warning in 1943: ‘the Government’s inability to last a day without the approval of Great Britain’ meant that all problems were blamed on Britain. If Britain stepped back and allowed a ‘social revolution’ to take place, a more responsive government would probably come to power and address some of the grievances of the local population. Yet this would also pose serious short-term risks: reform brought the threat of unrest and instability, while collaboration with Nuri and the ‘old gang’ offered immediate stability and cooperation in wartime.

<fn id="fn97-0022009413481825"><label>97</label><p>Dawisha reminds us that Britain’s support for a parliamentary democracy in Iraq was not ‘mere lip service. As an old and distinguished democracy itself Britain no doubt genuinely desired to create states in its own image.’ At the same time, ‘Britain’s predicament was how to reconcile its repeated assertions on its preference for democracy with its need to preserve its interests through a centralizing political authority, over which it would retain significant influence.’ Dawisha, <italic>Iraq: A Political History</italic>, 13–4.</p></fn>

As Daniel Rodgers stated in his study of keywords in American politics, ‘Let enough persons repeat a cant phrase (all men are created equal, for example), and there is a chance that they will suddenly charge the words with new meaning … That is one of the reasons why the cant phrases are important … They are all double-edged, profoundly radical or profoundly conservative, depending on who has hold of them.’ D.T.

<fn id="fn100-0022009413481825"><label>100</label><p>Britain’s ongoing frustration with its inability to reach Arab youth is evident in the extensive correspondence generated by Bevin’s January 1947 request for information from the various posts in the Middle East on how to address the ‘problem’ of the <italic>effendiyya</italic>. While each post responded with an assessment of the status of the <italic>effendiyya</italic> in the local context, there were, as K.C. Buss of the Research Department observed, few practical suggestions because ‘The “effendi” class–however we define it–is almost unapproachable, owing to the total lack of common interests between it and any class of Britishers abroad.’ Minute by K.C. Buss, 17 April 1947, FO 371/61538; for Bevin’s original request see Bevin to Eyres (Damascus), 15 January 1947, FO 371/52365, TNA.
