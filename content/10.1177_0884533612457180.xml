<abstract>
<p>Nutrition management of patients undergoing a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) can be challenging. Fluid, macronutrient, and micronutrient needs are often altered due to a variety of therapy-associated complications and changes in metabolism. Sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS) is a complication characterized by fluid retention, ascites, and painful hepatomegaly that may complicate provision of adequate nutrition to HSCT patients. The nutrition implications and interventions in a patient who developed SOS following an allogeneic matched unrelated donor (Allo/MUD) HSCT are reviewed in the case report.</p>

<p>Sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS), formerly called veno-occlusive disease (VOD), is a relatively common and high-risk complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612457180">1</xref></sup> The syndrome is characterized by hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, weight gain, ascites, and painful hepatomegaly that develops within approximately 10–20 days after the start of cyclophosphamide-based cytoreductive therapy and later after other myeloablative regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612457180">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612457180">Table 1</xref>). Symptoms are related to the narrowing and occlusion of hepatic venules, sinusoidal fibrosis, and hepatocyte necrosis as a result of chemotherapy toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612457180">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612457180">4</xref></sup> The incidence of SOS varies from ~5%–60% and is more common after allogeneic HSCT than after autologous HSCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612457180">5</xref></sup> The incidence has decreased in the recent past likely due to the changes in dose intensity, types of conditioning regimens, and a better management of risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612457180">6</xref></sup> Severe SOS is associated with a mortality rate &gt;80% on day 100 post-HSCT and is most frequently linked with hepatorenal syndrome and progression to multiorgan failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612457180">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>Identification of SOS is based on clinical signs and symptoms, after excluding other conditions that can mimic the disease such as viral infections, graft vs host disease (GVHD), other drug toxicities, and sepsis. A Doppler ultrasound may be performed to help identify hepatomegaly, ascites, and periportal edema and exclude biliary obstruction or liver abscess.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612457180">6</xref></sup> Although a liver biopsy is the most accurate diagnostic test for diagnosing SOS, the procedure can be potentially life-threatening in patients with thrombocytopenia or severe ascites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612457180">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>A variety of risk factors associated with developing SOS after HSCT have been reported. Positive predictors for SOS include the dose intensity and combination of chemotherapy used for conditioning therapy, the pharmacokinetics of some medications used for conditioning therapy, and the dose intensity and delivery of total body irradiation (TBI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612457180">8</xref></sup> Factors that increase the risk of severe sinusoidal liver injury include preexisting extensive hepatic fibrosis, viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic or alcoholic hepatitis, myelofibrosis with extramedullar hematopoiesis, recent treatment with gemtuzumab, or a previous history of SOS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612457180">6</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0884533612457180">
<title>Treatment</title>
<p>Currently, there is no proven effective therapy for either prevention or treatment of SOS. Treatment is mainly supportive and consists of diuresis, sodium restriction, renal replacement therapy, analgesia, and therapeutic paracentesis for discomfort or shortness of breath.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612457180">9</xref></sup> Heparin, ursodeoxycholic acid, and prostaglandin E1 have been investigated as potential treatments with inconsistent results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612457180">6</xref></sup> Defibrotide (Gentium, Como, Italy), a medicine with antithrombotic, anti-ischemic, and anti-inflammatory activity, has been associated with reduced incidence of SOS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612457180">5</xref></sup> The mechanism of action of Defibrotide in the treatment of SOS is not known, but some studies have shown benefit in SOS prevention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612457180">2</xref></sup> Currently, Defibrotide is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use outside of a research study.</p>
<p>Sodium and fluid restriction is vital in the management of SOS. Nutrition support volume, medication volume, and sodium intake should be minimized to help reduce fluid retention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612457180">8</xref></sup> For patients who are eating, dietary sodium restriction may be beneficial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612457180">8</xref></sup> Specific guidelines for sodium restriction in the presence of SOS do not exist; however, clinical judgment should determine the most appropriate intervention. Historically, parenteral nutrition (PN) has been the primary route of nutrition support for this patient population, but as research and advances in medical management have evolved over the past several years, use of PN has markedly decreased in favor of enteral nutrition (EN).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612457180">10</xref></sup> EN has been shown to decrease the risk of hyperglycemia, which is common in this patient population due to the frequency of corticosteroid use, when compared with PN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612457180">10</xref></sup> Research also suggests that early enteral feeding following HSCT is associated with less GVHD and lower infection mortality at 100 days post-HSCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612457180">10</xref></sup> In the presence of SOS, nutrition support should be assessed to minimize the risk of overfeeding, and macronutrients should be distributed in favor of decreased dextrose load, if possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612457180">11</xref></sup> Triglyceride levels should be monitored regularly while patients are receiving PN solutions containing lipids. When serum triglyceride levels exceed 400 mg/dL, it is recommended to decrease or discontinue the lipid infusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612457180">12</xref></sup> Although cycling the PN infusion may not improve liver function parameters, it may prevent exacerbation of the underlying problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612457180">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612457180">13</xref></sup> If hyperbilirubinemia persists longer than 1 week and the patient is receiving PN, copper and manganese should be discontinued to avoid accumulation of these elements, which are normally excreted through bile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612457180">13</xref></sup> Manganese toxicity can result in neurotoxicity, whereas copper toxicity causes gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612457180">8</xref></sup> When feasible, patients should be transitioned from PN to EN or an oral diet to help reduce stress on the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612457180">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533612457180">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Case Study</title>
<p>A 60-year-old Vietnamese man was admitted for an allogeneic matched unrelated donor (Allo/MUD) HSCT due to high-risk T-cell subtype acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Prior to admission, the patient completed induction therapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine, which brought the patient’s disease into first remission. Remission occurs when the patient’s blood counts return to normal and bone marrow samples show no sign of disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612457180">14</xref></sup> High-risk ALL patients are not likely cured with standard induction therapy alone and most often proceed to an allogeneic HSCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612457180">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612457180">15</xref></sup> The patient’s HSCT conditioning regimen included etoposide and cyclophosphamide followed by (TBI) 1000 cGy in 200-cGy fractions. Post-HSCT immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus and methotrexate (MTX) for prevention of GVHD. MTX was given on days 1, 3, and 6 post-HSCT. The patient experienced mild diarrhea, decreased appetite, and dysgeusia during the hospital course but was able to meet 85%–100% of his baseline needs with oral supplements and per oral (PO) intake at mealtimes. Upon engraftment, the patient was discharged home and was followed up by the care team in the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinic. The patient’s Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), which is a scoring system some clinicians use to measure quality of life, was 90% at the time of discharge. A KPS score runs from 100 to 0, where 100 is considered “perfect health” and 0 is death. A KPS of less than 40% is associated with poor survival rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612457180">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The patient was readmitted on day +73 after HSCT with a total bilirubin of 3.6 mg/dL. He also presented with elevated renal function labs (serum urea nitrogen, 35 mg/dL; creatinine [Cr], 2.1 mg/dL) and serum lactate dehydrogenase. Physical signs and symptoms included abdominal distention, ascites, and diarrhea. GVHD of the GI tract was not confirmed, but 60 mg methylprednisolone twice per day was initiated to treat suspected GVHD. A provisional diagnosis of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was determined, and the patient underwent plasma exchange therapy. A liver ultrasound was completed on day +77 showing hepatomegaly and ascites, which supported the diagnosis of SOS. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) therapy was initiated via a continuous intravenous infusion, and the pharmacist assisted in titrating up the PGE1 based on the continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring per hospital protocol. At this time, the patient’s renal function worsened, requiring continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD). During this admission, the highest serum urea nitrogen and Cr were 137 mg/dL and 3.1 mg/dL, respectively. Despite treatment with PGE1, the serum total bilirubin continued to rise. The medical team was able to enroll the patient in an existing research trial evaluating Defibrotide and its possible treatment effects for SOS. On day +85 status post-HSCT, Defibrotide therapy was initiated. By day +95 post-HSCT, CVVHD had to be discontinued due to difficulties with the patient’s labile BP. Additional clinical complications included refractory <italic>Candida krusei</italic> fungemia, refractory polymicrobial sepsis, and cytomegalovirus. The patient’s hepatic, renal, and pulmonary function continued to decline, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation was anticipated. After discussions between the family and the physician, the decision was made to withdraw care. The patient expired on day +99 with a bilirubin of 30.8 mg/dL.</p>

<title>Nutrition Management</title>
<p>During the first week of the second admission, the nutrition intervention focused on encouraging PO intake plus oral supplements. A general diet was ordered initially because his average intake was not adequate to warrant diet restrictions. As the patient’s clinical status worsened and PO intake fell below 50% of estimated needs, it was decided to initiate tube feedings via a nasogastric tube. Despite evidence of diarrhea and abdominal distention, EN was selected over PN because of the known decreased risk of hyperglycemia and infection with EN. The patient was experiencing a fluctuation of blood glucose levels due to high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Finger stick blood glucose measurements ranged from 86–261 mg/dL, and regular insulin was given according to a sliding scale per hospital protocol. A partially digested protein formula was selected that provided 1.3 kcal/mL, 67 g protein/L, and 79% added water. A more concentrated formula was desired, but the patient was expected to tolerate a partially digested formula better due to the mild GI symptoms (abdominal distention and diarrhea) he was experiencing. CVVHD kept the patient’s serum potassium and phosphorus within normal range, and therefore a renal formula was not indicated. Within 24 hours of initiation, the tube feeding volume was increased to meet the patient’s estimated needs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0884533612457180">Table 3</xref> for the patient’s assessed needs). Protein intake was optimized due to CVVHD therapy and corticosteroid therapy for GVHD prophylaxis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612457180">11</xref></sup> Tolerance to nutrition support was assessed regularly. Residuals remained less than 200 mL, and the patient maintained active bowel sounds. It was noted that at one point, the patient’s stool volume peaked at approximately 1500 mL/d, but this was mostly attributed to treatment with multiple prophylactic antibiotics and lactulose, which the physician prescribed for prevention of encephalopathy. Nutrition support continued until withdraw of care was initiated.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SOS is a very complex and life-threatening condition after HSCT. Complete recovery from SOS occurs in more than 70% of patients whose treatment involves management of sodium and fluid balance, preservation of renal blood flow, and repeated paracenteses for ascites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612457180">2</xref></sup> Patients with severe SOS most often die from renal and cardiopulmonary failure as opposed to liver failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612457180">2</xref></sup> The risk of developing SOS was unfortunately high in this patient due to the cyclophosphamide-based cytoreductive therapy, which has the highest incidence of fatal SOS, during initial induction therapy and the HSCT conditioning regimen. Currently, there are no satisfactory therapies for severe SOS. Defibrotide has shown complete recovery in some patients with severe SOS and multiorgan failure, but the mechanism of action is not known.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612457180">2</xref></sup> Post-HSCT, patients may be catabolic with increased metabolic demands and needs for tissue regeneration, especially in patients undergoing allogeneic myeloablative treatment regimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612457180">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612457180">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612457180">13</xref></sup> GI toxicities following conditioning regimens, GVHD, and hepatobiliary complications add to the nutrition challenges these patients already face post-HSCT.</p>
<p>The advantages of using EN compared with PN are well known.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612457180">11</xref></sup> PN remains the more popular route of nutrition support in this patient population, but research has shown that EN should be used when it is feasible. Despite presentation of some GI side effects, this patient was able to tolerate and meet goal needs with EN. A more concentrated formula (1.8–2 kcal/mL) would have been ideal due to the patient’s issues with fluid retention, but in this case, a partially digestive formula was thought to be more successful given the early stage of recovery from HSCT. It became difficult to accurately assess absorption of nutrients due to the high-volume stool output, likely related to medications, so EN was optimized to meet the higher end of estimated needs. Clinicians are faced with unique nutrition challenges when treating this patient population. Researchers continue to explore different strategies for treatment of SOS; however, prevention of SOS is likely to be a more effective approach for improving transplant outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612457180">1</xref></sup> A multidisciplinary team approach to caring for these patients is essential.</p>
