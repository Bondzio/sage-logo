<abstract>
<p>Involvement in work-related learning seems to be more complex than a simple supply–demand fit. An interplay of several factors can influence this involvement at different stages of the decision-making process of the employee. The aim of this systematic review is to examine which antecedents of work-related learning have been identified in previous research. In total, 56 studies met the criteria for inclusion. In the current study, we describe how work-related learning was measured and what the empirically observed relationship is between learning intention and actual participation in work-related learning. The results show a positive relationship between intention and participation. A learning intention is most related to the attitude, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and career-related variables of the employee. Important predictors of actual participation in work-related learning are firm size, initial level of education and self-efficacy of the employee, support by managers, and opportunities within the organization.</p>

<body>
<p>Many researchers, human resource development professionals, and policymakers have stressed the importance of work-related learning for employees to keep up with the rapidly growing and changing society and economy, characterized by technological advancement and global competitiveness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034654313478021">Baert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0034654313478021">Kyndt, Dochy, Michielsen, &amp; Moeyaert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer, Weiss, &amp; Barbeite, 2003</xref>). For both organizations and individuals it has become crucial that employees learn continuously throughout their (flexible) careers. The continuous development of employees can enhance an organization’s competitive position, while at the same time this learning contributes to the sustainable employability of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0034654313478021">Gijbels, Raemdonck, &amp; Vervecken, 2010</xref>). Many learning activities are being set up to realize this continuous development. However, the participation rate is often lower than expected or needed, and those who did not participate in previous learning activities remain more reluctant to participate in the future. It appears that the relationship between the opportunity to participate and the actual participation of employees is less straightforward than a simple supply and demand fit. Prior research has devoted its attention to what influences work-related learning, and it appears that many factors affect the involvement in work-related learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034654313478021">Cavanaugh &amp; Noe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0034654313478021">Noe &amp; Wilk, 1993</xref>). The actual learning process of the employee is the result of a complex decision-making process in which different stages can be identified. In addition, both individual and context-related characteristics can have an influence on the different stages of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034654313478021">Baert, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this systematic review study is to identify the antecedents of work-related learning investigated by prior research. First, how work-related learning can be defined is discussed; a holistic approach that includes both on- and off-the-job learning, and formal and informal learning is presented. Subsequently, the decision-making process of the learner is explored. The theory of reasoned action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034654313478021">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>) is used heuristically and provides a way of explaining this decision-making process. After discussing the methodology adopted by this study, the results are provided. Finally, the main conclusions are presented and future research perspectives are discussed.</p>
<sec id="section1-0034654313478021">
<title>Defining Work-Related Learning</title>
<p>Until the 1990s, work-related learning was usually equated with formal learning. Formal learning is structured in terms of learning context, learning support, learning time, and learning objectives. It is typically organized through courses provided by an education or training institution, which can be independent or established within the organization (e.g., corporate university or training department). Thus, formal learning occurs within a context that is specifically designed for learning. Furthermore, the learning process is mainly instructor led and marked by a fixed and limited time frame. Finally, desirable learning outcomes are often specified ahead of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0034654313478021">Eraut, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0034654313478021">Malcolm, Hodkinson, &amp; Colley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0034654313478021">Marsick &amp; Watkins, 2001</xref>). This formal learning can occur both on and off the job, meaning that learning activities like courses, seminars, or conferences can be held within the organization itself or at a different location.</p>
<p>Formal learning is often contrasted with informal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0034654313478021">Eraut, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0034654313478021">Malcolm et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0034654313478021">Marsick &amp; Watkins, 2001</xref>). Informal learning is characterized by a low degree of planning and organizing in terms of the learning context, learning support, learning time, and learning objectives. Informal learning opportunities are not restricted to intentionally created learning environments but can occur during several on- and off-the-job (work-related) activities. The learning results from engagement and reflection in daily work-related activities in which learning is not the primary goal. Informal learning is undertaken autonomously, either individually or collectively, but without an instructor or trainer. It often happens spontaneously and unconsciously. From the learner’s perspective, it is unintentional, although a basic attitude of “willingness to learn” can benefit learning processes and outcomes. Finally, informal learning outcomes are not defined in advance and are therefore unpredictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0034654313478021">Desimone, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0034654313478021">Ellström &amp; Kock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0034654313478021">Hager, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0034654313478021">Livingstone, 1999</xref>). However, it can be noted that the organization can create favorable conditions that increase the likelihood for informal learning to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0034654313478021">Baert, De Witte, Govaerts, &amp; Sterck, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0034654313478021">Kyndt, Dochy, &amp; Nijs, 2009</xref>). Although formal and informal learning are often presented in contrast, both types of learning should not be dichotomized. Formal and informal learning are considered as being part of a continuum of formality ranging from totally unorganized learning as a by-product of working (informal learning), to learning organized within an educational setting (formal learning; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0034654313478021">Colley, Hodkinson, &amp; Malcolm, 2003</xref>). In addition, formal and informal learning can be complementary; both are important components of workplace learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0034654313478021">Slotte, Tynjälä, &amp; Hytönen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>For this study, work-related learning is defined as the engagement in formal and informal learning activities both on and off the job, whereby employees and groups of employees acquire and/or improve competences (integrated knowledge, skills, and attitudes) that change individuals’ present and future professional achievement (and eventually also their career) and organizational performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0034654313478021">Doyle, Reid, &amp; Young, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0034654313478021">Matthews, 1999</xref>). This definition supports a coherent and holistic approach to work-related learning and captures the notion that work-related learning does not occur within education and training alone, but rather as a sustainable change aimed at achieving individual and organizational goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034654313478021">Crouse, Doyle, &amp; Young, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0034654313478021">Leslie, Aring, &amp; Brand, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0034654313478021">Matthews, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Toward Participation: The Theory of Reasoned Action</title>
<p>Before employees participate in work-related learning, they have to decide whether or not they will participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034654313478021">Baert, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034654313478021">Baert, De Rick, and Van Valckenborgh (2006)</xref> identify different stages in this decision-making process: This process starts from a generally formulated or felt <italic>need</italic> that evolves into an <italic>educational need</italic>, which leads toward an <italic>intention</italic> to participate in learning and a concrete <italic>educational demand</italic>, resulting in the <italic>actual participation</italic> in a learning activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0034654313478021">Figure 1</xref>). At each stage, several factors can influence the decision-making process and hinder or facilitate its continuation.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.3102_0034654313478021-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>This conceptualization of the decision-making process is based on the theory of reasoned action of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034654313478021">Fishbein and Ajzen (1975</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034654313478021">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>). This theory provides a heuristic framework for this systematic review study. It allows us to explain the decision-making process of the individual, shows that intentions play a central role within this process, and illustrates together with the theory of planned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034654313478021">Ajzen, 1991</xref>)—an extension of the theory of reasoned action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034654313478021">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>)—the importance of individual and contextual antecedents. According to the theory of reasoned action, individuals’ behaviors are steered by their intentions that are, in turn, shaped by their perceptions and considerations of various personal, social, and contextual factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034654313478021">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>). This theory assumes that deciding to participate in work-related learning is a rational process, in which all advantages, disadvantages, and costs and benefits are considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0034654313478021">Pryor, 1990</xref>). However, not all elements that are taken into consideration are therefore purely rational or objective. For example, the beliefs of an employee about the attractiveness of specific learning activities can play an important role in this decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034654313478021">Baert et al., 2006</xref>). In the following sections, this process is described in more detail.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0034654313478021">
<title>From Educational Need to Educational Participation</title>
<p>The process that leads to educational participation starts with the experience of a <italic>need</italic>, a discrepancy between the current and desired situation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034654313478021">Baert (1998)</xref> detailed this process as the process of the increasing articulation of an educational need. The experienced need can involve several aspects and can manifest itself in various contexts and over time. This “general” need to do and manage things in a different and better way can get an educational dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034654313478021">Baert, 1998</xref>). If individuals recognize that they lack certain competences or are in need of more advanced levels of competences to be able to satisfy the felt need, that is, to be able to resolve the discrepancy and reach the desired situation, an educational aspect is connected to the “general” need. When this educational aspect is increasingly articulated, an <italic>educational need</italic> is formed. This means that the person is aware that learning is needed to bridge the experienced discrepancy. It does not necessarily mean that this person is (already) deciding to engage in learning activities.</p>
<p>According to theory of reasoned action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034654313478021">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>), a learner who has gone through the process of articulating an educational need should develop an <italic>intention to learn</italic> to satisfy the educational need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034654313478021">Baert et al., 2006</xref>). This learning intention takes up a central role in the decision-making process and steers the individual to the formulation of an <italic>educational demand</italic>, followed by a search for a suitable and concrete educational solution to resolve the experienced discrepancy. This solution may not necessarily be the best or most adequate solution, but a solution that fits the cost–benefit balance in the eyes of the employee. The final step in the process is the actual <italic>educational participation</italic>. How successful this participation will be and how much transfer will occur depend on a number of factors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0034654313478021">Gegenfurtner, 2011</xref>). However, these questions are not within the focus of this article.</p>
<p>Ideally, this process follows the linearity that is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0034654313478021">Figure 1</xref>; however, in practice a nonlinear process with unequally important stages can occur. For example, when the initial solution for the educational need does not meet the requirements, the potential learner might readdress this initially formulated educational need and formulate a different educational demand. Or the information about an educational activity or program offered to the employee can launch the process of becoming aware of an educational need, followed by the articulation of an intention to learn.</p>
<p>In 1991, Ajzen extended the theory of reasoned action and formulated the theory of planned behavior. This theory of planned behavior considers the fact that not all behavior is completely under the volitional control of the individual and illustrates the importance of the contextual dimension in deciding to participate in learning activities. It is not uncommon in organizations that employees cannot fully act on their intention because several contextual influences are urging them to adapt. The context can discourage or encourage the formulation of a learning intention. The theory of planned behavior has been shown useful for predicting participation in organizational training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0034654313478021">Fishbein &amp; Stasson, 1990</xref>), managers’ voluntary development activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0034654313478021">Maurer &amp; Palmer, 1999</xref>), and learning and development activities in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0034654313478021">
<title>Exploring Learning Intentions</title>
<p>As mentioned before, the formulation of a learning intention takes up a central role within the decision-making process with respect to an engagement in learning activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al. (2003)</xref> found that the intention to participate in learning activities was a robust predictor of actual participation in those learning activities. In addition, a learning intention is considered a proximal determinant of participation in education and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034654313478021">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>). Getting employees to commit to an involvement in learning activities is considered a first valuable step toward actual participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034654313478021">Fishbein and Ajzen (1975)</xref>, a person’s intention to learn is influenced by his or her attitude toward learning and the perception of the subjective social norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034654313478021">Baert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034654313478021">Kyndt, Govaerts, Dochy, &amp; Baert, 2011</xref>). The attitude of an individual is determined by the personal balance of the advantages, disadvantages, costs, and benefits of the educational participation. The subjective social norm is formed through the observation of the norms of significant others and not of all others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034654313478021">Baert et al., 2006</xref>). The impact of its influence is also determined by the stronger or weaker tendency of the individual to conform.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0034654313478021">
<title>Influencing Involvement in Work-Related Learning</title>
<p>The decision-making process of the employee as described above can be influenced at each stage of the process. The current study will—besides the actual participation—also focus on the antecedents of the learning intention because of its central role within the decision-making process of the individual, and because it is considered a first valuable step toward actual participation. The model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034654313478021">Baert et al. (2006)</xref> proposes influencing factors on three levels: the individual or micro level, the learning activity or meso level, and the social context and its actors or macro level. At the individual level, individuals’ sociodemographic and psychological features are considered, as well as the characteristics related to their job. On the meso level, all features of the learning activity are recognized together with the prior experiences of employees regarding learning activities. At the macro level or the level of the context, several factors related to the organization and broader context can be distinguished. The structure of these levels is used as a heuristic framework for presenting the results of our literature study. For the clarity of these results and because different research studies investigated different combinations of variables, the separate relationships of the different antecedents with the involvement in work-related learning are discussed. However, one must bear in mind that participation in learning results from an interaction between the individual and the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0034654313478021">Tynjälä, 2008</xref>). In the conclusion and discussion section, we illustrate the possible interrelationships among the variables.</p>

<p>This review aims at offering an overview of the empirical research that investigated the involvement in work-related learning. This study starts with exploring how prior research has measured work-related learning. Subsequently, the relationship between learning intention and actual educational participation is examined. Next, the factors related to the learning intention of employees and the actual participation in learning are explored. In other words, this study focuses on the antecedents of two different stages within the decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034654313478021">Baert et al., 2006</xref>).

<title>Literature Search and Selection</title>
<p>As mentioned before, the current study is a systematic review. The main difference between a systematic review and a theoretical study is the more scientifically transparent and reproducible process of the former one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0034654313478021">Cook, Mulrow, &amp; Haynes, 1997</xref>). It aims at providing an exhaustive summary of the literature relevant for the research questions at hand. Therefore, a thorough and transparent search of the literature is necessary. For the current literature search various education and business databases were consulted by means of Limo, an electronic search platform. In total six databases were included in the search: Academic Search Elite, Business Source Premier, EconLit, ERIC (CSA), Francis, and Social Sciences Citation Index. The search terms in this study were <italic>work-related learning, continuous career development, educational participation, job-related learning, development activities</italic>, and <italic>learning intention</italic> in combination with the terms <italic>employees</italic> and <italic>workers</italic>. In total, the search yielded 596 results (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0034654313478021">Table 1</xref>), of which 396 were unique records.</p>

<p>The selection of the literature to answer our research questions was based on several criteria for inclusion. Empirical studies were included in this systematic review if they met all of the following criteria: (a) focused on the participation in work-related learning or the learning intention of participants who were at the time of the research study employed within an organization, (b) published in peer-reviewed journals, (c) published in 1990 or later, and (d) published in English. Studies on the outcomes of work-related learning were not included. A total of 43 studies were retained based on these criteria. In addition, 13 studies were added to this selection by tracing back references included in the retrieved literature. In total, 56 studies formed the basis for answering our research questions.</p>

<title>Analysis of the Studies</title>
<p>After the final selection of these studies based on the criteria for inclusion, each study was analyzed. First, we assessed if the study focused on the actual participation in work-related learning, the learning intention of the employee, or both. Subsequently, it was determined which type of learning was measured based on the measurement instrument used in the primary study. Next, the antecedents that were included in each study were identified and assigned to the appropriate level (micro, meso, or macro). The nature and significance of the relations between the antecedents and the involvement in work-related learning were established within each study. Finally, it was analyzed if the results concerning the relations were consistent or contradictory across the different primary studies. The characteristics of the studies can be found in the appendix (available in the online journal), whereas <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0034654313478021">Table 2</xref> provides an overview of the antecedents organized by level and category.</p>

<title>Measuring Work-Related Learning</title>
<p>When interpreting the results concerning the antecedents of work-related learning, it is important to understand how work-related learning was conceptualized and measured within the selected primary studies. As mentioned before, work-related learning used to be foremost equated with formal learning; this is also reflected in how work-related learning was measured. More than half of the studies (<italic>n</italic> = 29) focused solely on the participation in formally organized learning activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034654313478021">Albert, Garcia-Serrano, &amp; Hernanz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034654313478021">Blau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034654313478021">Cavanaugh &amp; Noe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0034654313478021">Green, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0034654313478021">Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0034654313478021">Leisink &amp; Greenwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0034654313478021">Leuven &amp; Oosterbeek, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0034654313478021">Noe &amp; Wilk, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0034654313478021">Sala-Velasco, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0034654313478021">Taylor &amp; Urwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0034654313478021">Thangavelu, Haoming, Cheolsung, Heng, &amp; Wong, 2011</xref>). Participants were usually asked to indicate if they had participated in any kind of organized education or training during a specific amount of time (e.g., past year or past 6 months). In contrast, only a small number (<italic>n</italic> = 3) of studies focused solely on the measurement of informal learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034654313478021">Cooper and Kurland (2002)</xref>, for example, focused on employee development activities such as networking and mentoring. However, it needs to be mentioned that mentoring can also be organized in a formal way. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034654313478021">Doornbos, Simons, and Denessen (2008)</xref> focused solely on informal work-related learning, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0034654313478021">Schulz and Roβnagel (2010)</xref> measured the learning success in informal learning.</p>
<p>Within the category of studies that included both formal and informal learning activities in their study, two types of studies can be distinguished: studies that actually differentiated between formal and informal learning (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and measured and analyzed both of them explicitly separately (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034654313478021">Chan &amp; Auster, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0034654313478021">Mallon &amp; Walton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>) and studies that did not differentiate (<italic>n</italic> = 14) and generally questioned the participants about whether or not they undertook several development activities such as attending a course, but also reading a book or discussing issues with colleagues. All these items then formed the basis for a variable measuring work-related learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0034654313478021">Birdi, Patterson, &amp; Wood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0034654313478021">Gijbels et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0034654313478021">Ito &amp; Brotheridge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0034654313478021">Maurer, Mitchell, &amp; Barbeite, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0034654313478021">Simmering, Colquitt, Noe, &amp; Porter, 2003</xref>). A complete overview of what each study focused on in measuring work-related learning can be found in the appendix.</p>
<p>Regarding the research on learning intention, 7 of the 16 research studies focused on the intention to participate in formal learning activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034654313478021">Elman &amp; O’Rand, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh &amp; Mavrotas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034654313478021">Kyndt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0034654313478021">Renkema, 2006</xref>). The remaining 8 studies took the intention toward both formal and informal learning activities into account but did not differentiate between these intentions in the analyses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0034654313478021">Gaillard &amp; Desmette, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0034654313478021">Maurer &amp; Tarulli, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0034654313478021">Renkema, Schaap, &amp; Van Dellen, 2009</xref>). No studies focused solely on the intention to undertake informal learning activities, which is no surprise since informal learning is often considered to be unintentional from the learner’s perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0034654313478021">Marsick &amp; Watkins, 2001</xref>). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0034654313478021">Table 3</xref> for an overview of the descriptive information regarding the included studies.</p>

<p>The purpose of the second research question was to examine the relationship between the two different stages of the decision-making process as described by the theory of reasoned action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034654313478021">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>) and applied to learning and education by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034654313478021">Baert et al.

The majority (<italic>n</italic> = 6) confirmed that a learning intention was positively related to prior participation in learning activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034654313478021">Kyndt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0034654313478021">Renkema, 2006</xref>). These results indicate that the relationship between learning intention and actual participation is reciprocal in nature; prior participation leads toward higher learning intentions, and higher learning intentions relate to more participation in future work-related learning. Only the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders, Oomens, Blonk, and Hazelzet (2011)</xref> found that participation in informal learning did not predict a formal learning intention.

<title>Antecedents of Employees’ Learning Intentions</title>
<p>In total 16 studies investigated antecedents of employees’ learning intentions.

<sec id="section14-0034654313478021">
<title>Micro level: Sociodemographic characteristics</title>
<p>The first demographic variable to be highlighted is age. In general, results of the studies (<italic>n</italic> = 4) show that <italic>age</italic> is negatively related to a learning intention; this association can be considered small to moderate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0034654313478021">Renkema et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh and Mavrotas (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al.

(2011)</xref> also found that employees older than 56 years have the lowest learning intentions. In addition, three studies did not find a statistically significant relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034654313478021">Kyndt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0034654313478021">Noe, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0034654313478021">Zoogah, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding <italic>gender</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al. (2011)</xref> found that women had higher learning intentions than men. In addition, two studies did not find gender differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh &amp; Mavrotas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0034654313478021">Zoogah, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034654313478021">Elman and O’Rand (2002)</xref> did confirm the result of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al. (2011)</xref> when they connected the willingness to retrain to job insecurity. They found that women are more willing to retrain because they belong to a group that is more at risk of losing its job. In the same research, they also found that employees who are responsible for <italic>children</italic> (in terms of income) are more likely to retrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034654313478021">Elman &amp; O’Rand, 2002</xref>). The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034654313478021">Kyndt et al. (2011)</xref> did not find any differences between employees with or without children.</p>
<p>Finally, unlike the results on actual participation (see infra), the <italic>level of education</italic> of the employee is not such a strong predictor of an employee’s learning intention. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0034654313478021">Zoogah (2010)</xref> did not find a statistically significant relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh and Mavrotas (1994)</xref> found that employees who obtained degree-level qualifications demonstrate a higher learning intention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034654313478021">Elman and O’Rand (2002)</xref> showed that employees without a college degree are less likely to engage in future learning activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034654313478021">Kyndt et al. (2011)</xref>, whose study focused on low-educated employees, that is, those without a starter’s qualification for higher education, found that those employees without any form of educational degree had the lowest learning intentions; however, the effect size was rather small.</p>

<sec id="section15-0034654313478021">
<title>Micro level: Personal characteristics</title>
<p>Above we already discussed that prior participation is a positive predictor of an employee’s learning intention. This prior participation also has an indirect effect on employees’ learning intentions; the experience of this prior participation influences the <italic>attitude</italic> of the employee toward learning, which in turn is an important predictor of an employee’s intention to participate in future development activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>). Other research studies also confirmed the influence of an employee’s attitude toward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh &amp; Mavrotas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0034654313478021">Renkema, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al., 2011</xref>). The relation between attitude and intention can be described as a moderate to strong relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>). Another important variable within the theory of reasoned action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034654313478021">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>) for the intention of individuals is the <italic>subjective norm</italic>. A positive relationship between the subjective norm and a learning intention was identified by empirical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0034654313478021">Renkema, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al., 2011</xref>). The reported beta coefficient indicates that subjective norm is a moderately strong predictor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al. (2011)</xref> stated that the perceived value attached to employees’ training participation of significant others, such as colleagues, family, and friends, should be considered when trying to increase the motivation to participate in training.</p>
<p>In the theoretical background, the theory of planned behavior and the role of <italic>perceived behavioral control</italic> in the decision-making process were introduced. A few empirical studies (<italic>n</italic> = 2) investigated the relationship between perceived behavioral control and learning intention. The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al. (2011)</xref> found a moderately strong and positive relationship between perceived behavioral control and learning intention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0034654313478021">Zoogah (2010)</xref> was unable to confirm this.</p>
<p>Another personal characteristic that is taken up in the research on employees’ learning intentions is <italic>self-efficacy</italic>. Self-efficacy can be defined as the belief individuals have in their own capacities, in this case the capacity to learn. Four out of five studies investigating the relation between self-efficacy and learning intention found a positive relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034654313478021">Kyndt et al. (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0034654313478021">Renkema (2006)</xref> related self-efficacy to a formal learning intention, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al. (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0034654313478021">Maurer and Tarulli (1994)</xref> found a relationship with a learning intention pertaining to formal and informal learning activities. The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0034654313478021">Renkema et al. (2009)</xref> was the only study that investigated self-efficacy and did not find a statistically significant relationship. In line with the results on self-efficacy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al. (2003)</xref> found that if employees perceive themselves to possess the <italic>qualities needed for learning</italic> in terms of general skills and abilities, they report a higher learning intention.</p>
<p>In total, three studies included career-related variables. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al. (2011)</xref>, investigating a formal learning intention, found that <italic>career orientation</italic> was positively correlated with this learning intention. The more employees are working toward certain career goals in a (more or less) strategic way, the more likely they are to engage in future formal learning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034654313478021">Kyndt et al. (2011)</xref> found that <italic>self-directedness in career processes</italic>, which concerns influencing the course of one’s career, is positively related to the intention of an employee to engage in formal learning activities. This relationship can be considered moderately strong. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al. (2003)</xref>, who focused on the intention to engage in both formal and informal development activities, investigated the role of <italic>career insight</italic>, defined as the awareness of strengths and weaknesses and thoughts about career plans.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0034654313478021">Noe (1996)</xref> found that <italic>career exploration</italic>—more specifically if employees had sought information about job areas that interested them—is moderately strong and positively related a learning intention. In sum, it appears that the more conscious an employee is in thinking about his or her career perspectives, the stronger his or her intention to learn will be. In addition, research showed that employees with a higher <italic>organizational commitment</italic> presented a slightly lower learning intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0034654313478021">Renkema et al., 2009</xref>). The indication that employees who are more likely to change to another organization develop a higher learning intention can be explained by the wish to remain employable; however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0034654313478021">Renkema et al. (2009)</xref> noted that this is not a very important predictor.</p>
<p>The research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0034654313478021">Maurer and Tarulli (1994)</xref> adds the finding that a higher <italic>need for self-improvement</italic> relates positively to the intention to engage in development activities including both formal and informal learning activities. The <italic>motivation to transfer</italic>—that is, the motivation to actually apply on the work floor what has been learned—and <italic>previous transfer success</italic> also have a positive relationship with learning intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0034654313478021">Zoogah’s (2010)</xref> study took a different approach in comparison with the other studies.

Results showed that when employees recognized that they have been disadvantaged and feel resentment, their formal learning intention is higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0034654313478021">Zoogah, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Micro level: Job characteristics</title>
<p>Half of the studies investigating an employee’s learning intention (<italic>n</italic> = 8) considered job-related characteristics when investigating employees’ learning intentions. First, we focus on <italic>tenure</italic>, a variable highly correlated with age. It is therefore no surprise that the results are in line with the results on age and show a negative relation with learning intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034654313478021">Kyndt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0034654313478021">Renkema et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034654313478021">Elman and O’Rand (2002)</xref> confirmed that more experienced employees were less willing to retrain.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034654313478021">Kyndt et al.

Two studies investigating the influence of <italic>job involvement</italic> on the intention to engage in both formal and informal learning activities found that job involvement is statistically significantly related to a learning intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0034654313478021">Maurer &amp; Tarulli, 1994</xref>). This means that the more employees consider their work to be central in their life, the higher their learning intention is. <italic>Job satisfaction</italic> in turn is related moderately positively to a job-related learning intention but negatively to a career-related learning intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0034654313478021">Renkema et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0034654313478021">Doornbos et al.

<title>Meso level: Learning activity</title>
<p>The characteristics of the learning activity were also investigated in a small number of studies (<italic>n</italic> = 6). Aspects of the learning activity that have been investigated are the <italic>expected outcomes or benefits</italic>. Intrinsic outcomes such as interest and personal value were found to relate positively to employees’ learning intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0034654313478021">Maurer &amp; Tarulli, 1994</xref>). The results concerning the extrinsic benefits (e.g., pay or promotion) are less clear: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0034654313478021">Zoogah (2010)</xref> investigated employees’ <italic>counterfactual beliefs</italic>.

<p>The studies investigating the <italic>support</italic> for learning within the work context in general show that support relates positively to a learning intention; a positive relationship was found for supervisor or management support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0034654313478021">Maurer &amp; Tarulli, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al., 2011</xref>), coworker support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al., 2011</xref>), and general work support including from supervisors, coworkers, and subordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0034654313478021">Renkema et al.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0034654313478021">Renkema (2006)</xref> also conducted an experimental study, in which he investigated if the learning intention differed between employees with and without an <italic>individual learning account</italic>, which is a combination of a professional development plan and an individual financing mechanism.

In the technical installation sector, employees with an individual learning account presented higher learning intentions than those without.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0034654313478021">Maurer and Tarulli (1994)</xref> investigated the influence of a <italic>company policy</italic> that facilitated participation in learning and development activities.

Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0034654313478021">Zoogah (2010)</xref> found that unfair procedures in terms of offering training and promotions within organizations increase the learning intentions of employees.

<title>Micro level: Sociodemographic characteristics</title>
<p>The majority of the selected research studies (<italic>n</italic> = 30) devoted attention to the role of sociodemographic variables in the involvement in work-related learning. Regarding <italic>gender</italic>, research often confirms the idea that female employees have a lower degree of participation in formal vocational education than do men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034654313478021">Albert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0034654313478021">Lauber, Taylor, Decker, &amp; Knuth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0034654313478021">Leuven &amp; Oosterbeek, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0034654313478021">Oosterbeek, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0034654313478021">Harris (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0034654313478021">Selmer and Leung (2003)</xref> found that women are offered fewer training opportunities, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh and Mavrotas (1994)</xref> found that when training is longer (i.e., takes up more time), more men than women participate. In general, the research literature is mixed about the effect of gender on participation. Further analysis of the situation nuances these findings and shows that sex-related discrimination decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0034654313478021">Green, 1993</xref>) and that differences are a result of the fact that women, more often than men, are employed in jobs where, in general, vocational education is less common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0034654313478021">Oosterbeek, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0034654313478021">Simpson and Stroh (2002)</xref>, however, contradicts this. They found that in 1995 women participated more in development activities than did men, and they were also able to attribute this to the occupational segregation. Other researchers (<italic>n</italic> = 3) also found that women participate more in formal career-related continuous learning activities than do men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0034654313478021">Rowold &amp; Shilling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0034654313478021">Sala-Velasco, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0034654313478021">Thangavelu et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, several studies (<italic>n</italic> = 4) did not find differences between men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034654313478021">Garavan, Carberry, O’Malley, &amp; O’Donnel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0034654313478021">Lauber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0034654313478021">Tharenou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0034654313478021">Xiao &amp; Tsang, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0034654313478021">Tharenou (1997)</xref>, who conducted his study in the public sector, attributes the lack of difference between the participation of men and women to the regulations regarding gender equality in the public sector.

<p>In addition to the majority of studies (<italic>n</italic> = 13) that investigated the relation between gender and formal learning, three studies were found that took both formal and informal learning into account when comparing men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034654313478021">Booth, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0034654313478021">Ito &amp; Brotheridge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0034654313478021">Taris &amp; Feij, 2004</xref>). However, they did not differentiate among these types of learning. The results of these studies also present an ambiguous image of the relation between gender and work-related learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034654313478021">Booth (1991)</xref> found that women undertake fewer learning activities, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0034654313478021">Ito and Brotheridge (2005)</xref> obtained higher scores for women and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0034654313478021">Taris and Feij (2004)</xref> ended up with a non–statistically significant relationship.</p>
<p>With regard to <italic>marital status</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh and Mavrotas (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0034654313478021">Thangavelu et al.

However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0034654313478021">Harris (1999)</xref> found that single men participate less. Others did not find a statistically significant effect of marital status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034654313478021">Forrier &amp; Sels, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0034654313478021">Oosterbeek, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0034654313478021">Taylor &amp; Urwin, 2001</xref>). The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034654313478021">Booth (1991)</xref>, which was the only study that included formal and informal learning activities when investigating the relationship with marital status, also did not find a statistically significant result. In conclusion, it can be stated that the results for marital status are inconclusive.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the relationship between having <italic>children</italic> and involvement in formal work-related learning is discussed. There are four studies that did not find a statistically significant relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh &amp; Mavrotas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0034654313478021">Taylor &amp; Urwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0034654313478021">Tharenou, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0034654313478021">2001</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0034654313478021">Tharenou (1997)</xref> did argue that women with (younger) children are less likely to be full-time employed, which reduces the possible impact of this family factor. This explanation stems from the fact that four research studies indeed found that having children results in a lower participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034654313478021">Booth, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0034654313478021">Green, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0034654313478021">Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0034654313478021">Simpson &amp; Stroh, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0034654313478021">Harris (1999)</xref> found that especially having children younger than age 4 reduced female participation, whereas having children between 5 and 11 years old reduced male participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034654313478021">Booth (1991)</xref>, who took both formal and informal learning into account, also found a negative relationship between having children and work-related learning for women.</p>
<p>There seems to be a general consensus among researchers about the negative relation between <italic>age</italic> and formal work-related learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh &amp; Mavrotas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0034654313478021">Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0034654313478021">Taylor &amp; Urwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0034654313478021">Warr &amp; Birdi, 1998</xref>). As employees get older, they participate less in training. However, several nuances have been formulated regarding this relationship, suggesting that the relationship is less direct than it might seem. On one hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0034654313478021">Oosterbeek (1996)</xref> put forward that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>older workers have a lower probability of working for a firm that offers training opportunities, but given that a worker is employed by a firm that provides training, the worker’s age has no influence on the probability of his/her being selected for a training program. (p. 803)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the other hand, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0034654313478021">Sala-Velasco (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0034654313478021">Thangavelu et al. (2011)</xref> found that the relation between age and formal participation is positive until a certain point, after which participation declines again. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0034654313478021">Sala-Velasco (2009)</xref> argued for a quadratic relationship, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0034654313478021">Thangavelu and colleagues (2011)</xref> placed the cutoff point at 37 years of age.</p>
<p>In addition, it has been found that the negative relation between age and vocational educational participation is stronger for men than women. A minority of research studies did not find a statistically significant relationship with age (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034654313478021">Blau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034654313478021">Cavanaugh &amp; Noe, 1999</xref>). Studies focusing on both formal and informal learning (without differentiating between them) showed similar results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034654313478021">Booth (1991)</xref> described a statistically significant negative result. However, a majority of these studies found that age was not statistically significant in the prediction of formal and informal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0034654313478021">Ito &amp; Brotheridge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0034654313478021">Noe, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0034654313478021">Taris &amp; Feij, 2004</xref>). Finally, there were two studies that investigated formal and informal learning separately. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0034654313478021">Schulz and Roβnagel (2010)</xref> focused solely on informal learning and found no statistically significant correlations between age and prior participation in informal learning and learning success. They did find that age was positively correlated with learning opportunities at work. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034654313478021">Chan and Auster (2003)</xref> investigated the role of subjective age (feeling old) and relative age (feeling old in comparison with colleagues) in a group of librarians. Their results showed that employees who feel older participate less in informal learning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034654313478021">Chan &amp; Auster, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The initially obtained <italic>level of education</italic> of an individual is another important predictor of participation in learning activities. Research has shown that the level of education is an especially important predictor of participation in formal training (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh &amp; Mavrotas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0034654313478021">Ito &amp; Brotheridge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0034654313478021">Tharenou, 1997</xref>): Employees with a higher level of education tend to participate more in such training (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034654313478021">Albert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0034654313478021">Green, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0034654313478021">Montizaan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0034654313478021">Tabassi &amp; Bakar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0034654313478021">Taylor &amp; Urwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0034654313478021">Warr &amp; Birdi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0034654313478021">Xiao &amp; Tsang, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0034654313478021">Tabassi and Bakar (2009)</xref> identified a low level of education as a barrier for participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0034654313478021">Thangavelu et al.

They found that subjective norms related positively to participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0034654313478021">Zoogah (2010)</xref> identified the positive relation between <italic>perceived behavioral control</italic> and participation in formal learning as postulated in the theory of planned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034654313478021">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz and Williams (2009)</xref> remarkably found that perceived behavioral control was moderately negatively related to participation. In addition, they found that voluntariness was related negatively to participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>). They concluded that if employees have a free choice to participate, they are less likely to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although <italic>time</italic> is assumed to play a central role in the participation of employees in work-related learning, only a few studies (<italic>n</italic> = 3) investigated time as such (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0034654313478021">Brown &amp; McCracken, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034654313478021">Chan &amp; Auster, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0034654313478021">Warr &amp; Birdi, 1998</xref>). These studies do confirm that a lack of time is an important barrier for the participation in formal learning. The research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0034654313478021">Warr and Birdi (1998)</xref>, however, shows that this relationship is mediated by a motivation to learn. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034654313478021">Chan and Auster (2003)</xref> were also able to confirm the negative relationship for informal learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0034654313478021">Noe and Wilk (1993)</xref> included time within their measure of <italic>situational constraints</italic> and found that these situational constraints lowered the participation in development activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034654313478021">Garavan et al. (2010)</xref> could not confirm this result for formal work-related e-learning.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we discuss several psychological characteristics of the individual. A first important factor that comes to the fore is <italic>self-efficacy</italic>. Three studies that investigated a combination of formal and informal learning found that self-efficacy is positively related to participation in development activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0034654313478021">Maurer &amp; Tarulli, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0034654313478021">Maurer et al. (2002)</xref>, however, confirmed this only for off-the-job learning activities and not for on-the-job learning activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034654313478021">Blau et al. (2008)</xref> related self-efficacy to formal organizational development activities but not to professional development activities. The first category of developmental activities focuses on the organization. Through organization-specific initiatives, organizational-relevant skills and knowledge are learned, whereas the latter focuses on development activities pertaining to the occupation; profession-relevant skills are learned through profession-based initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034654313478021">Blau et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0034654313478021">Noe and Wilk (1993)</xref> confirmed a positive relationship of self-efficacy and a subjective measure of participation in formal learning activities based on the perception of the individual; the relationship was not confirmed for the objective measure retrieved from the human resource information system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0034654313478021">Schulz and Roβnagel (2010)</xref> differentiated between memory self-efficacy and occupational self-efficacy and found that both correlate positively with learning success in informal learning and opportunities to learn at work. When employees believe in their own memory capacities and capacities to exert their profession, their learning success in informal learning and their opportunities to learn at work will be perceived as higher.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al. (2003)</xref> also measured the employees’ <italic>beliefs in their learning qualities</italic>, which is closely related to self-efficacy. They found that this belief was positively correlated with participation in formal and informal development activities; however, no direct relationship was found in the structural equation model. The influence of learning qualities was mediated by the learning intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>). A general learning confidence was found to be positively associated with participation in formal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0034654313478021">Warr &amp; Birdi, 1998</xref>), whereas <italic>anxiety</italic> during prior learning activities was unrelated to current participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>). A <italic>perceived decline in memory and mental functioning</italic> correlated negatively with participation, but was statistically nonsignificant in the structural model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>). The positive correlation of <italic>perceived intelligence</italic> was also statistically nonsignificant in the structural model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>). Another related construct that was investigated is the <italic>perceived level of competence</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0034654313478021">Schulz and Roβnagel (2010)</xref> found that learning competence predicted learning success in informal learning positively, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034654313478021">Doornbos et al. (2008)</xref> found that a higher perceived competence was negatively associated with the informal learning strategies learning together and learning from experts. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0034654313478021">Maurer et al. (2002)</xref> focused on the <italic>implicit theory</italic> of the employee and found that individuals who believe that ability can be enhanced participate more in learning activities, in comparison to those who believe that ability is fixed.</p>
<p>The next subset of variables that is explored pertains to the level of skills and competences and the need individuals experience to improve these. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0034654313478021">Maurer and Tarulli (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al. (2003)</xref> found that <italic>self-need for improvement</italic> was positively associated with participation in formal and informal development activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates (2001)</xref> investigated the role of <italic>basic skills</italic> level and proficiency. Math and reading skills were positive predictors for the objective measure regarding work-related learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates, 2001</xref>). However, when employees perceive that their reading skills are below what is required for their job, they are more likely to participate in formal development activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0034654313478021">Sala-Velasco (2009)</xref> added that experienced <italic>deficits in competences</italic> such as management and negotiating competences increase the likelihood to be offered formal training, whereas being <italic>overeducated</italic> for a job decreases this likelihood. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0034654313478021">Sala-Velasco (2009)</xref> showed that employees who graduated in health sciences had a higher likelihood of receiving formal training.</p>
<p>Besides the capacities of employees and their beliefs concerning these capacities, the motivation of the employee is an important antecedent of work-related learning. Several studies focused on different aspects of motivation. A total of six studies focused on the <italic>motivation to learn</italic> through formal learning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034654313478021">Garavan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0034654313478021">Noe &amp; Wilk, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0034654313478021">Tabassi &amp; Bakar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0034654313478021">Tharenou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0034654313478021">Warr &amp; Birdi, 1998</xref>). These studies confirmed the positive relation between motivation to learn (or participate) with actual participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034654313478021">Garavan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0034654313478021">Noe &amp; Wilk, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0034654313478021">Tharenou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0034654313478021">Warr &amp; Birdi, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0034654313478021">Tabassi and Bakar (2009)</xref> showed that having no motivation was an important barrier for the participation in formal learning.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz and Williams (2009)</xref> focused on a learning goal orientation. <italic>A learning goal orientation</italic> represents a general desire to learn new skills and increase competences that are considered important. Their results showed that learning goal orientation is a statistically significant direct predictor of actual participation in formal and informal learning activities. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0034654313478021">Schulz and Roβnagel (2010)</xref> found that such a learning goal orientation is positively associated with learning success in informal learning, whereas a performance avoidance orientation (concealing a lack of knowledge, skills and abilities) is negatively related to learning success. A self-directed learning orientation is closely related to the notion of a learning goal orientation.</p>
<p>A <italic>self-directed learning orientation</italic> is a “relative stable tendency to take an active and self-starting approach to work-related learning activities and situations, and to persist in overcoming barriers and setbacks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0034654313478021">Gijbels et al., 2010</xref>, p. 243). Such a learning orientation was found to relate positively to developmental behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0034654313478021">Gijbels et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0034654313478021">Gijbels, Raemdonck, Vervecken, &amp; Van Herck, 2012</xref>). Finally, <italic>epistemic beliefs</italic> in which learning is considered important and valuable, were also positively related to this learning success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0034654313478021">Schulz &amp; Roβnagel, 2010</xref>). The above-discussed motivational antecedents show some similarities with the concept of learning intention; however, a learning intention is considered to be more specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034654313478021">Kyndt et al., 2011</xref>). It pertains to an intention to demonstrate a certain behavior, whereas these motivational antecedents describe a more general tendency or belief of the individual. It can be expected that these motivational antecedents would strongly relate to the learning intention of an employee.</p>
<p>In terms of <italic>motivation to transfer</italic>, two contradicting studies were found. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates (2001)</xref> showed a positive relation between motivation to transfer and participation in formal learning, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0034654313478021">Noe and Wilk (1993)</xref> found a negative relationship. Their results suggest that the more motivated employees are to apply what they learned, the less they perceive these learning activities to be appropriate for their job content. Bates found that expected transfer effort performance is a positive predictor of participation in formal learning. Bates also investigated the <italic>expectancy belief</italic> regarding the performance outcome, but this was found to be unrelated to participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0034654313478021">Tharenou (2001)</xref> confirmed that <italic>motivation through expectancy</italic> explained participation in training and development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034654313478021">Chan and Auster (2003)</xref> confirmed this result for informal learning but not for formal learning.</p>
<p>Research on the relationship between the personality of employees and their participation in work-related learning is scarce. Two studies investigated the role of the personality trait <italic>conscientiousness</italic>. Conscientiousness is defined as a combination of achievement and dependability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>). Individuals higher in achievement set high standards for themselves, are goal directed, and generally try hard to do good work, whereas individuals high in dependability are reliable, thorough, disciplined, and persistent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0034654313478021">Simmering et al. (2003)</xref> found that conscientiousness was positively related to participation in formal and informal development activities, especially when employees experience a misfit between the autonomy they experience in their job and the autonomy they need or desire.</p>
<p>Besides the above-described personal and psychological characteristics, several variables related to how individuals go about their careers have been investigated. An overall <italic>responsibility for career development</italic> did not yield a statistically significant relationship with formal work-related learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034654313478021">Cavanaugh &amp; Noe, 1999</xref>); neither did focusing on <italic>career goals</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0034654313478021">Noe, 1996</xref>) or <italic>career planning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0034654313478021">Rowold &amp; Shilling, 2006</xref>). However, the <italic>distance to</italic> such career goals did yield a positive relationship with formal and informal development behavior. The further employees are removed from their career goals, the more they participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0034654313478021">Noe, 1996</xref>). <italic>Career strategies</italic> such as discussing and planning activities to broaden one’s skills used to reach those career goals were found to relate positively to participation in formal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0034654313478021">Tharenou, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the results of the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0034654313478021">Noe (1996)</xref> did not confirm this. The research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0034654313478021">Mallon and Walton (2005)</xref> confirmed that developing “saleable” skills or remaining <italic>employable</italic> was as a desired outcome of learning activities. <italic>Career exploration</italic>—specifically searching information about job areas of interest—can be considered as a specific career strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0034654313478021">Rowold &amp; Shilling, 2006</xref>). Two studies showed that this career exploration was positively associated with participating in formal learning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0034654313478021">Noe &amp; Wilk, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0034654313478021">Rowold &amp; Shilling, 2006</xref>). Noe found only an indirect effect via the learning intention of the employee. The final career-related variable that was investigated is <italic>career insight</italic>. Career insight pertains to “the extent to which a person has knowledge concerning his or her career-related strengths and weaknesses, specific career goals, career plans and current work situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>, p. 714). Two studies found positive correlation between career insight and participation in formal and informal learning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0034654313478021">Maurer &amp; Tarulli, 1994</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al.’s (2003)</xref> structural model showed that this relationship was indirect via the learning intention.</p>
<p>In terms of the commitment of employees toward their career or job, two different concept are distinguished: occupational commitment, that is, the commitment to the profession or occupation of the employee, and organizational commitment, which refers to the commitment of the employees toward the organization they are working for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034654313478021">Blau et al., 2008</xref>). Four research studies considered <italic>occupational commitment</italic>. Three of them found a positive relationship between occupational commitment and participation in formal work-related learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034654313478021">Blau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034654313478021">Cavanaugh &amp; Noe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0034654313478021">Lauber et al., 2010</xref>). However, Blau et al. showed that this relationship pertained only to professional development activities and not organizational development activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034654313478021">Chan and Auster (2003)</xref> found a non–statistically significant relation between occupational commitment and both formal and informal learning activities. Two of the above-mentioned studies also considered <italic>organizational commitment</italic>. Blau et al. related this organizational commitment positively to formal organizational development activities. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0034654313478021">Lauber et al. (2010)</xref> found a negative relationship. They explained this relationship through the existence of time constraints.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0034654313478021">Pierce and Maurer (2009)</xref> took a more holistic approach on organizational commitment; they examined <italic>organizational citizenship behavior</italic>: “Individual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system, and in the aggregate promotes the efficient and effective functioning of the organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0034654313478021">Pierce &amp; Maurer, 2009</xref>, p. 139). This type of behavior was positively related to work-related learning behavior involving both formal and informal activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0034654313478021">Zoogah (2010)</xref>, on the other hand, found that when individuals recognize that they were disadvantaged by their organization and they resent this, this does not directly affect their participation in formal development activities. However, individual relative deprivation was indirectly related through the learning intention of an employee.</p>
<p>In this final paragraph of this section, we present a few additional research results. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0034654313478021">Harris (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034654313478021">Booth (1991)</xref> found that <italic>union members</italic> participate more in learning activities. Harris added that this effect was less strong in larger organizations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh and Mavrotas (1994)</xref> found no relation between formal learning and union membership.

Related to this looking for a job, Booth found that the number of <italic>months</italic> an employee remains <italic>unemployed</italic> relates negatively to the participation in development activities. Finally, the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0034654313478021">Montizaan et al.

<title>Micro level: Job characteristics</title>
<p>The final category at the micro level pertains to the characteristics of the job. We start with discussing the occupational type and level of the employee. The research concerning the influence of the <italic>occupational level</italic> of employees shows consistent and relatively strong findings. Employees in higher level occupations (e.g., managers and professionals) participate more in formal learning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034654313478021">Albert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034654313478021">Cavanaugh &amp; Noe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034654313478021">Forrier &amp; Sels, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0034654313478021">Green, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0034654313478021">Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0034654313478021">Noe &amp; Wilk, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0034654313478021">Oosterbeek, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0034654313478021">Sala-Velasco, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0034654313478021">Tharenou, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0034654313478021">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0034654313478021">Warr &amp; Birdi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0034654313478021">Xiao &amp; Tsang, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0034654313478021">Noe (1996)</xref> also found that managers participate more than technical and clerical staff when considering both formal and informal learning activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0034654313478021">Taylor and Urwin (2001)</xref> found that managers, administrators, professionals, and associate professionals participate more in formal learning activities than do office and personal and protective service employees, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034654313478021">Booth (1991)</xref> found that manual workers participate less in comparison to nonmanual workers.</p>

<p>When investigating the differences between employees with different contracts, two differentiations come to the fore: a temporary versus tenured contract and a full-time versus part-time contract.

<title>Meso level: Learning activity</title>
<p>The meso level, or the level of the learning activity, is the level that is least investigated by the studies focusing on participation included in this review study. A couple of longitudinal studies (<italic>n</italic> = 2) investigated if <italic>prior participation</italic> predicted later participation in development activities. The results show that prior participation in formal learning is a strong predictor of later participation in formal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>). The reactions and experiences to this prior participation were also investigated. Positive reactions related to more participation in learning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh &amp; Mavrotas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0034654313478021">Noe and Wilk (1993)</xref> did not confirm this relationship. In addition, <italic>previous transfer success</italic> after a formal training was also a positive predictor of participation in formal learning activities. It looks like participation seems to be part of a vicious or virtuous circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh &amp; Mavrotas, 1994</xref>).

However, when employees <italic>value</italic> informal work-related learning, they participate more in the informal learning activity “learning together.”</p>
<p>Only a few studies (<italic>n</italic> = 3) focused on the influence on participation of characteristics of the actual learning activity itself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034654313478021">Garavan et al.

<p>The majority of the studies within this level (6 out of 11) focused on the <italic>expected benefits</italic> and <italic>outcomes</italic> of participating in learning activities.

<p>Several research studies (<italic>n</italic> = 5) incorporated organizational support within the broader concept of <italic>learning climate or culture</italic>. A positive learning climate or culture refers to an organizational climate that values, supports, and appreciates work-related learning. These aspects of an environment were found to relate positively to participation in learning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0034654313478021">Tharenou, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0034654313478021">Brown and McCracken (2009)</xref> showed that an unsupportive organizational climate is an important barrier for the participation in formal learning activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0034654313478021">Tabassi and Bakar (2009)</xref> stated that a low culture was also experienced as an important barrier. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0034654313478021">Schulz and Roβnagel (2010)</xref> found that a positive training climate related positively to learning success in informal learning. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034654313478021">Chan and Auster (2003)</xref> found that a climate in which it is perceived that information is exchanged with peers and supervisors related negatively to informal learning. However, the authors argued that this unexpected result can probably be explained by the difficulty of measuring informal learning and the fact that not all informal learning is recognized as learning. Within informal learning, feedback plays an important role. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0034654313478021">Brown and McCracken (2009)</xref> defined <italic>staff issues</italic> as the unwillingness of employees to be receptive to feedback and found that this was an important barrier for work-related learning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0034654313478021">Maurer et al.

In contrast, a <italic>company policy</italic> that facilitates participation in learning and development activities was found to be a positive predictor. In addition, a <italic>staffing strategy</italic> that focuses on recruiting employees from within the organization rather than from the outside and therefore focuses on the internal development of expertise positively predicts participation in work-related learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0034654313478021">Xiao and Tsang (2004)</xref> investigated the direction of <italic>internal mobility</italic> and found that both employees who experienced upward mobility and those who experienced downward mobility participated more in work-related learning than the stable reference group.

<p>Different organizations can offer different <italic>opportunities</italic> for learning to their employees.

(2008)</xref> specified that the possibility for collegial feedback was an important variable for participation in various types of informal learning activities.

<p>Pertaining to the opportunities an employer offers and the willingness of employees to participate, it can be stated that it is remarkable that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0034654313478021">Noe and Wilk (1993)</xref> did not find a statistically significant relationship between a <italic>match</italic> in employee and firm development needs and participation in work-related learning.</p>

Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0034654313478021">Zoogah (2010)</xref> found that when employees were in agreement with the policy change, they participated more in formal learning activities.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current systematic review focused on the involvement in work-related learning and its antecedents, and the main results can be summarized as follows. The study started from the decision-making process of the potential learner as explained by the theory of reasoned action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034654313478021">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>). This theory assigns a central role to the learning intention of an employee; therefore not only the antecedents of the actual participation but also the antecedents of an employee’s learning intention were examined. The empirical research studies included in this review showed that a learning intention is indeed related to actual participation in learning activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, the empirical research contributes that this relationship is reciprocal in nature. Prior participation enhances the learning intention of the employee, which in turns predicts future participation.</p>
<p>Although many contrasting results were identified for many variables, prior research does provide consistent results for several specific variables. Besides the attitude and subjective norm of the employee, self-efficacy and various career-related variables were found to be important for an employee’s learning intention. Self-efficacy seems to be a prerequisite for employees to develop an intention to learn (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034654313478021">Kyndt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0034654313478021">Maurer &amp; Tarulli, 1994</xref>). Employees need to believe in their own capacity to think about participating in development activities. Furthermore, the results of various career-related variables indicate that when employees are consciously and strategically thinking about their careers, they will be more inclined to undertake learning activities in the future (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0034654313478021">Noe, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al., 2011</xref>). However, this should not be interpreted as an isolated result: For employees to advance in their career, promotional opportunities need to be available within the organization. In addition, a supportive organizational context—which was also identified as an important predictor (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0034654313478021">Armstrong-Stassen &amp; Schlosser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al., 2011</xref>)—can potentially enhance these career-related variables and the employee’s self-efficacy.</p>
<p>The results show that when employees experience that their learning is supported, appreciated, and valued, they will be more inclined to participate in future development activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0034654313478021">Armstrong-Stassen &amp; Schlosser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034654313478021">Bates, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0034654313478021">Sanders et al., 2011</xref>). Regarding the learning activity itself, the majority of the research focused on the expected benefits or outcomes. The results indicate that (expected) intrinsic benefits predicted a learning intention positively, but prior research was inconsistent regarding various extrinsic outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0034654313478021">Maurer &amp; Tarulli, 1994</xref>). This inconsistency might be explained by the fact that these different primary studies were executed within different organizations (i.e., contexts) and that not every organization provides the same and/or powerful extrinsic rewards for engaging in learning activities.</p>
<p>Regarding the actual participation of employees in learning activities, level of education and self-efficacy come to the fore as important individual characteristics. Research has consistently shown that employees with a higher level of education participate (much) more in both formal and informal learning activities, but especially for formal learning this relationship is strong (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034654313478021">Albert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh &amp; Mavrotas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0034654313478021">Tharenou, 1997</xref>). On one hand, these results can be explained on an individual level; low-qualified employees often have negative experiences with education, making them less inclined to participate in learning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0034654313478021">Illeris, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0034654313478021">Oosterbeek (1996)</xref> showed that high-qualified employees have a higher likelihood of working for an employer who offers training possibilities. In addition, this effect is sustained: The results showed that prior participation and the experience during this prior participation yielded an important contribution in explaining employees’ participation in formal learning activities. Employees who have participated before, in general, participate more later on (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>), especially if this was a positive and successful experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034654313478021">Greenhalgh &amp; Mavrotas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the limited research on informal learning did not confirm this relationship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0034654313478021">Schulz &amp; Roβnagel, 2010</xref>). For self-efficacy the results were in line with the results pertaining to the learning intention of employees and generally showed a positive contribution of self-efficacy to actual participation in work-related learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034654313478021">Blau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2002</xref>). In line with the results for learning intention, it can be argued that the organizational context (such as a positive learning climate, organizational support, and offered opportunities) can interact with the characteristics of the employee and enhance employees’ participation in development activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0034654313478021">Schulz &amp; Roβnagel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0034654313478021">Tharenou, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0034654313478021">2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the size of the firm, a basic characteristic of the organization, seems to play an important role. Research has consistently shown that employees in larger firms participate more (in formal learning) than those in small firms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034654313478021">Albert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0034654313478021">Oosterbeek, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0034654313478021">Xiao &amp; Tsang, 2004</xref>). However, it can be noticed that the majority of these research studies focused on formal learning. Larger organizations might be in more need to formalize the learning activities because of the complexity of the organization and the product control systems, including the formal registration of learning activities and training. It would be premature to conclude that smaller organizations with more informal systems and control do less or that they compensate for this lack of formal learning with informal learning. Nevertheless, it is observed that participation in formal learning activities stimulates informal learning, and informal learning often leads to participation in more formal learning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0034654313478021">Leslie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0034654313478021">Shipton, Dawson, West, &amp; Patterson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This systematic review study reveals that sociodemographic variables have received substantial attention in prior research, probably because of commonsense expectations (e.g., age will have an impact on activity) and because these type of studies usually based their analysis on data collected within large, often nationally organized surveys such as the Labour Force Survey, OSA Labour Supply Survey, and National Household Education Survey. In addition, these variables are easily measured, and as a consequence most of the studies included them in their research. Hence, a lot is known about the differences between different demographic groups, but more than a summary, a critical reflection, is needed because these studies are usually not able to explain these differences as they rarely take the organizational context into account. For example, the results regarding the differences between men and women are not unequivocal; neither are the explanations provided for these differences.</p>
<p>On one hand, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0034654313478021">Oosterbeek (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0034654313478021">Simpson and Stroh (2002)</xref> attributed the differences between men and women to occupational segregation, but remarkably they used the same explanation for opposite results. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0034654313478021">Taylor and Urwin (2001)</xref> argue that the differences between men and women have disappeared over the years. At the same time, researchers found that having children had a negative effect only on the participation of women, indicating that this could also be a potential explanation for the differences between men and women (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0034654313478021">Green, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0034654313478021">Simpson &amp; Stroh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0034654313478021">Tharenou, 1997</xref>). However, several organizational and job-related characteristics might also explain these differences, or the lack thereof. For example, when an individual’s employer provides proper day care or allows for flexible hours, this might resolve the difference between men and women. It seems that a lot of antecedents of work-related learning can be used to explain these sociodemographic differences and that the interaction between the individual and the context should be taken into account.</p>
<p>In contrast to gender, the relationship between age and work-related learning seems to be clear. In general, it can be concluded that older employees participate less in learning activities than do their younger colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0034654313478021">Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0034654313478021">Warr &amp; Birdi, 1998</xref>). However, here also different explanations are provided. The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0034654313478021">Oosterbeek (1996)</xref> showed that older employees have a lower probability of working for a firm that offers training opportunities, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0034654313478021">Gaillard and Desmette (2010)</xref> offer a culture of negative stereotyping of older employees within an organization as a possible explanation. Both of these researchers explain individual differences by means of organizational characteristics. Other researchers have argued that these age differences might be a cohort effect related to the (in general) lower level of education of older employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0034654313478021">Mulenga &amp; Liang, 2008</xref>). It can be concluded that although it is relatively easy to include sociodemographic variables in the research on work-related learning, it is far more difficult to explain the identified differences. Therefore, it appears to be important that these variables are not investigated in an isolated manner, but that other individual characteristics and the context are taken into account. In quantitative research, a multilevel approach provides the researcher with the possibility of including individual characteristics and organizational characteristics simultaneously in the analysis. In addition, it is possible to identify the variance at each specific level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0034654313478021">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>). Future research would benefit from adopting this approach.</p>
<p>When reviewing <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0034654313478021">Table 2</xref>, it is apparent that the characteristics of the learning activity were less investigated than the individual and organizational characteristics. In our view, this is no surprise, as none of the research studies focused on one specific learning activity, making it difficult to question the participants about characteristics such as the instructional design, the quality of the teaching, and supportive relationships within the group for example. Most of the studies asked in general if employees were planning on participating in <italic>a</italic> learning activity or if they had participated in <italic>a</italic> learning activity without specifying this activity. However, the results of the limited number of research studies that did include characteristics of the learning activity seem to indicate that the attention on this meso level construct is warranted. Employees do consider it important that the learning activity is relevant for practice, adapted to adult learners, and of a high quality and that enough support is provided in terms of feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034654313478021">Garavan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0034654313478021">Leisink &amp; Greenwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0034654313478021">Murray &amp; Lawry, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Another observation that deserves attention pertains to how the empirical studies measured work-related learning. As mentioned, the majority focused on formal learning. In earlier studies (e.g., beginning of the 1990s) this can be explained by the lack of attention for informal learning. But for the majority of these studies the focus on formal learning can be attributed to the fact that formal learning is a lot easier to define and identify and, as a consequence, to measure, especially in large-scale quantitative studies. In addition, several studies did include informal learning in their measures, but often in a way that did not differentiate between formal and informal learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0034654313478021">Birdi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0034654313478021">Simmering et al., 2003</xref>). Although we consider this attention for informal learning a positive development, until now no differences between formal and informal learning in terms of their antecedents could be derived from this type of research. We argue that more attention should be given to possible differences in antecedents between these two types of learning, as the results of the studies that did differentiate between them seem to indicate that different patterns might arise between formal and informal learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034654313478021">Chan &amp; Auster, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0034654313478021">Schulz &amp; Roβnagel, 2010</xref>). In general, it can be noticed that the majority of researchers did not consider the fact that different variables might be important for these different types of learning.</p>
<p>Finally, one can wonder if differences arose between empirical studies that adopted different methodologies. Within the studies selected for this systematic review, three general methodologies can be distinguished: qualitative studies, relatively small quantitative survey studies, and large-scale quantitative survey studies. As we already mentioned, this latter type of study focused on sociodemographic variables the most, resulting in a more descriptive overview of which groups of employees demonstrated higher learning intentions and participation rates. The other two types of studies were more interested in explaining these learning intentions and participation rates. We would have expected that informal learning would have been investigated the most by qualitative research studies; however, looking at the appendix we cannot conclude that this is the case for the studies included in the current systematic review. Because of the limited amount of qualitative studies (<italic>n =</italic> 5) and the overall differences among all studies, no systematic discrepancies could be identified among the studies based on the applied methodology.</p>
<sec id="section28-0034654313478021">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The current systematic review faces some limitations. A first limitation pertains to the selection of the primary studies in this review. We focused solely on empirical studies and did not include theoretical studies. As a consequence, only antecedents included in these empirical studies are presented; the potential influence of other important constructs from a theoretical point of view is therefore not discussed in our results section. Second, one of our inclusion criteria was that the studies had to consider the relation of the antecedents with the actual participation in learning activities or learning intention. Accordingly, studies that investigated differences between reasons for participation without including actual participation were not included; neither were studies focusing solely on learning outcomes.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study refers to the fact that different primary studies measured learning in various ways. Where possible we have tried to make the appropriate distinctions, but nevertheless some of the results presented in this review study are less nuanced in comparison with the primary study itself. Finally, this review study does not escape the traditional limitation of possible publication bias. Because of the difficulty in retrieving unpublished work, this study focused on published studies. However, it can be mentioned that discussion is arising concerning this publication bias. For example, the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0034654313478021">Dalton, Aguinis, Dalton, Bosco, and Pierce (2012)</xref> provided empirical evidence that falsifies the assumption that inflation bias occurs because of the fact that statistically nonsignificant results are less likely to be published.</p>

<title>Future Research</title>
<p>This review examined 56 studies in answering its research questions. With only 12 of these studies dated from before 2000, it can be concluded that this is a relatively new field of research. This novelty is also visible in the results of this review study; within 56 studies, 117 possible antecedents were considered. Keeping in mind that several studies primarily focused on sociodemographic variables, it should not be a surprise that the research on work-related learning gives a scattered impression, with many antecedents that included in only a small number of studies or even a single study. Future research should try to build a coherent model rather than including every possible variable that might potentially be related to work-related learning. By providing an overview of the existing research and using our own heuristic framework, this review study has hopes to contribute to the future coherence of this field of study.</p>
<p>Although the current empirical research recognizes informal learning, it does not seem to consider the fact that formal and informal learning might have different antecedents. Future research would benefit from an examination of this issue. Taking both formal and informal learning into account and differentiating between them might not only enable us to identify mutual and distinct antecedents but also allow us to investigate empirically how both forms of learning relate to each other. For example, future research could confirm empirically if formal and informal learning are indeed complementary to each other (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0034654313478021">Leslie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0034654313478021">Shipton et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been argued in the introduction that a need for continuous work-related learning is being experienced as the nature of jobs is constantly changing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034654313478021">Baert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0034654313478021">Maurer et al., 2003</xref>). This evolution in the nature of jobs is expected to increase learning intentions of employees, in terms of both numbers of employees and the volume and intensity of learning intentions. Keeping this in mind, it is remarkable that the relationship between learning intention and job characteristics—especially in the knowledge intensive branches of the labor market—has not been investigated by many studies. Future research could investigate if this expectation holds up.</p>
<p>Finally, in line with the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034654313478021">Garavan et al. (2010)</xref>, it might be interesting for future research to focus on more specific learning activities rather than a general measure of development activities, to identify which elements of the learning activity (subjects, delivery modes, didactic, guidance, duration, composition of the group, certification, etc.) are taken into account by the employee during his or her decision-making process. The research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0034654313478021">Boeren, Nicaise, and Baert (2012)</xref>, for example, already showed that satisfactory learning experiences relate strongly to the perception of the classroom environment, whereas the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034654313478021">Hurtz and Williams (2009)</xref> shows that positive prior experiences predict the participation of employees in learning activities. It is to be expected that these classroom variables can make a valuable contribution to the research on involvement in work-related learning.</p>
