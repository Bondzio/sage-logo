<abstract>
<p>Mitochondrial diseases are increasingly being recognized as causes of encephalopathy and intractable epilepsy. There is no gold-standard test for diagnosing mitochondrial disease, and the current diagnosis relies on establishing a consistent pattern of evidence from clinical data, neuroimaging, tissue biopsy, and biochemical, genetic, and other investigations. Experience in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with certain forms of mitochondrial disease, such as Alpers syndrome, is largely gained from case reports or small case series. The authors describe a case of Alpers syndrome due to <italic>POLG1</italic> mutations, including serial neuroimaging and pathological investigations, to illustrate two main points: (1) Unique characteristics evident on serial diffusion-weighted imaging can be a valuable indicator of Alpers syndrome; and (2) abnormal lipid metabolism can be present in Alpers syndrome, which may need to be considered when using a ketogenic diet.</p>

<p>Alpers syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 203700) is a mitochondrial disease originally described as a triad of psychomotor retardation, intractable epilepsy, and liver failure in a patient with <italic>POLG1</italic> gene mutations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811423973">1</xref>
</sup> Mitochondrial diseases are increasingly being considered as causes of intractable epilepsy, with reliance on tissue histopathology and biochemistry to provide a diagnosis. There is very little data on the natural history of the clinical and pathological changes that occur over time in Alpers syndrome. Although the ketogenic diet has been tolerated in patients with Alpers syndrome, we are not aware of reports describing postmortem evidence of disordered fat metabolism.<sup>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 9-month-old boy with mild developmental delay presented with a prolonged generalized seizure. His exam at baseline showed hypotonia, but his brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram were normal. Within another 2 weeks, an independent area of epilepsia partialis continua developed in the right upper extremity. Despite trials of a number of anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, intravenous gamma globulin, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, the seizures could not be controlled.</p>
<p>On the suspicion of mitochondrial disease, muscle and liver biopsies were performed within a month of presentation; these showed normal histopathology, electron microscopy, and electron transport chain biochemistry. There were no clinical markers of liver disease; and liver enzyme testing showed only mild elevations in gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase. Tests of synthetic liver functions were normal.</p>
<p>A repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain 1 month later demonstrated linear areas of restricted diffusion (hyperintense diffusion-weighted imaging but heterogeneously reduced apparent diffusion coefficient maps) along the cortical ribbon of the right Rolandic cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811423973">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811423973">1B</xref>). Multivoxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated increased lactate at multiple locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811423973">Figure 1C</xref>). Another magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain was performed at 12 months of age during a precipitous decline in the patient’s condition including near complete plegia and obtundation. Similar new diffusion lesions were evident throughout multiple locations including the deep grey matter, occipital and sylvian cortices, and widespread areas of the cerebral hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811423973">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>Neuroimaging. Early diffusion-weighted images (A) and apparent diffusion coefficient maps (B) demonstrate restricted diffusion within the cortical ribbon of the posterior right frontal lobe. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrates a lactate doublet in multiple locations including right frontal lobe (C). Repeat magnetic resonance imaging 8 weeks later (D) shows restricted diffusion lesions in both thalami, left perisylvian cortex, and left occipital lobe, and extensive hemispheric lesions (left to right).</p>

</fig>
<p>At 13 months of age, the parents made an informed decision to trial a ketogenic diet as a final effort to help control continuous seizures. The diet was well tolerated, and seizures abated substantially for the first time in months. However, the patient’s general health did not improve. He progressed to a decreased level of consciousness, congestive heart failure, and respiratory difficulty and died at 14 months of age.</p>
<p>The most striking gross finding at autopsy was a greatly enlarged and yellow liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811423973">Figure 2A</xref>) with diffuse steatosis on microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811423973">Figure 2B</xref>). Lipid deposits were present in the proximal renal tubular epithelial cells. Ultrastructural examination of the liver revealed excessive crowding of the mitochondria within the hepatocytes. Many of the mitochondria were devoid of cristae; others showed disorganized and transversely arranged cristae, and there was a complete absence of dense matrix granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811423973">Figure 2C</xref>). Similar mitochondrial changes were present in the proximal renal tubular epithelial cells.</p>

Mild swelling of the mitochondrial matrix and of cellular processes of the parenchyma is due to postmortem autolysis. Mitochondria of neuronal somata in the grey matter appeared similar. These cerebral mitochondria contrast with the ultrastructurally altered mitochondria of the liver in this same case (Figure 2C).</p>

<p>Neuropathological examination revealed symmetrical but multifocal ischemic encephalopathy with laminar necrosis and neuronal degeneration in the cerebral cortex (especially in the temporal and occipital lobes), hippocampi, olfactory bulbs, and cerebellum associated with gliosis. Periventricular regions did not exhibit the degenerative lesions or dystrophic calcifications associated with Leigh encephalopathy. Microinfarcts were found in the cerebellar cortex. The abnormal areas visualized by magnetic resonance imaging and those with lactate peaks on spectroscopy, both in cortex and deep structures, did not show special histological distinction by immunocytochemical reactivities for neuronal and glial markers. Tau protein, ubiquitin, and α-synuclein were not overexpressed, as is seen in many neurodegenerative diseases. Up-regulation of α-B-crystallin was demonstrated in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and diffusely throughout the cerebrum and brainstem. Myelination was normal. No inflammation was present. Transmission electron microscopy of the cortex and white matter showed no ultrastructural alterations of neuronal or glial mitochondria; cristae were well preserved without stacking or whorling or forming paracrystallin structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811423973">Figure 2D</xref>). Metabolic storage products, including excessive lipofuscin, and viral inclusions were not demonstrated. Gross inspection of the spinal cord revealed excessive extradural adipose tissue surrounding nerve roots and dorsal root ganglia, including the cauda equina, but neural structures remained well preserved.</p>

<title>Biochemical and Molecular Genetic Testing</title>
<p>DNA sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome and deletion analysis by Southern blotting of the mitochondrial genome did not identify a mutation (S. L. Hume, Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, University of Alberta Hospitals, Edmonton). Comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH; MitoMet V1 oligonucleotide array; Lee-Jun C. Wong, Medical Genetics Laboratory, Baylor College of Medicine) showed no copy number abnormalities in nuclear genes. Mitochondrial DNA copy number in blood was 43% of control values (Lee-Jun C. Wong, Medical Genetics Laboratory, Baylor College of Medicine). Sequencing of the polymerase gamma1 (<italic>POLG1</italic>) gene revealed a heterozygous c.1399G&gt;A (p.A467T) known mutation and a novel c.3562T&gt;C (p.C1188R) unclassified variant predicted to be deleterious (Lee-Jun C. Wong, Medical Genetics Laboratory, Baylor College of Medicine). Each parent was heterozygous for these mutations and asymptomatic.</p>
<p>On 1 out of 3 occasions, urine 3-methyl glutaconic acid was elevated at 20.5 (norma11.9-9.1 mmol/mol creatinine; F. Snyder, University of Calgary) with normal plasma 3-methyl glutaconic acid on all occasions.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial electron transport chain analysis from vastus lateralis muscle showed a reduced complex IV specific activity of 4 (control 6-35 nmol/min/mg protein), complex V specific activity of 32 (normal 42-160) with a citrate synthase control activity of 55 (normal 44-160), and normal complex II, III, and synergistic I+III activities (J. Marin, Molecular Cardiology and Neuromuscular Institute Inc, New Jersey).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This case illustrates the challenges in diagnosing mitochondrial disease in patients with intractable epilepsy. Although only a single case, our findings suggest a number of potential clinical and investigational markers, including diffusion-weighted imaging, fat metabolism, and neuropathological studies. Further descriptions of such markers are required to determine their clinical utility in the care of children with mitochondrial disease.</p>
<p>Despite early findings on liver and muscle pathology that were unremarkable, at autopsy the liver showed substantive mitochondrial abnormalities and was engorged with fat. Considering that an earlier liver ultrasound was normal, we hypothesized that Alpers syndrome can have an underlying problem with fat metabolism. Based on a single case report, we cannot be certain whether this is part of the natural history of the disease or whether there can be any effect of the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>The use of a ketogenic diet in Alpers syndrome has recently been reported, but we are not aware of any histopathological studies on tissues at postmortem.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811423973">2</xref>
</sup> Despite the appearance of the liver, the ketogenic diet appeared well tolerated in our patient and seizure control improved, but there was eventual progression of congestive heart failure and respiratory weakness. Recently published consensus guidelines on the use of the ketogenic diet do not include diseases with <italic>POLG1</italic> mutations (such as Alpers syndrome) or mitochondrial depletion on the list of contraindications. Macroscopically, fatty accumulation was most notable in the liver and extradurally. Microscopically, fatty accumulation of the internal organs mostly affected the liver, with sparing of the heart, kidneys, and skeletal muscle. However, with such severe mitochondrial dysfunction, it is certainly reasonable to question how well a patient can handle a diet rich in lipids.</p>
<p>Distinct neuroimaging, specifically diffusion-weighted imaging, was the earliest clinical marker beyond the clinical syndrome, similar to a recent report by Visser and colleagues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811423973">3</xref>
</sup> Key differences from the well-described restricted diffusion lesions of ischemia include nonadherence to known arterial territories, predilection for the cortical ribbon as well as deep grey structures, heterogeneous apparent diffusion coefficient signal that does not normalize over 7 to 10 days, and a lack of focal atrophy over time. The diffusion-weighted imaging signal change was not restricted to any vascular territory, as noted by earlier reports.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811423973">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811423973">5</xref>
</sup> We did not identify any clear relationship with the neuropathological findings and neuroimaging. Clinically, there was no hypoxemia until the time of death or hypoglycemia at any point in the course of the illness, although this does not exclude the possibility of hypoglycorrhachia.</p>
<p>The neuropathological findings were not specific enough to be diagnostic of a mitochondrial encephalopathy,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811423973">6</xref>
</sup> but ischemic alterations are frequent in many mitochondrial cytopathies involving the brains of infants, in particular. Ultrastructural changes of mitochondria often are more prominent and frequent in endothelial cells of cerebral capillaries than in neural cells and can lead to ischemic changes, cortical laminar necrosis, and microinfarcts. Posterior hemispheric changes resembling ischemia also occur in hypoglycemia. In Alpers syndrome, more severe involvement of the striate (occipital) cortex is one of the hallmark neuropathological features,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811423973">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811423973">7</xref>
</sup> as seen in our case. Overexpression of several proteins not normally seen after early fetal life, such as tau, ubiquitin, and α-synuclein, occurs in many neurodegenerative diseases but were not demonstrated in this case or reported in Alpers syndrome. Up-regulation of α-B-crystallin in glial cells throughout the brain in our case is abnormal and can be attributed to several causes: chronic ischemia, hypoglycemia, neurodegenerative processes, and epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811423973">8</xref>
</sup> No evidence of viral encephalitis or other inflammatory encephalopathies was demonstrated in our case, and there were no intracerebral calcifications. The findings of hepatic encephalopathy, including Alzheimer type II astrocytes, were absent in the brain, despite the liver involvement. Lack of ultrastructural alterations of mitochondria in the brain (Figure 2D) was consistent with previous reports that neuronal and glial mitochondria at times are enlarged, but with preserved cristae in Alpers syndrome,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811423973">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811423973">10</xref>
</sup> although even this mild finding is not universally seen in all patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811423973">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Considering the normal early-tissue pathology and biochemical studies for mitochondrial disease, we found the electroencephalogram (rhythmic high-amplitude delta with superimposed spikes) and mutation testing for <italic>POLG1</italic> mutations to be invaluable in finalizing a diagnosis, and we suggest that gene testing is an essential component of searching for mitochondrial causes of intractable epilepsy.<sup>
