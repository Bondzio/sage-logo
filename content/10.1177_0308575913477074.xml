      <p>This is the first edition of <italic>Adoption &amp; Fostering</italic> under BAAF’s co-production arrangement with Sage. In these economically testing times, it is more important than ever to continue to enhance the fostering and adoption services painstakingly built up over many years, so this new coalition between professional development and publication expertise is especially welcome.</p>
      <p>The benefits of combining skills were brought home to me by a recent exhibition in London on the Bauhaus movement in Germany between 1919 and 1933. I was interested in this not just because I worked for nearly 20 years in Bauhaus-inspired buildings on the Dartington Hall estate,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0308575913477074">2</xref>
         </sup> but also because much Bauhaus thinking is echoed in current approaches to the care of separated children.</p>
      <p>The Bauhaus philosophy stressed the benefits of high-quality crafts, working together using the best materials and scientific knowledge available, a focus on detail at all levels, from town planning to the design of furniture and fittings, the importance of toys for children’s healthy development and an emphasis on warm relationships. In addition, there was an economic dimension: its products were capable of widespread replication and offered value for money.</p>
      <p>These values are mirrored in much current childcare practice, from overarching ideas, such as the ecological perspective enshrined in needs-assessment frameworks, respect for children’s views and feelings, and sensitivity in the details of care settings. Indeed, it is especially fitting that expressing these ideas coincides with the journal’s tribute to John Triseliotis, a rigorous academic but also a great humanist, who never lost his concern for the day-to-day experiences of fostered and adopted children. We reprint part of his influential book, <italic>In Search of Origins: The experiences of adopted people</italic>, a publication sufficiently significant to be cited in articles on this subject 40 years on.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0308575913477074">3</xref>
         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>But away from this heady idealism, we cannot ignore some sinister parallels between children’s services and the Bauhaus movement. Alongside its success, it attracted hangers-on and frauds, sound ideas were contaminated by dietary and spiritual crankiness, and critics oversimplified the movement as ‘back to basics’. Even more worrying is that its eventual demise was hastened by the Great Depression and the withdrawal of public funds, and its closure was enforced by those who claimed to know what was best, only to disappear themselves just over a decade later.</p>
      <p>There are also lessons to be learned from the subsequent careers of the Bauhaus founders. Gropius, Klee and van der Rohe moved away to achieve success elsewhere, but the architect Ehrlich stayed put and tried to keep going against the odds, only to end up designing the cell blocks and gateway lettering of the concentration camp that imprisoned him.</p>
      <p>After visiting the exhibition, my colleagues discussed what could be learned from the exhibition for looking after children. One cynic proposed a role play incorporating the goodies and baddies around the time of the closure, and casting suggestions were soon forthcoming. But a more serious idea was to see if Bauhaus thinking could strengthen the link between grand, overarching concepts, viable and effective action and details of the day-to-day experience of children.</p>
      <p>This may not seem particularly dazzling but such interconnected thinking might just help improve the link between theory and practice, increase the quality of ‘drudgery divine’, and ensure universal high-quality care in times when economic forces demand value for money and demonstrable effectiveness – long-standing ambitions of this journal that both BAAF and Sage are committed to continue.</p>
