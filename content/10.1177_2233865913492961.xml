        <p>The objective of this article is to assess the current political developments in Myanmar
          and the impact of the democratic transition on the country’s persistent ethnic conflicts.
          It analyses the dynamics in the triangular relations between the ruling elite, the
          democratic opposition and the ethnic groups – the three necessary parties in any peace
          process. It also examines some of the internal lines of conflict within each of these
          parties and delineates four scenarios related to various possible outcomes of the
          elections in 2015. The argument of the article is that democratization does not in itself
          provide a viable solution to the war-torn country. Without a political process that
          involves all ethnic groups, aiming to target core problems in the Constitution and to
          secure genuine political representation and self-determination for Myanmar’s minority
          populations, there is little hope for lasting peace.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Expectations are running high for the political reforms and the democratic transition to
        succeed in Myanmar (Burma). The process that gained momentum as President Thein Sein
        announced his reform agenda after taking office in March 2011 represents the best
        opportunity in half a century to bring peace and progress to the troubled country. With the
        reforms, new ceasefire agreements have been signed, media censorship eased and political
        prisoners released, in turn leading to the suspension of international sanctions and
        increased anticipation in Myanmar for economic progress. It is also expected that the
        general elections in 2015 will mark Myanmar’s shift into a full-fledged democracy. The
        question remains, however, if democracy will also bring peace.</p>
      <p>The assumption that democracy will be the solution to all of the country’s problems has
        been widely held among many of those struggling for democracy in Myanmar. The academic
        literature on democratization and peace, however, reveals a different reality. As Hegre et
        al. have shown, regime change clearly and strongly increases the probability of civil war.
        They have also shown that semi-democracies are more likely to experience civil war than
        either democracies or autocracies, and moreover that these two factors are partly
        overlapping, yet complementary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2233865913492961">Hegre et
          al., 2001</xref>). That ethnically divided countries are unlikely to see democratic
        transitions without conflict, as argued by Horowitz among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2233865913492961">Horowitz, 1993</xref>), is also supported by this study. In
        fact, they found that the probability of civil war is twice as high in countries where the
        largest ethnic group constitutes half the population as in countries where it accounts for
        95% of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2233865913492961">Hegre et al.,
          2001</xref>). For an already civil war-torn country like Myanmar, where the Bamar majority
        constitutes roughly 65% of the total population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2233865913492961">Smith, 1999</xref>: 30), and where the deomcratization
        process has been slow and tedious, and by all probability will continue to be so, there are
        good reasons for concern. In fact, since the start of the democratic transition in 2010 we
        have already seen a significant rise in battle-related deaths in Myanmar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2233865913492961">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2233865913492961">1</xref></sup></p>

      </fig>
      <p>The peace process and the ceasefire talks have led to an increase, rather than a decrease,
        in violent incidents. War has raged in Kachin State since a 17 year ceasefire broke down in
        June 2011. This war escalated drastically with the Myanmar army’s offensive over the
        Christmas holiday in 2012. There are also repeated reports of clashes between the Myanmar
        army and ethnic minority armies in Shan State and Kayin State.</p>
      <p>As suggested by Cederman et al., democratization may also trigger new conflicts through the
        opening of the political arena, political competition producing winners and losers, and the
        destabilizing sequencing of democratic procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2233865913492961">Cederman et al., 2010</xref>: 387). This may help explain why
        serious communal riots between Buddhist Rakhine and Muslim Rohingya in Rakhine State erupted
        in June and October 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2233865913492961">International
          Crisis Groups, 2012</xref>: 2–6) – a conflict that thus far has left more than 160 people
        dead and over 100,000 displaced, and thousands of homes burned (the vast majority of the
        victims are Rohingya).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2233865913492961">2</xref></sup>
        There was also a series of attacks on Muslims in communal riots in the central parts of
        Myanmar in March and April 2013.</p>
      <p>As long as Myanmar’s persistent ethnic conflicts – its main political challenge – remain
        unsolved, it is fair to predict that the trend of increased violence will continue through
        the decisive elections in 2015 and well into 2016. During political reforms and elections,
        the political stakes are high, and conflict may further increase. Yet what will be the
        long-term effect of the reforms?</p>
      <p>In line with the studies referred to above, the argument of this article is that
        democratization does not in itself provide a viable solution to the country’s ethnic
        conflicts. Without a political process that involves all ethnic groups, aiming to target
        core problems in the Constitution and to secure genuine political representation and
        self-determination for Myanmar’s minority populations, there is little hope for lasting
        peace. With this hypothesis as a starting point, a research team of four researchers of
        peace and conflict from Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) and Uppsala University
        conducted amongst themselves nine research trips to Myanmar (Central Myanmar, Kachin State
        and Shan State) and its border areas in China and Thailand, over the course of 2012 and into
        the first months of 2013.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2233865913492961">3</xref></sup>
        As part of the team, this author carried out three research trips, interviewing several
        ethnic minority leaders in political parties, armed groups, religious groups and civil
        society organizations, as well as Burmese and international Myanmar analysts. The team also
        organized a conference on the impact of political reforms on Myanmar’s ethnic conflicts, in
        Myanmar, on 13–14 October 2012, and a similar seminar in Oslo on 13–14 December 2012, where
        several prominent Burmese and International Myanmar scholars contributed. Moreover, at the
        conference in Myanmar, more than 30 representatives of political parties and civil society
        organizations in Myanmar participated. The interviews, discussions and field observations
        from these research trips and events form the basis of the analyses presented here.</p>
      <p>The objective of the article is to assess the current political developments in Myanmar and
        analyse the dynamics in the triangular relations between the three necessary parties in any
        peace process: (1) the ruling elite (Thein Sein’s government, the Union Solidarity and
        Development Party (USDP) and the Tatmadaw); (2) ethnic groups (political parties, armed
        groups and civil society groups); and (3) the democratic opposition (the National League for
        Democracy (NLD), the National Democratic Force (NDF), the 88 Generation and civil society
        groups). These three parties, which I also will refer to as power centres, are heterogeneous
        groups with diverse – sometimes divided – interests. They nonetheless represent the
        principle political groupings in Myanmar modern history. The article will also examine some
        of the internal lines of conflict within each of them, that is, between the government and
        the army; between the ethnic political parties and the ethnic armed groups, and between the
        various different ethnic groups; and between the NLD and other political opposition forces.
        Finally it delineates four scenarios related to various possible outcomes of the elections
        in 2015.</p>

      <title>Ethnic armed conflicts and civil war</title>
      <p>The Union of Burma never managed to unify after its founding in 1948. The transition from
        colonial rule to independence was marred by internal strife and conflict, and with the
        assassination of General Aung San and six of his cabinet ministers on 19 July 1947, the
        spirit of the Panglong agreement, aiming for an independent Burma by bringing together Burma
        proper and the frontier areas, had already perished. Only months after independence, the
        Communist Party of Burma (CPB) and some Arakanese groups rebelled. In 1949 the Karen
        National Union (KNU) took up arms, and since then, Burma – later to be known as Myanmar –
        has been in a continuous state of armed conflict and civil war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2233865913492961">4</xref></sup> Out of the 135 official ethnic groups, where
        eight major ethnic nationalities are the most dominant, there have emerged more than 30
        different ethnically designated armies fighting the Burmese government as well as each
        other. A number of politically or economically motivated armed groups were also drivers of
        the country’s frontier conflicts, most notably the influential CPB until its demise in
        1989.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of the 1980s the conflict changed. With the fall of the CPB, the Burmese
        government seized the opportunity to negotiate ceasefires with Kokang (MNDAA) and Wa (UWSA)
        mutineers from the CPB. This gave the Burmese army, the Tatmadaw, the chance to concentrate
        on escalating its offensive against its other major enemy, the KNU and other KNU-allied
        ethnic armed groups in the National Democratic Front. When student democracy protesters, who
        fled to the jungle from the 1988 crackdown, joined these armed groups, this marked an
        additional incentive to step up the war. The abuse and violence in border areas were
        devastating, not least for the civilian population, who continued to suffer under the ‘four
        cuts’ strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2233865913492961">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The National Democratic Front which, during the 1960s and 1970s, had received tactical
        support from Thailand as it was regarded as an anti-communist stronghold during a
        politically tense period, had lost its strategic value. The front was additionally weakened
        by the ceasefire between the government and National Democratic Front member, the Shan State
        Army (SSA), in 1989. When another major National Democratic Front member, the Kachin
        Independence Organization (KIO), in 1994 also reached a ceasefire agreement, the pressure on
        the remaining eastern border areas escalated further.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2233865913492961">6</xref></sup> A split within the KNU the same year also
        contributed to this escalation. The Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) rebelled against
        KNU’s predominantly Christian leadership and was soon met with a ceasefire proposal from the
        government and means and incentives to fight their former allies in the KNU.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2233865913492961">7</xref></sup> The combination of these events
        led to the fall of the KNU headquarters in Manerplaw (1995), and since then, fighting ethnic
        armies in Eastern Myanmar have been subjected to guerrilla activities along the Thai/Myanmar
        border. Repeated attempts to reach a ceasefire agreement between the government and the KNU
        all failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2233865913492961">Keenan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2233865913492961">Kramer, 2009</xref>: 8–15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2233865913492961">Lintner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2233865913492961">Smith, 1999</xref>: chapters 17–19; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2233865913492961">Taylor, 2009</xref>: 433–445).</p>
      <p>The number of people killed in battles in Myanmar was significantly reduced after 1995
          (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2233865913492961">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-2233865913492961">8</xref></sup> This was due to the fall of the
        CPB, the successful policies of the junta in achieving ceasefire agreements with as many as
        17 armed groups (particularly the truce with Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the
        United Wa State Army and the Shan State Army in 1989 and with the Kachin Independence
        Organization in 1994), and the partly successful repression of remaining fighting ethnic
        armies. The number of fatalities in clashes between the Thatmadaw and ethnic armed groups
        remained remarkably low until the resurgence of war with the KIO in June 2011, something
        that led to significantly improved living conditions for the civilian population in ethnic
        minority areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2233865913492961">Zaw Oo and Win Min,

      <p>However, the country’s ethnic conflicts were far from solved. Twelve armies remained as
        non-ceasefire groups and fighting continued in large parts of Myanmar’s border areas.
        However, even among the ceasefire groups there were no signs of a lasting peace. Although
        many of the earliest ceasefire agreements involved prevalent self-governing, it was
        explicitly communicated that these arrangements were only temporary. The Myanmar regime
        expected from the ceasefire groups that, once a new Constitution was in place, they would
        integrate and be represented in the political institutions of the union. However, none of
        the ethnic groups on their part were content with the political process leading up to the
        2008 Constitution, and as political negotiations and constitutional amendments are the main
        demands of these groups today, it is worth giving a brief analysis of the main aspects of
        the democratization process, before discussing the current political situation.</p>

    <sec id="section3-2233865913492961">
      <title>The democratization of Myanmar</title>
      <p>The democratization of Myanmar is a state-controlled and top-down affair. While a broad
        democracy movement (which includes many ethnic groups) has put continuous pressure on the
        regime, both from within the country and from exile, and has possibly contributed to
        enforcing some changes, these changes have all along been under the firm control of the
        military regime – initially the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), then the
        State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), before the government of Thein Sein took over in
        2011. The National Convention convened in 1993 was the SLORC’s first attempt to develop a
        new Constitution for Myanmar, the third of its kind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-2233865913492961">9</xref></sup> Ethnic minority representation was limited
        and, by and large, hand-picked by the regime. Only 15% of the delegates were chosen among
        those elected in the general elections of 1990, which were overwhelmingly won by the NLD. In
        1995, those few members who represented the NLD were expelled after boycotting the meetings,
        and by 1996 the whole Constitution-making process was given up and the convention
        adjourned.</p>
      <p>In 2003 the SLORC’s successor, the SPDC, made another attempt and launched its ‘roadmap to
        a discipline-flourishing democracy’. The roadmap aimed to reconvene the National Convention
        (step 1) in order to gradually introduce a ‘genuine and disciplined’ democratic system (step
        2) by drafting a new Constitution (step 3), which should be endorsed in a national
        referendum (step 4). This should in turn lead up to free and fair elections for the
        formation of the required national legislative bodies (hluttaws; step 5), where elected
        representatives should convene in accordance with the new Constitution (step 6), so a
        ‘modern, developed and democratic’ nation could be built (step 7).</p>
      <p>The roadmap was announced by Prime Minister Khin Nyunt, who as head of military
        intelligence had engineered the ceasefire agreements, and must be viewed against the
        background of the 1988 uprising, which revealed not just the economic bankruptcy of the Ne
        Win era since 1962, but also the state’s lack of legitimacy and the army’s inability to live
        up to its ideal of protecting the unity of the country. The illegitimacy of the regime was
        further confirmed when the SLORC decided to ignore the results of the 1990 elections and the
        NLD’s resounding victory. After that the regime always professed that its goal was to
        relinquish some of its control and return to constitutional rule, and the ceasefires agreed
        upon with various ethnic groups were seen as means to this end. The army continued, however,
        to alienate itself from the population through its repression and monopoly on political
        power, and only in 2003, was General Than Shwe’s regime ready to launch the reform plan.</p>
      <p>The roadmap aimed to reinvent and maintain the political role of the military by making it
        constitutional and instituting a civilian government. Although Khin Nyunt was ousted from
        power and imprisoned shortly after the launch, General Than Shwe methodically, albeit
        slowly, continued the process and implemented the reform plan. This opened up new
        opportunities. However, from a democratic perspective and from the perspective of national
        reconciliation, the way the Constitution was drafted and adopted, as well as much of its
        content, was deeply flawed.</p>
      <p>In 2004, the National Convention was reconvened with new members chosen by the SPDC. Since
        more ceasefire groups were invited to take part, the number of ethnically designated
        delegates increased significantly from 215 to 633, out of a total of 1086 delegates. Their
        influence was, however, limited. In all, 104 basic principles had already been settled, and
        although these included important provisions for Self-Administrated Areas for particular
        ethnic nationalities, other provisions – notably those ensuring the dominant role of the
        military and the steadfast refusal of federalism – were deeply problematic for the ethnic
        minority delegates.</p>
      <p>The chance for delegates to influence the drafting process was restricted. One of the main
        ceasefire groups, the KIO, submitted a 19-point proposal for how the union could be rebuilt
        based on the Panglong agreement of 1947. Its core demand was democratic rights for all
        citizens, political equality for all nationalities, and the right to internal
        self-determination for all member states of the union. (In addition to the seven
        Bamar-dominated regions these are the Chin, Kachin, Karen, Karenni, Mon, Rakhine and Shan
        states.) None of KIO’s 19 proposals were taken into consideration. In fact, they were never
        put on the agenda – something that disillusioned many Kachin, as well as other ethnic
        nationalities. Today, against the backdrop of their negative experience, KIO and its Kachin
        Independence Army (KIA) have become the most recalcitrant of all the armed groups. What the
        Kachin see as a betrayal by the regime at the National Convention, together with the fact
        that the main Kachin political party was denied registration for the 2010 general elections,
        is considered a main reason why they refuse to enter into new ceasefire negotiations without
        first obtaining political concessions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-2233865913492961">10</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Another problem with the National Convention and the drafting of the Constitution was the
        absence of non-ceasefire groups. Crucial actors like the KNU, which had been in continuous
        armed conflict with the government since shortly after independence (the KNU waged their war
        against the central government in early 1949), were never consulted, although some Karen
        representation was ensured through other non-fighting representatives of the Karen
            community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-2233865913492961">11</xref></sup> To engage
        in dialogue in conditions of active warfare is of course difficult. However, to expect that
        non-ceasefire groups would later accept a Constitution they had not taken part in drafting
        was unrealistic, particularly as many issues crucial to ethnic nationalities were
        ignored.</p>
      <p>A constitutional referendum was held on 10 May 2008 (24 May in some townships) just as the
        cyclone Nargis devastated the country. Many criticized Myanmar for carrying out a national
        referendum at a time when it should have concentrated on a humanitarian effort. Allegations
        of ballot fraud were also numerous. Few therefore discovered the new Constitution’s
        potential for underpinning genuine change. The SPDC on its part claimed the process to have
        been free and fair and reported an overwhelming voter turnout and approval of the
        Constitution. The SPDC was content to finally see a prospect for transferring the
        administration of the country to a civilian government, while having obtained guarantees for
        its own ultimate power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2233865913492961">Ghai,
        2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2233865913492961">Taylor, 2009</xref>:
        487–506).</p>
      <p>On 7 November 2010 national elections were held to the new bicameral National Assembly and
        14 state and regional assemblies. Owing to discontent with the Constitution and distrust in
        the sincerity of the government based on experience from 1990, most of the political parties
        from the 1990 elections, including many ethnic political parties and the NLD, chose not to
        take part. Others were denied registration by the regime, like the Kachin State Progressive
        Party, something that prevented any real representation of Kachin in the national and state
            parliaments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-2233865913492961">12</xref></sup>
        Nonetheless, many new parties registered, many of which were derived from existing parties –
        for example the National Democratic Force (NDF), a breakaway group from the NLD, and the
        Shan Nationalities Democratic Party (SNDP), which leadership’s background is from the Shan
        Nationalities League for Democracy (SNLD), the second largest party in 1990. The decision to
        contest was controversial and the disagreements about participation in the 2010 elections
        created discord among former political allies, in the democratic opposition as well as in
        ethnic minority groups. The rationale behind participation was that involvement, despite
        shortcomings with the Constitution and the election laws, nonetheless would be preferable to
        being sidelined from the political process all together.</p>
      <p>As many as 37 political parties contested the 2010 general elections, and the majority of
        them were ethnic minority parties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-2233865913492961">13</xref></sup> At this point, however, no one imagined that the Constitution and the
        elections (which were not regarded as free and fair) would pave the way for real change.
        This only became clear when Thein Sein, the new President from the regime-loyal USDP,
        launched his reform policy in his inaugural address on 30 March 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-2233865913492961">14</xref></sup> The President moved rapidly to
        implement an ambitious reform agenda aimed at reinvigorating the economy, reforming national
        politics and improving human rights. Political prisoners were released and a new round of
        ceasefire negotiations was initiated, primarily led by the Railway Minister at the time
        (Minister at the President’s Office since August 2012), Aung Min. Within the first months of
        2012 Aung Min had reached agreements with all of the major ethnic fighting groups (former
        non-ceasefire groups), including the Shan State Army – South (Restoration Council of Shan
        State, RCSS/SSA; 2 December 2011), the Shan State Army – North (Shan State Progressive
        Party, SSPP/SSA; 28 January 2012) and the Chin National Front (6 January 2012). There was
        also the historic signing of an agreement with the KNU (7 February 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2233865913492961">South, 2012</xref>: 35).</p>
      <p>To some extent, the new round of ceasefire agreements represents a clear continuity from
        the policies of the central government in the 1990s and the first decade of the twenty-first
        century. However, in other aspects it marks a new era in Myanmar politics. The new ceasefire
        agreements are written as opposed to the previous oral agreements and they are firmly
        grounded in the government, not just individuals. Moreover, there has all along been a clear
        understanding between all parties that a political dialogue will follow the truce. In sum
        these aspects represent a long-awaited positive change with hopes for peace. However, the
        full picture is ambiguous. On the one hand Thein Sein’s government has reached an agreement
        with the main former non-ceasefire groups – a major accomplishment. On the other hand, it
        has not been able to maintain its truce with the KIO, who are disgruntled with 17 years of
        ceasefire that have not provided any political solutions, only mass exploitations of the
        rich natural resources of Kachin State. Fighting erupted in June 2011 and has continued
        since then. Over the Christmas holiday in December 2012 and well into 2013, the conflict
        further escalated as the Tatmadaw launched an intensive artillery assault against the KIA
        along the road between Myitkyina and Bhamo. President Thein Sein’s announcement on the 18
        January of a unilateral ceasefire never materialized in a truce and on 26 January the
        Myanmar army seized Hkaya Bum, a strategic hill-top in the Laja Yang area close to the KIA
        headquarters in Laiza.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-2233865913492961">15</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In other words, the tables have turned since the first round of ceasefire negotiations in
        the late 1980s. The former non-ceasefire groups are now engaging in dialogue, including the
        KNU, while one of the main former ceasefire groups, the KIO, is not part of this dialogue.
        The KIO’s communication with the government largely goes through the United Nationalities
        Federal Council, and the few attempts at direct negotiations have failed to bring results.
        The Kachin are, moreover, prevented from taking part in the new political opening. KSPP was
        not allowed to register at the 2010 elections, and owing to the fighting in 2012, the 1
        April by-elections have been postponed indefinitely in Kachin State (elections to the three
        Pyithu Hluttaw seats from the Mogaung, Hpakant and Bhamo townships were suspended). With the
        renewed offensive of the Myanmar army in 2013, the outlook for peace in Kachin State remains
        grim.</p>
      <p>The political reforms and the democratization process are positive developments towards
        building peace in Myanmar and ending ethnic conflicts. However, they form only the first
        steps. A precondition for lasting peace is an inclusive political process accommodating the
        aspirations of ethnic groups with regards to internal self-determination, equal rights and
        the establishment of a federal union – the main demands from ethnic minorities since the
        founding of the Union of Burma after independence in 1948. This process, which has yet to
        take off, will have to include active participation of the following three main actors: (1)
        the ruling elite (Thein Seins government, the USDP and the Tatmadaw); (2) ethnic groups
        (political parties, armed groups and civil society groups); and (3) the democratic
        opposition (the NLD, the NDF, the 88 Generation and civil society groups). In the following
        this paper will assess the latest political developments in Myanmar and estimate the
        prospect for a successful turnout of this political process. The dynamics in the triangular
        relations between the three parties, but also between different groupings within these
        diverse parties, will be examined.</p>

      <title>Tripartite negotiations – possibilities and limitations</title>
      <p>Since the collapse of the CPB and the democratic uprising towards the end of the 1980s,
        Myanmar’s conflicts have been dominated by three parties: the ruling military elite, the
        ethnic groups and the democratic opposition. Until recently most of the democratic
        opposition was excluded from the political scene and was submitted to persecution and
        repression from the military regime. It nonetheless held moral power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2233865913492961">Mehta and Winship, 2010</xref>: 425–438). The symbolic power
        following the charisma of a leader like Aung San Suu Kyi, who embodies not only her own
        qualities, but also those of her father, General Aung San, and his struggle for independence
        and a unified Burma, is an omnipresent force that has confronted and challenged the more
        conventional power of the ruling military elite. Other leading figures, like Min Ko Naing
        and his comrades of the 88 Generation Student Group, possess a similar type of moral or
        symbolic power, and continue to build such power, although to a lesser extent than Aung San
        Suu Kyi. Ethnic groups may exercise conventional as well as moral power, but the moral power
        of ethnic leaders of political parties and civil society organizations is generally limited
        to their own ethnic communities. Armed groups, however, have supplemented this power with
        the use of violence.</p>
      <p>It has long been widely recognized that national reconciliation and a solution to Myanmar’s
        enduring conflicts require tripartite negotiations between all these power groups/centres
          (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2233865913492961">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-2233865913492961">16</xref></sup> Communication and cooperation
        have to go along all three lines. The main scope of this paper is therefore to take stock of
        the possibilities and limitations within the current situation with regard to achieving
        national reconciliation and to assess the latest developments relevant to this process.</p>

        <title>The ethnic groups</title>
        <p>With the exception of the Kachin, the relations between ethnic groups and the ruling
          elite have radically improved. Despite the serious situation in Kachin State, and repeated
          reports of clashes between ethnic armed groups and the Myanmar army in some of the
          ceasefire areas in Shan State and Kayin State, the fact that there are talks between the
          government and all ethnic armed groups and that 13 ceasefire agreements have been signed
          is a significant progress. Moreover, representatives from the government, most notably
          chief negotiator Aung Min, as well as mediators with close ties to the government, remain
          optimistic about brokering a deal with the KIO as well. Many people regarded the outlook
          for a solution in Kachin State to be improved after the May 2012 appointment of Aung Min
          as negotiator to replace Aung Thaung, who had failed to impress the KIO. By February 2013,
          however, there was still little progress and KIO had refused the invitation to meet the
          peace negotiators in Naypyitaw. Instead, initial meetings took place on more neutral
          ground in Ruili, China, on 30 October 2012 and 4 February 2013. China has since then made
          efforts to mediate, but the follow-up meeting that was to be held in April was delayed.
          There has also been the possibility of holding meetings at the headquarters of the
          powerful United Wa State Army (UWSA) in Pang Hsang, with UWSA as mediator.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-2233865913492961">17</xref></sup> However, without a halt to
          the offensives between the Tatmadaw and the KIA, there is little hope of fruitful
          discussions.</p>
        <p>While most people acknowledge the commitment of the government to work for a solution to
          Myanmar’s ethnic conflicts, there are nonetheless doubts within armed groups about its
          ability to control the powerful Myanmar army. The Tatmadaw has ignored the President’s
          ceasefire orders in Kachin State on three occasions (the latest one was issued 18 January
          2013, but the Tatmadaw continued its offensive the following day). From experience with
          earlier peace initiatives, ethnic armed groups are therefore cautious in their optimism.
          They are not likely to be fully engaged and committed before there are concrete signs of a
          political dialogue about power sharing and the rights to freely exercise their
              culture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-2233865913492961">18</xref></sup> Moreover,
          during the rainy season of 2012 it became clear that there are stark disagreements about
          the way forward within the KNU, and brigades 2 and 5 have voiced a pending attitude
          towards the peace process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-2233865913492961">19</xref></sup></p>
        <p>The demand for more political talks was repeated at the Ethnic Nationalities Conference
          held on 14–16 September 2012 in the Thai–Myanmar border area. One of its statements
          included a three-step peace plan that emphasized: (1) ceasefires; (2) implementation of
          ceasefire agreements (instead of ‘development’ as proposed by the government); and (3)
          political dialogue. A six-step roadmap for the implementation of this peace plan was also
              developed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-2233865913492961">20</xref></sup> Ethnic
          armed groups are impatient and want to take the process to the next level, and if the
          government is not able to start sincere political dialogues, their efforts to make peace
          thus far may have been in vain. While the trust in the President and key government
          negotiators like Aung Min seems to be high, representatives of the KNU, RCSS/SSA and CNF
          remain suspicious of the ruling elite’s sincerity in trying to reach a political solution.
          Many expressed distrust in the peace process and warned that the ruling elite first and
          foremost is interested in securing the status quo.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-2233865913492961">21</xref></sup></p>
        <p>This impatience is also salient among ethnic political parties. Ethnic political parties
          that boycotted the 2010 elections refused, in line with the NLD, to compete on the
          unlevelled playing field of the 2008 Constitution and objected to a political reality
          where many of their leaders and most high-profile figures were imprisoned. Revision of the
          Constitution and political concessions in regard to power sharing are therefore crucial
          issues for these parties if they are to participate in national politics. While many of
          them have decided to run for the 2015 elections after the positive outcome of the 1 April
          by-elections, like the SNLD that reregistered in May 2012, the Arakan League for Democracy
          that re-registered in April 2012 and The Mon National Democratic Front that registered as
          the Mon Democracy Party in July 2012, their demands for fundamental political change are,
          nonetheless, maintained.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-2233865913492961">22</xref></sup> Ethnic political parties that ran for parliament in 2010 have promoted
          similar demands. The major difference between the parties contesting the 1990 and 2010
          elections is their view on strategies to achieve change. It seems that these differences
          are less distinct after the entrance of the NLD on the national political arena and the
          release of political prisoners on 12 October 2011 and 13 January, 3 July and 17 September
          2012, but political parties emanating from the same ethnic group may nonetheless bear
          grudges against each other because of differences in their political strategies concerning
          national politics, or personal differences between leaders. These are challenges that must
          be overcome if ethnic groups want to take on competition from the NLD. If the NLD decides
          to run for elections in all constituencies, including those with a high proportion of
          ethnic minority voters, it is crucial for the various ethnic political parties to stand
          united (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2233865913492961">Nilsen and Tønnesson,
            2013</xref>). Another measure to avoid total electoral annihilation is to work for a
          change in the electoral laws and the implementation of a system with proportional
          representation, a system many ethnic political parties are likely to benefit from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2233865913492961">International Crisis Groups, 2012</xref>:
          18). Some Shan and Rakhine parties who believe they are able to compete against the NLD
          are nonetheless reluctant to support such changes and proportional representation was
          rejected in the SNLD’s six-point statement from their second congress in Tachilek on 2–3
          January 2013.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-2233865913492961">23</xref></sup></p>
        <p>An ethnic nationality is not just one group of people. It is a complex dynamic of
          different political forces that sometimes overlap, but also represents different
          perspectives and agendas. Although the main political objectives of each ethnic
          nationality in Myanmar are by and large the same (federalism, self-determination and
          religious and cultural rights), their viewpoints and thus their strategies to achieve
          these objectives may alter significantly. A constructive dynamic between various armed
          groups, various political parties and the emerging diversity of highly capable civil
          society groups – religious, humanitarian or community oriented groups – is therefore
          crucial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2233865913492961">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>In addition to altering viewpoints and strategies among different political forces, there
          are also differences, or cross-cutting cleavages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2233865913492961">Lipset and Rokkan, 1967</xref>), that are manifested along
          geographical, linguistic or religious lines. Among the Karen we have seen examples of
          religious tension between Christian-dominated and Buddhist-dominated Karen armies, and
          among the Chin there are divides between the north and the south, and the two main
          language groups.</p>
        <p>In a war-torn country like Myanmar, much emphasis is often put on the role of armed
          groups. It is worth reminding ourselves, however, that most ethnic minority people do not
          participate in armed struggles, but work for their political goals by other means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2233865913492961">Ardeth Maung Thawnghmung, 2012</xref>). An
          interesting development is that ethnic civil society organizations (CSO) and community
          based organizations (CBO) have emerged as mediators between the different political forces
          within ethnic groups, but also between ethnic armed groups and the government. Civil
          society played a mediating role in the early ceasefire negotiations in the late 1980s and
          early 1990s – one concrete example is the Shalom Foundation (a Kachin-lead CSO), which
          acted as a mediator during the negotiations between the KIO and the government.</p>
        <p>Civil society organizations have had to work under difficult conditions in Myanmar. To
          keep their status as officially registered organizations, a careful balance of their work
          and their statements has been vital, in order not to provoke the authorities. Civil
          society organizations have been restricted from working directly with political issues.
          Since the cyclone Nargis in 2008, however, during which CSOs and CBOs proved efficient in
          providing aid to the victims (when international aid organizations were restricted from
          providing help), they have gained confidence and trust and it has become easier to operate
          more freely. Experience has also taught them how to manoeuvre within the legal framework,
          and at all levels of mediation and peace negotiations – internal strategizing within an
          ethnic group, between ethnic groups, and not least, in the relations between ethnic groups
          and the government – civil society organizations play an active role driving reform
          processes forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2233865913492961">Kramer,

        <p>The process of developing coordinated strategies among various stakeholders within ethnic
          groups in order to stand poised for future political negotiations with the government has
          come furthest in Shan State, although the Shan State historically is the most divided and
          thus the most challenging state to unify. During a visit to Taunggyi in October 2012, I
          met with a wide range of Shan organizations that were getting prepared for the three-day
          Shan conference in November. There were preparation meetings with both the Shan political
          parties (SNLD and SNDP), civil society organizations and the SSA at the Centre for Shan
          Culture and Literature in Taungyyi, where political demands and proposals were discussed.
          Another major issue was the possible merging of SNLD and SNDP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-2233865913492961">24</xref></sup> Similar meetings were held among Shan
          groups in other states. A major survey among Shan people had been organized on issues like
          the question of federalism, the merging of Shan political parties and armed groups, the
          ability to teach the Shan language in schools and the conservation of natural resources
          and how revenues from such resources should be allocated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-2233865913492961">25</xref></sup> The Shan congress that followed in Yangon
          on 26–28 November with 150 representatives from various Shan groups and communities around
          Myanmar was the next step on the way towards a coordinated Shan position towards the peace
          process and political talks. The third step is the all-Shan State conference for peace
          that was scheduled to be held in the first part of 2013 and involves all ethnic groups
          within Shan State.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-2233865913492961">26</xref></sup></p>
        <p>The question about merging the two major Shan political parties SNLD and SNDP will be
          particularly urgent as the 2015 general elections are approaching. This issue was high on
          the agenda among MPs and party members at the SNDP headquarters in Taunggyi in October
              2012.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-2233865913492961">27</xref></sup> Similar
          discussions are on the agenda between political parties in Mon State where All Mon Region
          Democracy Party and Mon Democratic Party have agreed to merge;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-2233865913492961">28</xref></sup> in Rakhine State between the Arakan League
          for Democracy and the Rakhine Nationalities Development Party; and in Chin State between
          the Chin National Party and the Chin Progressive Party.</p>
        <p>Constructive dynamics between all political forces within each ethnic group are
          imperative if they are to achieve progress in their quest for a federal union where ethnic
          minorities enjoy equal rights and internal self-determination. Equally important is a
          well-organized united front of all the ethnic nationalities. This requires good dynamics
          between the various ethnic groups as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2233865913492961">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>A main challenge in this regard is the cross-cutting cleavages reflected in the diverse
          realities on the ground in the various ethnic-minority states or areas. Mon State and Chin
          State in particular, are poor states with relatively few natural resources compared with
          Kachin State, Shan State and Kayin State. Chin and Mon states have therefore less interest
          in keeping revenues from the extraction of natural resources, something that many ethnic
          nationalities have called for. The Rakhine Nationalities Development Party, which
          represents a state with considerable gas and oil resources, presented a proposal to the
          Pyidaungsu Hluttaw in August 2012 to change the rules in the appendix to the country’s
          2008 Constitution to allocate a percentage of revenue from natural resources to each of
          the country’s states and regions. The proposal gained support, perhaps surprisingly, from
          Minister Soe Thane at the President’s office.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-2233865913492961">29</xref></sup> For the poor Chin State, on the other
          hand, which has few natural resources, subsidized development projects creating jobs and
          improving infrastructure would be more beneficial to the local people. As it would be
          considerably easier for the government to give concessions in these matters, the
          government aims to engage in a political dialogue and negotiate a deal with Chin State
          first, before taking on the more challenging demands from ethnic-minority states richer in
          natural resources. However, during the second phase of the union-level peace talks between
          the Chin National Front and the government that took place at the Myanmar Peace Centre 7–9
          December 2012, the CNF proved to be a strategic and tough negotiator and must have taken
          the government’s peace negotiating team by surprise. The signed agreement largely mirrored
          the CNF positions prior to the talks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-2233865913492961">30</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Another challenge is the different views on autonomy or self-determination among the
          various ethnic groups. The different interest of the Pa’O ethnic group and the Shan ethnic
          groups in Shan State is illustrative. The Pa’O group, which is the second largest ethnic
          group in Shan State, in addition to populating parts of Kayin and Kayah State, has a long
          record of cooperation with the ruling elite. The Pa’O National Organization (PNO) with its
          Pa’O National Army reached a ceasefire agreement with the SPDC in 1991. Since then the PNO
          has cooperated closely with the government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-2233865913492961">31</xref></sup> PNO took an active part in the National
          Convention that drafted the 2008 Constitution and as a result the Pa’O was granted three
          Self-Administered Zones of Shan State, the Hopong, Hsihseng and Pinlaung townships. From a
          PNO point of view, this was a major achievement and the party’s political goal is to
          establish more such self-administrative zones in Shan State and in Kayin and Kayah
              State.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-2233865913492961">32</xref></sup> From a Shan
          point of view, however, the Self-Administered Zones of the Pa’O and the Wa in Shan State
          are not seen as steps towards autonomy or self-determination, but rather as a deliberate
          attempt by the ruling elite to split Shan State and undermine it as a political
              force.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-2233865913492961">33</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Nonetheless, in regard to core demands of internal self-determination and federalist
          principles and the securing of religious and cultural rights, the ethnic groups are
          relatively united, and groups with different interests, like the SNDP and the PNO in Shan
          State, claim to work well together. Ethnic minority organizations have a long tradition of
          cooperation, and the building of alliances goes back to the Panglong conference in 1947
          and the significant Taunggyi conference in 1961. This is not to say that there have not
          been divisions between ethnic nationalities. Various ethnic armed groups have previously
          nurtured loyalties to alliances that have rivalled alliances of other ethnic armed groups,
          most notably pro-CPB or anti-CPB (i.e. National Democratic Front) alliances. Since the
          democracy uprising of 1988, however, and the fall of CPB, these rivalries have been less
          prominent, and ceasefire groups as well as non-ceasefire groups have been engaged in
          dialogue and strategy meetings. Today, it is particularly the Ethnic Nationalities Council
          and the United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) that play this role. While the Ethnic
          Nationalities Council is a state-based organization established in 2001, the UNFC was
          established in 2011 and is a broad coalition of the armed and political ethnic groups. The
          challenge for these coalitions is not so much in uniting on a common platform, but rather
          in remaining unified when engaging in the realpolitik and compromises that negotiations
          with the government will require. While amendments to the 2008 Constitution are of high
          priority to all ethnic minorities, it is clear that it will be difficult to achieve
          substantial changes in the short run. However, ethnic minorities could also gain
          considerable political influence if they were able to campaign for more power to the
          region and state parliaments and an increase in their budgets, something that could be an
          opening for more autonomy and self-determination without controversial constitutional
          changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2233865913492961">Nilsen and Tønnesson,
            2012</xref>).</p>
        <p>Ethnic minority groups in Myanmar, armed groups, political parties and civil society
          organizations alike – with the important exception of most Kachin groups – all seem to
          support the current peace process. Despite the lack of trust in the sincerity of the
          ruling elite, most ethnic minority actors are cautious optimists. However, a lasting peace
          will require a profound political dialogue about federalism, internal self-determination
          and equal rights – a demand the Kachin also support. To achieve this goal, ethnic armed
          groups, political parties and organizations need to improve the coordination of their
          demands and strategies.</p>

      <sec id="section6-2233865913492961">
        <title>The ruling elite</title>
        <p>As mentioned above, the main driver of reform in today’s Myanmar is neither the ethnic
          organizations nor the NLD, but the government of President Thein Sein. According to the
          president, democratization has been on the ruling elite’s agenda since the ‘Roadmap to
          Democracy’ was launched in 2003 by the Prime Minister at the time, Khin Nyunt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-2233865913492961">34</xref></sup> Khin Nyunt was dismissed and
          imprisoned shortly after, but General Than Shwe continued the reform plan and followed it
          systematically. Nevertheless, at this stage, the internal dynamics within the ruling elite
          is the element in the reform process that is the hardest to determine. The most pressing
          issue is to what extent the Tatmadaw supports the reforms and how much power the Tatmadaw
          still holds over the cabinet and the MPs of the USDP. How much power are the armed forces
          willing to give up, and are they a unified actor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2233865913492961">Figure 6</xref>)?</p>
        <fig id="fig6-2233865913492961" position="float">

        </fig>
        <p>The continued conflict in Kachin State provides some indications. The President has three
          times ordered a halt to the fighting, and three times the Tatmadaw has ignored the orders.
          The army has also violated the ceasefire agreements in Shan State on a number of occasions
          and there are grave concerns among ethnic groups about extensive army movement in some
          ceasefire areas. This suggests that the army still exercises considerable power within the
          ruling elite. Indications of the inner dynamic of the ruling elite can also be found in
          the parliament and the political sphere. Thus far the military appointed MPs have not
          directly hindered the reforms of the government. The appointment of Nyan Tun as new Vice
          President has been interpreted by observers as a support to the government’s reform
          processes. In accordance with the Constitution, it was the commander-in-chief who
          nominated the Vice President (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2233865913492961">Myanmar
            Ministry of Information, 2008</xref>: Ch. III §60).</p>
        <p>It is hard to verify, but the events of the past two years suggest that the army
          acknowledges that Myanmar is changing and that the role of the army has to change with it.
          In informal statements the commander-in-chief has recognized that the army in the future
          has to be under civilian control. However, this period has also revealed that the army
          intends to exercise its constitutional prerogatives of protecting the unity of the country
          and thus continue its presence in border areas. All in all, the prospects for developing a
          democratic future for Myanmar are promising. However, with regard to building trust with
          ethnic minorities and establishing a peaceful Myanmar, the prospects are less optimistic.
          While important progress has been made in the peace process with regard to the ceasefire
          agreements and the continued peace talks, the offensive in Kachin State reveals a pattern
          from the past where the Tatmadaw continues to use military force and divide and rule
          strategies to repress ethnic armies and rebel groups. The attack on Laiza in January 2013
          resembles the attack on Manerplaw in 1995, also carried out in December and January. The
          offensive targeting Manerplaw was launched less than a year after the Myanmar government
          had reached a ceasefire agreement with the KIO. Similar to the situation with the KIO and
          KIA today, the government then was free to concentrate its military effort against the
          KNU. Although the Myanmar army failed to eradicate it, as a result of the offensive, the
          organization was for a long time a marginalized force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2233865913492961">Lintner, 1999</xref>: 413; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2233865913492961">Zaw Oo and Win Min, 2007</xref>: 42). It is fair to
          speculate that similar strategies underpinned the offensive against the KIA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-2233865913492961">35</xref></sup> By the scale of the
          operations it is clear that the attack on the KIA had backing from the top echelon of the
          army, and was not merely an offensive initiated by the regional commander. It seems,
          moreover, to have been an attack that the Tatmadaw had planned since the KIA in 2009 first
          refused to become border guard forces under the Myanmar army.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-2233865913492961">36</xref></sup> Thus, it cannot be ruled out that there
          may have even been an understanding between the army and the Thein Sein government about
          taking this calculated risk. Thein Sein, like the Comander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, owe
          their current positions to Senior General Than Shwe, and although it is believed that Than
          Shwe has left everyday politics and the governing of the union to the President and Army
          Chief, it is unrealistic to think that the former dictator does not have a say in major
          strategic issues like the war in Kachin State. To what degree he gets involved in such
          matters is nonetheless uncertain.</p>
        <p>There is also a degree of uncertainty with regard to the dynamics between the inner
          circles of the government and the remaining USDP party and its MPs, particularly those
          loyal to the speaker of the Pyithu Hluttaw, Shwe Mann. Shwe Mann was by many regarded as
          the most likely to become president in 2011. It is evident that Shwe Mann has political
          ambitions, and he has worked intensively to make the Pyithu Hluttaw a relevant political
          body. The constitutional crisis of August 2012, where the parliament disputed a ruling by
          the constitutional court and refused to abide by it – a dispute that included an unlikely
          alliance between the USDP and the NLD – has been interpreted as a power struggle between
          the parliament and the government and thus reveals a certain power struggle within the
          USDP as well. The USDP is also experiencing critique for its lack of democratic processes
          from party members. There was open criticism of the party leadership, from USDP members
          and MPs, as in October 2012 it became clear that the Chief Ministers of the region and
          state governments would be appointed as leaders of the party’s regional
              branches.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-2233865913492961">37</xref></sup> This may
          be an indicator that the USDP is also developing into a real political party (or at least
          that its members are developing into real politicians) where various interests are tried
          and contested, and where the party and its members are not merely an instrument for the
          top generals of the Tatmadaw.</p>
        <p>With the general elections coming up in 2015, President Thein Sein and his government
          know that they are in a hurry. After the elections there will be other people running the
          country, and whatever policies the current government wants to see implemented must come
          fast. While several people within the USDP (like Minister Aung Min, Minister Soe Thane and
          Speaker Shwe Mann) are likely to nurture political careers also in the future, it is
          anticipated that it will be Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD who will be ruling Myanmar in the
          coming years. (Despite the constitutional barrier that prevents Aung San Suu Kyi becoming
          president, owing to the Constitution’s Ch. III, §59f that disqualifies any person whose
          spouse or children owe allegiance to a foreign power from serving as president of the
          Union of Myanmar (her two children hold British citizenship), many people hope and believe
          that the required constitutional amendments will be made to allow her the presidency;
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2233865913492961">Myanmar Ministry of Information,
            2008</xref>.) This, of course, has implications for ethnic minorities as well and Ashley
          South has therefore noted that: ‘As a part of their calculations, armed groups must decide
          whether they expect to get a better deal from a post-2015 (presumably, NLD-dominated)
          government, with greater democratic credentials than the present regime – or if their best
          chance is now’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2233865913492961">South, 2012</xref>:
          21). The same assessments should be made by ethnic political parties. It may be easier to
          achieve concessions from people who know that others than themselves will have to deal
          with the consequences. Moreover, with a radical shift in government, considerable
          competence and knowhow will also be lost, and the new government is likely to be
          preoccupied with internal affairs.</p>
        <p>Several civil society organizations and political mediators and analysts I have
          interviewed in Myanmar identify the ruling elite as currently divided into three power
          centres led by President Thein Sein, Pyithu Hluttaw speaker Shwe Mann and
          Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing. As mentioned, there are also speculations as to the
          degree to which retired army chief General Than Shwe forms a fourth power base operating
          behind the scenes. In fact, many political organizations and civil society groups in
          Myanmar consider the construction of these three power bases as General Than Shwe’s
          attempt to control the political reform process. With three equally powerful centres or
          bases none of them are able to rule alone, and the political development is more likely to
          go according to what they believe is General Than Shwe’s plan – a slow and steady
          transition to democracy, albeit under the continued dominance of a powerful
              Tatmadaw.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-2233865913492961">38</xref></sup> The
          future of democracy, but also of peace, relies on how the balance of these power bases
          develops over the coming years. For now they seem to be equally strong, something which
          may ensure the steadfast progress of the reform processes.</p>
        <p>While the ruling elite previously has been viewed as a unified force by outsiders, the
          reform process has revealed diverse clusters of interests, some of which are the drivers
          of the reforms, and others of which work against them – and yet others that are sitting on
          the fence. The main drivers of the reforms are found in the circle around the government,
          but the democratization seems to be supported by the leaders of the Tatmadaw as well. It
          appears that a critical mass of individuals within the ruling elite has sufficient to gain
          from the opening up of the economy to support further reforms. However, there are also
          indications that strong forces, particularly within the armed forces, are more reluctant
          to accommodate the ethnic minorities’ demands for a federal state and internal
          self-determination – necessary moves to build lasting peace. There is still no real
          political dialogue between the government and ethnic groups, but the lines are open, on
          the part of both the government and the ethnic groups. A positive signal was sent by the
          government’s chief negotiator, Aung Min, when in November 2012 he claimed that he was
          ready to engage in political dialogue with all ceasefire groups, as well as with the
              KIO.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-2233865913492961">39</xref></sup> The meeting
          between Aung Min and the UNFC in Chiang Mai 20 February 2013 was also a milestone, as this
          was the first time a government delegation met directly with this coalition of armed
          groups. Whether the Tatmadaw is also ready for this kind of dialogue, however, remains an
          open question.</p>

      <sec id="section7-2233865913492961">
        <title>The democratic opposition</title>
        <p>The lines are also open between the ruling elite and the democratic opposition. The
          release of Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest 13 November 2010 and the subsequent talks in
          2011 and 2012 between her and the president are clear indications of new policies from the
          ruling elite. Her party the NLD is no longer ignored, but recognized as a political force,
          and the decision by the NLD to contest the 1 April by-elections in 2012 indicated that it
          is willing to negotiate and play a conciliatory role. The dispute over the oath where
          parliamentarians swear to safeguard the Constitution when entering parliament, on the
          other hand, was less constructive in improving the political climate (in April 2012 Aung
          San Suu Kyi and other MPs from the NLD delayed their entrance into parliament by nine days
          because they refused to take the oath). Another clear signal of the government’s open
          policy towards democratic forces came on 6 February 2013 when the New Light of Myanmar
          announced that Tin Shwe, a MP for the NDF at the Amyotha Hluttaw, had been appointed
          deputy minister of hotels and tourism – the very first opposition MP appointed to the
              Cabinet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-2233865913492961">40</xref></sup></p>
        <p>In this article, the somewhat inaccurate term ‘the democratic opposition’ refers to a
          broad coalition of political groups and activists that have challenged the ruling elite
          since the democracy uprising in 1988. The dominant group within this opposition is the
          NLD. This is first and foremost due to the immense popularity and charisma of Aung San Suu
          Kyi. The democratic opposition however, also includes a number of other political groups
          like the NDF and student’s organizations like ABSDF and the 88 Generation.</p>
        <p>Although predominantly ethnic Bamar, many ethnic minority political parties and leaders
          are also affiliated with this democratic opposition. Some of the reformists within Thein
          Sein’s government and civil society groups, sometimes referred to as the third force,
          represent a similar democratic force. However, although there seem to be no real alliances
          between the NLD and reformists in the government at this point, there are important
          overlaps in the interests of the two groups. To refer to NLD as the only democratic force
          in Myanmar is therefore misleading.</p>
        <p>While a main demand from this diverse and ambiguous group has been the implementation of
          a multi-party democracy in Myanmar, the democratic opposition is primarily an anti-regime
          constellation, rather than an eminently democratic movement. In the long struggle against
          an oppressive and brutal military regime, there has been little room for a broad debate
          about democratic principles, and many of these groups, including the NLD, lack basic
          democratic structures within their own organizations. At the same time, many of the key
          leaders, particularly from the older generation, have strong ties to the military
          institution, Aung San Suu Kyi included, whose father was a general. The democratic
          opposition is in other words exceedingly diverse and with few other focal points than
          being opposed to Myanmar’s long-ruling military regime.</p>
        <p>From a democratic perspective, the recent internal turmoil within the NLD is therefore
          encouraging. As the NLD prepared for its first national congress that was held 8–10 March
          2013 (and the following youth assembly), many party members raised their voice against
          what they experienced as undemocratic practices in the selection of delegates. The concern
          from the critics was that delegates were hand-picked by the party leadership rather than
          representing the diversity of the party. Interestingly, the leadership has all along
          denied the allegations of lack of democracy by arguing that the party has chosen the most
          competent delegates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-2233865913492961">41</xref></sup>
          Another, more direct response, was the suspension of three veteran party members in the
          Pathein township of the Ayeyarwady delta and the closure of the NLD office in Pathein in
          August 2012 after similar critique. Aung San Suu Kyi on her part has warned fellow party
          members not to ‘misuse free speech for their own benefit’. In November 2012 as many as 130
          NLD-members resigned in protest against the leadership. This shows that democratic
          principles are openly debated and that the party leadership is challenged and must expect
          to be held accountable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-2233865913492961">42</xref></sup> Similarly to the tension within the USDP, this can be viewed as a sign
          of budding democratic consciousness within practical Myanmar politics.</p>
        <p>As with the ethnic groups and the ruling elite, there is much interest concerning the
          internal dynamics within the democratic opposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-2233865913492961">Figure 7</xref>). The divide in the NLD prior to the 2010
          elections which led to the formation of the splinter party, the NDF, was harrowing,
          leading to enduring hard feelings between former allies. Similar divides may be found
          between those in the democracy movement who have navigated within the existing system and
          compromised with the regime, and those imprisoned or in exile who have not taken part in
          internal Myanmar politics. The NDF and a number of civil society organizations are part of
          the former group, while the NLD, the 88 Generation and various exile organizations are
          part of the latter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-2233865913492961">43</xref></sup> At
          present it seems as though most groups are going in the direction of supporting the reform
          processes. Nonetheless, the different groups within the democratic opposition have some
          way to go before they are able to draw from each other’s experiences and insights. Similar
          to the reunification processes that are currently unfolding between political parties in
          various ethnic minorities, a reconciliation between the NLD and the NDF would serve the
          democratic opposition well. However, it is clear that the two parties are still too far
          apart for a reunification to take place before 2015.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-2233865913492961">44</xref></sup> Many people are therefore eager to see if
          the 88 Generation might be able to play a conciliatory role within the democracy movement
          as well as between the movement and the government, and the movement and ethnic groups.
          There are also expectations that some of them might form a new political party, something
          that could help bring Myanmar closer to a multi-party democracy. At the moment the
          dominant role of the NLD (combined with the single-member constituency electoral system)
          has unintentionally threatened to undermine political plurality. It will be a challenge to
          secure a unified democratic opposition that at the same time is able to provide space for
          the diversity of interests and opinions that exists in Myanmar.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Given the historical strength of the army, and its vast constitutional prerogatives, good
          relations and cooperation between the democratic opposition and ethnic groups – to counter
          the power of the ruling elite – are of immense importance if political reforms are going
          to lead to a successful democratic transition and sustainable peace. To some extent there
          are large overlaps between the democracy movement and ethnic groups, many of which worked
          closely together both during and in the aftermath of the 1988 uprising. There are also
          close relations between the NLD and ethnic political parties that contested the 1990
          elections. The NDF and ethnic political parties with seats in the union hluttaw have
          similar good relations after cooperating on practical political issues over the past two
          years. However, while most ethnic leaders – in armed groups, political parties and civil
          society alike – have trust in Aung San Suu Kyi and believe her to be working in their
          interest, many of them are less confident as to whether the NLD and the remaining
          Bamar-dominated democratic opposition are equally sensitive to their grievances and
              needs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-2233865913492961">45</xref></sup> Moreover,
          it is worth noting that, despite Aung San Suu Kyi’s proposition to mediate between the
          government and the KIO, the KIO has thus far been reluctant to pick up on the
              offer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-2233865913492961">46</xref></sup> The ability
          of the ethnic groups and the democratic opposition to unite on a common platform for the
          future of Myanmar is therefore in doubt.</p>
        <p>The current triangular dynamics between the ruling elite, the ethnic groups and the
          democratic opposition are relatively positive with regards to developing a democratic and
          a peaceful Myanmar. For the first time there are open lines between all three parties, and
          although there are many obstacles to overcome, the potential for constructive tripartite
          talks are better than at any other time in the country’s modern history. There is,
          however, a real risk that the interests of ethnic groups may be overshadowed by a mutual
          understanding between the ethnic Bamar majorities in the ruling elite and the democratic
          opposition, where power is largely shared between the two. Internal coordination, both
          between the various ethnic groups and within each one of them, is therefore of particular
          importance if the ethnic minorities want to seize the opportunities and openings in the
          reform process. The dynamics of the current reforms reveal an implied structure where the
          ruling elite is willing to give up power to a civilian government in accordance with its
          own seven-step plan. The implied condition is that the main principles of the 2008
          Constitution for the time being remain the base for this transition. Not only does this
          mean that the army will continue to imprint Myanmar politics in the coming years. It also
          means that it will continue its domination in border areas, and that impeachments or
          trials for past atrocities against the civilian population are out of the question. These
          are difficult conditions for both the democratic opposition and the ethnic groups and it
          is likely that attempts will be made at least to challenge the Tatmadaw’s prerogatives on
          its influential position in the union hluttaw. Within this structure, however, the leaders
          of the democratic opposition and people in the central areas of Myanmar will have much to
          gain. While the ethnic minority population also has much to gain from an overall reduced
          conflict level, there is a probability that Myanmar’s transition to democracy may take
          place without giving sufficient political concessions to ethnic groups on their claim for
          federalism and internal self-determination. The reforms may bring democracy and economic
          progress in most parts of Myanmar, including improving living conditions for people in
          former conflict areas, not least if programmes like the Myanmar Peace Support Initiative
          succeed in facilitating peace dividends. This transition, however, may not depend on a
          successful peace process and there is a risk that the country may see a continuation of
          the low-tension violence in changing areas – a continuation of the developments since the
          early 1990s. Central Myanmar may prosper while the border areas continue to lag behind.
          The prospects for peace are uncertain.</p>

      <title>Prospects for peace following the 2015 elections</title>
      <p>The real test of the political reform process and its impact on ethnic conflicts is the
        2015 general elections; 2015 is the next milestone that will provide some indicators for
        Myanmar’s future. In the following I will outline four scenarios on the prospects for peace
        following 2015 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-2233865913492961">Figure 8</xref>). Scenarios
        are not predictions. They are attempts to categorize various series of events and create a
        picture of what impact they may have. In this context they are a way to structure the
        knowledge we have about current dynamics and place them into a selection of hypothetical
        cases. I here also seek to weigh the probability of their occurrence. Based on the analysis
        of this article, the outlook for democratic and economic progress in Myanmar seems to be
        relatively good. The outlook for peace, on the other hand, is more uncertain. While it is
        likely that the general conflict level will remain low, it is not given that the democratic
        transition will bring a sustainable peace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-2233865913492961">47</xref></sup></p>

      <sec id="section9-2233865913492961">
        <title>Military backlash and continued conflict</title>
        <p>The first scenario is the situation all actors in Myanmar politics are wary of. A
          military backlash and a new coup loom in the background of the political reforms and the
          peace process. The Tatmadaw, the armed forces, have intervened before when they have
          viewed their interests as threatened. The situation prior to General Ne Win’s military
          coup of 1962 was not radically different from the present peace process. Back then, U Nu’s
          government pursued a solution to the many armed struggles by discussing the demands for
          federalism and self-determination that ethnic groups had outlined during their conference
          in Taunggyi and a series of related meetings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2233865913492961">Sai Aung Tun, 2009</xref>: 401–503). A scenario where the
          Tatmadaw consider the reforms to have got out of hand and decides to take back power is a
          real possibility. A new NLD-dominated government confident from a landslide victory in the
          2015 elections may confront the military and seek to limit their privileges, by
          instigating major constitutional changes. The Tatmadaw may also fear a disintegration of
          the union if ethnic groups achieve too rapid and extensive concessions on the issue of
          federalism and self-determination in political negotiations with the present government or
          an NLD-led post-election government.</p>
        <p>However, the army would need an extreme situation to justify the use of violence and the
          staging of a coup. This could be triggered by mass protests or by extensive communal
          violence similar to the riots in Rakhine State in June and October 2012. If these riots
          extended to violent anti-Muslim sentiments in other parts of Myanmar, as seen in March and
          April 2013, this could serve as an incentive for military intervention. Anti-Chinese or
          anti-Indian violence is another possibility. A further escalation of the Kachin conflict
          or renewed armed conflict in Shan State, something that reform sceptics within the armed
          forces could provoke, would also serve as an incentive for a coup.</p>
        <p>Although the reform process is instigated and conducted by the former generals, it has
          now taken on its own dynamic, and a full return to a pre-1995 conflict level is hard to
          imagine at this point. A new coup is nonetheless the situation that would be the hardest
          blow to the positive developments of the last two years and could further increase the
          conflict level, as it is likely that both the democratic opposition and armed ethnic
          groups would be provoked by such an event. For time being, however, there are few
          indications that the reform sceptics within the ruling elite are strong enough to stage a
          coup. Moreover, all political actors in Myanmar are careful not to provoke such reactions.
          The likelihood of a military backlash thus seems unlikely.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section10-2233865913492961">
        <title>Successful democratic transition and peace</title>
        <p>The reverse scenario would be a situation where free and fair elections in 2015 lead to a
          successful transition into democracy, where the winning party, most likely the NLD and
          Aung San Suu Kyi, form a new government, either alone or in a coalition with some of the
          larger ethnic political parties or democratic parties, or even reformist elements from the
          ruling elite (i.e. some of Thein Sein’s most trusted Ministers and advisors or Shwe Mann).
          Successful tripartite negotiations prior to and in the aftermath of the elections engage
          all ethnic groups in political dialogue about power sharing and the future state formation
          of Myanmar and enable the three power centres to agree on some fundamental constitutional
          amendments – where ethnic minorities, the democratic opposition and reformists within the
          ruling elite experience cross-cutting cleavages – and thus help create a political
          solution to the country’s ethnic conflicts, which in turn could lead to disarmament and
          peace.</p>
        <p>While this scenario requires focused coordination and skilled mediation at all levels,
          between and within all the three major power bases, and although much remains with regard
          to trust-building and reconciliation, this scenario of successful democratic transition
          and peace is still possible to achieve.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section11-2233865913492961">
        <title>Successful democratic transition and continued conflict</title>
        <p>More likely, however, are the two remaining scenarios. The third scenario is similar to
          the second as it predicts free and fair elections and thus also an NLD-led new government
          in a possible coalition with other parties. However, it differs from the previous scenario
          with regard to how the question of federalism and political rights for ethnic groups are
          dealt with. The risk with a strong NLD victory in the 2015 elections is an equally strong
          ethnic Bamar domination in the political sphere. In such a situation it may be difficult
          for ethnic minorities to penetrate Myanmar politics and existing cleavages could be
          reinforced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2233865913492961">Lipset and Rokkan,
            1967</xref>). Constitutional amendments are likely to be limited to governmental reform,
          while the question about reforming the union will be ignored and the question of a federal
          union and self-determination for ethnic minorities will remain unsettled.</p>
        <p>This may in turn open up for a continuation of conflict where the government is able to
          negotiate a truce with some, perhaps even most, ethnic armed groups, while armed conflict
          will continue with others in some parts of a few ethnic states. Democracy and economic
          progress will thus be limited to central Myanmar and government-controlled parts of ethnic
          states, while the army will continue its offensives in the restive border areas, and will
          do so in compliance with the 2008 Constitution. For the majority of people in Myanmar this
          scenario will bring significant progress. Democracy and economic reforms are likely to
          have a positive effect on the livelihoods of the average population. For the part of the
          population that has suffered the most, however – the civilians in the most conflict-ridden
          ethnic areas – the outlook for the future is grimmer, although some consolation may be
          found in the statistics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2233865913492961">Figure
            2</xref> above that suggest that the number of people killed in the conflicts is likely
          to remain low or even decrease.</p>
        <p>This scenario illustrates how urgent it is for ethnic minorities to establish a firm
          footing in the political reform process as soon as possible. Coordinated demands and
          positions from the ethnic minority organizations are one important strategy, but such
          groups also need to nurture good relations with the reformists of the current government
          and the democratic opposition. If not, the likelihood of this third scenario is imminently
          probable.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section12-2233865913492961">
        <title>Political standoff and continued conflict</title>
        <p>Equally probable is the fourth scenario. The democratic transition is partly successful,
          but elections are not deemed entirely free and fair and there is discontent within the
          democratic opposition, not least in the NLD. Most ethnic political parties, with a few
          exceptions, are also discontent with the result. The power of the military-appointed
          parliamentarians is reduced, but they continue to act as guardians of the 2008
          Constitution, and thus block the possibility of further democratic progress. Aung San Suu
          Kyi is barred from becoming president, in accordance with the Constitution’s Ch. III,
          §59f. Both the democratic opposition and ethnic minorities experience reinforcing
          cleavages that decrease the chances of reaching compromises and finding solutions to
          Myanmar’s democratic deficit and civil wars.</p>
        <p>While the ruling elite is effectively marginalized from practical everyday politics,
          although the army continues to control the country’s security policies, the political
          situation remains unsolved both for the democratic opposition and the ethnic minorities.
          As an effect of this political standoff, the economic development is slower than
          anticipated and trust between the three power bases remains low.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the continued power struggle between the democratic opposition and the ruling
          elite overshadows the political demands of ethnic minority groups and the probability of
          constructive political negotiations on the question of federalism and self-determination
          for ethnic minorities is low. The peace process is reduced to maintaining ceasefires and
          initiating development projects in some of the ethnic states. Some cultural concessions
          are also given and ethnic languages are taught, but outside the regular curriculum. Such
          minor improvements are not sufficient to accommodate ethnic grievances and there is a
          potential for continued conflict, and while most armed ethnic groups will accept the
          conditions, others will not. In this scenario of a political standoff, it is likely that
          Myanmar will experience continued conflict with some ups and downs in the statistics over
          the number of people being killed in violent conflicts or battles. Given the current lack
          of trust between the three power bases and the difficulties the various actors have in
          developing sound negotiation strategies, the prospects for this fourth scenario to occur
          must be considered as likely.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Three conclusions can be drawn from this paper. The first is that, since the democratic
        reforms and the following peace efforts are state-controlled processes, there are
        limitations to what the democratic opposition and the ethnic minorities can achieve in the
        short run. The ruling elite is still the most powerful force in Myanmar, and reforms are
        implemented on its terms. This means that the constitutional amendments necessary to create
        a federal union with self-determination and equal rights for all ethnic nationalities will
        be part of a long process. Control and influence over the border areas are likely to be the
        domain where the Tatmadaw will continue to dominate. Implicit in these state-controlled
        processes is also an understanding that atrocities committed by the former regime will not
        be prosecuted. Democracy is granted in exchange for justice.</p>
      <p>The other conclusion is that the results of the 2015 general elections are likely to bring
        a political situation dominated by the interests of the Bamar ethnic group. Given the
        immense popularity of Aung San Suu Kyi, the Bamar-dominated NLD is likely to win the
        majority of seats, also in many ethnic minority areas. The interests of ethnic minorities
        and their political demands are in danger of being overshadowed by the political agenda of
        people in central Myanmar, and it is therefore urgent for ethnic minority groups (armed
        groups, political parties and civil society organizations alike) to seek influence and get a
        firm footing in the transition processes and political developments as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The current political opening and its peace process is the best opportunity in half a
        century for ethnic minorities to achieve political concessions. By engaging in the political
        discussions at the state/region and the union level and demanding political negotiations
        with the Thein Sein government, ethnic minorities have a chance to raise ethnic grievances
        and obtain political concessions. Both the ruling elite and the democratic opposition are
        currently open for political alliances, and if ethnic minority organizations and political
        parties engage on the political scene at the union level, there is a window of opportunity
        where ethnic groups can take part in defining Myanmar’s political future.</p>
      <p>The third conclusion is therefore that, although there are many burning political issues
        that currently may be hard to manage, it is imperative for ethnic minorities to use the time
        up to 2015 in order to influence the course of Myanmar politics and position themselves
        within the political framework defined by the ruling elite. One way to do this is to
        campaign for an electoral reform to implement proportional representation rather than the
        current single-member constituency electoral system, which is likely to favour the NLD in
        most ethnic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2233865913492961">International Crisis
          Groups, 2012</xref>: 18). Another opportunity is to seek to strengthen the power of the
        state/region parliaments and an increase in their budgets. This could be a step on the way
        to strengthening local self-determination and creating some autonomy, without rocking the
        most controversial paragraphs of the Constitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2233865913492961">Nilsen and Tønnesson, 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>Since the former round of ceasefire negotiations between the Myanmar government and ethnic
        armed groups, in the first part of the 1990s, Myanmar has seen a radical and lasting
        reduction in battle-related deaths. However, as a political solution was never found to the
        long-running conflicts about state formation and equal rights for ethnic minorities, the
        conflict level as well as the number of people killed have again increased with the 2010
        elections and the following political reforms and peace process. Unless these unresolved
        political issues (i.e. federalism, internal self-determination and minority rights
        concerning language, religion and culture) are handled, there is a risk that this trend will
        continue past the 2015 elections, despite well-intended efforts of peace-building on the
        part of the Thein Sein government and many ethnic armed groups. In the longer run, it is
        likely that ceasefire agreements and political integration of ethnic minorities will help
        keep the casualty figures low. However, without a political solution, repeated resurgences
        of violence and conflict will in all probability continue to plague Myanmar, and the
        incipient democracy may inherit the old regime’s most profound problem.</p>

          <p>These numbers from the Uppsala Conflict Data Programme (UCDP) give an indication of the
            number of battle-related deaths as a result of armed conflict between the Myanmar army
            and non-state armed groups since 1989. The numbers are rated in Low, High and Best
            estimates. The High estimates from 2011 and 2012 are particularly dramatic as the
            uncertainties related to the resurgence of the Kachin Conflict are exceptionally high
            (the numbers from 2012 are preliminary figures). For more on the methodology of the

          <p>The official name of the country was changed in 1989 from ‘the Union of Burma’ to ‘the

          <p>The main discrepancy between High and Best estimates prior to 1989 are due to the
            methodologically difference of numbers collected form 1975 to 1988 and the ones
            collected from 1989 onwards. Prior to 1989 there was no systematic collection of each
            event, and the Best estimates are the results of an overall assessment of media sources,
            books, journals and statements (the numbers from 2012 are preliminary figures). For more

          <p>‘Conflict level’ in this context refers to more than just the number of people killed
            in war or political strife. It also includes political unrest in general and the effect
            such unrest may have on the ability of political leaders to govern the country – at the
            union level as well as locally.</p>
