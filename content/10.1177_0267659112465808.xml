<p>MR. KEVIN CHARETTE (Piermont, New York): We wash cells with Normosol<sup>®</sup> and that does help. Babies would arrest when initiating cardiopulmonary bypass, so we came to the conclusion that we had to wash the bank blood. It helps a great deal. You will encounter many problems with the blood bank by washing bank blood, because the AABB (American Association of Blood Banks) standards are very strict now and the blood banks are trying to follow them. Cell salvage devices, in general, fall into a very gray area.We had to jump through many hoops to be allowed to do this process. I go on many medical missions and for anyone who does that, you will find that the bank blood is oftentimes horrible. It would be great if we could wash the blood on these missions or just run it through a hemoconcentrator. We have arrested patients there in the operating room, and even in the recovery unit, after they have received a transfusion of bank blood.</p>
<p>MR. RONALD BABKA (Corryton, Tennessee): Are you recommending that we should be washing all units of blood prior to transfusion? Your data represent such a small amount of volume. Do you think this represents a normal distribution?</p>
<p>MR. TREVOR SMITH (Brookline, Massachusetts): Are you asking about a normal distribution in terms of the red cell volume?</p>
<p>MR. BABKA: Correct.</p>
<p>MR. SMITH: The units we had were not full units. Generally, when we wash the units, we get approximately 250 ml of product after washing.With those units, it is right on the cusp of filling the 125 ml cell salvage centrifuge bowl, so that is why we did not get a full bowl. If we were transfusing the product, the whole product, I think we would have the bowl filled and be able to transfuse those cells to the patient. In terms of recommendations, if you have the time to wash units before transfusion, I see no reason not to reduce any kind of load given to the patient.</p>
<p>MS. DEBORAH ADAMS (Houston, Texas): Regarding the depletion of 2,3-DPG, did you see any delay in actual oxygen delivery?</p>
<p>MR. SMITH: We did not measure that, so I am not positive it occurred.We did not see any evidence of compromised oxygen delivery. I suspect, if you do see a further decrease in 2,3-DPG, it would not surprise me if that were the case.</p>
<p>DR. MARK YAZER (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania): There was a paper in <italic>Transfusion</italic> last year where the authors reported results of washing fresh red cells.They just let them sit for 24 hours, which is the usual outdate of a washed unit. Just by sitting, the increase in plasma free hemoglobin went up significantly such that, by 24 hours, there was the same amount of free hemoglobin in that unit of washed red cells as a 42-day-old red cell unit.We looked at the mechanical fragility of the red cells after they were washed and there is a five-fold increase in the mechanical fragility of the red cells after they are washed.We do not know what this means; whether the recovery of the cells is going to be worse or whether they are going to hemolyze quickly in the first couple of passes through the spleen. But, it certainly suggests that, although washing improves the plasma or the liquid component immediately, we need to think about the long-term and downstream consequences of washing red cells on a routine basis because we may be providing an inferior product.</p>
<p>MR. JOSEPH SISTINO (Charleston, South Carolina): We have done similar studies and when we used outdated blood, the plasma hemoglobin level before we washed was between 1,000 and 2,000 milligrams per deciliter because of the length of the storage. At these levels, the laboratory personnel had to use dilution in order to calculate the starting plasma hemoglobin level. So, I am curious as to why your starting level was that low after 42 days.</p>
<p>MR. SMITH: I could not tell you why it was lower.It was what it was.</p>
<p>MR. SISTINO: We have done studies on cytokines with washed red cells. Some cytokines are good cytokines and their levels increase, but some of the bad ones also increase. I am not sure yet really what the long-term effects of that are. There are other issues besides the ones that you brought up that are really important, but there are still other issues with washed red cells.</p>
<p>MR. SMITH: To say that washing units of blood is going to cure all the problems or make the product that much better is not necessarily true.</p>
<p>MR. WILLIAM HARRIS (Luling, Louisiana): I always measure the potassium levels in bank blood for pediatric patients, especially, and I concluded the blood probably should be washed. Are you recommending the blood should be washed with Normosol<sup>®</sup> rather than saline?</p>
<p>MR. SMITH: Yes.</p>
<p>MR. HARRIS: The pH would be lower if you did that. When you measured potassium levels in your bank blood, were you doing this through the hospital laboratory or were you doing this on a point-of-care testing mechanism like the i-STAT<sup>®</sup> device, which may not be an accurate measurement because of the lack of protein levels?</p>
<p>MR. SMITH: The potassium levels were measured through the hospital laboratory. We also run rapid points right in the operating room at our station.</p>
<p>MR. HARRIS: So those potassium levels then, you believe, are accurate in a red blood cell unit?</p>
<p>MR. SMITH: Yes.</p>
