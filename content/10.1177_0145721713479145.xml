<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate if patients of nonwhite race are less likely to receive insulin therapy for treatment of poorly controlled diabetes than patients of white race.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721713479145">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective review was performed of patients with an A1C &gt;10%. The primary objective was to determine any difference in the initiation of insulin between white and nonwhite patients. Secondary outcomes measured the impact of clinic type and provider specialty on the initiation of insulin therapy. Exclusion criteria included those patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, those who were previously receiving insulin, and those without an outpatient clinic visit within 14 days of an A1C &gt;10%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721713479145">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 277 patients were included. Of these patients, 132 (47.7%) were white, followed by 95 (34.2%) black non-Hispanic patients and 30 (10.8%) Hispanic/Latino patients. No difference was found in receipt of insulin therapy for nonwhite patients as compared to white patients (12.5 vs 21.4, <italic>P</italic> = .117). Neither clinic type nor provider specialty impacted initiation of insulin therapy. No changes to medication regimen were made at 35% of clinic visits.</p>

<p>Based on currently available data, the Centers for Disease Control estimates diabetes mellitus affects approximately 26 million Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721713479145">1</xref></sup> However, the prevalence of diabetes varies by race. Minority groups (Hispanic/Latinos, Asian Americans, blacks, American Indian/Alaska Natives) have a significantly increased prevalence of diabetes compared to whites. Along with this higher burden of disease, there is also increased complications associated with diabetes. Minorities are up to 50% more likely to suffer complications of diabetes including hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), end-stage renal disease, nontraumatic lower extremity amputation, and mortality from DKA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721713479145">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Glycemic control is a major goal of therapy for type 2 diabetes. Current treatment recommendations target a hemoglobin A1C &lt;7% as a general goal in the nongestational diabetes adult population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713479145">3</xref></sup> Large, randomized clinical trials have provided evidence that optimizing glycemic control is fundamental to preventing the development and/or delaying the progression of complications of diabetes, particularly microvascular complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721713479145">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721713479145"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713479145">6</xref></sup> While these recommendations are widely recognized as standard, a study from 2006 provided evidence that patients often do not achieve this treatment goal. A national population-based survey found that only 42.3% of patients had an A1C &lt;7.0%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713479145">7</xref></sup> The lack of glycemic control is even more prevalent in the minority population. Non-Hispanic blacks and Latinos demonstrate higher A1C levels than whites even after controlling for socioeconomic and self-management factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713479145">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721713479145">9</xref></sup> The problem of poor glycemia in minorities may be twofold, one of health disparities and the other of clinical inertia.</p>
<p>The mechanisms involved in racial disparities in glycemic control have not been fully elucidated. Many factors have been evaluated, including visit-based, patient-based, and provider-based factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713479145">10</xref></sup> Some studies suggest that differences are related to disparities in socioeconomic status, access to quality health care, and insurance coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713479145">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721713479145">12</xref></sup> If this relationship is valid, then a health system that minimizes these barriers should be less likely to have disparities in glycemic control. The Veterans Affairs (VA) system is one that strives to provide uniform health care to veterans through a highly structured organization, low-cost medication, quality of care indicators, and emphasis on evidence-based medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721713479145">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>For patients with significant hyperglycemia and/or A1C &gt;10%, the newest management guidance from the American Diabetes Association recommends insulin therapy, in combination with lifestyle modification, as the treatment of choice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721713479145">14</xref></sup> Insulin should be utilized in these patients due to its rapid glycemic response, lack of ceiling effect, and robust safety and efficacy profiles. Ensuring that all patients with poor glycemic control (A1C &gt;10%), regardless of race, receive appropriate treatment is a necessary intervention.</p>
<p>One of the most significant contributions to the disconnect between treatment recommendations and practice has been identified as “clinical inertia.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721713479145">15</xref></sup> Clinical inertia can be defined as providers’ recognition of a therapeutic problem, namely, not achieving treatment goals, with failure to act. Failure to appropriately treat or intensify therapy has been associated with suboptimal glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713479145">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a growing body of literature that documents failure to intensify oral diabetes medications as a contributing factor for a lack of glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713479145">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713479145"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721713479145"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721713479145">19</xref></sup> Disparities in medication therapy management of oral antidiabetic agents among patients of different races have also been consistent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721713479145">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721713479145">21</xref></sup> To the authors’ knowledge, there are no studies that have investigated therapeutic intensification to insulin therapy in patients with poor glycemic control. Therefore, the current study was conducted to determine if patients of nonwhite race are less likely to receive insulin therapy for treatment of poorly controlled diabetes than patients of white race.</p>
<sec id="section5-0145721713479145" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section6-0145721713479145">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This study was a retrospective cohort study of veteran patients with type 2 diabetes who received care at the Veterans Affairs North Texas Health Care System (VANTHCS). The retrospective nature of this study allowed for data collection within a “real-world” clinic setting. Electronic medical records were the source of outpatient pharmacy records, outpatient visits, laboratory data, and ICD-9 code data. This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of VANTHCS and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Funding was provided by salary support of each of the contributing authors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0145721713479145">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>A search of the electronic medical records database was conducted to identify patients with an A1C &gt;10%. Eligible subjects were patients with type 2 diabetes and an A1C &gt;10% between July 1, 2008, and June 30, 2009, who were being treated with only oral antidiabetic medications or no therapy at the start of the study interval. Subjects were also required to have a minimum of 2 outpatient clinic visits within the study interval to verify their primary point of care was the VA. Exclusion criteria were patients on insulin at the start of the study interval. Patients with an A1C &gt;10% result from the laboratory but no clinic visit within 14 days of that result were also excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0145721713479145">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected from patients’ electronic medical records. Patient demographic information including age, gender, and race were collected. Since 2003, self-identification is the preferred method for reporting race/ethnicity with the VA health care system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721713479145">22</xref></sup> The racial categories from which VA patients may select are: (1) American Indian or Alaska Native, (2) Asian, (3) black or African American, (4) Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, (5) white, (6) other, (7) declined to answer, or (8) unknown. In addition, patients may also affirm or deny if their ethnicity is of Hispanic or Latino origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721713479145">23</xref></sup> Race/ethnicity data for this study were gathered from the electronic medical record using the VA race/ethnicity categories, and subjects were divided, for study purposes, into white and nonwhite for the primary outcome. From laboratory data, the level of the first A1C &gt;10% was noted along with the date of that result. From that date, all outpatient visits were searched to find a clinic visit within 14 days. This timeframe was used to establish a response to the elevated A1C. The outpatient clinic visit conducted within 14 days served as the patient’s index clinic visit. The therapeutic antidiabetic regimen taken by the patient at the index clinic visit was collected and verified by outpatient pharmacy records, including medication name, dosage, and frequency. The professional credentials of the health care provider documenting the patient’s index clinic visit were recorded. This could include a physician, pharmacist, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. Also documented was the type of clinic providing services, whether it was in primary care or a specialty clinic. Specialty clinics were any referral-based clinic. For follow-up, the patient’s first A1C collected between 3 and 7 months after the index clinic visit was documented. This period was selected to allow enough time for physiologic changes to be evident in the A1C but also allow sufficient time for monitoring.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145721713479145">
<title>Modification of Antidiabetic Medications</title>
<p>The combination of index clinic visits and electronic pharmacy records was utilized to identify the modification(s) of antidiabetic treatment, defined as (1) addition of a new oral antidiabetic medication, (2) subtraction or deletion of an oral antidiabetic medication, (3) increase to a higher dosage of oral antidiabetic medication, (4) decrease to a lower dosage of oral antidiabetic medication, and (5) initiation of insulin therapy. If no medication therapy changes were made, an attempt was made to elucidate the justification for lack of modification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0145721713479145">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>The primary outcome was to determine any difference in the initiation of insulin between white and nonwhite patients with type 2 diabetes and an A1C &gt;10%. Nonwhite patients included all those self-identified as any racial/ethnic category other than white. Secondary outcomes included examination of the impact of other factors, including provider and clinic status, on intensification of antidiabetic medications. The study also evaluated the impact, defined as change in A1C, of therapeutic intensification on glycemic control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0145721713479145">
<title>Power Analysis</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that antidiabetic therapy will be intensified in approximately 55% of white patients, compared with approximately 35% of nonwhite patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721713479145">20</xref></sup> To achieve 80% power, it was estimated that 98 patients would be required in each study arm (white and nonwhite) to detect a 20% difference in insulin initiation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0145721713479145">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used for all baseline demographic data. For the primary endpoint of insulin initiation, the chi-square test was used to compare groups. The chi-square test was also used for the secondary outcomes of provider and clinic status. The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to compare A1C levels at follow-up. All statistical analyses were performed using Minitab<sup>®</sup> (Release 15, Minitab Inc, State College, Pennsylvania) software. Statistical significance was defined as a 2-sided <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; .05.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section13-0145721713479145" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 277 patients were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria of type 2 diabetes and having an A1C &gt;10% within the 1-year study period. The patients had a mean age of 57 years and were 97.4% male. The study population had representation from all racial and ethnic groups identified by the VA criteria, with the majority of patients being non-Hispanic whites. African American patients were the most frequently identified minority group (34.3%), followed by Hispanic/Latino patients (10.8%). Baseline demographics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721713479145">Table 1</xref>. There were 6 patients whose race was either blank (n = 5) or declined to answer (n = 1) in the medical record. These patients were identified as undeclared and not included in study analyses of primary or secondary outcomes.</p>

<p>A total of 30 (10.8%) patients were initiated on insulin therapy at their index clinic visit. There was no statistically significant difference in initiation of insulin between nonwhite and white patients (12.5% vs 21.4%, <italic>P</italic> = .117). For provider status, physicians were compared to nonphysician providers, including nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and physician assistants. There were no statistically significant differences in receipt of insulin between those patients scheduled for physicians or nonphysician providers (18.1 vs 12.8, <italic>P</italic> = .436). Due to the large percentage of patients seen during primary care visits (96.3%), clinic status (primary vs specialty clinic) was not analyzed.</p>
<p>At follow-up, a total of 177 (63.8%) patients had an A1C reading within 3 to 7 months of their index clinic visit and were included in the subsequent analysis. Follow-up A1Cs were monitored at a mean of 134 days. Both patients who received insulin at the index clinic visit and those who did not had poor glycemic control at baseline, which was similar between groups; median A1C 11% versus 11.1% (<italic>P</italic> = .4028). However, patients who received insulin had significantly lower follow-up A1C readings compared to patients who did not receive insulin; median A1C 7.4% versus 8.5% (<italic>P</italic> = .0238) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721713479145">Figure 1</xref>). There was also a significant difference in median A1C between patients who received insulin and those who did not have any medication therapy changes. The comparison of median A1C between patients who received insulin and those who only received oral medication changes was not significant (<italic>P</italic> = .0849).</p>

<p>To take into account all potential actions of providers, the number of patients who had no medication adjustments made but were referred to a specialty clinic or specialist was analyzed. This was considered an intervention as an intensification of care. When combined with patients who received insulin, the number of patients included in the intensification of care group increased but remained nonsignificant (25 white vs 20 nonwhite, <italic>P</italic> = .413).</p>
<p>In this study, there were 97 (35.0%) patients who received no change in therapy at their index clinic visit. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721713479145">Table 3</xref> shows the justification documented in the medical chart per race/ethnicity.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this highly diverse cohort of patients with significant hyperglycemia, no significant differences were found in the therapy between white and nonwhite patients. Failure to initiate insulin was prevalent, evidenced by only 10.8% of the patients with an A1C &gt;10% at baseline being started on therapy at their index clinic visit. Patients were primarily managed on metformin and/or sulfonylurea therapy at baseline. The limited utilization of the incretin agents and thiazolidinediones was likely due to their restricted formulary status during the study interval. There was limited patient care provided by specialty referral clinics as patients were largely seen by physicians in primary care.</p>
<p>There were no statistically significant differences in initiation of insulin between white and nonwhite patients, which may be due to the fact that white and nonwhite patients had similar levels of baseline glycemic control; median A1C 10.8% versus 11.1%, respectively. Medication changes in diabetes care should be based on blood glucose monitoring and measures of glycemia. Therefore, patients with similar A1C levels are likely to receive similar treatment strategies. The concern in this study population overall, however, is the lack of insulin initiation considering their A1C &gt;10%. The low incidence of insulin initiation may also have contributed to the nonsignificant finding of the primary outcome. There was also no significant difference in the follow-up A1C between white and nonwhite patients; however, this 0.5% difference between patient groups could be clinically relevant in the daily practice of clinicians.</p>
<p>This study examined a new question regarding the racial differences specifically in insulin initiation. Previous studies investigating the effect of race on therapeutic intensification of antidiabetes medications in general have found that minority patients were less likely to have medications adjusted following an elevated A1C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721713479145">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721713479145">21</xref></sup> These studies were conducted within a managed care organization. A study that compared the VA health administration with managed care organizations in their care of patients with diabetes found that the VA provided better outcomes in 7 measures of quality, including control of A1C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721713479145">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current study found a significant amount of patients who experienced clinical inertia at their index clinic visit, but the majority of patients did have changes made to their medication regimens (65%). This stands in contrast to the rates of medication change reported in prior studies, ranging from 33.3% to 45.1%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713479145">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713479145">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721713479145">19</xref></sup> The authors would have liked to see an A1C &gt;10% be a call to action for all providers in this study, but overall the rate of providers who did make medication changes is encouraging since it is nearly twice that found in others. Also encouraging is the noticeable decrease in follow-up A1C that was seen in patients who did not receive medication changes (11.1%-8.5%). Although the authors did have the benefit of electronic medical records, oftentimes not every nuance of a clinic visit is documented. It could be that providers did not make medication changes for valid reasons that were not documented, such as recent illness or hospitalizations. Providers may have educated and motivated their patients to improve their compliance, which is an intervention that may not have been captured with the chart review.</p>
<sec id="section15-0145721713479145">
<title>Strengths of the Study</title>
<p>This study utilized the electronic medical records of the VA system. The VA health administration has one of the largest and most sophisticated networks of electronic medical records in the nation, which allowed for the vast majority of data collection to be completed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721713479145">25</xref></sup> Second, this study assessed a very diverse patient population, which includes a much higher minority veteran population as compared to Texas state data. In an official estimate of the veteran population, white non-Hispanic veterans account for 69.4% of the total population as opposed to just 47.7% of this study population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721713479145">26</xref></sup> Studies have shown the VA’s electronic medical record system is a reliable tool for extracting race/ethnicity data. Concordance between the electronic medication record system and self-report is highest for white non-Hispanic (85.5%) and black non-Hispanic (93.4%) patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721713479145">23</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section16-0145721713479145">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>Self-identification of race has the potential for misclassification and underestimation of other racial/ethnic groups. While the current study did include a large percentage of minorities, it did not include a large percentage of female patients. This limitation is consistent with other studies conducted at VA health care facilities. The study did not identify patients’ suboptimal adherence, which is traditionally defined as failure to initiate or continue provider- recommended management. However, nonadherence to both lifestyle and pharmacologic recommendations was the most common justification documented by providers for not making further therapeutic changes. The study also focused on a single index clinic visit that occurred within 14 days of an A1C &gt;10%. All judgment of therapeutic modification was at the index clinic visit. The patient’s follow-up A1C was then monitored. Patients could have potentially seen their providers at an intermediate visit between the index clinic visit and follow-up. If therapeutic changes were made at these visits, these changes were not documented as part of the study, despite the impact the changes likely had on the follow-up A1C. Finally, the study interval included July 2008 to June 2009. The ADA treatment algorithm supporting insulin as the first-line agent for an A1C &gt;10% was published in January 2009, during the study period. Therefore, the recommendation could theoretically have been new for providers.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study of patients with poor glycemic control (A1C &gt;10%), there was found to be no significant difference between white and nonwhite patients who were initiated on insulin therapy. In addition, neither clinic status nor provider type was found to have an impact on insulin initiation. However, it was relatively common to make no changes to therapy, at 35% of index clinic visits. Providers should be aggressive in making interventions to overcome clinical inertia.</p>
<sec id="section18-0145721713479145">
<title>Implications/Relevance</title>
<p>Clinical inertia is a complex problem that is likely multifactorial in causation. In broad terms, factors that contribute to clinical inertia can often be attributed to physicians, patients, or health systems, being aware that several sources may interact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721713479145">27</xref></sup> Interventions that seek to improve clinical inertia should target at least 1 of these factors to be most effective.</p>
<p>The most common justification documented for the clinical inertia seen in this study was patient nonadherence. While this study did not detect nonadherance by outpatient pharmacy records, the issue has been previously addressed. Medication nonadherance by black non-Hispanics and Latinos has been identified as a significant, independent predictor of poor glycemic control as compared to white patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713479145">8</xref></sup> A retrospective cohort study among insured patients with diabetes found that poor medication adherence was associated with lower odds of medication intensification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713479145">17</xref></sup> This however does not remove all responsibility from providers. In the same study, the mean time to medication intensification was 22 months (95% CI, 19-25) even among patients with &gt;90% adherence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713479145">17</xref></sup> The slow response, or lack thereof, to elevated blood glucose levels by clinicians is a missed opportunity to optimize glucose control and improve diabetes care. Nonadherence, including medication or dietary, can be a vague reason that providers use to justify not intensifying therapy, which is sometimes used inappropriately. Providers can help improve adherence by being cautious not to let the past behavior of patients dictate their future actions, for example, not intensifying therapy because they suspect (without discussion) that their patient will be resistant to medication changes. Also, providers should not assume nonadherance without documented evidence such as poor refill history.</p>
<p>In addition to a slow response to hyperglycemia, a slow response to clinical evidence has also been suggested as a potential factor in clinical inertia. Before a practitioner is able to make the appropriate therapeutic treatment decision, he or she must be aware of what the recommended appropriate treatment decision is. The recommendation of insulin as the standard of care for an A1C &gt;10% put forth by the American Diabetes Association was a new clinical recommendation for 2009. Prior to that, several treatment methodologies were appropriate. After an advance is made in a clinical guideline, there is often a delay as the guidelines are widely incorporated into usual practice, which may take 5 to 10 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721713479145">15</xref></sup> Providers must be challenged to more readily and effectively translate new clinical evidence into everyday practice. Providers may also be reluctant to initiate insulin for their own reasons. Some providers believe starting insulin is difficult due to the time required to implement the transition from oral therapy or that insulin regimens are overly complex. Providers themselves may also want to avoid patients’ resistance to insulin therapy or feel unable to mitigate patients’ fears. Other providers express worry about weight gain and hypoglycemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721713479145">28</xref></sup> These providers need to receive education about the many recent advances in insulin therapy. Newer insulins, particularly analogs, often allow for simpler regimens with less frequent dosing as well as reduced risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. Also available are numerous delivery devices that have been shown to reduce injection pain. Finally, successful therapeutic intensification to insulin may be in the presentation. Implementation of insulin should not be used as a “threat” if patients are noncompliant with their oral medications or fail to improve their lifestyle habits. Nor should it be suggested that a patient requires insulin because his or her disease has gotten worse.</p>
<p>There are several patient-related barriers that may be confronted, at least in part, by providers. If patient fear is an issue, it should be quickly addressed. Patients’ fear or concern regarding insulin often arises from misconceptions or past experience. Particularly when medication therapy adjustments are warranted, education should be emphasized. One specific principle that is often overlooked is the patients’ understanding of their disease process. A patient who does not really believe he or she has diabetes or realize that diabetes is a significant disease with adverse consequences is much less likely to follow any clinical interventions suggested by the provider. Again, repeated education is potentially needed and may help to improve underlying nonadherence or other clinical barriers.</p>
<p>A health system intervention could be a transition from patient-prompted to physician-requested visits. This strategy may enhance the effectiveness of office visits with a focus on being more proactive. For example, providers could begin to supply electronic or paper reminders to patients to regularly check their A1C levels. Then, once available, providers should be sure to give patients feedback regarding results. Flowcharts of patients’ results can monitor their trends over time as well as indicate evidence-based goals so that the patient can identify when changes are needed. This study allowed for a follow-up time period of 7 months. Even for patients who are not meeting their glycemic goals, the recommended frequency of follow-up is only every 3 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713479145">3</xref></sup> However, 1 recommended mechanism to reduce clinical inertia is simply to decrease the revisit interval. Particularly for patients who have not achieved target A1C levels, more frequent office visits may be appropriate, as demonstrated in several clinical trials. A review of 10 studies found that contact with a provider was independently and highly correlated with a reduction in A1C, with some patients having over 40 visits per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721713479145">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the study, VA providers often referred patients to specialty clinics for insulin initiation or for consult on poorly controlled patients. However, it is not unusual for the interval between clinic visits to be 2 to 3 months, during which time the patient is likely to continue to experience prolonged hyperglycemia. Therefore, it is often advantageous for providers to make medication therapy adjustments, including insulin initiation, during routine clinic visits. Where endocrinology or other specialty services are available, efforts should be made to improve access and also facilitate communication among providers. And in all health systems, standardization of care should be emphasized so that interventions can be implemented in a uniform and efficient manner.</p>
