<abstract>
<p>This research expands the study of political skill, a construct developed in North America, to other cultures. We examine the psychometric properties of the Political Skill Inventory (PSI) and test the measurement equivalence of the scale in a non-American context. Respondents were 1511 employees from China, Germany, Russia, Turkey, and the United States. The cross-cultural generalizability of the construct is established through consistent evidence of multi-group invariance in an increasingly stringent series of analyses of mean and covariance structures. Overall, the study provides systematic evidence that political skill can be treated as a stable construct among diverse cultural groups. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that translated PSI measures operationalize the construct similarly. With some exceptions, the item loadings and intercepts are invariant for the US and non-US responses, suggesting partial measurement equivalence. After verifying the accuracy of item translation, we conclude that any differences can be explained by variation in the cultural value of uncertainly avoidance and cultural differences on a low-to-high context continuum. Detected dissimilarities are addressed, and some suggestions regarding the correct use across borders of the instrument by managers and researchers are provided.</p>

<p>This study focuses on the cross-cultural validation of the <italic>Political Skill Inventory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470595812439870">Ferris et al., 2005</xref>) and generalizability of the political skill construct in non-American cultures. Political skill is defined as ‘the ability to effectively understand others at work and to use such knowledge to influence others to act in ways that enhance one’s personal and /or organizational objectives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470595812439870">Ferris et al., 2005</xref>). In the current literature, it is regarded as a strong predictor of rated job performance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470595812439870">Semadar et al., 2006</xref>), and an effective career management tool (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470595812439870">Forret and Dougherty, 2004</xref>). Recently researchers have also started to apply the instrument across borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470595812439870">Blickle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470595812439870">Ferris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470595812439870">Perrewé et al., 2004</xref>; Wei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470595812439870">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Arguably, multicultural comparisons are ubiquitous in a modern ‘global village’. Implicit in such comparisons is the assumption that both the theoretical structure of a construct and the factorial structure of its measuring instrument are equivalent across groups (Byrne and Campbell, 1999). To the extent that they are not, the potential credibility of such comparisons and findings can be open to question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470595812439870">Hui and Triandis, 1985</xref>). To address this problem, cross-cultural studies usually employ confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which is not sufficient to provide a detailed analysis of the psychometric properties of a scale at the item level. Recently researchers have suggested that an equivalence of the psychometric properties of the measure (aka measurement invariance) must be established before making meaningful comparisons between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470595812439870">Byrne and Campbell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470595812439870">Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470595812439870">Vandenberg and Lance, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>So far the studies of political skill conducted outside of the United States employed recommended procedures (namely, CFA), and demonstrated good fit to an originally specified factor structure when tested for each group separately (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470595812439870">Ferris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470595812439870">Lvina et al., 2009</xref>). However, such separate analysis is less stringent and may lead to premature conclusions of construct generalizability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470595812439870">Byrne et al., 1998</xref>). It is quite possible that the construct of political skill differs in its meaning and importance across cultures. Intuitively, well known for the concept of <italic>guanxi</italic> (i.e. practice of connections), Chinese may react to the enactment of political skill differently from Germans or Americans. On the other hand, cultural endorsement of the strict chain of command and role specification may restrict the usefulness of political skill in Germany. This may be particularly relevant for expatriates. In the US-based studies, this skill is regarded as a strong predictor of leader effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470595812439870">Douglas and Ammeter, 2004</xref>) and is claimed to be “one of the most important competencies leaders can possess, contributing to effectiveness in their organizations.” (Treadway et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470595812439870">2004</xref>: 493). Presumably, political skill can be also instrumental for an expatriate’s adjustment and her oversea success. Indeed, her ability to understand other people’s needs and emotions may become critical when abroad. However, it would be premature to recommend the Political Skill Inventory for selection purposes before fully exploring its psychometric properties across cultures. Given the complexity of the interpersonal aspects of work on organizational performance in a globalized economy, understanding the function of political skill across cultures is highly pertinent.</p>
<p>Verifying measure invariance entails ensuring that (a) the same construct is being measured under different conditions (e.g. respondents’ nationality), and (b) the relationship among the items is identical across those conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470595812439870">Baranik et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the present study will have important practical implications. First, it will provide systematic evidence of the assumption that political skill can be treated as a stable construct in diverse cultural groups. Also, the translated and validated PSI will become available for further empirical research and managerial practices in the studied countries of China, Germany, Russia, and Turkey, as well as in the former Soviet Union countries where Russian is the operating language.</p>
<sec id="section1-1470595812439870">
<title>The construct of political skill and the Political Skill Inventory (PSI)</title>
<p>The original Political Skill Inventory (PSI) was developed and validated in US samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470595812439870">Ferris et al., 2005</xref>). While initial development of the unidimensional measure of political skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470595812439870">Ferris et al., 1999</xref>) found some support, the more comprehensive multidimensional construct of political skill was developed later on. Ferris and colleagues argue that political skill exhibits distinctiveness as a construct that is sufficiently different from others, although they conceptualize it as overlapping to modest degrees with other related social effectiveness constructs and with selected personality traits. In order to measure the skill, Ferris and his colleagues advocate four dimensions of political skill: social astuteness, interpersonal influence, networking ability, and apparent sincerity. Eighteen items comprise the four dimensions of PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470595812439870">Ferris et al., 2005</xref>). The items are provided in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1470595812439870">Appendix</xref>. The brief definitions of the dimensions are as follows.</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Social astuteness.</italic>Individuals possessing political skill are sharp observers: They can read and understand people’s emotions, needs and motivations in diverse social situations.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Interpersonal influence.</italic> Politically skilled individuals possess a subtle and persuasive personal style. Furthermore, they are capable of appropriately adapting it to each situation.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Networking ability.</italic>Individuals with strong political skill are exceptionally good at establishing and using relationships with people, both key organizational members and outsiders.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Apparent sincerity</italic>. Politically skilled individuals come across as possessing high levels of integrity, authenticity, and sincerity. They are, or appear to be, honest, open, and genuine.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>This study aims to contribute to the growing number of studies on political skill and specifically to the international ones. Because the PSI has been translated into other languages, and used in cross-cultural research, Ferris and colleagues have suggested further examination of whether there are cross-cultural differences in political skill’s dimensions, predictors, and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470595812439870">Ferris et al., 2008</xref>: 764). Hence, here we investigate the dimensionality of the PSI using simultaneous confirmatory factor analysis of Northern American (US) PSI and the PSI translated into German, Chinese, Russian, and Turkish. In addition, we examine the invariance of this measure across the samples, and compare latent means of the construct’s dimensions. Arguably, the separate analysis that researchers across the borders have applied to political skill until now has been less stringent and, thus, may have led to premature conclusions of construct generalizability. Some research has suggested that ‘item score data can vary across cultures despite the use of an assessment measure that exhibits excellent fit to an identically specified factorial structure when tested for each group separately’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470595812439870">Byrne et al., 1998</xref>: 241). In an effort to contribute to the cross-cultural literature and managerial practices across borders, we evaluate the suitability of the PSI scale for cross-cultural research by assessing measure invariance and comparing latent means of the PSI across five cultures.</p>

<title>Cultural determinants of differences in PSI responses</title>
<sec id="section3-1470595812439870">
<title>Methodological sources of measure difference across cultures</title>
<p>We argue that culture could influence PSI responses in many ways. Translation issues, erroneous assumptions of cross-cultural relevance of constructs, and critical characteristics of the sample will be addressed in this section. For a comprehensive review of the sources of culture-based non-equivalence, we direct readers to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470595812439870">Robert et al. (2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Translation issues represent a common source of measure noninvariance or dissimilarity. Translation with back translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470595812439870">Brislin, 1980</xref>) has been conventionally used in cross-cultural research for decades. However, it cannot assure 100 percent equivalence of the instrument. First, problems might be encountered when items include words with non-specific meaning (Robert et al., 2006). Those words are difficult to translate without some distortion of their original connotation, which may lead to the non-equivalence of item intercepts for different PSI versions.</p>
<p>Erroneous assumptions of construct relevance also can result in non-equivalence, and in this case, it will be reflected in item slopes. In our study, different discrimination (i.e. noninvariance of factor loadings) is expected for the items that contain the constructs ‘networking’ and ‘connections’. We argue that respondents from high-context cultures will perceive the constructs differently from the respondents from low-context cultures. For example, high-context cultures may endorse networking as being a major ‘survival tool’ that is closely related to people’s social astuteness: the ability to read others’ emotions and hidden agendas. Hence, some item cross-loadings, as well as overall higher means, can be expected in these cultures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1470595812439870">
<title>The role of culture-specific sample characteristics</title>
<p>Lastly, we expect non-equivalence of a number of items due to the sample characteristics, such as the ‘frame-of-reference’ effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470595812439870">Heine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470595812439870">Schmit et al., 1995</xref>), and normative concerns (Hamid et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439870">2001</xref>). For example, even though Chinese managers would have political skill as high if not higher than American managers, items intercepts, which represent the extent of item endorsement, may be non-equivalent (lower) in a Chinese sample. This may occur for two reasons. First, Chinese may distort their high true score because they assume that a higher threshold exists in the comparison group (a ‘frame-of-reference’ phenomenon). The concept of <italic>guanxi</italic>, or connections, is central for the Chinese culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812439870">Francesco and Gold, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470595812439870">Gannon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470595812439870">Varma et al., 2009</xref>) and intuitively, Chinese respondents should score highly on this dimension. However, in reality, they may perceive other people as being even better at this and underreport their own networking abilities. Furthermore, it is common for Chinese respondents have the tendency to respond in the middle of a rating scale, avoiding extreme responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470595812439870">Cheung et al., 1991</xref>). This is particularly true for self-report inventories, which are strongly influenced by the norms of the collectivistic culture, and the teaching of Confucius on modesty and self-moderation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470595812439870">
<title>Cultural values as a source of measure non-equivalence across cultures</title>
<p>Culture has been argued to shape the constructs nomologically related to political skill, such as emotional intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470595812439870">Sharma et al., 2008</xref>) and extra-role behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470595812439870">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>). We have some reason to believe that cultures have a set of specific consequences for the political skill construct and measure. Not only was the concept of political skill developed by American scholars, but much political skill research has been conducted in North America. The very conceptualization of political skill and its dimensions is grounded in western culture and reflects western values (e.g. achievement and performance orientation). Although western culture emphasizes self–other distinctions and the self as an independent entity, eastern or other cultures value relational or interdependent processes and social interactions with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470595812439870">Baranik et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we suggest that, in countries that do not share western values, political skill may function in a different manner, and may be perceived as a more or less beneficial set of competencies than it is in the US.</p>
<p>We argue that certain cultural dimensions can influence the generalizability of the political skill construct, and thus how the PSI functions across national borders. Specifically, this difference may emanate from low-versus high-context style of communication and uncertainty avoidance. We anticipate that high scores on the low-to-high context continuum dictate overall higher means on political skill dimensions, because this cultural value highlights the importance and craft of relationships. On the other hand, we contend that high uncertainty avoidance, which stresses the importance of rules and regulations, may constrain the development and enactment of political skill. To a certain extent, the high uncertainty avoidance context resembles the ‘strong situation’ setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470595812439870">Adler and Weiss, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470595812439870">Mischel, 1968</xref>) which is argued to reduce the impact of personality. In a culture where the chain of command is clearly defined and strictly reinforced, the need and ability to build personal networks in order to achieve organizational goals may be obsolete.</p>
<p>Thus, we predict significant differences in PSI scores for different cultures. Relatively high latent means on every political skill dimension are expected in the Chinese, Russian, and Turkish samples, but not in the German sample. However, the Turkish sample represents an orthogonal relationship on these two dimensions. This culture is high on contextual communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470595812439870">Gannon, 2001</xref>) and is predicted to be high on political skill, but it is also high on uncertainty avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470595812439870">Hofstede, 1993</xref>) which is argued to constrain political skill. Hence, it is logical to expect a mixture of findings for Turkey.</p>
<p>After establishing the case that political skill may function differently across the cultures, we develop several research questions that will guide the reader. These questions will punctuate the article by focusing on an increasingly stringent analysis employed for testing measure invariance across different cultural groups. To test whether the measuring instrument operates equivalently across different populations, we will specifically address the following questions:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Is there configural invariance of the measure? Namely, is the number of PSI factors and factor loadings across the cultures identical to the original measure developed in the US in each and every cultural group under focus?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Is there measure invariance? Namely, are factor loadings and factor intercepts equivalent across the groups and if not, which parameters are less endorsed and more ambiguous?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Are the latent means of political skill dimensions similar across the populations?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition, we propose to explore a higher order structure of political skill and compare political skill endorsement in the USA vis-à-vis China, Germany, Russia and Turkey.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The data were collected by the co-authors within larger projects and in accordance with conventional research practices. This multi-group sample included all non-American PSI data available at the time the current study was performed. In each study, the inventory was distributed among the employees in various organizations. Our sampling was designed to incorporate three indexes of variation in each culture: managerial as well as non-managerial positions, various geographical locations, and various industries. Also, demographic data on age, organizational tenure, and gender were collected. The total sample size comprised 1511 responses. Chi square test of the sample differences in terms of respondents’ age proved to be insignificant (<italic>p</italic> = .115), thus revealing sample compatibility. Mean age ranged from 34 years in the Russian sample to 40 years in German, with 37 years average for the entire sample. The percentage of women respondents ranged from 67 percent in the Russian sample to 43 percent in the Chinese sample. For the sake of space, the major demographic characteristics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470595812439870">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Political skill<bold/>was measured with 18 statements of the Political Skill Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470595812439870">Ferris et al., 2005</xref>) translated into the Chinese, German, Russian, and Turkish languages. Respondents indicated their responses on a seven-point Likert scale, from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). An example of a question is ‘At work, I know a lot of important people and am well connected’.

<p>The original PSI validated in North-American samples demonstrated reliability estimates ranging from .78 (Interpersonal Influence) to .87 (Networking Ability) with the intercorrelations of the political skill dimensions ranging from .36 to .57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470595812439870">Ferris et al., 2005</xref>). In the current study, the reliabilities for the subdimesions of Social Astuteness, Interpersonal Influence, Neworking Ability, and Apparent Sincerity were respectively as follows. US: .79, .86, .84, .78; China: .85, .84, .86, and .64; Germany: .66, .72, .87, .67; Russia: .69, .75, .75, .65; Turkey: .81, .63, .82, .65.

<title>Handling missing data</title>
<p>Because the samples had incomplete data, we ran a separate analysis to review the missing data patterns. Usually probability values higher than .05 found in the GLS tests serve as evidence that the patterns of missing data vary across the samples. The GLS tests of homogeneity of means, covariance matrices and means and covariance combined, provided the evidence of internal differences of the patterns of missing data for each sample. In other words, we could tell that respondents from different groups ‘skipped’ different items. While this information is of potential importance, the current version of EQS software cannot identify deviant patterns. Based on this, and given a relatively small percentage of missing cases (varying from 2 to 7 percent), we decided to proceed with the method of listwise deletion of missing data.</p>

<sec id="section12-1470595812439870">
<title>Determination of baseline models</title>
<p>First, the theoretical model of the PSI structure was tested separately for goodness of fit across the five cultures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470595812439870">Figure 1</xref>depicts the four-factor model of political skill. Provided with some evidence of non-normally distributed data, we made a correction to the test statistics. As robust statistics are known to perform better than uncorrected statistics where the normal distribution assumption is false (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470595812439870">Bentler, 2005</xref>), we employed Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-square in our analysis. Minor modifications were implemented to achieve good fit in the correspondent first order CFA models. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470595812439870">Byrne (2006)</xref> suggests, it is possible that baseline models may not be completely identical across groups. Thus, based on the Lagrange multiplier test, the modifications were identified and implemented for the German, Turkish, and Chinese samples. They are briefly described. Refer to the PSIs in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1470595812439870">Appendix</xref> for the item numbers in the text.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the German sample, the error term for items 1 and 11, both belonging to the dimension of Networking Ability, were allowed to covary. We believe this systematic error covariance represents a method effect caused by the overlap in the items’ content (i.e. , item 1 – ‘I spend a lot of time and effort at work networking with others’; item 11 – ‘I spend a lot of time at work developing connections with others’).</p>
<p>In the Chinese sample, the error terms of items 9 and 11, belonging to the same dimension of networking ability, were also allowed to covary. In addition to content overlap this error covariance may represent an omitted factor deriving from some sample-specific characteristics. For instance, high institutional collectivism, which reflects the degree to which individuals are encouraged by societal institutions to be connected to others and integrated into groups within organizations and the society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470595812439870">Javidan and House, 2001</xref>) may influence responses to these items.</p>
<p>Another modification to be considered for the Chinese sample is the cross-loading of item 14 on the Social Astuteness factor. Initially designed to tap Apparent Sincerity, it seems to also measure how attuned a person is to diverse social situations, needs, and motivations of others. We believe the explanation of this can be found in the concept of ‘face’, or ‘facework’. Even though the concept of ‘face’ (i.e. the tendency of members of a culture to protect their own egos and the egos of others when they communicate) can be found in many cultures, it is considered to be central to Asian culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470595812439870">Mead, 1994</xref>). Saving face implies ‘the positive social value a person effectively claims for himself by the line others assume he has taken during a particular contact’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470595812439870">Goffman, 1967</xref>: 5), and translates into ‘behavior that meets criteria of harmony, tolerance, and solidarity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470595812439870">Mead, 1994</xref>). Evidently, in the Chinese context, ‘showing a genuine interest in other people’ (item 14) also means being ‘attuned to needs of others’, specifically the need of mutual face saving. Thus, we consider freely estimated correlation of errors for items 9 and 11, as well as item 14 cross-loading on the Social Astuteness factor, to be justified.</p>
<p>In the Turkish sample, two modifications were implemented. First, following the logics described for the Chinese sample, the error terms for items 1 and 9, both belonging to the dimension of Networking Ability, were allowed to covary. Also, the error term for item 18 was constrained at the low bound. ‘Constraints at low bound’ messages typically accompany solutions having computational difficulties, specifically when a diagonal element of the covariance matrix of estimates is zero or even negative. Bentler explains, ‘If the bound is desired, the solution may be totally acceptable’ (2005: 113). From the theoretical perspective, the present case may imply that item 18 is perfect in its prediction of the factor. Indeed in the highly contextual Turkish culture, getting clues from ‘people’s facial expressions’ (item 18) may be critical for understanding and ‘reading’ people (Factor 1, Social Astuteness). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470595812439870">Bentler (2005</xref>: 113–14) points out: ‘if a solution converged cleanly, it is quite likely that the parameter estimates are correct even if there is a problem with the standard error of an estimate’. In our case the solution with the imposed constraint cleanly converged, so the appropriateness of the modified model was assumed.</p>
<p>We further proceed with respecified initial models and partial measurement invariance analysis. Evaluation of models was based on multiple goodness-of -fit criteria, including the Comparative Fit Index (CFI; Bentler, 1990), the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR). All parameter estimates were statistically significant. Statistical fit of the baseline models is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1470595812439870">Table 2.</xref>

<title>Identification of referent indicators</title>
<p>As a preliminary step, we identified referent indicators (‘common’ factor loadings fixed to 1) across the groups. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470595812439870">Vandenberg (2002</xref>: 150–1), we examined the loadings to identify one for each PSI dimension that is very close in value between groups in terms of its loading on the focal factor and cross-loadings on the other factors. EFA (i.e. principle axis, promax rotation) was employed; the judgment was made via an eyeball test. It should be noted that it is rather approximate, since it is hard to find absolutely identical patterns for five groups. The identified referent indicators are as follows:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Factor 1, Social Astuteness, item 16: ‘I have good intuition or savvy about how to present myself to others.’</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Factor 2, Interpersonal Influence, item 4: ‘It is easy to me to develop a good rapport with most people.’</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Factor 3, Networking Ability, item 6: ‘I am good at building relationships with influential people at work.’</p>

<sec id="section14-1470595812439870">
<title>Testing for configural invariance</title>
<p>As a next step in a simultaneous analysis of the data, we tested for configural<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470595812439870">2</xref> invariance across groups. To demonstrate configural invariance, groups need to have the same number of factors and factor loadings, namely four factors and 18 factor loadings originally specified in the literature. A constant variable (V999) was introduced into the model, which led to reconceptualization of the independent variables as dependent variables. Here, regression of the factors onto the constant variable represents the latent factor means, while regression of the measure variable represents the observed variable intercepts. The model yielded good fit: chi square = 1629.121 (643); CFI = .951; SRMR = .078; AGFI = .817; RMSEA = .032, 90 percent C.I. .030, .034.</p>
<p>We conclude that the five groups are configurally invariant in that they have the same number of factors and factor loadings. In other words, the four-factor structure of the PSI is optimal, and the pattern of factor loadings is in accordance with original theoretical specifications. This multi-group analysis is a first step in a chain of hierarchical, increasingly stringent, tests of group invariance. The model allows for an invariance test for all groups at the same time; the fit of this model serves as a baseline against which all subsequently specified invariance models are compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470595812439870">Byrne, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section15-1470595812439870">
<title>Testing for invariance of factor loadings and intercepts</title>
<p>Analysis of intercepts based on MACS (mean and covariance structures) allows us to assess the extent of item endorsement. Employing the analysis of factor loadings we can also assess items’ ambiguity. Here, we focus on items that were found equivalent across groups and do not test sample-specific parameters such as, for instance, cross-loading of item 14, originally loading onto Apparent Sincerity, on the Social Astuteness factor in the Chinese sample. Discussing the nature of parameters that showed subgroup differences, we attempt to answer the question if the differences are interpretable in light of what is known about the focal cultures.</p>
<p>Testing for invariance of factor loadings in MACS implies the following procedure: equality constraints were imposed on all factor loadings except ones fixed to 1.00 for identification and scaling. Results from this test yielded appropriate fit: chi square = 2037.289 (699); CFI = .933; RMSEA = .036, 90 percent C.I. .034, .038. Furthermore, comparison of this model with the configural model yielded Δ CFI =.018, which is slightly higher than the value recommended by Cheung and Rensvold (2002). Indeed, judging by the LM (Lagrange Multiplier) Test, used to access invariant parameters), there are several noninvariant items. Specifically, 9 out of 70 constraints were found to be noninvariant in the four cultures. The noninvariant factor loadings are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1470595812439870">Table 3</xref>. Within a CFA framework, factor loadings are interpreted as item discrimination: less ambiguous items tend to have higher factor loadings. Interestingly, only one item (item 13) was perceived as vague by the Chinese sample. Even if this difference between Chinese and American samples is statistically significant, its practical significance is negligible (<italic>beta</italic> = .58 vs <italic>beta</italic> = .65). The only noninvariant, item 5, in the German sample is not well discriminated by respondents, possibly due to some translation issues. Factor loadings for the noninvariant items in the Turkish sample are consistently higher, signalling no ambiguity in understanding the items by respondents. On the contrary, three items in the Russian sample obtained low factor loadings. Obviously, those items are perceived as vague. We propose to explain this by difficulties in translating the concept ‘network’ (i.e. no fully analogous concept exists in Russian) in item 1 and some ambiguity in items 2 and 12.</p>

<p>In testing for the invariance of intercepts, we imposed equality constraints on all invariant factor loadings and all observed variable intercepts, including the ones previously fixed to 1.00 for identification and scaling purposes. The results from this test yielded modest fit: chi square = 3225.022 (756); CFI = .931; RMSEA = .047, 90 percent C.I. .045, .049. Comparison of this model with the configural model yielded Δ CFI =.02, which is higher than the recommended value to conclude invariance. Indeed, reviewing the LM Test statistics, we found that 46 out of the 70 intercepts were noninvariant.</p>
<p>Interpretation of noninvariant item intercepts, done within a CFA framework, is analogous to the item difficulty parameter in Item Response Theory. The higher an intercept value, the stronger item endorsement is. On the contrary, lower intercept values signify that the item is less attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470595812439870">Chan, 2000</xref>). It should be noted that the majority of noninvariance was demonstrated by the Chinese sample. In fact, for China, all intercepts but three proved to be noninvariant when compared to the US sample item intercepts. Close analysis reveals lower levels of item intercepts in the Chinese sample (e.g. for item 14 there is 2.6 points difference in a seven-point scale!).</p>
<p>We suggest two possible explanations for this noninvariance: frame-of-reference or a collectivist culture phenomenon, where modesty in self-promotion is required. At any rate, the importance of considering noninvariance is noteworthy. Talking about the issue of true score calibration and differences between the intervals underlying a scale in different cultures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470595812439870">Riordan and Vandenberg (1994</xref>: 644) provided a useful illustration: <disp-quote>
<p>The 3 (neither agree nor disagree) on a 5-pooint Likert scale may mean ‘no opinion’ to a group of American employees, while it may be interpreted as ‘mild agreement’ in a group of Korean employees. As with conceptual (construct) equivalence, the lack of true-score equivalence may also result in an inappropriate interpretation of the data.</p>

<p>As it is highlighted by some researchers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470595812439870">Byrne, 2006</xref>), group differences in intercepts do not mean that these items are useless in measuring their underlying constructs. It was also pointed out that this difference need not stop researchers from testing differences in the latent factor means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470595812439870">Cooke et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, it is accepted practice for translated measures to employ partial measurement invariance, probably because they are frequently found to lack perfect equivalence across languages. In general, researchers are reported to be more likely to investigate issues of partial invariance when the instrument was translated than otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470595812439870">Schmitt and Kuljanin, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1470595812439870">
<title>Testing the invariance of latent factor means</title>
<p>Along with cross-cultural construct validation, a test of the equivalence of factor means represents an important research question. As a rule, this test follows the measure invariance test. As Schmitt and colleagues highlight: <disp-quote>
<p>Cultural and language differences, as well as other differences, in the populations being measured necessitate an examination of the degree to which the instrument measures the same construct across these cultural and language groups. Unless measurement invariance is established, conducting cross-group comparisons of mean differences or other structural parameters is meaningless. (2008: 212)</p>
</disp-quote> Thus, after we established partial measurement invariance for the instrument, we proceeded with the test of invariance of latent factor means, forcing the intercepts to be identical across the groups and allowing the nonivariant factor loadings to be freely estimated. Also, as required in this type of analysis, we fixed the latent factor means for one group to zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470595812439870">Bentler, 2005</xref>). We chose to do this for the US sample. Thus, factor means can be interpreted only relatively, namely in comparison to the US sample; significance of the parameters represents a test of the difference of latent means.</p>
<p>As expected, results from this test of first-order latent mean differences yielded an appropriate fit: chi square = 2463.287 (740); CFI = .936; RMSEA = .047, 90 percent C.I. .038, .041. Examination of the construct equations reveals that all factors’ latent means are significantly lower for the German and Russian samples, as compared to the US. For Turkish and Chinese samples the results are more diverse. For the Turkish respondents our analysis reveals nonsignificant difference for the Apparent Sincerity factor mean; significantly higher factor mean for Network Ability, and significantly and lower means for Social Astuteness and Interpersonal Influence, as compared to the US respondents. After we adjusted our analysis for the non-equivalent factor loadings and, especially, for the observed variable intercepts, we found that latent factor means for the Chinese respondents are higher than for the Americans in two cases. Specifically, the means for the dimensions of Social Astuteness and Apparent Sincerity proved to be significantly higher for the Chinese.</p>
<p>To illustrate the importance of considering partial measurement equivalence, we compared latent means for the five groups’ PSI dimensions with and without noninvariant scalars. Specifically, the following models were analyzed:</p>

<p>fully invariant model: all factor loading and intercept parameters were constrained to equality.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The models yielded good fit, deteriorating slightly from the free to the fully constrained model. Interestingly, while latent factor means do not differ much in partially vs fully invariant models, they change sign in the model that does not constrain the intercepts to be equal. In other words, without considering scalar invariance we would interpret the results in the way that is opposite to our final conclusion. This supports Schmitt and Kuljanin’s (2008: 219) assertion that ‘intercept difference should have the greatest impact on tests for differences in latent factor mean differences’. To sum up the findings, all four cultures (with some exception for Turkey and China) tend to assess their political skill dimensions as less developed compared to Americans.</p>
<p>Overall, negative coefficients for political skill dimensions suggest that German, Chinese, Russian, and Turkish respondents tend to be more negative in assessment of their political skill. In terms of practical application of these results, reassessment of the scores signifying high and low political skill for different cultures may be useful. While moderately developed political skill is suggested to be between 2.3 and 4.6 points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470595812439870">Ferris et al., 2005</xref>), the numbers may be different for other cultural groups.</p>

<title>Higher-order structure of political skill</title>
<p>Testing the multi-group equivalence of the higher-order structure is an important yet not very common practice. In fact, the second-order models testing the mean structure are typically not identified and the literature lacks agreement on the procedures for dealing with this issue. That is why we chose not to use the analysis as our primary method, but rather in addition to the more conventional one.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470595812439870">Ferris et al. (2008</xref>), we hypothesized that political skill represents a higher order factor, comprising of the four first-order factors of Social Astuteness, Interpersonal Influence, Networking Ability, and Apparent Sincerity. In other words, we suggest that covariation among the four first-order factors will be fully explained by their regression on the second-order factor of political skill. As the procedure and the obtained results are similar to the previously discussed and tested models based on the first-order CFA, we describe them in a cursory manner. Then, we closely address the issue of obtaining a mean structure for a second-order multiple group model. Namely, we focus on the equivalence of the four lower order factors (i.e. political skill dimensions) and the higher order factor (political skill) across the five cultural groups.</p>

<title>Testing for configural invariance</title>
<p>The five groups baseline model yields an appropriate fit: chi square = 1717.401 (655); CFI = 1.000; AGFI = .806; SRMR = .081; RMSA = .033, 90 percent C.I. .031, .035. Thus we conclude that the five groups have the same number of factors and factor loadings, in other words they are configurally invariant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1470595812439870">
<title>Testing for invariance of factor loadings</title>
<p>To test for the equivalence of factor loadings, we specified the equality constraints on all first-order factor loadings and then, on the second-order factor loadings in the five samples. Not surprisingly, and similar to the results of the analysis based on the first order CFA, this analysis yielded a good fit and nonsignificant difference with the baseline (configural) model. Based on this, we conclude that the first-order factors are operating in the same way across the groups; in other words there is factorial invariance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1470595812439870">
<title>Testing for invariance of intercepts</title>
<p>In testing for the invariance of the observed variables’ intercepts we imposed equality constraints on all first- and second-order factor loadings first and then on all observed intercepts. As all but three observed intercepts proved to be noninvariant for the Chinese sample, we had to release the constraint that makes them equivalent to the intercepts in the American sample in the consequent analysis. Testing for the next model we also had to impose constraints on the observed variables with factor loading initially restricted to one for identification purposes. Namely, we had to constrain them to the intercepts values for Group 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470595812439870">Byrne, 2006</xref>). The resulting model yielded good fit and negligible change from the previous model.</p>

<sec id="section22-1470595812439870">
<title>Testing for latent mean differences</title>
<p>In this part of the analysis the major interest shifts to testing the latent mean scores on the higher order factor of political skill. In other words, we now aim to answer the question of which culture seems to be more politically skilled based on the PSI. Overall, we followed the procedure described in the previous section. However, to address the identification issue we also constrained the four observed variables intercepts related to the reference indicator to the estimated value for Group 1 – Americans. (For a discussion of the appropriateness of this approach, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470595812439870">Byrne, 2006</xref>: 314–18.) The results of the analysis demonstrate that the mean of political skill as a higher order factor is higher for Americans than for the other cultural groups.</p>
<p>Attempting to answer the question ‘who is more politically skilled’, we ran a set of analyses to compare cultures among each other. As this type of analysis does not allow the obtaining of absolute values, only relative to a selected group, we had consequently to fix the factor intercepts of US, China, or Russia to zero. Our results reveal that US respondents consistently evaluate their political skill as more developed than other cultures. In the hierarchy of political skill we observed the following descending order: US, Turkey, China, Russia, and Germany.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study a series of research questions was designed to investigate whether the construct of political skill takes on equivalent meaning across  cultures. We used data translated from English into four languages and collected from five different countries. The cross-cultural generalizability of the construct was established through consistent evidence of the multi-group invariance in an increasingly stringent series of analyses. In light of the stringency of the used criterion (the good model fit and minimal CFI difference), our findings of factorial invariance speak well for the PSI translation into the focal languages. Provided with evidence of overall invariant factor loadings we conclude that Americans, Germans, Chinese, Russians, and Turks use compatible conceptual frames of reference when responding to the PSI. While the scale yielded the identical structure across all samples, we were able to establish only partial measurement equivalence. Furthermore, the groups were found to calibrate the true scores underlying the items in a country-distinct manner. The test of the latent means on political skill also revealed statistical differences among the groups.</p>
<p>The results have several implications. First, the study systematically validates the assumption that political skill can be treated as a stable construct among diverse cultural groups. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that translated PSI measures are operationalizing the construct similarly. With some exceptions, the item loadings and intercepts were found to be invariant for the American and non-American responses. After verifying for the accuracy of the item translation, we concluded that the difference can be explained by variation in cultural values.</p>
<p>Specifically, we think that uncertainty avoidance and a low- vs high-context style of communication are two possible sources of difference. The high scores on a low-to-high context continuum were reflected in overall higher means on political skill dimensions. High-context cultures, e.g. Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470595812439870">Gannon, 2001</xref>) and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470595812439870">Hall, 1976</xref>), that emphasize the importance of relationships and indirect communication style were found to score especially high on the Social Astuteness and Networking Ability dimensions of political skill. On the other hand, cultures that are high on uncertainty avoidance, i.e. Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470595812439870">Hofstede, 1993</xref>), demonstrated somewhat constrained endorsement of political skill.</p>
<p>Some caution should be used when interpreting responses of Chinese respondents. Even though factor structure of the political skill construct holds well for this population, this group was found to differ from Americans in virtually all item intercepts. In other words, Chinese responses consistently demonstrated low endorsement of the items. The importance of considering this noninvariance is noteworthy. However, identifying the source of this noninvariance is even more critical. In this study we offer the frame-of-reference phenomenon, and Confucian norms and collectivist culture values, as possible explanations. Prior research has established some other sources of biases. For instance, a 26-country study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470595812439870">Harzing (2006</xref>) reports major between-countries differences in response styles, such as acquiescence and extreme response styles.  In Harzing’s study, Chinese respondents showed medium acquiescence, and low preference of both positive and negative extreme response styles. She argues that the difference results from the influence of power distance, collectivism, and uncertainty avoidance. Arguably, these phenomena have critical implications for cross-national research and practice. Hence, we encourage future research to explore these issues.</p>
<p>We contend that our finding may shed the light on the phenomenon of the glass ceiling for Asian Americans. Some research suggests Asian Americans are perceived at least as competent as Whites but less socially skilled than Whites by both Asian and White participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470595812439870">Lai and Babcock, 2009</xref>). For one, this perception may indeed reflect the lower (compared to Americans) latent mean score found for political skill among the Chinese. Yet, we also have to consider the dimensions where Chinese, and overall Asian managers, need some ‘improvement’. It appears that coming from a high-context culture, those employees are quite astute in social situations. However, they do lack in influence and differ in network building. In light of commonly practiced <italic>guanxi</italic>, this deficiency in networking ability may appear somewhat counterintuitive. However, some recent studies suggest that <italic>guanxi</italic> is multidimensional and not necessarily identical to western networking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470595812439870">Redfern and Ho, 2009</xref>). We hope that future research will further explore this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Yet another important contribution of this study is the analysis of substantive importance of PSI dimensions for the diverse cultural groups. Provided with evidence of measure consistency and accuracy, we turned to conducting the latent means test. In the present study we used the analysis of MACS (Bentler, 1985). In accordance with our hypothesis, respondents from Germany (low on context but high on uncertainty avoidance) scored as least politically skilled on the four PSI dimensions. Respondents from China and Russia scored higher than those from Germany but lower than Americans. Overall high latent factor means for the Turkey sample proved to be mixed as expected. The respondents evaluated their Network Ability higher than Americans and were found to be nonsignificantly different from them on Apparent Sincerity dimension. Interpersonal Influence was also found to be equivalent for the Turkish and Russian samples.</p>
<p>We did not predict that American respondents would be higher overall on the majority of the dimensions of the Political Skill Inventory. Our post-hoc explanation is that this may be a function of the self-report method and a tendency of Americans to overemphasize their advantages during self-presentations. From a cultural perspective, their higher latent mean score may be explained by the high individualism of US respondents. Individualism is characterized by such orientations as ‘individual regulation’, ‘self-sufficiency’, ‘personal fate’, and ‘I orientation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470595812439870">Riordan and Vandenberg, 1994</xref>). Arguably, in its original form, the PSI may represent a rather individualistic operationalization of the political skill construct, as it frequently references the self and personal achievements. Thus, it can explain why Americans describe their political skill (at least in its current operationalization) higher than other, more collectivistic, cultures.</p>
<p> It is important that we note at least two limitations of the present study. First, a direct measure of culture has not been employed. Rather, we assumed that country is equivalent to culture and offered some explanations of differences based on the assumption that our respondents shared these cultural values. Furthermore, there may be some risk of overgeneralizing our findings, due to the non-random samples: in the study we did not demand selective representation of particular demographic variables. It is quite possible that the samples were not wholly representative of their cultures/countries.</p>
<p>The results of our study suggest cross-cultural invariance of the construct and measure of political skill. Yet our findings were exploratory in nature. A separate validation is required to investigate whether, for example, Chinese political skill dimensionality is different from the American one. It is quite possible that, like the organizational citizenship construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470595812439870">Farh et al., 2004</xref>), this construct has some additional dimensions not evident in the western operationalization. Another important research endeavor would be further testing the equivalence of the nomological net of the political skill construct. It has been demonstrated that important relationships found in the American culture still hold in other cultures (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470595812439870">Blickle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470595812439870">Ferris et al., 2008</xref>). However, the question whether the strength of the relationship is equivalent, and whether it holds equally well in alike contexts is yet to be answered. We believe that this study will help answer these questions and will further endorse the use of PSI across the globe by making it available for both empirical research and managerial practices in the studied countries.</p>

<p>Given controversy and the complexity of issues surrounding cut-off values for model fit indices, Mathieu and Taylor (2006) suggested that models with CFI 0.90 to &lt; 0.95 and SRMSR &gt; 0.08 to 0.10 ranges can be considered as acceptable. Values of RMSEA of about 0.08 or less are also considered to reflect reasonable fit of the model to the population by Browne and Cudeck (1993).
