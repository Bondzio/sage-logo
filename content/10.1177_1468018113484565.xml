<p>Merike Blofield’s analytical survey of the rights of domestic workers across Latin America is an important contribution to an under-researched area of debate. While a growing number of studies have documented the abusive conditions faced by many domestic workers in Latin America and beyond, this book is more focused on the political processes that support the broader environment in which these abusive conditions are allowed to continue. As Blofield succinctly argues in the introductory chapter,
<disp-quote>
<p>… the legal status of domestic workers exemplifies the tension between equal rights and class divisions and goes to the heart of the debate over what legal equality and social justice in a formal democracy entail. (p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, as she notes, it also reflects the value assigned to care work by the state and highlights how across the region these activities remain notably undervalued and where they become contracted out to others, significantly underpaid.</p>
<p>The first chapter provides an overview of domestic workers in Latin America and illustrates how despite ideas proposed in the 1970s that paid domestic work would gradually disappear with modernization, in fact the reverse has occurred. Demand for domestic labour has increased as more women move into other areas of the paid economy and at the same time, high levels of inequality fuel the supply of cheap labour to respond to this demand. While there is a rich literature on global care chains which also examines this supply and demand of domestic labour in the context of South–North inequalities, Blofield’s analysis reminds us that significant South–South as well as internal inequalities exist. Within Latin America many domestic workers are not cross-border migrants but are women from low-income households who have few other employment options and thus move within country to search for work. The chapter provides a detailed summary of current laws on domestic workers in South America and illustrates notable differences as well as commonalities across countries. For example domestic workers in Argentina, Paraguay and Venezuela can be dismissed for showing a ‘lack of respect’ or ‘lack of morality’; in Chile domestic workers do have a right to take national holidays, in Brazil they are entitled to double pay for working holidays but those in Paraguay and Venezuela are expected to work on national holidays.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 is organized around a central question of how the political system has addressed the interests of groups such as domestic workers that are multiply disadvantaged – as low-paid labourers, as women, and frequently as ethnic or visible minorities. Blofield looks at how far legal rights, most notably a limit on the hours of work, minimum wages, holiday and severance pay as well as access to social security, have been granted to these workers. While in the majority of countries no reform has occurred, in a small number of cases full or partial reform has taken place.</p>
<p>The predominant focus of the remainder of the book is four country case studies which exemplify different reform outcomes: Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica and Uruguay. At the time of writing the book Uruguay and Bolivia illustrated cases of full reform, Chile was a case of partial reform and Costa Rica represented no reform. Just prior to publication of the book, Costa Rica did in fact approve equal rights for domestic workers (in 2009), although as Blofield argues, while it is no longer a case of ‘no reform’, it does still provide a useful example of the dynamics of political change.</p>
<p>The case studies shed light on different paths to reform. Social mobilization was critical in both the Bolivian and Costa Rican case whereas in contrast in the Chilean case very little social pressure occurred. Chile is an example of ‘top-down’ reform, led by particular legislators. Uruguay falls somewhere between the two examples – a predominantly top-down process yet with some social mobilization. Yet even where legal reforms are implemented, enforcement of the rights of domestic workers remains an ongoing challenge. One of the most important contribution’s of Blofield’s study is the attention she brings to deeply embedded negative attitudes to domestic workers which are closely entwined with class and racial privilege. However, she also develops this further by linking these attitudes to processes of political and legal reform to explain the widespread reluctance among the political elite to support better working conditions for domestic workers. Negative attitudes are also closely tied with a widespread reluctance to consider domestic work as equal to other forms of work, given its supposed ‘exceptional nature’.</p>
<p>Given many of the deeply rooted structural constraints to reforming the conditions of domestic work in Latin America Blofield’s conclusions are cautious. One note of optimism is the role of the International Labour Organization (ILO). The Uruguayan case reveals how the active participation of the ILO in forming strong links with domestic workers organizations was a central factor in building the strength of civil society groups to push for reform. Indeed, the ILO has also played a positive role in parts of the region, including Chile, reinforcing the need for global networks to contribute to the push for change.</p>
<p>In essence Blofield’s book is a clear and comprehensive analysis of the push for reform of domestic workers’ rights in Latin America. It is well written and very readable and her personal commitment to the issues raised in the book is clear. The accessible style of writing should appeal to policy makers and academics alike and should be an important addition to reading lists of both postgraduate and undergraduate courses in a broad range of subject areas relating to economic development and inequality.</p>
