<p>This excellent book proposes a thorough analysis of the realities and potentialities of what could become a new paradigm for social policy and welfare research in the future, much as Keynesianism was in the postwar period, and neoliberalism over the past three decades. The social investment viewpoint presents social policies’ enrichment of human capital as a cornerstone for a tentative new paradigm. Investment in issues such as education suited to the different life stages, improved combinations of active/protective labour market policies and social cohesion become key productive forces in present societies.</p>
<p>This is a bold target, which is pursued in a twofold manner. First, the volume has some key chapters devoted to exploring the state of the art on the different approaches to the changing role of modern welfare states (Keynesianism, neo-liberalism and social investment) – and also the divergences and possible complementarities among them. This state of the art section is both rich and clear, making the book a great read for specialised academic audiences as well as for social and political actors involved (or interested) in policymaking.</p>
<p>Second, together with being an admirable piece of academic scholarship, the main virtue of the book is indeed its vocation to be policy-oriented, with the aim of offering ‘an empirically informed assessment of social investment policies … ’ (p. 20). The bulk of chapters in this book are thus devoted to identifying the potential and weaknesses of policies that carry the imprint of a social investment rationale, enriching the analysis of values and ideas behind current policy reforms.</p>
<p>The book is divided in four parts. The first and fourth are more speculative as they present the call for a new paradigm and its future viability, respectively. By contrast, the middle sections are more concerned with empirical assessments. Throughout the book, though, there is a fruitful dialogue between the theoretical conception of a possible ‘emerging paradigm’ to better understand present socioeconomic realities, and the provision of actual evidence to support such a claim in terms of the extension of social investment policies, in relation to both the degree of development and geographical reach, and the impact assessment of policies that carry the imprint of such a paradigm. Given that the aims are ambitious, and that the outcome of their predictions depends very much on how the current economic crisis develops, how it will end, and, crucially, how it is and will be understood and interpreted (as Diamond and Liddle’s chapter specifically addresses with prudent optimism), the final answer to the question in the title of the book is left open.</p>
<p>The middle chapters provide numerous examples of best practices in policy implementation. Some of the evidence of success goes beyond isolated achievements to point towards what a social investment strategy might look like. However, as the authors themselves acknowledge, the ‘mapping’ of new social investment policies in Europe is not enough to testify a full-fledged theoretical formulation of a new paradigm. Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, most examples of social investment creativity in the real world of welfare reform are concentrated on the Nordic countries and the Netherlands under conditions that are difficult to transfer to other political, social and economic contexts in Europe. Indeed, these two factors confront the whole project with serious obstacles of different nature: How can we decide, for example, when certain ‘ambiguities’ could be seen as virtues that offer room for manoeuvre to the different actors (chapter 3 by Jenson and chapter 10 by Lindh), whereas on other occasions (Morgan in Chapter 6 or De La Porte and Jacobsson in Chapter 5) these same ambiguities may actually weaken the consistency of the approach? How can we get ‘fine balances’ between policies that follow different logics, most notably ‘activation’ versus ‘protection’ (Bonoli in Chapter 7)? What is the policy-learning capacity of countries drifting towards short-term reactive measures of the crudest neoliberal form? And finally, given the politically minded nature of the book, what are the steps that can lead towards the formation of the broad political and social alliance needed to support the whole aspiration?</p>
<p>After reading the book, one certainly becomes aware of the extent to which terms such as ‘up-skilling’, ‘entrepreneurship,’ ‘knowledge’ and ‘learning societies’ will become central to forthcoming social policymaking, as we seek to face the need to adjust to changing environments. But after decades of neo-liberal abuse of destructive-creativity, we should also be aware of the limits of permanent demands for tireless adaptive efforts. The works of Sennet, Tronto or Bourdieu, although addressing very different sociological dilemmas, have shown the importance of moments in our daily existence that rest more within the ‘habit’ than the ‘creative’ side of human action: our need for regularities and routines in everyday life and their troubled relationship with unrelenting change. In this sense, the issue of climate change that is often quoted in the book as an area where the synergies between different policy domains are crucial offers a wonderful example of the need to face trade-offs or getting ‘fine balances’ between the ‘creative’ and ‘habit’ side of human action. Too much stress is often put on what we might call the ‘high-speed train’ versus ‘electric car’ type of debate, which likes to emphasise how the environmental problems offer good opportunities for more sophisticated technologies and more innovative efforts, focusing on whether these should be more or less state-oriented. This kind of discussion has become a ‘usual suspect’ in the face of the economic crisis, but tends to displace other more modest alternatives, which we might call ‘bicycle’ measures. Among other reasons, this is because their outcomes are not that well reflected in present national account statistics. The need for clear, parsimonious and expressive indicators that offer alternatives to gross domestic product (GDP) is actually repeatedly mentioned in the book. This call for giving visibility to a whole new range of factors has plenty to offer for finding a paradigm that manages to differentiate itself enough from the past.</p>
<p>That the book spurs these and many other questions shows how strong it is in going into the detail of the numerous variables that need to be taken into account in the pursuit of more successful social policies. The fact that it is also honest in recognising all sorts of difficulty (cognitive, financial, political, inter and supra-state coordination) involved in such an effort might make some readers sceptical about the whole idea, but it will provide others with several starting points to question the present state of affairs as well as glimpses – solid glimpses – of possible improvements.</p>
