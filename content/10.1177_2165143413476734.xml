<abstract>
<p>A systematic review was conducted of 581 articles published in 76 issues of <italic>Career Development and Transition for Exceptional Individuals</italic> from the journal’s initial issue in 1978 to the final issue of its 35th year in 2012. Articles were coded based on inclusion of original or secondary data and if not, what type of information the article contained. In the case of articles that presented data, statistics were collected related to sample demographics and the location of the study. In addition, the topic of each article was coded. The most common topical areas were program descriptions and professional development. Trends throughout the analysis are discussed to forecast topical areas needing study as the journal goes forward.</p>

<body>
<p>Since its inception as the 12th division of the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) in 1976 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2165143413476734">Brolin, 1996</xref>), the Division on Career Development and Transition (DCDT) has evolved and undergone many transitions of its own. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2165143413476734">Donn Brolin (1996)</xref>, the first president of what was known in 1976 as CEC’s Division on Career Development (DCD) described the division’s early emphasis on providing career education for students in “the formative elementary/middle school period when important work attitudes, values, motivations, abilities, and interests are formed” (p. 95). In the 1980s, the division evolved to incorporate the concept of “transition.” As noted by Brolin, the reasons for integrating transition included the expiration of the Career Education Act and the introduction of the term <italic>transition</italic> to the special education lexicon by Madeline Will, then the Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS). In 1983, the use of the term <italic>transition</italic> was reinforced by the passage of transition-related amendments in the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2165143413476734">Ianacone &amp; Kochhar, 1996</xref>) and then again in 1990 with the passage of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, which mandated transition services for youth and young adults with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2165143413476734">Kolstoe, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Reflecting the division’s early focus on career development, <italic>Career Development for Exceptional Individuals</italic> (CDEI) was first published by DCDT in the spring of 1978. Now in its 35th year, the journal has been retitled <italic>Career Development and Transition for Exceptional Individuals</italic> (CDTEI) to more accurately reflect the division’s increased emphasis on transition. CDTEI is used as the journal title throughout the remainder of the current article.</p>
<p>The intent of the present study was to analyze the main (e.g., K–12 education, postschool settings, or non-student-based articles) and secondary topical areas (e.g., self-determination, money management, professional development) of every article published in CDTEI from 1978 to 2012 (<italic>n</italic> = 581). In addition, we sought to determine whether the article included original data, secondary analysis of an existing data set, or whether the article was descriptive rather than data based (e.g., a program description, an editorial, a summary of legal issues). For those articles containing original data or a secondary data analysis, information was collected on the sample and study location. Next, we examined how common topics trended over time and, in addition, how topics varied in relation to study location and sample characteristics.</p>
<p>An examination of topics covered, the populations studied, and study context has value for a number of important reasons. First, we can determine which topics have been well examined and which areas are in need of additional investigation. Second, we can identify with whom sufficient research has—or has not—been conducted. Third, understanding study context allows us to better identify the “where” of evidence-based practice; that is, we then have data that allow us to say, with some degree of confidence, which practices work with which students and in which settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2165143413476734">Horner et al., 2005</xref>). Given the heterogeneity of the special education population and, more generally, the diversity found in our schools, research that meets this standard is essential. In sum, “professional journal articles play a key role in disseminating knowledge and in the development for content for professional education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2165143413476734">Plotner, Shogren, &amp; Strauser, 2011</xref>, p. 28). Our analysis is intended to provide the field with a retrospective examination of topics, samples, and locations covered throughout the history of CDTEI, while providing a basis to forecast topical areas warranting future investigation.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-2165143413476734">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Each issue (<italic>n</italic> = 76) of CDTEI from 1978 to the present was located through electronic databases and in consultation with the current journal editors. Each article was then uploaded to a cloud server, thus allowing the research team remote access. The electronic database included a citation and unique code for each article (<italic>n</italic> = 581). This allowed the coding to be linked to the citation and results to be linked to each research team member for reliability calculation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2165143413476734">
<title>Coding Scheme</title>
<p>The research team used an iterative process to develop the coding instrument (available from the first author on request). An initial pilot instrument was developed in collaboration with the team that analyzed the research methods used in CDTEI publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2165143413476734">Carter et al., 2013</xref> [this issue]). Items included determining whether articles included original data and on demographic topics such as study location (e.g., United States or International; urban, suburban, or rural), student type (e.g., disability type, gender, school level, and number of students by category), nonstudent samples (e.g., professionals, parents), study setting, research methods, and article topical area.</p>
<p>An initial review of several journal issues revealed that a wide range of topics had been addressed, including many that were not specifically about students (e.g., program descriptions). This meant an organizational structure was necessary to code and analyze the topical areas. First, the articles were sorted into one of three <italic>broad areas of focus</italic>. The three broad topical areas were K–12 Education, Postschool Settings (employment or postsecondary education), and Nonstudent Specific areas (e.g., program descriptions, professional development, policy).</p>
<p>K–12 Education and Postschool Settings were further parsed into a <italic>secondary area of focus</italic>. For articles in the K–12 Education topical area, the secondary areas of focus were academic development or career/vocational development. For articles in the Postschool Settings topical area, the secondary topical areas were either an academic setting (i.e., a college, an age-appropriate transition program, a certificate program) or an employment setting. Articles that were Nonstudent Specific were not sorted into a secondary area and instead were sorted using the process described below for specific topical areas.</p>
<p>Following this initial and secondary sort, articles were arranged into a third and more <italic>specific topical area</italic>. For example, articles that focused on academic development were sorted into categories such as assistive/adaptive technology, academic and classroom instruction, person-centered planning, and self-determination. Articles that focused on career/vocational education were sorted into vocational programs, descriptions of work experiences, and determining employment or job preferences. In regard to postschool academic settings, articles were organized into topical areas such as perceptions of experiences and self-advocacy/self-determination, whereas employment articles were sorted into vocational programs and descriptions of work experiences. Finally, articles that were nonstudent focused were sorted into topical areas such as program development/description/evaluation or state/national databases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2165143413476734">
<title>Coding Process</title>
<p>On two occasions, two issues of CDTEI were randomly selected (Fall 1999 and August 2011; Spring 1978 and May 2011) and coded, each time resulting in a number of instrument revisions. Early issues of the journal, in particular, presented several challenges. First, numerous issues contained a section titled “Briefs,” which comprised a set of short descriptive articles. In some cases, the <italic>Brief</italic> named a “Department Editor” and also named authors for each article within the <italic>Brief</italic>. In other cases, the only identifiable attribution for the section and for each article within the <italic>Brief</italic> was an unidentified “Editor.” To ensure all journal articles were reflected in our examination, each article was discretely coded. Second, earlier issues of the journal also contained a range of other types of articles, such as “ERIC Reviews,” “Reviews,” “Washington Briefs,” and “Personnel Preparation.” Due to their small number, these were combined into one category that also included features found in more recent issues of the journal, such as book reviews and a section titled “In Other Sources.” Finally, additional subject areas that were not reflected in the coding instrument (i.e., description of federal grants, policy work, preservice training) were included in the Nonstudent Specific category.</p>
<p>Following all revisions to the coding protocol, the research team coded each article (<italic>n</italic> = 581) from all journal volumes (<italic>n</italic> = 35). Using recommended coding protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2165143413476734">Wilson, 2009</xref>), approximately 10% of the articles were randomly selected and were subject to an interrater reliability check. Overall reliability for all coders was 100% for each of the broad areas of focus. For secondary area of focus, the reliability ranged from 85% to 100%.</p>

<title>Overview of Published Articles</title>
<sec id="section7-2165143413476734">
<title>Articles with nonoriginal and original data</title>
<p>In total, 55% (<italic>n</italic> = 322) of the articles presented nonoriginal data. The largest percentage (24.7%) of these articles were position statements. The second largest category (22.6%) were summaries of other sources, such as books, curricula materials, and articles followed by reviews of the literature (18.5%), editorials and introductions (17.6%), and program descriptions (13%). An additional 3% presented secondary analyses of an existing data set. Two articles (0.6%) were coded as meta-analyses. The remaining 259 articles (45%) presented original data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2165143413476734">
<title>Study demographics</title>
<p>We reviewed the study demographics of the 259 articles including original data, the 2 meta-analyses, and the 14 articles that examined extant data. This resulted in a total of 275 articles to be analyzed. Of these, 99% were studies conducted in the United States. Sixty-five percent (<italic>n</italic> = 178) did not clearly specify whether the study was conducted in rural, suburban, and/or urban settings. Of studies noting a location (<italic>n</italic> = 97), 32 were conducted in urban settings (12% of the 275 articles analyzed for study demographics), 10 were conducted in rural settings (4%), and 9 were conducted in suburban settings (3%). Forty-six studies (17%) were conducted in multiple settings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2165143413476734">
<title>Students/young adults</title>
<p>CDTEI has published 160 articles that included participants (58%) who were students or young adults. Of these, 56 (35% of the 160 articles presenting data on students or young adults) contained sample sizes greater than 100, while 42 (26%) had samples of 11 to 50. The most common study setting was the K–12 schools (36%). Other settings were next (20%) followed by settings not being clearly described (19%). Postschool locations (including postsecondary education) were the next most common (11%), followed by employment settings (10%) and community settings (7%).</p>
<p>The majority of articles whose participants were students or young adults did not clearly report data regarding race/ethnicity (<italic>n</italic> = 94 or 59%). The remaining 66 (41%) reported participants as European Americans, while 53 (33%) included African Americans, 32 (20%) included Latino/Latina Americans, and 25 (16%) included Asian Americans. Males and females were participants in equal numbers (120 articles each; 75%), while 40 articles (25%) did not clearly report participant gender. Seventy-eight articles (49%) had participants described as high school students, while 34 articles (21%) included post–high school participants (in noneducation settings) and 14 articles (9%) included participants from postsecondary education. Forty-six articles (29%) did not clearly report the education level of participants.</p>
<p>With regard to disability type, 75 studies (47% of the 160 articles presenting data on students or young adults) included students with an intellectual disability, 74 (46%) did not clearly report disability status, and 70 (44%) contained students with learning disabilities. Some studies included participants in more than one disability category, thus the total exceeds 100%. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2165143413476734">Table 1</xref> provides data regarding disability categories across all articles and reflects 16 disability categories.</p>

<p>One hundred and thirty-one articles (48% of the 275 articles) contained data from samples other than students (e.g., professionals, parents); however, 16 of these articles (5.8% of the 275 articles) included both students and nonstudents. Thirty studies (23% of the 131 articles) reported on special education teachers, 24 (18%) on parents, 21 (16%) on other transition professionals, and 10 (8%) on employers.

<sec id="section11-2165143413476734">
<title>Topical Areas</title>
<p>As noted, articles were sorted initially into one of three <italic>broad areas of focus</italic>: K–12 Education, Postschool Settings, and Nonstudent Specific areas. Next, articles in the K–12 Education and Postschool Settings broad area of focus were sorted into a <italic>secondary area of focus</italic>. Finally, articles in each area were sorted into a <italic>specific topical area</italic>. Articles could only be coded under one broad area and one secondary area; however, they could be coded under multiple specific topical areas that were unique to each of the broad and secondary areas of focus. The broad areas of focus with the corresponding secondary areas for each are described in the discussion below, while the corresponding topical areas are noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2165143413476734">Tables 2</xref> through <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2165143413476734">5</xref>. Articles that included data, meta-analyses, and secondary analyses, as well as some articles that did not present original data (e.g., program descriptions and literature reviews) were included in the analysis of the broad area of focus. Thus, in total, 387 articles were included in this analysis.</p>

<title>Trends</title>
<p>Trends over time were examined by data category. As a function of small cell sizes, observation periods were collapsed into 5-year increments. Even after collapsing data in this manner, most cell sizes remained small, and the only trends that could be analyzed were the number of articles featuring original versus nonoriginal data and the most common topics covered in those particular articles.</p>
<p>The number of published articles not presenting original data decreased steadily over the life of the journal, moving from 95 such articles in 1978–1982 to 28 in both 1998–2002 and 2003–2008. Conversely, the number of published articles including original data increased from 19 articles during the 5-year span 1978–1982 to 50 in 2008–2012 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2165143413476734">Figure 1</xref>). Likewise, the number of studies on students and young adults that provided sufficient information about the sample size steadily increased, moving from 9 articles from 1978–1982 to 39 articles from 2008–2012 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2165143413476734">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>With regard to articles presenting original data, the most frequently coded specific topical areas of focus were analyzed to observe trends over time. Articles that featured program descriptions fell from 19 in 1978–1982 to 2 in 2008–2012, while those that described a vocational education program decreased from 4 in 1978–1982 to 0 in 1993–1998, climbing to 2 in 2008–2012 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2165143413476734">Figure 3</xref>). No articles presented information on national data sets in 1978–1982. However, that increased to 12 articles from 2008–2012, whereas articles that specifically discussed transition and educational planning increased from 2 to 10 during the same time frame (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2165143413476734">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The data reflect a trend in the earliest years of CDTEI toward descriptive articles that capture the development of a profession, of a new area of study, and of a nascent journal. Although the initial focus of the division was on career education for students in K–12 education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2165143413476734">Brolin, 1996</xref>), the earliest articles described the development of a coordinated effort to provide services for adults with disabilities in vocational settings. Thus, it brought together vocational rehabilitation, vocational education, counseling, and then a little later, special education and general education. As the field moved toward the concept of transition in the early to mid-1980s, the articles reflect a shift toward that topical area as the number of articles that focused on “transition and educational planning,” rather than career education, increased steadily. These articles also tended to focus on special education programs, processes, and laws, and less on vocational rehabilitation and education.</p>
<p>As the journal matured, there was a continual uptick in the number of articles presenting original data. Correspondingly, these studies increasingly used sophisticated and rigorous research designs and result reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2165143413476734">Carter et al., 2013</xref>). These trends coincide with attempts by the field to increase the level of detail in describing samples in learning disabilities research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2165143413476734">Rosenberg et al., 1993</xref>) and more recently, in a 2005 special issue of <italic>Exceptional Children</italic> titled “Criteria for Evidence-Based Practice in Special Education: A Special Issue of <italic>Exceptional Children</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2165143413476734">Gersten et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed this emphasis was clearly adopted by the editors of CDTEI and is reflected in the manuscript submission policies of the journal.</p>
<p>Despite both increasing rigor and calls from the field for better sample reporting, sample descriptions often remained vague. The most commonly provided data regarding geographic location and race was “not clearly specified.” In addition, “not clearly specified” was the second most commonly provided label for study setting and disability category. Although gender was more clearly reported than the previously noted variables, there were still 76 studies that did not clearly specify gender. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2165143413476734">Shaw and Dukes (2013</xref> [this issue]) call for the development of evidence-based practices for the transition to postsecondary education. Moreover, the National Secondary Transition Technical Assistance Center (NSTTAC) has and continues to identify in-school predictors of postschool success for students with disabilities. To effectively achieve these goals, better sample reporting is necessary, and this goal appears to be reflected in more recent issues of the journal, at least in regard to the overall sample size. However, more detail is needed in regard to setting and student-specific information such as disability type, gender, and race/ethnicity.</p>
<p>Although the journal’s title includes the phrase “Exceptional Individuals,” the majority of the articles (<italic>n</italic> = 254) are focused on what we describe broadly as nonstudent areas (e.g., professional development, program descriptions, instrument development). This compares with 104 articles whose broad area of focus was on a K–12 setting, and 29 articles whose broad area of focus was on a postschool setting. Examination of the total number of studies presenting data on students (<italic>n</italic> = 158) versus nonstudents (e.g., parents, special education teachers, transition specialists; <italic>n</italic> = 131) may also point to the need for additional articles specifically focused on students with disabilities. Studies examining research-based interventions and high-quality instructional techniques impacting student outcomes appear to be needed at both the secondary and postsecondary level. Learning technologies are also radically and rapidly changing the educational landscape for students. Studies regarding which technologically driven interventions improve student transition outcomes as well as what types of supports are appropriate for different types of disabilities would be of benefit to the journal readership. Studies examining the results and efficacy of various transition initiatives at the K–12 level would be of great benefit. For example, does the use of universal design in secondary settings improve student access to the general education curriculum? There also appears to be a dearth of research related to nonacademic areas critical to adult life, including community participation, independent living skills, and leisure and recreation. Although these topics may be covered in articles published in journals other than CDTEI, there is a clear need for researchers working in these areas to consider the journal as a publication outlet to better share their work with the transition community.</p>
<p>In regard to topical areas, the relatively small number of articles (<italic>n</italic> = 32) that present original data related to Career/Vocational Development is surprising and clearly presents an opportunity for future investigators. Likewise, the relatively small number of articles that focus on postschool settings (<italic>n</italic> = 29) is also notable and is an area of need for future investigations. These could include studies of factors that influence a successful (or not successful) transition to college, the characteristics of successful and struggling postsecondary students, and eventual career outcomes of college graduates. As postsecondary programs continue to expand for students with intellectual disabilities, the field is ripe for rigorous research in this area as well.</p>
<sec id="section17-2165143413476734">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The results here must be examined in light of two limitations. First, the trends in the data presented and topics covered over time should be interpreted with caution given the small sample sizes across the majority of the data categories. Inferences drawn from the data should be judged in light of the reality that their precision might well have been impacted by the paucity of data in some topical areas. Second, it is important to consider that only articles from this journal were included in the analysis. The journal represents only a portion of the articles published on transition and career development within the special education literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-2165143413476734">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>This analysis of the topics and samples covered in the 35-year history of CDTEI reveals the growth and evolution of the journal. From an early focus on career development for young adults, the journal has since included a broad focus on K–12 education and the importance of transition embedded throughout. In addition, the number of studies presenting original data has increased over the past decade, along with a corresponding increase in better sample descriptions. Although there is much growth to recognize, the results also pointed out several key areas in which important work remains to be done to promote optimal outcomes for students with disabilities.</p>
