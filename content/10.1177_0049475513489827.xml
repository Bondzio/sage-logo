<abstract>
<p>In the developed nations, temporary ileostomies are usually made in order to protect a distal anastomosis after cancer surgery. However, in India and the neighbouring countries ileal perforation is the most common indication for creating a temporary ileostomy after emergency laparotomy. It seems logical to perform a contrast study when a stoma that was made to protect a bowel anastomosis is being reversed in order to check for anastomosis healing, leak or stenosis. Although we do not know precisely when and why we started this practice, it is customary at our institute to do a contrast study before reversal of a temporary ileostomy. At some institutes a routine contrast study is never done. The utility of this practice has not previously been studied at our institute. This study tries to correlate the surgeon’s clinical and operative findings with the contrast study report in order to see if it may be reasonable to reverse the stoma without a routine contrast study in selected patients where the surgeon has clearly documented absence of any gross disease in the distal bowel and who have had an uneventful post-operative period. To our knowledge this appears to be the first such attempt from our country.</p>

<p>Indications for a temporary ileostomy in India and the neighbouring countries are different from those in western countries. In the west most temporary ileostomies are made to protect a distal anastomosis after cancer surgery. It may be prudent to do a contrast study before stoma reversal in order to check for healing, anastomotic leak, stenosis, stricture or fistula, especially when the post-operative period has been eventful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513489827">1</xref></sup> Even in these patients, if the post-operative course is smooth and anastomosis clinically accessible, a contrast study of the anastomosis prior to ileostomy closure has been thought to be unnecessary or of little value.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513489827">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513489827">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>At our institute, peritonitis due to ileal perforation is a common indication for emergency laparotomy that culminates into a temporary ileostomy as it is thought to be the safest option for many of these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513489827">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513489827"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049475513489827">5</xref></sup> Also, it is customary to perform a contrast study of the distal bowel before stoma reversal. The time involved in obtaining a contrast study adds substantially to the overall waiting time before a stoma can be reversed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049475513489827">6</xref></sup> It also burdens the hospital resources,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0049475513489827">7</xref></sup> exposes patients to radiation and increases the cost to patients as they often have to pay for the contrast. Delay in stoma reversal affects the quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0049475513489827">7</xref></sup> and is associated with increased morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0049475513489827">8</xref></sup> Early closure is associated with fewer stoma related complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0049475513489827">9</xref></sup> At some institutes, a routine contrast study is not done at all before the reversal of ileostomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0049475513489827">7</xref></sup> Thus, a contrast study may be used more selectively for cases with a clinical suspicion or history of complication after the index surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0049475513489827">10</xref></sup> as the incidence of positive radiological findings in uncomplicated patients is low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513489827">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our objective was to study the correlation between the surgeon’s clinical and operative findings and the operative findings and contrast study report to see if it would be reasonable to reverse a stoma without a routine contrast study in selected patients where the surgeon has clearly documented an absence of any gross disease in the distal bowel and when there has been an uneventful post-operative period. The average waiting period for undergoing contrast study after an index operation and the average time interval between ileostomy formation and reversal were also studied.</p>
<p>In a PubMed® search in the English language we could find no studies that addressed the key issues in patients with temporary ileostomy after emergency surgeries that culminated into temporary ileostomy.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0049475513489827"><title>Methods and methodology</title>
<p>This retrospective analytical case series study was conducted at the department of surgery of a tertiary care teaching hospital in New Delhi after receiving approval from the institute’s ethical committee. Data from two surgical units were included and reports of patients who underwent a study between January 2010 and December 2011 were retrieved. The corresponding medical records of patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were also retrieved and evaluated. Patients with all types of temporary ileostomy (end loop, divided loop, end with mucus fistula) were included. Colostomy patients and malignancy or suspected malignancy patients were excluded. A total of 69 cases met the criteria of inclusion and were included in the study. Data from the contrast study reports and medical records of included patients were recorded in a structured case record pro forma. The data collected were analysed in order to fulfil the objectives of the study using the Kappa co-efficient. Kappa co-efficient (<italic>κ</italic>) was used for comparing the proposed variables to rule out any agreement that may happen by chance. The <italic>κ</italic> value and the corresponding level of agreement are as shown below.

<p>The contrast study reports of the included patients were studied. Ninety-six per cent (<italic>n</italic> = 66) were found to be reported as normal and 4% (<italic>n</italic> = 3) had some reported abnormality. The intra-operative findings documented at the index surgery were normal in 97% (<italic>n</italic> = 67) and abnormal in 3% (<italic>n</italic> = 2). An abnormal intra-operative finding was defined as stricture, adhesions or gross inflammation of the bowel distal to the chosen site of stoma. Inter-bowel adhesion involving the large bowel was also considered to be an abnormal finding. A total of 96% (<italic>n</italic> = 66) patients had a normal intra-operative finding and a normal contrast study report. Three of the 69 patients had an abnormal contrast study report, of which two also had a documented abnormal intra-operative finding.

<p>In South East Asian countries such as India, ileal perforation peritonitis constitutes one of the common surgical emergencies encountered and typhoid being endemic continues to be among the common aetiologies for ileal perforation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513489827">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513489827"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049475513489827"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049475513489827">6</xref></sup> Most of these perforation cases require an emergent laparotomy and creation of a temporary ileostomy is not only lifesaving but also a preferred surgical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513489827">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513489827"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049475513489827"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049475513489827">6</xref></sup> Although we do not know precisely when and why we started doing it, it is customary at our institute to do a contrast study before reversal of a temporary ileostomy. In the West, most temporary ileostomies are made to protect a low colorectal anastomosis and a contrast study is done before reversal of stoma in order to rule out anastomotic leak, stenosis or stricture. Even in these patients, if the post-operative course is smooth and the anastomosis clinically accessible a contrast study of the anastomosis prior to ileostomy closure is thought to be unnecessary or of little value.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513489827">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513489827">2</xref></sup> At some institutes a routine contrast study is never done.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0049475513489827">7</xref></sup> The utility of this practice of contrast study before stoma reversal has never been studied at our institute in patients undergoing a temporary ileostomy.</p>
<p>Loop ileostomy was the most common temporary ileostomy in our study group. More than 80% of patients were from the 16–45 years age group and 75% were males. This is the most socially-productive age group and if a man, who is the bread winner in a family, is affected it is not only he who suffers but the whole family. Seventy per cent (<italic>n</italic> = 48) were diagnosed pre-operatively as peritonitis with a possibility of enteric ileal perforation based on clinical features and abdominal radiographs. Based on the operative findings documented by the senior resident, the post-operative diagnosis was the same as the pre-operative diagnosis in 95% (<italic>n</italic> = 65) of the cases. The diagnosis of ileal perforation was substantiated in 67% (<italic>n</italic> = 46). The <italic>κ</italic> co-efficient that takes into account the agreement by chance was used to study the level of agreement. An excellent level of agreement (<italic>κ</italic> value = 0.908; excellent = &gt;0.75; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0049475513489827">Table 2</xref>) was found between the pre- and post-operative diagnoses which suggests that a correct diagnosis was not just made by chance and that the clinical acumen of our resident doctors is excellent and can be relied upon.</p>
<p>Reports of contrast studies (normal 96%; abnormal 4%) and surgeon documented intra-operative findings (normal 97%; abnormal 3%) were also tested for agreement by Cohen’s <italic>κ</italic> co-efficient (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0049475513489827">Table 3</xref>). There was an excellent level of agreement suggesting that the surgeon documented intra-operative findings are as good as a contrast study report. Of the 69 patients, three had an abnormal contrast study report and, of these, two also had an intra-operatively documented abnormality. The first patient, where the contrast study showed a stricture in transverse colon, had undergone loop ileostomy for ileal perforation. The surgeon had also documented oedema and pus flakes over the transverse colon. The second patient, where the contrast study reported a leak of contrast after hepatic flexure, was a case of stab injury. The patient had: a complicated and stormy post-operative period; a redo surgery for stoma retraction; and developed a faecal fistula in the post-operative period before being discharged from the hospital after improvement. The surgeon had also documented inter-bowel loop and parietal adhesions. Thus, these two patients had either an abnormal intra-operative finding or a complicated course after surgery. Patients with clinical suspicion or a history of complication after index surgery should continue to undergo contrast study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0049475513489827">10</xref></sup> In the third patient, intra-operative findings were reported to be normal but the contrast study showed a possibility of partial stricture in the sigmoid colon. The dye was flowing freely into the rectum but there was some luminal disparity. The label ‘partial stricture’ was based on the clinical experience of the radiologist rather than objective criteria. This patient, who had undergone a loop ileostomy after ileal perforation, had a smooth uneventful post-operative course and was found to have no stricture on colonoscopy just prior to stoma reversal. Khair et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513489827">2</xref></sup> had two patients in their study where the stoma was reversed despite a positive leak on contrast enema report. The patients had a low clinical suspicion of complication and underwent stoma reversal uneventfully and without any additional investigation. The authors have suggested that a routine contrast study in the absence of clinical suspicion is of little value.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513489827">2</xref></sup> Thus, we extrapolate that, in the absence of clinical suspicion or complication, stoma reversal without a contrast study may be a viable option for selected patients.</p>
<p>Most of the ileal perforation patients were clinically suspected to have enteric fever that remains a public health problem in India, is endemic to our city and has been identified as a common cause of peritonitis in this region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513489827">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049475513489827"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049475513489827">6</xref></sup> In our study, 67% of those with temporary stomas had a post-operative diagnosis of enteric ileal perforation. Terminal ileum is the favoured site for typhoid ulcers but ulcers can occur anywhere from stomach to the rectum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0049475513489827">11</xref></sup> Cecum and ascending colon may be affected by direct bacterial invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0049475513489827">11</xref></sup> but, otherwise, colonic involvement is very rare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049475513489827">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0049475513489827">11</xref></sup> Thus, with a post-operative diagnosis of enteric ileal perforation, it may not be injudicious to assume that there is a miniscule chance of finding an abnormality on a contrast study in the large bowel, especially if the pathology found at the index operation has already been dealt with adequately by virtue of an ileostomy and the surgeon has documented a normal condition of the bowel distal to the chosen site of stoma. In cases where the surgeon encountered multiple perforations in the ileum and chose to primarily close the distal ones while exteriorizing the most proximal one as a stoma, the post-operative course of the patient should govern the need for a contrast study. If a patient has a smooth post-operative course and clinical suspicion of a leak is low, the contrast study is likely to be of little value.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513489827">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513489827">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>By safely reducing the number of unnecessary contrast studies the waiting period for reversal of stoma can be reduced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0049475513489827">Table 4</xref>). A study from our institute has shown a statistically significant association between the duration of a stoma and the general quality of life (QoL) of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049475513489827">6</xref></sup> Thus, we again stress the need for being selective in undertaking a contrast study for patients before the reversal of a stoma. This will not only affect QoL of stoma patients but also save valuable hospital resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0049475513489827">7</xref></sup> and, also, save patients from being exposed to the harmful effects of radiation. In addition, the effort involved in carrying out too many contrast studies can be effectively channelled into other important and more demanding tasks without compromising patient care.</p>

<p>This study explores and proposes the possibility of using contrast studies more selectively in patients undergoing ileostomy reversal, especially for those with enteric ileal perforations. The pre-operative and post-operative diagnoses had an excellent level of agreement which suggests a high standard of clinical acumen. An excellent level of agreement between the surgeon’s operative findings and the contrast study report also suggests that the clinical judgement of the surgeon could be relied upon when selecting patients for a contrast study. The post-operative course of patients should be taken into account before subjecting them to contrast study. We favour the practice of contrast imaging in patients with abnormal intra-operative findings, a complicated post-operative course and, also, tuberculosis. The waiting period before undergoing a contrast study adds to the morbidity of stoma and delays stomal reversal procedures. It appears that in selected patients not performing a contrast study is a safe and viable option.</p>
<p>Despite being constrained by its retrospective design and small sample size this study promises to provide important background knowledge to future researchers. It is recommended that a better designed prospective study is undertaken using a larger sample size.</p>
