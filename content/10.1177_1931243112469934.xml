It explores how rolling coverage has reshaped news, influenced the practices of political players and democratic institutions, and affected how people conceive of the world around them.</p><p>Using a variety of methodological approaches and theoretical frameworks, the book covers regions as diverse as Europe, North America, and South America, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. The result is a refreshing and comprehensive academic approach to a highly important subject.</p><p>Several book chapters and academic articles have individually studied the topic since the 1990s, often focusing on isolated case studies, but this book has the benefit of systematically exploring the significance of rolling news coverage as a distinctive genre. Seventeen essays span across history and geography to describe and assess the role of this technology.</p><p>This, however, should not suggest that the various authors adopt a technological-determinism approach. Far from that, the role of ownership, the pressures of the market, the agendas of nation states, and the expectations of the audience all affect the way the medium was used—and abused.</p><p>The editors, Stephen Cushion and Justin Lewis of the Cardiff School of Journalism in Wales, seem pessimistic about the prognosis. They, along with several of the chapters’ authors, suggest that 24-hr news channels have reduced coverage to an interminable series of live, breaking pictures devoid of context and analysis. The space that a 24-hr block of time provides was superseded by competition and market pressures. Although in some areas such as the Middle East, the rise of Al Jazeera and its counterparts brought about a wider coverage of events, in many other instances where survival depends on ratings, the rolling news coverage has paradoxically meant flash updates without significant content.</p><p>The book is divided into four parts. The first focuses on the rise and development of 24-hr news stations and reviews the map of such media outlets around the world today. It looks at the role audience expectations and economics have played in shaping the way 24/7 news channels evolved.</p><p>The second part surveys the effect of live, breaking news on journalistic practice, ethics, and coverage.</p><p>Part 3 looks at case studies from various parts of the world and assesses the impact of 24-hr news stations on the countries or regions in question. Chapters cover the Middle East, Latin America, Gaza, and Australia.</p><p>The last part of the book addresses the interaction between national agendas and editorial strategies, with a focus on France, China, Germany, and India.</p><p>All in all, the anthology is an invaluable addition to the electronic news studies corpus. The global approach it adopts contributes to our understanding of globalization and exposes us to the intricate diversity and complexity of what Marshall McLuhan dubbed the “global village.” It also highlights the close relationship between and influences on politics, culture, and media.</p><p>The book is all the more valuable in the age of Twitter journalism, now that instant news is as instant as it can get. The 30-year lapse grants us the luxury to reflect profoundly and assess critically the impact of instant news on our lives. It could be a revealing indicator about the now, which seems more elusive at this moment, with technologies and trends evolving as we speak.</p><p>Finally, <italic>The Rise of 24-Hour News Television </italic>is an opportunity to reflect on journalism as a profession: What it has become, where it is heading, and whether it is evolving in the right direction. In an age of breaking news, instant pictures, and latest polls, it is a welcome opportunity to quietly ponder about a rapidly changing field.</p></body></article>
