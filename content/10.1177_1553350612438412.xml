<p><bold>Background</bold>. The single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) technique has been used in many surgical procedures, but there are few reports regarding liver surgeries. The purpose of this study was to perform single-incision laparoscopic hepatectomy (SILH) using standard laparoscopic instrumentation in 8 Chinese patients. The advantages and prospective future applications of SILH are also described. <bold>Methods</bold>. Selected patients were hospitalized between December 2009 and November 2011. The procedure was accomplished through a 2.5-cm transabdominal wall incision using a laparoscope and 2 other instruments without the assistance of any articulating instruments or single multiport trocar. <bold>Results</bold>. All procedures were successfully performed without the need for supplemental trocars. Postoperative pathological examinations were supportive of the preoperative diagnoses. No complications such as perioperative hemorrhage or infections occurred. <bold>Conclusion</bold>. SILH appears to be a safe approach and the results are cosmetically favorable. The accumulation of SILH experience and the development of instrumentation are needed for extensive use of this technique in hepatectomies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a novel, minimally invasive procedure that has been used to perform a variety of surgeries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612438412">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612438412"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612438412"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612438412">4</xref></sup> Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) is currently recommended as the primary procedure by some experts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612438412">5</xref></sup> To date, the question of whether SILS is amenable to hepatic surgery remains unanswered. The anatomical complexity of the liver contributes greatly to the challenges associated with conventional laparoscopic manipulation. Although there is little published information on single-incision laparoscopic hepatectomy (SILH), it is anticipated that SILH will be as challenging as or more challenging than conventional laparoscopic surgery because the single incision restricts the surgeon’s ability to manipulate the tissues. To date, there have been only a few reports on the treatment of hepatic cysts via SILS. Despite the challenges associated with SILH, the benefits of the technique are immense. This report describes 8 patients who underwent SILH and discusses the authors’ experiences and the advantages and potential problems associated with this approach.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Between December 2009 and November 2011, 8 patients underwent SILH in our department. Preoperative diagnosis confirmed 4 cases of primary hepatic carcinoma, 1 case of metastatic liver carcinoma, and 3 cases of benign liver neoplasms based on clinical presentations, laboratory examinations, and imaging studies, including abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612438412">Table 1</xref>). Presurgically, the procedure was described in detail to all patients, and informed written consent was obtained.</p>

<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>Following routine perioperative care and anesthesia, a 2.5-cm incision was created around the umbilicus. The actual size and location of the incision varied slightly from patient to patient depending on the body types and exact location of the lesion. A Veress needle was placed directly into the peritoneal cavity, and carbon dioxide was insufflated to 14 mm Hg. One 10-mm and two 5-mm trocars (Kanger, Tong Lu, China) were inserted through the incision and packed with towels to prevent gas leakage. The 10-mm trocar was used to introduce a 30° 10-mm laparoscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and the 5-mm trocars were used to insert a grasper and a laparoscopic ultrasound equipment (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). After exploring the abdominal cavity with the laparoscope, the actual position of the hepatic lesion was identified. Each patient was also assessed for evidence of metastasis, and the location of the margin of the lesion to be resected was confirmed.</p>
<p>Based on perioperative imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612438412">Figure 1</xref>) and intraoperative ultrasound examinations, a cutline 1 cm from each lesion was marked via electric coagulation (Kanger, Tong Lu, China), except for the fourth patient. Instead, a 0.5-cm hole in the cystic wall was created using an ultrasonic scalpel (Ethicon Endosurgery, Cincinnati, OH) through one of the 5-mm trocars, and fluid was extracted using a suction device. When the cyst collapsed, the ultrasonic surgical system was used to resect the cystic wall and the surrounding hepatic tissue on the left side of the broad ligament. In the remaining 7 patients, the surgical procedure for hepatectomy was the same as routine laparoscopic hepatectomy. Strict oncological principles were observed for all patients diagnosed with malignant lesions. An ultrasonic scalpel and LigaSure (Valleylab, Covidien) were used to incise the hepatic amicula and carefully dissect the liver parenchyma. During the transection, the small intraparenchymal vessels were coagulated with the ultrasonic scalpel or LigaSure. When the LigaSure was used, one of the 5-mm trocars was exchanged for a 10-mm trocar. When approaching larger structures, such as branches of hepatic veins and Glisson bundles, one of the 5-mm trocars was exchanged for a 12-mm trocar to permit insertion of either an Endo Clip applier (Valleylab, Covidien) or endoscopic stapler (Ethicon Endosurgery, Cincinnati, OH).</p>

</fig>
<p>To achieve afferent blood control during left liver resection, liver surface transection was performed using an ultrasonic scalpel, which coagulated vessels &lt;2 mm in diameter. Deep parenchyma dissection was achieved with the LigaSure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612438412">Figure 2</xref>), which also sealed intrahepatic vessels &lt;5 mm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612438412">Figure 3</xref>). Larger tracts of the left hepatic vein and artery were all clipped with laparoscopic clips (Tyco USSC, Norwalk, CT, USA) and then divided. When the branch was too large to apply a clip, it was transected with an endoscopic linear stapler. For the eighth patient who underwent external left lobectomy, transfixion was successfully performed to achieve hemostasis in the transection plane when the LigaSure and clips failed. In right liver resections, the large supply vessels around the tumor were identified by laparoscopic ultrasonography and were clipped and transected with an endoscopic linear stapler extraparenchymally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1553350612438412">Figure 4</xref>). After the transection, the resected, raw surface of the liver was sealed with fibrin sealant (Fibrin GluRAAS, Shanghai RAAS Blood Products, China) in all cases. The resected specimens were immediately isolated and placed in a specimen bag and then extracted through the incision, which was increased to 3 to 6 cm, based on the size of the resected tumor. After confirming the lack of bleeding and biliary leakage by careful inspection of the peritoneum, a drainage tube was placed, and the abdominal wall muscles were closed layer by layer in a standard fashion.</p>

<title>Postoperative Management</title>
<p>Postoperative care was identical to that for open liver resections, including perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and hemostatic and fluid management. In addition, the drainage tube was taken good care of and squeezed every 2 hours to prevent blood clots from blocking the tube. When the drainage fluid amount was less than 30 mL/d, it was removed.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All 8 SILH procedures were successful. A standard hepatectomy of the external left lobe was performed in 3 patients, tumorectomy in 4 patients, and drainage of hepatic cysts and partial hepatectomy in 1 patient (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1553350612438412">Table 2</xref>). The histopathological results confirmed the preoperative diagnosis in all patients. For patients 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8, there was no evidence of neoplastic cells at the incisal margins. Postoperatively, all patients recovered uneventfully, and no complications such as bleeding, biliary leakage, and infection occurred. All drainage tubes were removed on day 2 postsurgically. We found that 7 patients were able to walk unassisted 1 day postsurgically, and the remaining patient (#2) began to walk unassisted on day 2. All patients returned to their normal diet by day 3 and were discharged within 2 to 6 days.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cosmetic results and the short recovery period have contributed to the popularity of laparoscopic surgeries, including in the management of benign and malignant hepatic tumors. In fact, the laparoscopic approach may become the gold standard for treating localized lesions in some parts of the liver (eg, segments 2 and 3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612438412">6</xref></sup> The SILS technique, however, is technically challenging for hepatectomies. Therefore, few surgeons currently use SILH. Kobayashi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612438412">7</xref></sup> reported their first case of SILH in June 2010. In that report, the 55-year-old male patient was diagnosed with a 2-cm primary, malignant hepatic tumor in the third hepatic segment by MRI. SILH for hepatic tumorectomy was achieved by making a 2.5-cm incision below the umbilicus. Satisfactory cosmetic results and a fast recovery were reported. Currently, the complexities associated with SILH continue to limit its use in hepatic surgeries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612438412">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The major challenges associated with SILS are the parallel insertions of surgical devices and laparoscope, the narrow room for manipulations, and the parallel field of view.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612438412">8</xref></sup> To date, the authors of this report have performed 254 cases of SILC and 8 cases of SILH since our hospital first began using single-incision laparoscopy. In the authors’ experience, avoiding intraoperative bleeding from ruptured blood vessels is the key to success during SILS, such as SILC and SILH, just as it is to the success of total laparoscopic hepatectomy because of the rich blood supply in the liver and the complexity of the hepatic structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612438412">9</xref></sup> In addition to the 8 SILH cases, 53 cases of total laparoscopic hepatectomy have also been performed by the authors of this study. Together, this accumulated experience in the manipulation of tissues during laparoscopic hepatectomy, both traditional and via the single-incision approach, contributes greatly to the shortened operative duration and marked reduction in intraoperative bleeding reported by this group of surgeons. In the authors’ hands, the ultrasonic scalpel and LigaSure are effective for dissecting the liver parenchyma and achieving hemostasis when bleeding stems from small vessels. The LigaSure has been reported to be effective in sealing vessels up to 7 mm in diameter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612438412">10</xref></sup> For larger vessels, such as the hepatic veins and Glisson bundles, the Endo Clip and endoscopic linear stapler was effective, as previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612438412">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612438412">9</xref></sup> Transfixation may also be an option when either the LigaSure or Endo Clips are feeble and bleeding is noted or the blood vessel(s) retract into the liver parenchyma.</p>
<p>Selection of the umbilicus for placement of the trocars allows for the possibility of hiding the surgical incision to achieve desirable cosmetic results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612438412">7</xref></sup> In practice, however, the transumbilical route is not ideal for all patients because the distances from the umbilicus to the liver vary as a result of differences in body types. Ideally, the position of the incision should be selected based on the patient’s body type and the position of the lesions, which will vary from case to case. In this report, patients 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were short in body type, and the lesions were close to the umbilicus, providing an ideal situation for manipulations during SILH. In contrast, patients 1, 3, and 8 were tall, and the lesions were on the left and right side of the liver, respectively. In these cases, the incisions were created on the superior left umbilicus and superior right umbilicus to ensure that the instruments would reach the lesions.</p>
<p>When conducting laparoscopic hepatectomy for malignant hepatic tumorectomy, it is imperative to select appropriate cases based on the size and position of the tumor as well as its relation with the peripheral great vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612438412">11</xref></sup> In the authors’ opinion, SILH may be applicable for tumors measuring &lt;5 cm, tumors located in the superficial regions of the liver, and tumors located at the periphery of the liver. Generally, large tumors located deep in the liver or in the posterior right lobe are not amenable to either total laparoscopic hepatectomy or SILH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612438412">12</xref></sup> Nonetheless, SILH may be feasible for large (&gt;5 cm) hepatic tumors where there is no evidence of metastases that are localized to the external left lobe or in the right liver periphery. In this report, patient 2 was diagnosed with a malignant lesion localized to the external left lobe of the liver, which was successfully treated using SILH only after a complete preoperative workup and after intraoperative confirmation of the location and size of the tumor had been confirmed by ultrasonic endoscopy to ensure the safety and feasibility of the procedure. In such patients, it is critical to perform SILH using strict oncological principles: following the principle of “no touch,” ensuring that a radical excision (<italic>R</italic>
<sub>0</sub>) is achieved, and creating a 1-cm noncancerous incisal margin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612438412">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612438412">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>SILS is a promising minimally invasive procedure largely because of the favorable cosmetic results and rapid postoperative recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612438412">14</xref></sup>; however, when considering SILH, appropriate patient selection is essential. It is also a prerequisite for surgeons to master the techniques of both total laparoscopic hepatectomy and SILS. Continued progress in instrument development, additional clinical experience, and longitudinal follow-up studies to determine the safety and feasibility of SILS for a myriad benign and malignant hepatic conditions are needed.</p>
