<p>Condensing a century and a half of Mexican immigration history into 150 pages is no simple task, but Timothy Henderson has done so admirably. Henderson’s synthesis is designed as a brief supplemental reading for use in the classroom, and it will serve this purpose very well. More ambitiously he aims to intervene in the often-abrasive debate in the United States over immigration and to help pave the way toward ‘rational and productive reform' (158). To do so, he focuses on transnational political economy and on the contradictions of US immigration policy. He argues, most broadly, that undocumented Mexican immigration has economic roots that will require binational cooperation to develop successful economic solutions.</p>
<p>Henderson acknowledges that Mexican immigration and the debates surrounding it have echoed other immigrations in US history, but one of his goals is to highlight some very important differences. First, Mexicans have mostly immigrated (until recent years) to areas that the United States conquered from Mexico in the mid-nineteenth century, leading some ethnic Mexicans to declare the Southwest as an ancestral homeland and some nativist demagogues to charge immigrants with a conspiracy to ‘reconquer’ the territory. Second, the proximity and economic ties between the United States and Mexico created a ‘larger and more sustained' process than other immigrations (3). Third, the context and historical timing of Mexican immigration has led to the classification of a large proportion of migrants as ‘illegal’. Henderson rightly points out that ‘illegality’ itself is a fairly recent historical phenomenon, growing out of twentieth-century policies that progressively restricted the right of migrants to enter the United States.</p>
<p>The narrative begins with the U.S.–Mexican War in 1848, though the author moves quickly through the next 70-year period in a single chapter. The first section of this and subsequent chapters focuses on the circumstances in Mexico that prompted increasing numbers of migrants to cross the northern border. His extensive treatment of Mexico is one of the greatest strengths of the book. Henderson demonstrates, however, that the United States played a large role in creating conditions in Mexico that led to such emigration. Early on it did so through its conquest of half of Mexico’s territory, later through its investments and direct involvement in Mexico’s economy through mining, railroad construction and the commercialization of agriculture, all of which helped spawn a revolution that spurred increasing emigration after 1910.</p>
<p>For Henderson, it was in the early twentieth century that the most enduring patterns developed. Most important were US employers’ demands for a cheap, moveable, and non-unionized workforce, which attracted Mexicans who were coping with ‘violence, poverty, and a lack of opportunity’ in their own country (8). The US government repeatedly bowed to the labor demands of business interests. At times it did so simply by turning the other cheek, at other times by exempting Mexicans from immigration quotas and other restrictions and experimenting with programs to recruit temporary workers directly from Mexico. Rising immigration, however, bred sharp reactions by those who believed that immigrants drove down wages and drained public resources or, most troublingly, that they culturally and racially contaminated the nation. Repeatedly – in the 1930s and again in the 1950s – such backlashes led to mass deportations and other crackdowns. Most recently, as concerns over national security combined with economic and cultural anxieties, the din against immigration has reached a crescendo, resulting in enhanced border enforcement and increasing dangers for the immigrants themselves.</p>
<p>Henderson avoids polemics, but he is not afraid to criticize demagoguery and flawed policies. He condemns the current system as ‘unjust and cruel’ (156) and suggests that simple solutions such as mass deportation are ‘sheer fantasy’ (153). He argues that Americans’ concern for protecting the southern border while largely ignoring the northern border evinces not only worries over economic and national security, but also a desire to maintain boundaries around affluence and privilege, ethnicity, and culture (154). He reserves some criticism for those on the other side of the debate, particularly for those who have refused to endorse or enforce meaningful sanctions against employers.</p>
<p>While Henderson does an excellent job describing the causes of and debates over Mexican immigration, he spends little time discussing the experiences of immigrants themselves. The book is also somewhat uneven in its treatment of the regions where most immigrants have settled, with much more space dedicated to California than to Texas, and very little attention paid to Arizona and New Mexico. Fortunately, the book’s brevity will allow instructors to assign additional readings to fill these gaps.</p>
<p>The final pages of <italic>Beyond Borders</italic> discuss possible solutions. Most prominently, Henderson advocates reform of trade policies that have promoted the free movement of capital without anticipating that such policies would promote trans-national migration. He argues that the inclusion of ‘social clauses' such as ‘internationally recognized standards on wages and working conditions' might prevent so many Mexicans from seeking better opportunities in the United States (156). Rather than assert that he has all of the answers, however, he suggests that a better understanding of the history of Mexican immigration will tone down the hyperbole and grandstanding and help to challenge the unjust and failed system now in place. This reviewer hopes that such aspirations are not out of reach.</p>
