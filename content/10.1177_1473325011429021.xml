<abstract>
<p>This article presents data from a two-year case study using multiple qualitative methods to probe how residents of a suburban area interpreted the question of settlement by undocumented Latino immigrants in their neighborhoods. Though many residents framed their understanding of neighborhood problems via racialized portrayals alluding to ‘inferior’ countries of origin and culture, data here indicate that their hope was to restore both the worth of their properties and what they perceived to be an injured sense of place identity. Findings from this study suggest that non-governmental organizations could assist with mediating conflict and supporting immigrant incorporation into communities by serving as liaisons between newcomers and wary homeowners.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1473325011429021" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Numerous US small cities have emerged as so-called ‘new destinations’ for Latino workers, many arriving without legal immigration status. Their arrival to communities unaccustomed to incorporating immigrants has often prompted enactment of municipal ordinances to dissuade their residency. Some statutes forbid property rentals without checking immigration status; others mandate law enforcement ‘crackdowns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473325011429021">Claffey, 2006</xref>). Though social work has begun inquiry into barriers to social provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011429021">Lewis, 2008</xref>), as well as understanding immigrant lived experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011429021">Hancock, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325011429021">Paris, 2008</xref>), the profession’s scholarship has yet to ask why some localities have become sites for anti-immigrant activism and policies, while others embrace or at least tolerate newcomers. Though the latter constructs (tolerance or conscious inclusion) are beyond the scope of this article, I seek to present a nuanced understanding of how some residents of a predominantly white area made meaning of changes to their neighborhoods. I do so to begin discussion and invocation to future research to better understand opposition to immigrant settlement. A nuanced understanding of why some residents oppose immigrant residency may prompt interventions to assuage community concerns – and thus lessen the appeal of anti-immigrant policies. This article presents findings from a case study of a suburban county that adopted one of the nation’s most stringent anti-immigrant ordinances. I explore the question of how residents delineated neighborhood identity at a time of conflict marked by anti-immigrant activism, declining home values, and a soaring foreclosure rate.</p>
<p>Neighborhoods represent values and a way of life, and thus are subject to shifting perceptions and efforts to identify and reclaim boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011429021">Campbell et al., 2009</xref>). As has been described in the rich sociological canon of neighborhood studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011429021">Anderson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325011429021">Gans, 1962</xref>), residents’ interpretations include symbols, memories and impressions that change as residents perceive threats from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011429021">Kissane, 2010</xref>). As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011429021">Blumer (1969)</xref>, subjective meanings emerge during social interactions. ‘Subjective understandings of symbolic identities, social relations, and events intertwine with particular locations to shape positive and negative attachments, feelings, and, ultimately, social action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011429021">Kissane, 2010</xref>: 6). In what follows, I analyze data from three qualitative methods: ethnographic observation, in-depth recorded interviews (<italic>n</italic> = 23) and open-ended survey questions (<italic>n</italic> = 103) to elucidate strategies of identity negotiation engaged by English-speaking residents of neighborhoods that became sites for anti-immigrant activism. Strategies included: 1. Delineating acceptable behavior through narratives and symbols, 2. Efforts to repel threats to status such as political activism or reporting zoning violations, and 3. Accommodation of behaviors eschewed by other neighbors. As explained in the findings, residents lived in neighborhoods with high foreclosure rates and real estate deprecation – causing financial duress that led to anger. By way of orientation, I explore the literature on place identity to provide a conceptual framework that will facilitate explaining the findings.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1473325011429021"><title>Literature review</title>
<p>Neighborhoods beset by poverty and crime develop reputations reinforced through the adjectives, ‘run-down,’ ‘trashy,’ ‘blighted,’ or simply, ‘bad.’ Words not only impugn neighborhoods, but also stigmatize people who reside there, as evidenced by slurs such as ‘trailer trash’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429021">Kusenbach, 2009</xref>) or names for impoverished neighborhood as ‘badlands’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011429021">Kissane, 2010</xref>). As noted in a study of stigma surrounding trailer parks, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429021">Kusenbach, 2009</xref>), neighborhoods serve as symbolic expressions of people’s identities; one with a ‘bad’ reputation may stigmatize residents. Social psychologists argue that place identity reflexively informs individual’s self-identity and ultimately encompasses conscious and unconscious ideas, beliefs and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011429021">Low and Altman, 1992</xref>). ‘Homes are much more than physical shelters: They are powerful symbols of individual and collective identities and relationships. Denigrations on one’s home may thus be felt as an assault on one’s identity and community, as a symbolic challenge to one’s place in society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429021">Kusenbach, 2009</xref>: 401). Maintenance of place identity requires managing stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011429021">Goffman, 1963</xref>), reinforcing attachment through narrative and social interactions, or efforts to exclude certain populations.</p>
<p>Perceptions of neighborhoods as ‘bad’ may discourage some from walking or even driving through them, reinforcing beliefs that the area is not only poor but that residents are of questionable character. Mobile home park residents may accept the terms ‘trailer’ and ‘trailer parks,’ but use, ‘trailer trash’ only to distance themselves from residents whose behavior transgresses the symbolic moral marker between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429021">Kusenbach, 2009</xref>). By using the word, ‘trash,’ residents may protect themselves from stigma by distancing themselves from other trailer residents who behave badly.</p>
<p>Routine practices and narratives preserve positive place identity. From a symbolic interactionist perspective, place identity is developed, negotiated, perceived, maintained and contested much like individual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011429021">Gieryn, 2000</xref>). Research on place attachment, defined as how people think and feel about their neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011429021">Chamlee-Wright and Storr, 2009</xref>) has identified interactions that abet positive feelings about neighborhoods including personal encounters, seasonal celebrations and upkeep of premises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011429021">Brown et al., 2003</xref>). Neighborhoods are more than physical space; they constitute symbols which people use to set expectations for behavior, norms and values as unspoken criteria for inclusion.</p>
<p>Positive place identity and attachment may exist despite poverty and a ‘bad’ reputation. A post-Katrina study of New Orleans’ Ninth Ward residents found lasting attachment to the neighborhood despite outsider perceptions of poverty and crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011429021">Chamlee-Wright and Storr, 2009</xref>). Hurricane survivors hoped to return despite poverty that threatened rebuilding efforts. Thus, place attachment and identity depend on more than home occupancy or residential construction; its existence is shaped by discourse, perception, action, and interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011429021">Gieryn, 2000</xref>). When material resources are limited, residents depend on culture to preserve place identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011429021">Chamlee-Wright and Storr, 2009</xref>). ‘The disruption in their place attachment made return desirable since their sense of contentment, well-being, and even self could only be found in New Orleans’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011429021">Chamlee-Wright and Storr, 2009</xref>: 629).</p>
<p>Not only are the edifices and terrain of place subject to change, but so are their meanings and interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011429021">Gieryn, 2000</xref>). Place identity hinges on symbols as they become internalized aspects of self that exist both in a physical setting outside of self, and part of an internal schema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011429021">Falk et al., 2006</xref>). An individual’s social and existential identity is therefore, to some degree, a product of where he or she lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473325011429021">Park et al., 2010</xref>). Critically, neighborhoods are also financial investments, and as such, can become stages for contestation over the prerogative to dictate accepted practices. As evidenced by municipal ordinances to dissuade immigrant residency in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Farmingville, New York volatile processes of contestation have erupted in localities where citizens perceive threats to quality of life from undocumented neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473325011429021">Claffey, 2006</xref>). Contestation encompasses the dominant group’s efforts to preserve power by deciding which groups are acceptable as neighbors and which are not. Exclusion strategies include narratives, social movements and policies to make residency as inhospitable as possible. ‘This language of spatial exclusivity implies a pre-existing social and spatial identity that confers a positive identity to the culturally, economically, historically, and/or numerically dominant group while simultaneously labeling another group as “other,” and typically by definition inferior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011429021">Lemanski and Saff, 2010</xref>: 509). Outsiders perceived to hold different values, and hence to be ‘inferior’ become rallying points. In recent cases, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011429021">Lemanski and Saff, 2010</xref>), the positive values of citizen residents – law abiding, clean, taxpayers – have been contrasted with undocumented Latinos, who are presumed to be devoid of such attributes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1473325011429021" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>Proceeding on the understanding that people in new destination communities engage in constructing identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473325011429021">Patton, 2002</xref>), we designed a study that allowed us to hear residents’ stories while observing social settings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1473325011429021">1</xref></sup> The goals were to: 1. Obtain rich, thick data to understand residents’ lived experiences; 2. Sample enough respondents to ensure multiple viewpoints so that emerging themes could be challenged, and 3. Engage in persistent observation to understand contextual factors shaping lived experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325011429021">Lincoln and Guba, 1985</xref>: 304). We used a modified replication of sociologist Douglas S. Massey’s ethno-survey methodology characterized by multi-method data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473325011429021">Massey, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011429021">Massey and Capoferro, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473325011429021">Massey (1987)</xref> developed ethno-survey methodology to obtain more valid data on Mexican migration by studying communities in both Mexico and the US via the simultaneous application of ethnographic and survey methods. Unlike Massey, who sought generalizable findings via comparing multiple communities, our goal was to obtain a trustworthy understanding of one residential area. Therefore, we sacrificed the multi-site sampling while retaining key features of Massey’s approach to obtain an in-depth understanding (1987: 1504): archival research and ethnographic immersion prior to face-to-face surveys; ethnographic observation while conducting surveys, and recorded interviews. Ethno-surveys are designed to obtain identical information from informants, though questions and word ordering may vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011429021">Lattanzi Shutika, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011429021">Massey and Capoferro, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1473325011429021">2</xref></sup> We sought credible data about residents’ perceptions of neighborhood change within the context of an immigration controversy: ethno-surveys afforded us the means to reach respondents in their homes while engaged in prolonged observation.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1473325011429021"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>We used random sampling to obtain multiple viewpoints and to ensure that activist sentiments did not dominate findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473325011429021">Massey, 1987</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1473325011429021">3</xref></sup> Two adjacent neighborhoods were chosen because key informants and newspaper coverage described them as areas in which long-time predominantly white citizens resided in close proximity to Latino immigrants. Questions covered the following domains (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1473325011429021">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Principal investigators engaged in direct observation prior to ethno-survey administration. Surveys and field work were conducted in tandem by 14 graduate and undergraduate students in sociology, folklore, anthropology and social work, who we trained for seven weeks in research ethics, ethnographic field work and survey administration. Potential respondents received letters explaining the study’s purpose. Surveys were conducted after respondents signed IRB-approved consent forms explaining that the study concerned community change including immigration, traffic, housing and other issues. Each survey was assigned a sort number to ensure confidentiality; addresses were not attached to surveys. Students were assigned to work in pairs for safety as well as to facilitate interviewing. One in each pair interacted with respondents and asked questions, while the other entered data on a laptop equipped with ethno-survey software. Ethno-surveys (<italic>n</italic> = 103) were conducted in March through June 2008.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1473325011429021"><title>Respondents</title>
<p>Researchers identified 1,535 house addresses in the two neighborhoods, from which 307 addresses (1 in 5) were drawn via random sampling. Visits produced the following (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1473325011429021">Table 2</xref>).

<p>Researchers stipulated that survey answers were to be completed by heads of household only. The racial/ethnic breakdown of survey respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 103) was: white (<italic>n</italic> = 87); Asian (<italic>n</italic> = 6). Latino (<italic>n</italic> = 5), African American (<italic>n</italic> = 3), and other (2). Forty-three had at least a high school education with some college or technical training; 37 were college graduates and 21 had a graduate degree. Educational information was not available for two respondents. The sample included 59 males and 44 females. All names reported are pseudonyms. Given the anger over immigration, it is possible that respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 103) who harbored strong views were over-represented. This constitutes a limitation of this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1473325011429021"><title>Fieldwork</title>
<p>As noted previously, field work/direct observation is always conducted with ethno-survey interviews. Researchers were required to write copious descriptions of houses, neighborhood activities and interactions with potential respondents. Investigators required submission of field notes within 48 hours of contact to minimize risk of forgotten detail. Principal investigators conducted field work from May to August 2008 to ensure prolonged engagement. Investigators and students spent approximately 400 hours in the field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1473325011429021"><title>Recorded interviews</title>
<p>Principal investigators conducted 1–2 hour interviews with 23 residents in their homes in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1473325011429021">4</xref></sup> Twenty-one interviewed were whites, and two were African American. Three married couples, interviewed jointly, are included in the total. Thirty had initially agreed to a second interview, but later declined or did not return phone calls. This attrition could be attributed to fatigue over the immigration controversy. Respondents signed Institutional Review Board consents explaining the study’s purpose. We encouraged them to discuss issues not covered by the ethno-survey so that they could introduce new concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1473325011429021">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1473325011429021"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Analysis centered on three goals: 1. Developing themes while acknowledging nuance and complexity; 2. Bracketing bias and assumptions; 3. Reporting exceptions to emergent patterns. Bracketing entails conscious effort to suspend beliefs, feelings and assumptions to understand respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473325011429021">Padgett, 2008</xref>: 41). I used Nvivo7 to develop data-driven, literal codes, which are argued to be more true to the ‘raw’ information than thematic codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011429021">Boyatzis, 1998</xref>: 30). Literal codes such as ‘trash,’ ‘traffic’ and ‘foreclosures’ helped facilitate bracketing by focusing on raw data. After the initial examination, I used Nvivo7 to group 198 literal ‘child’ codes under thematic trees. Review of data revealed themes related to property values, worries about neighborhood change and anger at immigrants.</p>
<p>Thematic categories included: 1. <italic>Narratives to define behaviors</italic> associated with acceptable place identity; 2. Delineation of certain <italic>symbols</italic> for positive and negative place identity; 3. Resident <italic>action to stop threats to neighborhood identity</italic>; 4. <italic>Financial losses</italic> related to residential life (foreclosures, real estate depreciation); 5.

</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1473325011429021"><title>Setting</title>
<p>We chose Prince William County (PWC), Virginia, a suburb 30 miles south of Washington DC, for this examination following its adoption of one of the nation’s most stringent anti-immigrant ordinances – a law that became a precursor to Arizona’s SB 1070 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473325011429021">News 13, 2010</xref>). Beginning in 2000, PWC underwent substantial change: a boom in construction brought demand for workers, many of whom came from Mexico and Central America. Residents complained about declining house values, noise, trash, and overcrowding – conditions they blamed on Latino immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473325011429021">Singer et al., 2009</xref>, p. 4). A Brookings Institution analysis of 2006 Census data found that PWC experienced enormous population growth – 27 percent – between 2000 and 2006, a change that included a 300 percent increase in the Latino population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473325011429021">Singer et al., 2009</xref>). In 2006, 18.5 percent of county residents were Latino compared to whites (61 percent).</p>
<p>Coupled with these changes was an astonishing foreclosure rate. The Washington <italic>Post</italic> characterized PWC as the ‘epicenter’ of a foreclosure crisis sweeping the capitol’s outlying suburbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011429021"><italic>Brulliard</italic>, 23 March 2008</xref>). When the County Board of Supervisors launched its anti-immigrant ‘crackdown,’ there were 3,334 foreclosures in PWC, compared to 282 the preceding year (<italic>Post,</italic> para 11). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011429021">McClain (2008)</xref> linked foreclosures to new construction, speculative buying, and sales to people who could not afford homes – particularly with the ‘help’ of subprime loans.</p>
<p>In March 2007, an activist anti-immigrant group announced its goal ‘to reduce the number of illegal aliens in our community’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.helpsavemanassas.org">www.helpsavemanassas.org</ext-link>). Four months later, the county’s board of supervisors unanimously passed the ‘Rule of Law’ ordinance that required police to check immigration status for all detainees believed to be in the country illegally. The ordinance required the county to ensure that undocumented immigrants be denied all social services not required by federal law. The ordinance did not directly affect many social services but still had a profound impact on immigrants. One study noted that it, ‘ … created fear and a sense of being unwelcome among immigrants in general, and it seems to have caused some <italic>legal</italic> immigrants or Hispanics in general to avoid or leave the county’ (UVA, 2010: 9). After the ordinance passed, the Washington <italic>Post</italic> reported that some immigrants who feared deportation abandoned houses overnight. A reporter described a resident surveying her neighborhood in April 2008: ‘She’s dismayed by what she sees – vacant houses – and delighted by what she says she doesn’t see – illegal immigrants.’</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1473325011429021"><title>Findings</title>
<p>Analysis of open-ended survey responses, recorded interviews and field notes revealed that homeowners experienced anger over neighborhood change, particularly foreclosures, overcrowded housing and real estate devaluation. Not only did residents face lost investment because of foreclosures and house value depreciation, they struggled with stigmatized place identity. For some, stigma arose from living near immigrants, or from allegations that anti-immigrant sentiment was motivated by racism. As will be explained, residents sought to define acceptable place identity through 1. <italic>Narratives to define which behaviors</italic> bring positive place identity, 2. Identifying <italic>symbols</italic> linked to place identity, and by 3. <italic>Taking action</italic> to retain positive place identity. Symbols emerged in narratives that revealed concern over neighborhood demise, as evidenced by terms such as ‘trash’ and ‘eye sore.’ As will be explained, some residents joined discussions of acceptable practices together with references to racial identity: specifically, narratives linking immigrants, their native countries and cultures, to crime and dirt. The presence of Latino immigrants moved some to join an anti-immigrant organization, though some made efforts to welcome them and <italic>accommodate</italic> certain behaviors that had not previously been normative. Finally, as will be explained below, efforts to preserve positive place identity occurred in an area suffering pronounced home depreciation resulting in <italic>financial losses</italic>.</p>
<sec id="sec11-1473325011429021"><title>Narratives to define acceptable behaviors</title>
<p>Field notes referred repeatedly to homeowner efforts to maintain property: Research assistants frequently found homeowners planting flowers, trimming shrubs or spreading mulch. Field notes from March 2008 described a pale yellow house with two Adirondack chairs under a tree. Light fixtures by the front door sparkled with what appeared to be a recent application of polish. Researchers were greeted by a middle-aged white female who led them to her kitchen, where they took seats at a high counter. Though the woman expressed positive sentiments about the neighborhood, including the fact that her street afforded quiet and privacy, she was angry about conditions nonetheless. One respondent said: ‘The abandoned house across the street with grass a foot high, houses overtaken by large families, trash … The builders brought illegals here for the construction … They come. They work. They mess things up. They send money home to Mexico or wherever and they give nothing.’ A house nearby had been converted to a boarding home for multiple families; neighbors heard rumors that children lived in a basement without an exit. One family occupied a laundry room.</p>
<p>As residents struggled to cope with lost real estate investments, many sought to reassert and shape a positive identity through narrative. Some used interactions with researchers to shape positive place identity by arguing that the county’s ordinance was not motivated by prejudice. One woman complained that the area’s reputation suffered unduly during the law’s enactment, and blamed immigration rights activists for allegations of racism. ‘You don’t respect how we do things, so we’re racist. … We have borders. We have rules and if you’re breaking the rules and you get in trouble for it, don’t call me a racist’ (Recorded interview, 3 June 2009). Another sought to dilute the salience of racialized Latino identity to the ordinance’s enactment. ‘As far as illegal immigration that is not a racist issue. I don’t care if you’re from Korea, Guam, Mexico, China … if you want to come here come here legally, you know … end of story’ (Recorded interview, 11 March 2009).</p>
<p>Others sorted through what they deemed to be acceptable behaviors, as well as acceptable neighbors. One respondent characterized immigrants as lawless, thus engaging a narrative to define acceptable behaviors. ‘They’re living by their own rules … The neighborhood is an eyesore. I don’t like how these immigrants say, “We can walk in your face”’ (Field notes, 28 March 2008). Surveys, field notes and recorded interviews revealed narratives chronicling transgressions of neighborhood norms: overcrowding; houses with unrelated occupants; public drinking; cat-calling to females; improper trash disposal; vehicles parked on lawns; poor upkeep of homes; use of yards for agriculture. One woman (‘Amber’) became active in the anti-immigrant organization and complained about changes to her neighborhood at a county supervisors meeting. Sitting outside on her deck, Amber said, ‘It’s not the people who’ve lived here for 30 or 40 years who are bringing chickens in their back yards. That’s a lack of respect. Do you know how dirty those things (chickens) are?’ (Recorded interview, 24 June 2009). Narratives reveal the construction of place identity in which people imbue physical surroundings, other people, cultural rituals and objects with symbolic meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011429021">Milligan, 1998</xref>). For immigrants, chickens likely meant a resource to prevent hunger: lacking the legal right to the work in the US, immigrants would likely recognize this possibility. Multiple family dwellings were a financial necessity in an area known for exorbitant housing costs. But for residents losing home equity, immigrants were symbols of neighborhood decline. Further, their behavior was seen as defiant rather than a product of poverty or the profound displacement experienced during immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011429021">Organista, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325011429021">Paris, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec12-1473325011429021"><title>Symbols</title>
<p>A female respondent who had raised her sons in a middle-class neighborhood described negative place identity in racialized terms, using Mexico as a symbol for disorder and dirt:<disp-quote>
<p>Even my son who was born (<italic>here</italic>) said this was ‘Mexico City, North.’ … I found an apartment for him … They wanted to get out of (<italic>area name</italic>) as quickly as possible because they couldn’t stand what had happened to (<italic>area name</italic>). And, to me when people who grew up in this place aren’t proud of their town anymore and they don’t want to live here anymore, that’s sad … . We have always been very proud of our neighborhood. (Recorded interview, 26 May 2009)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Some respondents expressed ire at realtors, mortgage companies and construction contractors for residential over-crowding; others engaged racializing narratives. A woman expressed anger at realtors for selling homes to Latino immigrants who could not afford them: ‘The next door neighbor moved out because of immigrants. A realtor pressured her to move saying that the area was turning to trash. She sold high … The realtors convinced the Latinos to buy into a lie and the realtors knew they would go belly up. I’m pointing my finger at the realtors and the businessmen’ (Field notes, 28 May 2008). Clearly, the idea of Latino immigrants as bad neighbors served the realtor’s interests; she sold a house by convincing an owner that the neighborhood was ‘turning to trash,’ invoking symbolic lines between acceptable neighbors and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429021">Kusenbach, 2009</xref>). As the discussion continued, this respondent characterized Latino immigrants via racialized images of a porous United States/Mexico border and the myth that many cross for welfare checks: ‘I don’t want to be the United States of Mexico. Someone pregnant just races across the border for the benefits. I’m scared of Mexico being the gateway to trouble’ (Field notes, 10 May 2008). In a recorded interview a year later, the respondent said: ‘I’m married to a lawyer and I’m for a safe community. I’m for a law abiding community … And I think a lot of what’s going on with traffic problems and the crime is a lot of ignorant people from different areas that don’t speak the language, don’t know the law’ (Recorded interview, 23 May 2009).</p>
<p>As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011429021">Lemanski and Saff (2010)</xref>, spatial exclusivity assumes pre-existing social and spatial identities that attribute positive values to the dominant majority while the ‘other’ is grouped together and deemed inferior. The result of racializing narratives can be seen in the use of the unexamined term, ‘illegal’ in discourse about immigrants. ‘Illegal,’ emphasizes criminality, and thus marginalizes people who cross the border without authorization, no matter the circumstances that led to the potentially deadly trek across the border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011429021">DeGenova, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325011429021">Chavez (2001)</xref> noted that undocumented immigrants are routinely racialized as morally suspect via terms that imply threat such as ‘flood’ or ‘invasion.’ By virtue of their racial and ethnic differences, as well as their sheer numbers occupying a single house, immigrants became a symbol for violations of enduring neighborhood practices and norms. In PWC, the racialization of immigrant practices arguably led to adoption of the ‘Rule of Law Ordinance’ in 2007. Racializing narratives, shared among neighbors and used in public hearings prior to the ordinance’s adoption, could preclude other reactions to immigrant settlement, such as working with the population to curb problematic behavior including public drinking or improper trash disposal, as well as addressing foreclosures as an economic rather than cultural or law enforcement issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1473325011429021"><title>Financial losses</title>
<p>In the following passage, an elderly coupled described an economic issue with reference to a different and inferior culture:<disp-quote>
<p>Wife: This is when they (banks) were really lax with the mortgages and they would let them come in no money down. … and they would pay the bills for a while because they would have 15–20 people living in a house.</p>
<p>Husband: We’re not exaggerating.</p>
<p>Wife: You could see from the vehicles parked out front. And they would pay the mortgage. Then … (<italic>local government</italic>) did a crackdown. And when they did, people started leaving this area because they didn’t like it, and they were afraid. So they were leaving the area. Well, when they didn’t have a bunch of people helping pay the mortgage, they couldn’t pay it. They walked away. That’s why we’re having so many foreclosures. They literally packed up and left in the dead of the night ….</p>
<p>Husband: … These folks that come in, they may or may not pay their taxes on the house. Contribute nothing back to the community … That’s a difference in culture. We weren’t raised that way. (Recorded interview, 6 May 2009)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One couple complained about foreclosures and worried that abandoned homes would bring vermin. Neighbors swapped stories about properties that had been stripped of sinks, toilets etc., causing sewage to spread.<disp-quote>
<p>Husband: We put $200,000 into renovating this house four years ago, which is probably more than the house is worth now. But … the rest of <italic>(the development)</italic> is pretty dilapidated. There are houses back there that were foreclosed on. There was a house on another street that one of my neighbors looked at. It was on the market for $150,000. He said he was looking at it basically to see if he could just buy it for the land. … The only thing they could have done was burn it because you couldn’t even walk into it …</p>
<p>Wife: For awhile there we were pretty …</p>
<p>Husband: Depressed. (Recorded interview, 10 June 2009)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Such descriptions speak to financial losses as homeowners suffered through intersecting processes: the migration of undocumented Latino workers to a suburban area unaccustomed to large groups of immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473325011429021">Singer et al., 2009</xref>), followed by the fallout from predatory lending practices that fueled the ‘market meltdown’ of 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011429021">Blinder and Zandi, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Another woman spoke approvingly of a document circulated by the municipal government warning of fines to residents who neglect properties:<disp-quote>
<p>Since the onslaught of foreclosures, that in an effort to stop any deterioration, any, what would you call it? Social deterioration. They are going to come down pretty hard on such things as what appears to be a derelict building.</p>
<p>Or maybe it’s obvious that someone lives there, but cars that are up on blocks … Even in their yards, you have a tarp over stuff. (Recorded interview, 25 June 2009)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In this narrative, the idea of deteriorated properties serves as a symbol not only for property values but for the implied deterioration in the way some neighbors behave. Cars on blocks and neglected properties indicate social deterioration – that is, deterioration of positive identity.</p>
<p>As these interviews illustrate, residents faced serious financial losses because of lax lending practices and home purchases by people ill-equipped to afford them. A high foreclosure rate forced property depreciation; residents who had invested large sums of money often found themselves owing more than the assessed property value. In addition, a chasm of language and culture precluded the sharing of symbols or socialization, keys to maintaining positive place identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011429021">Chamlee-Wright and Storr, 2009</xref>). Aside from suffering lost monetary investments, residents’ place identity had been sullied by new neighbors who did not engage in previously normative behavior.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1473325011429021"><title>Taking action</title>
<p>Field notes written on 18 April 2008 in conjunction with administration of an ethno-survey interview reported the following interaction with a retired, white couple who invited researchers into their home.<disp-quote>
<p>She considers herself the source of neighborhood intelligence, calling herself, ‘information central.’ … They say repeatedly that this is a ‘well established neighborhood.’ When the neighborhood was first built it ‘was the address to have in (<italic>location</italic>). Many important people lived there.’</p>
<p>Mrs. X is working on a pamphlet to welcome people to the neighborhood. … The pamphlet will let newcomers know what is required to live in the neighborhood, what it means to be here. This includes things like yard upkeep. The inspiration for the pamphlet came to Mrs. X when she was particularly frustrated with the next door neighbors. The house next door has had a six-year or so history of being filled with outsiders who just don’t fit in.</p>
<p>Mrs. X announces from her rocking chair – without prompting, no defensiveness – ‘Minorities don’t fit in here. We’re just not blended yet.’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The respondent’s writing of a pamphlet advising newcomers about acceptable behaviors constituted one action to stop threats to positive neighborhood identity. Notably, she grouped ‘minorities’ in a single category, then described how her husband taught an Asian immigrant neighbor to operate a riding lawn mower – as if to point out that ‘minority’ neighbors maintain properties and conform to expectations can be suitable candidates for neighborhood inclusion. For Mrs. X, a key component in retaining positive place identity centers on the question of who her neighbors are, both in terms of ethnicity and status. Mrs. X, reported with considerable pride that her neighborhood was once home to people deemed important by others in the area. The presence of ‘important people’ in the neighborhood became a symbol of positive identity, as the address itself proffered status on its residents.</p>
<p>Other residents policed streets and called authorities to report behavior they deemed suspect. One woman said her elderly mother sat at the bay window in their house each day to record license plates, as well as to count how many people entered and left a house occupied by multiple Latino families. The respondent alleged that Latinas were prostitutes; they were often seen climbing into idling cars. Her mother kept copious notes. The respondent and neighbors called government offices with repeated complaints until the house was ‘re-claimed’ by the owner, who lived out of town. The owner apparently evicted the tenants before renting it to a family. Another respondent obtained copies of municipal zoning ordinances, and used that information when contacting authorities. ‘People parking trucks on the grass. Every single zoning violation we could find, we called in. Everybody’ (Recorded interview, 26 May 2009). The couple also joined the anti-immigrant group that pushed for the adoption of the ‘Rule of Law Ordinance,’ and kept up with its activism through an on-line newsletter.</p>
<p>The idea of preserving positive place identity via property maintenance emerged repeatedly in surveys, field notes and recorded interviews. As noted in the next example, however, some were less inclined to couple immigration with concerns about place identity. An African American woman, who lives on a different block than the preceding respondent, appreciated the local homeowner’s association for its efforts to ensure that properties are maintained. An association serves the necessary function, she said, of policing neighbors who transgress expectations: ‘You need one (HOA) that at least makes an attempt to say to some of the residents, ‘You can’t do that. You cannot dig that trench in the back of your yard and leave it there for six months. It’s just not right’’ (Recorded interview, 25 June 2009).</p>
<p>Some described avoiding areas that brought about feelings associated with a spoiled place identity. The white female who lived with her mother limited her contact with shopping centers. When asked how she would describe her community, she said:<disp-quote>
<p>Let me first tell you how my sister would describe it. My sister’s favorite thing … When she is on the other side of town shopping, instead of coming straight down and going home … . She goes through (<italic>old downtown</italic>) to get to her house. That’s the way she likes to think of (<italic>the area</italic>). And, I mean, that’s the way I would like to think of (<italic>the area</italic>) too. And that gives me a warm and fuzzy and all that because the little old part of (old downtown) is really very sweet …</p>
<p>I like to think of it as homey. If you get outside.. There is just … all of those shopping centers that they’re building now. It drives you crazy. Every time I drive down there I see something else new that’s opened up. And that makes me crazy. So I tend to come home at night … I come into my little shell. (14 April 2009)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>An African American resident said she avoided a nearby chain restaurant after a colleague warned her about the clientele. Though her co-worker, a white male, did not overtly mention race, he implied it through the statement: ‘I wouldn’t go there if I were you.’ The respondent was willing to make the accommodation, arguing that the alienated white males who frequented that particular restaurant ‘need their outlet too’ (Recorded interview, 17 June 2009). She maintained a sense of positive place identity by avoiding men who might express racially biased views in her presence. ‘I don’t need to eat there. I can get chicken wings someplace else.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1473325011429021"><title>Accommodation</title>
<p>The same respondent’s ability to maintain positive place identity was tested three years earlier, when she received a notice that a registered sex offender had purchased a house on her block. She visited the courthouse to read his records and understand the gravity of his crime. During the man’s first year of occupancy, she and the other neighbors rarely saw him, though they were pleased that he maintained his property. ‘He kept his yard looking presentable. After about the second year, I started thinking you know it’s not so bad having him next to me.’ He remained there for another year, until his house went into foreclosure. At the time of the interview, a bank owned the house. The respondent noted that once the house is purchased again, she will have to engage in the process of ‘getting used to’ new neighbors.</p>
<p>Others managed place identity by distancing themselves from behaviors and attitudes associated with anti-immigrant activism. A 44-year-old described her efforts to befriend all of the neighbors, including immigrants. She did this despite suffering the precipitous decline in house values brought about by foreclosures. A house next door that was once valued at approximately $650,000 had recently been sold for $400,000. At the time of the interview, it was on the market again, for $319,000. She and her husband bought their house for $370,000 six years earlier and recently received a recent assessment of its worth at $285,000. ‘So we’re not too bad off, but that’s relatively speaking. It’s really bad, but it’s not horribly bad’ (Recorded interview, 9 June 2009). Several houses on her street had multiple, unrelated occupants including a neighbor rented rooms to boarders.<disp-quote>
<p>There was a house across the street that … had been owned by … about three or four families. Young couples with a couple of little kids, and they shared the house. And, you know, if I were somebody that was coming from another country rather than having four little apartments in a crappy neighborhood, that’s a great idea to buy one big, nice house and your kids go to the school system that’s with that nice house. And play in the neighborhood with that nice house. How do you blame somebody for wanting things like that rather than little apartments?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The families eventually left when they lost their jobs and went into foreclosure. For this respondent, maintaining a positive place identity meant declining to fight battles that other residents engaged. When a Latino household had loud parties that lasted late into the night, she and her husband decided not to call the police because they did not want to create animosity. ‘I remember when they first moved in, “Wow. What time is it? 3 o’clock. And they’re still partying?” We didn’t mind. And they were sweet, they would always ask us, “Hey, you should come over and have a Corona.” … We never complained about it.’</p>

<sec id="sec16-1473325011429021" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study sought a nuanced understanding of resident sentiment in a predominantly white, ‘new destination’ community unaccustomed to incorporating immigrants. Analysis of open-ended survey responses, recorded interviews and field notes revealed that homeowners experienced anger over neighborhood change, particularly foreclosures and real estate devaluation. Not only did residents face losses on real estate investment, many sought to reassert and shape a positive identity both through narrative and action. Narratives were used to delineate acceptable behavior such as upkeep of homes and yards. Mexico and immigrants themselves became symbols for disorder, lawlessness and neighborhood deterioration in the eyes of some. The presence of Latino immigrants in overcrowded conditions prompted some residents to join an anti-immigrant organization, or to police zoning violations by documenting transgressions and reporting them to authorities.</p>
<p>Neighborhoods represent values and a way of life; when residents perceive threats to place identity, they engage in tactics to reclaim dominance and to dictate acceptable practices and symbols. Data indicate that while some residents harbor racial prejudice, many simply hoped to stop the depreciation of investments and were angry that the value of life-long investments had plummeted. Though many residents framed their understanding of neighborhood problems via racialized referrals to ‘inferior’ countries of origin and culture, data here reveal their hope to restore both the worth of their properties and a sense of place identity. Narratives, as well as actions – reporting zoning violations and in some cases, engagement in anti-immigrant activism, served as tools for shaping neighborhood identity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1473325011429021" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Findings from this study show that future research and policy initiatives need to address several concerns: 1. Immigration reform, particularly avenues to legalization, and 2. Ensuring that real estate speculation and predatory lending do no more harm to neighborhoods. In addition, social work practitioners need to develop organizations to incorporate immigrants into neighborhoods before conflict accelerates. In areas with established immigrant populations, community organizations serve as liaisons that provide information about local laws and housing codes – a critical support for populations that do not speak English and cannot communicate with government or neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473325011429021">Singer et al., 2009</xref>). An infrastructure of organizations to assist immigrant incorporation was unavailable in PWC. Bilingual social workers employed by such organizations could allay certain public concerns by assisting immigrants in understanding and abiding by local ordinances on residential occupancy, parking and trash disposal. ‘A logical start would be to bring the public together on the immigration issue in ways that curb conflict rather than inflame it, and seek effective policies that successfully address long-term demographic change and challenges’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473325011429021">Singer et al., 2009</xref>: 13). If social work is to effectively provide services to immigrants in new destination areas, future comparative research needs to engage questions of unique characteristics in these communities that might contribute to strife over immigrant settlement.</p>
<p>Though some residents expressed anger about predatory lending and real estate speculation, lawmaking centered on immigrants. The state of ‘illegality’ that made immigrants a marginalized and disposable workforce, also served to make them suspect as neighbors. ‘When legal status becomes the defining feature of an entire ethnic group in the public’s eye, fear and civic isolation grow’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473325011429021">Singer et al., 2009</xref>: 13). Lacking avenues to legal status, migrant workers cannot seek higher wages or permanent employment; thus, they are vulnerable to economic instability. Findings indicate that the nation’s immigration policy needs to be reformed so that immigrant workers have paths for legalization – a status that would render them eligible for stable employment and residential stability. Permanent residency with its potential for incorporation into economic and civil society could conceivably help immigrants to buy and maintain single-family homes, thus lessening the appeal of anti-immigrant activism for their neighbors.</p>
<p>Eclipsed in the debate over the Prince William County ‘Rule of Law’ ordinance were predatory lenders and real estate speculators who profited from selling homes to people ill-equipped to maintain them, as well as contractors who wanted large numbers of low-waged workers as a residual workforce: hired and dismissed according to economic peaks and downturns. Long-time homeowners were angry that properties they had invested in over the course of decades had lost value precipitously. Thus, homeowner concerns need to be acknowledged and strategies developed to ensure recovery. Social workers trained in community organizing could initiate campaigns identifying real estate speculators and slumlords and insisting they follow zoning laws. Advocacy efforts should address homeowners’ losses, but frame the issue so that slumlords and the entities that profit from predatory loans are held accountable. Strategies developed to abet recovery from economic stressors such as foreclosures and depreciation are necessary. This point is complex: most social work practitioners and researchers lack expertise in economics to develop potential solutions, which indicates the need for considerable multidisciplinary research.</p>
