<abstract>
<p>Recent studies have identified enzymes that use NAD as a substrate, thus contributing to its net consumption. To maintain the intracellular pool, NAD is re-synthesized by a salvage pathway using nicotinamide, the by-product generated by the enzymatic cleavage of NAD. Enzymes involved in NAD re-synthesis include nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase. Our studies show, that NAMPT was substantially up-regulated by LPS in primary human monocytes, suggesting that it may be especially required during the process of monocyte activation. To evaluate the contribution of the NAD rescue pathway to LPS-induced biological responses in human monocytes, we used APO866, a well-characterized inhibitor of NAMPT. Concomitant with the inhibition of NAMPT, LPS-induced TNF-α protein synthesis declined, while TNF-α mRNA levels were minimally affected. Moreover, APO866 strongly decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased surface expression of the NAD-consuming enzyme CD38, and modified the production of selective eicosanoids. We further demonstrate that protein ADP-ribosylation was strongly reduced, indicating a possible link between this post-translational protein modification and human monocyte inflammatory responses. Despite a substantial reduction in intracellular NAD levels, activated monocytes were resistant to apoptosis, while resting monocytes were not. Taken together, our data suggest that activated monocytes strongly depend on the NAD salvage pathway to mount an appropriate inflammatory response. Their survival is not affected by NAD-depletion, probably as a result of LPS-mediated anti-apoptotic signals.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1753425911423853" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>NAD is generally considered as a coenzyme exclusively involved in redox reactions. However, recent studies have identified enzymes that use NAD as a substrate and thus contribute to the net consumption of this nucleotide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425911423853">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911423853">3</xref></sup> Hence, NAD re-synthesis is required to maintain a stable cellular concentration. In mammals, NAD is formed by the <italic>de novo</italic> pathway from tryptophan via quinolinic acid and by the salvage pathway mainly via nicotinamide (Nam), a reaction product of NAD-consuming enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425911423853">4</xref></sup> In addition, a new pathway which leads to NAD from nicotinamide riboside has recently been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425911423853">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the first enzyme in the salvage pathway, catalyzing the production of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) from Nam and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). NMN, together with ATP, is then used by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) to yield NAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425911423853">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast to NAMPT, little is known about NMNAT localization and regulation in immune cells.

<p>NAMPT has gained much attention because of its potential immunological properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425911423853">6</xref></sup> The expression of NAMPT, also known as pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911423853">7</xref></sup>, or visfatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425911423853">8</xref></sup>, is up-regulated during activation of immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, T and B cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425911423853">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425911423853">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to its intracellular localization, NAMPT has also been detected in serum and culture supernatants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911423853">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425911423853">12</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425911423853">14</xref></sup> As recombinant NAMPT has been shown to exert anti-apoptotic effects on macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425911423853">15</xref></sup> and activated neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425911423853">14</xref></sup>, and to induce cytokine production in monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911423853">16</xref></sup>, its extracellular occurrence seems to be of biological significance.</p>
<p>Over the last decade much evidence has emerged that NAMPT has potential implications in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Its expression was found to be increased in colonic biopsy specimens of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911423853">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, elevated NAMPT levels have been detected in synovial tissues and in serum and synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritis patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425911423853">17</xref></sup> Considering that monocytes are one of the major players in inflammatory diseases, we set out to study the role of NAMPT in regulating monocyte functions. To this end, we took advantage of APO866, an inhibitor of NAMPT able to reduce the intracellular NAD pool. This drug, which has been shown to induce apoptotic cell death in many cancer cell lines without any DNA damaging effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911423853">18</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425911423853">20</xref></sup> is now under scrutiny in phase II trials for treatment of solid and hematologic malignancies (see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425911423853">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911423853">22</xref></sup> How this treatment affects cells of innate immunity, such as monocytes, is unknown.</p>
<p>In the present study, we show that human monocytes up-regulated NAMPT in response to LPS and that inhibition of NAMPT resulted in drastic depletion of intracellular NAD levels. Blockage of NAMPT effectively reduced TNF-α and ROS production; it led to changes in the eicosanoid pattern and to an up-regulation of CD38, but had no consequences for the survival of activated monocytes.</p>

<p>According to previous reports in which APO866 was shown to induce apoptosis in hematologic cancer cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753425911423853">34</xref></sup> we first tested the effect of this inhibitor on the viability of primary human monocytes. In three independent experiments the cells were incubated with or without 100 µM APO866 for 4 h and 16 h in the presence and absence of LPS. Apoptosis was assessed by double staining with annexin V/propidium iodide. When incubated for 4 h, the percentage of apoptosis was hardly affected by the presence of 100 µM APO866 in both resting and LPS-activated monocytes (range 10.2%–16.9%). However, when prolonging the incubation time to 16 h, resting monocytes showed a slight increase in apoptosis (24.5% ± 1.8%), which was significantly elevated in the presence of 100 µM APO866 (51.0% ± 2.5% ***). In contrast, the viability of LPS-activated monocytes remained unaffected by the presence of APO866 (apoptosis rate ranged from 14.1%–16.5%). LPS has been suggested to rescue monocytes from apoptosis either directly through the activity of the CD14-TLR-complex or indirectly via the inductionof pro-inflammatory cytokines in an autocrine manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1753425911423853">35</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1753425911423853">37</xref></sup> Interestingly, in activated monocytes, these anti-apoptotic mechanisms seem to overcome the cytotoxic effects of APO866 that include mitochondrialdysfunction, ATP depletion and/or excessive autophagy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911423853">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425911423853">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753425911423853">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1753425911423853">38</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec19-1753425911423853"><title>APO866 inhibits NAMPT activity and reduces intracellular NAD concentrations</title>
<p>We next investigated the influence of APO866 on NAMPT activity and intracellular NAD levels. The enzyme activity was determined by measuring the formation of radioactive NMN in a reaction mixture containing [<sup>14</sup>C] Nam as substrate. Monocytes incubated for 16 h in the presence of LPS (100 ng/ml) displayed an enzyme activity of 4.5 ± 0.8 nmol/h/mg protein (<italic>n</italic> = 3), which was completely abolished in the presence of 100 µM APO866. To test whether the reduced NAMPT activity was mirrored by a decline in the intracellular NAD concentration, we evaluated intracellular NAD levels after 4 h and 16 h of incubation in the presence and absence of APO866 and LPS. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425911423853">Figure 3A</xref>, the NAD concentration of unstimulated cells treated with 100 µM APO866 decreased by 57.5% ± 23.9% after 4 h and 84.0% ± 3.4% after 16 h. In LPS-stimulated cells, the decline amounted to 66.4% ± 9.6% after 4 h and 85.5% ± 2.2% after 16 h. This robust decrease demonstrates a high turnover of NAD in unstimulated and LPS-activated monocytes. When adding 10 mM NMN, the product of the NAMPT-catalyzed reaction, to monocytes treated for 4 h with LPS and APO866 the decline in NAD concentrations was nearly prevented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425911423853">Figure 3B</xref>). To test whether NAD depletion had any effect on NAMPT protein expression, we carried out Western blot analyses with lysates of cells treated for 16 h with LPS and APO866.

<sec id="sec20-1753425911423853"><title>APO866 reduces TNF-α protein production, without affecting mRNA expression</title>
<p>Having verified the inhibitory effect of APO866 on NAMPT activity in monocytes, we next studied its influence on TNF-α production. To this end, monocytes were cultured for 30 min with increasing doses of APO866 and then stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 h. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425911423853">Figure 4A</xref>, APO866 inhibited TNF-α protein production in a concentration-dependent manner. However it had no effect on TNF-α mRNA levels measured after 1–3 h of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425911423853">Figure 4B</xref>). To test whether the reduced TNF-α protein production was caused by a depletion of NAD, monocytes were incubated with APO866 and NMN prior to the addition of LPS. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425911423853">Figure 4C</xref>, although NMN almost replenished the cellular NAD pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425911423853">Figure 3B</xref>), it failed to prevent the inhibitory effect of APO866. In the absence of APO866, NMN slightly promoted LPS-induced TNF-α secretion. These data indicate that either the replenishment of NAD (80%) was insufficient or that inhibition of TNF-α biosynthesis may have been caused by an increase in intracellular nicotinamide concentrations. Nicotinamide, a potent inhibitor TNF-α,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1753425911423853">39</xref></sup> is likely to accumulate when NAMPT is inhibited, irrespective of the intracellular NAD concentrations.

Monocytes (2  × 10<sup>6</sup>/ml) were incubated with APO866 (A–E) and, if indicated, in the presence of NMN (C) for 30 min before LPS (100 ng/ml) was added. After 4 h of incubation, TNF-α concentrations in the culture supernatants were determined by ELISA (A, C) and after 1 h, 2 h and 3 h TNF-α mRNA expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Relative mRNA levels (ΔΔC<sub>t</sub>-method) were standardized to the expression of the GNB2L1 housekeeping gene (B). Cells were lysed 4 h after incubation and proteins (100 µg) separated by SDS-PAGE were subjected to immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal goat anti-human TNF-α antibody and a mouse anti-human β-actin antibody. One representative experiment out of eight is shown (D, E). For statistical analysis, band intensities were quantified using Adobe® Photoshop® (E).

<p>As APO866 reduced TNF-α protein secretion but did not affect mRNA levels, we tested whether the effect of APO866 was caused by diminished production of the precursor form of TNF-α (pro-TNF-α), a 26 kDa transmembrane type II polypeptide from which the soluble 17 kDa polypeptide is derived by proteolytic cleavage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1753425911423853">40</xref></sup> Western blot analyses revealed that the amount of intracellular pro-TNF-α protein was significantly reduced inAPO866-treated monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425911423853">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425911423853">E</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that APO866 affects TNF-α protein production by acting at a post-transcriptional step, possibly by interfering with TNF-α mRNA translation. The unexpected presence of the 17 kDa TNF-α in the cell lysates most likely reflects the binding of soluble TNF-α to TNF-α receptors on the cell surface, so that the amount of detectable 17 kDa TNF-α in lysates mirrored the level of TNF-α secretion.</p>

<sec id="sec21-1753425911423853"><title>APO866 decreases protein ADP-ribosylation</title>
<p>The APO866-triggered depletion in intracellular NAD concentrations prompted us to hypothesize that NAD-consuming enzymes, such as mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (mARTs) and poly-ADP-polymerases (PARPs) would be affected. While mARTs transfer one ADP-ribose moiety from NAD to specific target proteins, PARPs catalyze the transfer of multiple moieties and branching of the ADP-ribose chain. This post-translational protein modification, called ADP-ribosylation, results in an alteration of the target protein’s functional properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1753425911423853">41</xref></sup> By Western blot analyses we showed that there was extensive ADP-ribosylation of cellular proteins in LPS-activated monocytes.

<p>LPS, the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is a highly potent activator of monocytes. It not only induces the expression of multiple genes encoding inflammatory mediators to combat infection, but, as shown here, it also affects the expression of NAMPT, an enzyme directly involved in NAD metabolism.</p>
<p>Whereas LPS strongly up-regulated NAMPT expression, it had only minor effects on mRNA and protein levels of NMNAT, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the NAD salvage pathway (data not shown). Thus, consistent with its housekeeping role, NMNAT contributes to a stable cellular concentration and rapid availability of NAD required for many NAD-dependent processes.</p>
<p>As described previously and as shown here, the inhibition of NAMPT activity led to a decrease in intracellular NAD concentrations and resulted in diminished TNF-α production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911423853">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425911423853">11</xref></sup> This reduction was not caused by apoptosis, as no loss in viability was detected in LPS-activated monocytes. It is surprising that, despite massive NAD depletion, activated monocytes are almost resistant to cell death, whereas unstimulated cells are not. Considering that metabolic processes are increased in activated monocytes, one would expect these cells to be more susceptible to NAD depletion but, obviously, the anti-apoptotic effects displayed by LPS overcome the demands for sufficient NAD supply. This is not a common feature of all immune cells. As reported by Bruzzone et al., activated, but not resting, T cells are crucially dependent on NAMPT activity for their function and survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1753425911423853">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Compared with our studies, the concentrations of APO866 used by Busso et al. to achieve maximum inhibition of TNF-α expression were much lower ranging in nanomolar concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425911423853">9</xref></sup> The reason for this discrepancy may lie in different experimental conditions. Whereas we only incubated the cells for 4.5 h, Busso et al. exposed the cells to APO866 for 20 h. As the kinetics of LPS-induced TNF-α secretion show a maximum at 4 h, we favoured this time-point for our investigations. To achieve sufficient NAD depletion under these conditions, the use of higher APO866 concentrations was necessary.</p>
<p>Although the molecular mechanisms linking NAMPT inhibition by APO866 and blockage of TNF-α production are largely unknown, there is some evidence that NAD-consuming enzymes with multiple roles in cellular regulation, such as PARPs, mARTs and sirtuins, are involved in this process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1753425911423853">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bruzzone et al., who showed that APO866 inhibits TNF-α production in T cells, relate the defective production to an impaired activity of SIRT6, a member of the sirtuin family.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1753425911423853">44</xref></sup> In line with these findings, Van Gool et al. suggest a role of SIRT6 in the post-transcriptional control of TNF-α expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1753425911423853">46</xref></sup> We recently reported that LPS induces an increase in ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in human monocytes and that inhibitors of ADP-ribosylation interfere with phosphorylation events and cytokine production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425911423853">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1753425911423853">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, our studies showing that exhaustion of intracellular NAD correlates with a marked reduction in PARP/ART activity and a reduced capacity to produce TNF-α also point to a link between ADP-ribosylation and TNF-α synthesis. While some studies favoured the view that PARP1, through inhibition of nuclear factor-κB transcriptional activity, regulates TNF-α production;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1753425911423853">47</xref></sup> others dismissed a role of PARP1 in this process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1753425911423853">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to its function as an enzyme, extracellular NAMPT has been reported to act as a pro-inflammatory mediator triggering the release of cytokines. As NAMPT secreted by monocytes could regulate cytokine production in an autocrine fashion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911423853">16</xref></sup> we reasoned that, should APO866 inhibit NAMPT synthesis, its capacity to act as a mediator may be impaired. However, by showing thatAPO866 has no impact on NAMPT synthesis, this mode of action does not account for the decrease in TNF-α production.</p>
<p>Depletion of intracellular NAD not only affected TNF-α synthesis but also the production of eicosanoids, another group of mediators that influence inflammation and immune responses. In resting monocytes, APO866 increased the production of all detectable eicosanoids, the highest values being reached by 5-HETE and AA. As AA is released by cells undergoing apoptosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1753425911423853">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1753425911423853">49</xref></sup> its increase may very well be attributed to the catabolic state of resting monocytes. The elevation of the remaining eicosanoids could be a mere consequence of the increase of AA, which gives rise to prostanoids (prostaglandins, leukotriens) and HETEs. Alternatively, 12-HETE and 5-HETE, which have been associated with anti-apoptotic activities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1753425911423853">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1753425911423853">51</xref></sup> could rise in an attempt to counteract apoptosis. The up-regulation of 5-HETE may also be caused by the limited availability of NAD/NADP, which serve as cofactors of enzymes involved in 5-HETE metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1753425911423853">52</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1753425911423853">56</xref></sup> APO866-induced changes in the eicosanoid pattern of activated monocytes include a modest increase in 5-HETE, PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGF<sub>2α</sub> and a pronounced decline in 11-HETE and TXB<sub>2</sub> concentrations. As TXA<sub>2</sub> has a relatively short half-life and is rapidly converted to the more stable TXB<sub>2</sub>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1753425911423853">57</xref></sup> TXA<sub>2</sub> production is measured by monitoring TXB<sub>2</sub>. In addition to PGE<sub>2</sub> and 11-HETE, TXA<sub>2</sub> is a quantitatively important product of stimulated human monocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1753425911423853">58</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1753425911423853">61</xref></sup> While TXA<sub>2</sub> has been identified as an eicosanoid that facilitates TNF-α synthesis, PGE<sub>2</sub> seems to suppress the production of this cytokine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1753425911423853">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1753425911423853">63</xref></sup> Given that the treatment of LPS-activated monocytes with APO866 results in decreased levels of TXA<sub>2</sub> and elevated levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> an anti-inflammatory effect of APO866 may be anticipated. The accumulation of prostaglandins may be explained by diminished activity of the NAD-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, the key enzyme responsible for the biological inactivation of prostaglandins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1753425911423853">64</xref></sup> Whatever the precise mechanisms that underlie the observed effects of APO866 on eicosanoid production are, our data indicate that the response of resting monocytes differs from that of activated monocytes, and that selected pathways are affected in the latter cells.</p>
<p>Similar to eicosanoid production, expression of CD38 was measured after 16 h of incubation with APO866, a time at which NAD levels were drastically reduced. As supplementation with NAD and NMN reversed the effect, depletion of NAD is clearly associated with the up-regulation of CD38. The CD38 molecule is widely known as a multifunctional ecto-enzyme that metabolizes NAD and NADP generating cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), ADPR and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). These reaction products are essential for the regulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the most ancient and universal cell-signalling system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1753425911423853">65</xref></sup> Should the concentration of these products fall below a critical value, the cell may try to compensate for this loss by up-regulating the expression of CD38 with the option of cleaving additional NAD and internalizing the reaction products cADPR and NAADP via CD38.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1753425911423853">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1753425911423853">67</xref></sup> As a side-effect, up-regulation of CD38 activity would also result in an increase in Nam, which stabilizes cellular NAD concentrations by inhibiting NAD-consuming enzymes. We could, indeed, show that, in the presence of Nam, CD38 expression returned to basal levels.</p>
<p>Not only TNF-α and eicosanoid production, but also LPS-induced ROS production, was subject to inhibition by APO866. The production of ROS is a short-term effect starting soon after encounter of the stimulus. The immediate effect of APO866 applied before and after initiation of the oxidative burst, as well as the failure of NAD to restore ROS production, suggests that APO866 described as a specific inhibitor of NAMPT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425911423853">20</xref></sup> may directly affect NAD(P)H oxidase activity independent of its ability to reduce intracellular NAD levels. However, should Nam accumulate as a consequence of NAMPT blockage, it has the potential to suppress the generation of ROS as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753425911423853">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, our data clearly indicate that the NAD rescue pathway is of great significance for human monocytes to mount an appropriate immune response. Considering that APO866 is now under scrutiny in phase II trials for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies, it would be of interest to monitor the response of monocytes to this treatment, especially under conditions of primary and secondary infection.</p>
