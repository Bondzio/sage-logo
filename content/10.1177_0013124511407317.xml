<abstract>
<p>The author examines racial, economic, and linguistic segregation in the Washington, D.C. charter school system and asks, “Are government supports aimed at deterring segregation effective at preventing enrollment bias in charter schools?” The author shows that charter schools in Washington, D.C. remain heavily segregated even though market supports meant to deter racial, economic, and linguistic segregation have been adopted. The findings of this study are generalizable to other charter school systems because segregation is least likely to arise in D.C. charter schools. The results indicate that underlying market forces continue to create segregated schools and that further study and government supports are necessary to diversify public charter schools.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Free market approaches that emphasize greater choice in school selection dominate the education reforms both in practice and in discussion. This is evidenced by the recent proliferation of charter schools, which first appeared in 1991 and have quickly become one of the most popular of all free market approaches. While only enrolling 2.5% of all school-aged children in 2010, charter schools continue to receive heavy attention from the U.S. Department of Education and politicians on both sides of the aisle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013124511407317">Murphy &amp; Shiffman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124511407317">U.S. Charter Schools, 2010</xref>). The idea that parents are best suited to choose what is right for their children is a popular one, but the rhetoric appears to downplay some of the negative results created by these relatively new experiments.</p>
<p>In fact, parental choice has led to increased racial and economic segregation of students in charter schools across the United States and the most recent report by the Civil Rights Project has labeled the charter school movement has a “civil rights failure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124511407317">Frankenberg, Siegel-Hawley, &amp; Wang, 2010</xref>, p. 1). Even among charter schools, those with large numbers of minority students lag in the number of academic resources available and offer less advanced curricular options than predominately White schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124511407317">Fuller, Gawlik, Gonzales, &amp; Park, 2003</xref>). The division of students by race, income, and language further exasperates inequalities and opportunities, while creating homogenous enclaves within the same community that can hurt the ability to overcome racial discrimination when students graduate.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to determine whether government supports aimed at combating charter school segregation have been effective. I study the charter school system in Washington D.C., where racial, economic, and linguistic segregation is the least likely place to occur. I determine if government supports have been effective by analyzing the degree of racial, economic, and linguistic segregation of students in D.C. charter schools. I then compare levels of segregation to those found in the traditional public schools to determine whether the D.C. charter school system has been more successful at creating desegregated schools. I conclude that D.C. charter schools have been more successful than the public school system, yet despite having a host of policies meant to correct enrollment bias, students are heavily segregated along racial, economic, and linguistic profiles. This discovery questions the ability of government policy to control for this market imbalance and raises further questions as to what factors affect parental choice.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section3-0013124511407317">
<title>Charter Schools and Market Reform</title>
<p>The single largest education initiative in the past decade was the bipartisan passage of the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). In addition to creating policies aimed at increasing the accountability of schools, NCLB also created a series of procedures, which increased the ability of parents to transfer their children out of schools that had consistently underperformed on state standardized tests. The rationale behind this approach is that parents are best suited to make the correct decisions regarding their child’s education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511407317">Frankenberg &amp; Lee, 2003</xref>). The new market of available choices created new options for students in some of the least successful schools and supposedly provided greater incentive for schools to perform better.</p>
<p>Charter schools are a highly discussed option among parents and politicians who are seeking alternatives to public schools because they relate to the popular free market theories found in NCLB. Since 2001, an additional 3,392 charter schools have opened in 40 states and Washington, D.C. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124511407317">Center for Education Reform, 2009</xref>). President Obama’s “Race to the Top” program has persuaded states to loosen restrictions on charter school enrollment and growth, making this number likely to grow as states compete for 4 billion dollars in education reform grants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124511407317">Banchero, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013124511407317">Nagel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013124511407317">U.S. Department of Education, 2009</xref>). The increased emphasis on charter schools is well accepted because it strongly relates to the already popular ideas about school competition and choice.</p>
<p>Supporters claim that charter schools may serve as laboratories for new teaching instructions and schoolwide policy, which would benefit traditional public schools as well. Their presence supposedly also extends into the traditional public system by placing pressure on traditional public schools to increase their performance or lose their students to these new schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511407317">Buckley &amp; Fisler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511407317">Hassel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124511407317">Lubienski, 2003</xref>). In addition, charter schools may decide to specialize their curricula to appeal to a certain student population and increase the number of choices available to parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511407317">Merrifield, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This push for increased charter school enrollment is likely to take place in the wake of several studies challenging the academic successes of charter schools. One report issued by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511407317">CREDO Institute (2009)</xref> found that when compared to students with similar demographic and academic backgrounds, students in charter schools were rarely more successful than their traditional public school counterparts on standardized testing. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511407317">CREDO (2009)</xref> study has important implications for analyzing free market reforms because it controlled for a possible error in market choice—the aggregate student populations of charter schools were dissimilar to student populations in traditional public schools. Previous studies had accounted for racial, economic, and linguistic differences, but students who had entered charter schools had something that some students in public schools did not—motivated parents.</p>
<p>Since parental involvement in a child’s education is one of the most significant factors related to a child’s academic success, we know that simply comparing these two populations raises a set of challenges in controlling for parental motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013124511407317">Jeynes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013124511407317">Stewart, 2007</xref>). Researchers have known that parents from higher social-class backgrounds participate in school choice decision making more often and with fewer resources than their low-income counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511407317">Ball, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013124511407317">Lareau, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013124511407317">Smrekar &amp; Goldring, 1999</xref>). But even within similar social or economic classes, some parents are more likely to take an interest in their child’s education or are more motivated to enroll their children in alternative schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511407317">Ball, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013124511407317">Lareau, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013124511407317">Smrekar &amp; Goldring, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The market created by most charter school districts, where parents must actively select, apply, and then join a specific charter school, creates a population that already has a certain advantage compared to the population as a whole. The CREDO study uses this understanding of enrollment bias to compare academic successes, but this problem in the marketplace raises questions about other possible imbalances between charter school populations and the traditional public schools. Compared with analyzing academic outcomes, racial, economic, and linguistic segregation are topics that have received minimal amounts of attention despite having a meaningful impact on a student’s holistic education.</p>

<sec id="section4-0013124511407317">
<title>Segregation and the Free Market</title>
<p>Free-market reforms had a different meaning when school desegregation was at the height of the political agenda. <italic>Brown v. Board of Education I</italic> effectively ended de jure segregation in schools in 1954 and <italic>Brown II</italic> placed the courts in charge of implementing desegregation plans “with all deliberate speed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124511407317"><italic>Brown II</italic>, 1955</xref>). The first widespread free-market attempts arose in Virginia with the practice of giving vouchers to all students, which successfully segregated students once again on racial lines in the marketplace. The plan, known as “massive resistance,” was a blatant attempt to resegregate the school system under the classical American economic tradition of free markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124511407317">Bartley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013124511407317">Muse, 1961</xref>). Under federal pressure, these plans were overruled, but the migration of middle-class Whites into suburbs and out of cities led to prominently segregated housing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511407317">Armor, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013124511407317">Orfield, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124511407317">Welch, 2007</xref>). During 30 to 40 years after <italic>Brown</italic> ruled that separate could never mean equal, free-market reforms were little more than a ruse to revert back to segregated schools.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court effectively took school desegregation off the policy agenda in 1991. The Court no longer saw enforced desegregation as means to better education and build cohesive communities but rather viewed desegregation plans as means to “repair the damage caused by generations of segregation and overt discrimination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013124511407317">Orfield, 1995b</xref>, p. 3). Now repaired, local school districts suddenly regained control and student distributions once again reflected their neighborhood demographics. Public schools had resegregated.</p>
<p>By this time, however, supporters of school choice began to believe that free markets could create desegregated schools. In addition to the theoretical academic benefits of market competition, they believed that such reforms, including charter schools, would rush in a new era of school diversity because they were not constrained by district boundaries that produced racial and economic segregation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124511407317">Finn, Manno, &amp; Vanourek, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013124511407317">RPP International, 2000</xref>). But as already seen, parents and students in the market do not have equal resources in the free market of school choice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124511407317">Carnoy, Jacobsen, Mishel, and Rothstein (2005)</xref> showed that students with greater educational advantages participated in school choice markets more often than their peers. Governments recognized the inherent problems in the market and instituted corrective measures.</p>
<p>Government supports are essential to help those with limited resources and to create an equal opportunity for students to engage in the marketplace; this is especially true since charter schools are publicly funded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511407317">Frankenberg &amp; Lee, 2003</xref>). Increased parental involvement is a difficult variable to control in the marketplace, but governmental policies can outweigh some of the other costs that make the charter school option more accessible for one student than another. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124511407317">Fuller, Elmore, and Orfield (1996)</xref> examined a series of choice plans and found that free transportation was an essential support for low-income families. Schools also had to make specific efforts to make minority children feel welcome to recruit them. Laws dealing with where applicants must live may further limit the number of options to some students based on where a charter school is able to locate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124511407317">National Alliance, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite a range of policies, different charter school districts implement different degrees of desegregation supports and as a result widespread racial and economic segregation continues to exist in charter schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124511407317">Frankenberg et al. (2010)</xref> found that minority charter school students, especially Black students, are more likely to be enrolled in schools that are more segregated than public schools within the same district; the study concluded that more than two fifths of all Black students attend charter schools that enroll 99% minority students, which is nearly three times as high as Black students served in public schools (p. 37). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013124511407317">Miron, Urschel, Mathis, and Tornquist (2010)</xref> found that charter schools run by education management organizations, which account for roughly one third of all charter schools, followed similar trends in economic and racial isolation. These studies look at an aggregated picture of all students enrolled in charter schools regardless of the different supports used to counter racial and economic segregation. We can only understand how effective government supports have been at curbing self-segregation in free markets by studying a charter school district that has implemented an extensive range of research-supported supports.</p>

<title>D.C. Public Charter Schools: Least Likely Case Study</title>
<p>The research on charter school segregation almost always presents data on an aggregated level, making it impossible to decipher whether similar levels of segregation exist in charter school systems with different desegregation support policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124511407317">Frankenberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511407317">Frankenberg &amp; Lee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013124511407317">Miron et al., 2010</xref>). To determine whether or not segregation persists alongside desegregation support policies, it is necessary to study the system where it is least likely for enrollment bias to create racial, economic, and linguistic segregation. The D.C. charter school system is the most appropriate system to study because it has the most extensive range of desegregation support policies. Other physical and demographic characteristics also make enrollment bias segregation highly unlikely—if segregation exists in D.C. charter schools, then desegregation supports will not be successful anywhere else.</p>
<p>Public law created the D.C. Public Charter School Board in 1996 and granted sole authorizing and oversight privileges over all charter schools to them in 2007. The board is responsible for overseeing 57 independently run charter schools operating in D.C. on all facets of management, from curriculum and instruction to financial audits. Charter schools serve an estimated 27, 893 students, close to 38% of all eligible children in the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511407317">D.C. Charter School, 2010</xref>) and the proportion of city children they educate is likely to increase—charter school growth was a major initiative of former Mayor Adrian Fenty and is likely to continue during the next administration. In addition, 74% of city residents approve of the charter school system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124511407317">Braun Research Inc., 2009</xref>). The reform climate in Washington, D.C. is one that is very receptive to market-based reforms; the reality that students in the city have had some of the lowest test scores in major metropolitan areas and the perception that administration after administration has failed to keep students enrolled and adapt to changing demographics has led many to seek a system free of the bureaucratic red tape and traditional methods of the urban school system.</p>
<p>To determine whether government intervention can correct market imbalances, it is important to know when the market has fully matured; any analysis of school choice system that had very few options, or where parents did not know about their options would be invalid. The D.C. charter school system, while not the oldest in the country, educates more students per capita than any other charter school system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124511407317">National Alliance, 2010</xref>). We can assume that parents know the system exists, since 38 of children in the District attend a charter school and that variety and choice exist in the market since there are 97 individual charter school campuses in the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511407317">D.C. Charter School, 2010</xref>). The wide range of choice available in the system and the widespread knowledge of charter schools make randomized self-segregation less likely to occur.</p>
<p>The D.C. charter school model is one of the most free-choice friendly in the entire nation because it has legislated supports aimed at deterring segregation of charter school applicants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124511407317">National Alliance, 2010</xref>). All children who are eligible to attend D.C. public schools are also able to attend D.C. charter schools free of charge. Aspiring students submit applications to the charter school that they wish to attend and if requests exceed available enrollment, a random lottery determines what applicants can attend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511407317">D.C. Charter School, 2010</xref>). This lottery includes those who are entitled to special education services under IDEA and also those who may need English language instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511407317">D.C. Charter School, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124511407317">National Alliance, 2010</xref>). These policies are the cornerstone supports of creating charter school student populations representative of the entire student population.</p>
<p>It was once widely thought that charter schools would be able to manipulate the applicant pool and engage in a practice known as cream skimming, which involves schools specifically selecting or appealing only to academically strong students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511407317">Garcia, McIlroy, &amp; Barber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013124511407317">Lacireno-Paquet, Holyoke, &amp; Moser, 2002</xref>). Cream skimming leaves a disproportionate number of low-income, minority students in public schools with decreased resources available to teach them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013124511407317">Garcia, 2008</xref>). Despite these initial concerns, however, studies have shown that charter schools do not engage in this practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124511407317">Eckes &amp; Rapp, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511407317">Frankenberg &amp; Lee, 2003</xref>); in fact, many charter schools serve disproportionate percentages of racial minorities and high-poverty children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124511407317">Green, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013124511407317">Rapp &amp; Eckes, 2007</xref>). This is possible because charter schools have the flexibility to advertise and, therefore, enroll diverse student populations and because many charter schools begin with the intention of serving at-risk and minority students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124511407317">Eckes &amp; Trotter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013124511407317">Schneider, 1999</xref>). Charter school supporters attribute the lack of cream skimming and apparent reverse trend because of such actions taken by school officials and mandated policies like having a randomized lottery.</p>
<p>The randomized lottery has become commonplace for many charter school networks, but Washington, D.C. stands at the top in encouraging a truly free marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124511407317">U.S. Charter Schools, 2010</xref>). There are no caps on how many charter schools can exist in the District. And although there is only one authorizer in the city, which some claim inhibits charter school growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013124511407317">Shober, Manna, &amp; Witte, 2006</xref>, p. 579), the data-driven accountability reports issued by the charter school board allow parents to compare schools reliably and knowledgeably. In addition, all students who receive free or reduced price meals are also eligible for free or reduced fare on city public transportation; this further increases the number of options available to students most at risk of not participating in the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124511407317">Fuller et al., 1996</xref>). There is also no requirement that charter schools pull students from the school cluster in which they reside, again opening the marketplace to more students than most charter school districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124511407317">National Alliance, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While Washington, D.C. is only a 69-square-mile city, it has very distinct neighborhoods and informal boundaries. The policies instituted by the charter school board attempt to limit the effects those boundaries have. The range of policies the government has enacted makes it highly unlikely that racial, economic, and linguistic segregation would exist in charter schools. By comparing the levels of segregation in charter schools with those found in traditional public schools, we can determine if the free market, with supports, does a better job at desegregating schools than the traditional system. If so, this could mean that highly segregated charter school systems are able to implement effective market-controlling policies, eliminating enrollment bias.</p>

<p>Despite limited opportunity for segregation to emerge, charter school students are racially, economically, or linguistically stratified. The system of school choice, with government policies, cannot prevent self-segregation to occur in the free market. Since D.C. has some of the strongest supports to deter free-market inequalities, segregation in this charter school system shows that enrollment bias in charter schools continues to exist and needs more corrective measures.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypotheses 2</italic>: If students attending charter schools are less segregated than public school students, then government supports have be able to control for bias in the market.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Charter schools in D.C. provide a more diverse classroom than D.C. traditional public schools. This finding would be contrary to the recent trend and could demonstrate that the supports aimed at deterring enrollment bias have actually helped create a desegregated school system. However, while charter schools may provide a more diverse experience, this result has a subjective element on how effective the market has been at creating desegregated schools. Charter schools may create more diverse schools than traditional public schools but may still remain highly segregated.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Segregation levels are equal in charter and traditional public schools.</p></list-item></list>
<p>There is no discernable difference between segregation levels in charter or traditional public schools. This could mean that both systems are completely desegregated or it could mean that both systems have totally segregated school systems. Either way, the null finding would show that racial, economic, or linguistic segregation continues to persist in D.C. regardless of whether that student chooses to attend a charter school.</p>

<p>I use two different methods to analyze the levels of racial, economic, and linguistic segregation in D.C. public charter schools. Following the convention in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511407317">Frankenberg &amp; Lee, 2003</xref>) I calculate an aggregated exposure index for each racial, economic, and linguistic group in the charter school system by using data from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124511407317">D.C. Charter School Board (2010)</xref> annual school performance report. The exposure index gives the average picture of the racial, economic, or linguistic makeup of the schools; it represents the percentage of students of a racial, economic, or linguistic group in the school of the average student of another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511407317">Frankenberg &amp; Lee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013124511407317">Reardon &amp; Yun, 2002</xref>). In effect, it is the average of each school’s racial, economic, and linguistic composition, weighted by enrollment.</p>
<p>The exposure index is subject to manipulation by student distributions on an aggregated level. For example, an exposure index of 50 between two racial groups could mean that students attend charter schools that are, on average, split evenly between races. It could also mean that half of the students attend a school that is 90% composed of their own race and that the other half of students attends a school that is only 10% composed of their own race. The exposure index, in this case 50, would show equal exposure, when in fact only a small minority of either racial group attend school with students of a different racial group. It is therefore necessary to examine the distribution of students in heavily segregated schools. I use the categories outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511407317">Frankenberg and Lee (2003)</xref> to determine student distributions. A predominately segregated school is one in which more than 50% of the school is composed of a single race, economic status, or linguistic profile. An intensely segregated school is one in which more than 90% of students are of a similar racial, economic, or linguistic category.</p>
<p>The term “segregation” needs accurate definition to answer the research question. If the exposure index for a particular subgroup is higher than the percentage that subgroup represents in the total population, then that group is segregated. For example, if Asian students make up 1.07% of the charter school population and have an exposure index of 6.50, then the school system is segregated; Asian students attend school at a higher rate than they would in an ideal system. Similarly, when a majority of students of a particular subgroup attend segregated schools, the school district is segregated; if 58.34% of White students attend majority White schools, then the system is segregated.</p>
<p>To compare levels of segregation, I will also create exposure indices and student distributions for the traditional public school system. I use self-reported demographic data available through the DC GIS online school profiles web site to create the indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511407317">DC Public Schools [DCPS], 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, a different definition is required to compare the two school systems because past research shows that charter schools may enroll disproportionate numbers of minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124511407317">Green, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013124511407317">Schneider, 1999</xref>). In fact, charter school leaders may advertise in such a way as to skew the applicant pool demographics away from the actual student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124511407317">Eckes &amp; Trotter, 2007</xref>). This happens to be true in the D.C. charter school system as well, where the proportion of Black students, economically disadvantaged students, and limited English proficient students is higher than in the traditional public schools. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze both these school systems segregation data in terms of a norm-reference population, that is, the total student population of each respective school system. The averages of each system’s population will serve as the reference population.</p>
<p>In a completely desegregated school system, which includes a charter school enrollment process free of selection bias, or where government policy has fully corrected for selection bias, the exposure indices among different groups would be equal to the norm-reference group. Exposure indices give an accurate depiction of in-school experiences for students, but if not compared to their reference group category, the degree of control public schools officials have over segregation in the system can be under- or overstated. For example, an exposure index of 90 for Black students indicates a very high level of segregation in the system. But, if 90% of the entire school system is Black, school officials also created a balanced district to the greatest degree possible. I label the difference between the norm-reference population and the actual exposure index as the exposure index discrepancy. Lower discrepancies mean that the school system is closer to desegregation; therefore, when comparing different systems, higher discrepancies mean that the system is creating greater segregation.</p>
<p>Comparing the two data sets does not present any coding complications because both school systems rely on the same identification procedures and criteria. Students self-report their racial identification in both districts and I use the traditional measurement for determining low economic status of students, the percentage of students who receive free or reduced price meals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511407317">DC Public Charter Schools, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511407317">DCPS, 2010</xref>). Similarly, both districts report the percentage of students with limited English proficiency (LEP). Federal laws, including NCLB, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, require that school systems provide resources for students with LEP, so thresholds for services are equal.</p>

<title>Results and Analysis</title>
<p>The results are broken down by student race, economic statues, and English proficiency. I present exposure indices and student distribution data first, followed by the analysis. I first determine whether racial, economic, or linguistic segregation exists in charter schools and then I focus on comparing segregation levels in charter and traditional public schools. Overall, the results show that despite a range of supports intended to correct enrollment bias, segregation continues to exist in a parental choice system.</p>
<sec id="section9-0013124511407317">
<title>Race</title>
<p>The four main racial groups in the District of Columbia are Black, Latino, White, and Asian. Black residents account for the 54% majority in the city; the Hispanic population is roughly 8% to 9%; and a small Asian population, about 3.4% of the total population, make the District of Columbia a majority–minority populated city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013124511407317">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). The proportion of White citizens continues to grow as gentrification movements in many D.C. neighborhoods bring an influx of young, White professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013124511407317">Thompson, 2007</xref>). As far as these population trends concern schools, enrollment has dropped nearly 40% since 1996 but has finally rounded off to a steady rate of about 46, 000 students per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124511407317">21st Century School Fund, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013124511407317">Turque, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>During the 2009-2010 school year, 35% of all students attending public schools attended a D.C. public charter school. Black students made up 83.58% of the charter school population and 74.74% of the traditional public school population. The remaining charter school population was comprised of three other races, Latino (12.65%), White (3.19%), and Asian (1.07%). Traditional public school enrollment was similar with Latino (13.46%), White (8.85%), and Asian (2.02%) making up the rest of the student population.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013124511407317">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013124511407317">2</xref> indicate that all racial groups in D.C. public charter schools are segregated. All exposure indices are positive and a majority of Black and Hispanic students attend a school that enrolls a majority of Black or Hispanic students, respectively. An average Black charter school student attends a school that is roughly 92% Black, which means that a Black student attending a school of average size (260 students) would only have 17 Latino classmates, 5 White classmates, and 2 Asian classmates. Around 86% of Black students attend a majority Black school, and 69% of all Black students attend a school that is greater than 90% Black; there is very little room for exposure to other races in schools this segregated. The largest discrepancies occur in the Latino population, as Latino students attend charter schools with nearly four times as many Latinos than a desegregated school system would allow. In addition, 53.20% of Latinos attend a school that enrolls a majority of Latino students.</p>

<p>White and Asian students also have positive exposure indices, but since they make up such a small percentage of the overall student population, there are no majority-White or majority-Asian charter schools in D.C. White charter school students attend schools that are, on average, 20.50% White, while Asian charter school students attend schools that are 6.50% Asian. While these numbers do not indicate high levels of relative racial segregation, the discrepancy between the actual and ideal populations for Asian and White students is very high. Asian students attend schools that enroll 5.5 times more Asian students than a completely desegregated school system would have, while White students attend schools that enroll 6.4 times more White students than the ideal distribution.</p>
<p>The answer to whether charter school students are more segregated than their traditional public school peers is slightly more convoluted. Exposure indices for all four races in traditional public schools are also higher than the norm-reference population, meaning that students are segregated. The discrepancies between the exposure index and the reference group will determine whether charter schools or traditional public schools are more segregated.</p>
<p>The greater exposure index discrepancy indicates that traditional public schools segregate Black students more. Even though charter schools have a higher exposure index for Black students, they also have a higher percentage of Black enrollment; the lower discrepancy means that the charter school system, through supports and the market, has been able to correct enrollment bias better than traditional public schools. A similar pattern emerges in the exposure indices for White students in traditional public schools. Although White students only account for 8.85% of traditional public school enrollment, an average White student attends a school that is majority White. Asian students also attend schools that contain higher percentages of Asian students than a completely desegregated system. The distribution of Asian and White students also supports the conclusions drawn from the exposure indices. No White or Asian charter school student attends a school that is majority White or Asian, unlike the traditional D.C. public school system, where 58.34% of White students attend a majority-White school. With such a low proportion of the overall student body, this is a major pattern of racial segregation not found in the charter school system.</p>
<p>A different conclusion emerges when looking at how students distribute themselves among the schools. A higher percentage of Black charter school students attend schools that are at least 50% Black; this is most likely due to the higher percentage of Black students in the entire charter school system population. However, when looking at intensely segregated schools, 69.42% of Black charter school students attend a school that is at least 90% Black. In traditional public schools, 52.64% of Black students attend such an intensely segregated school. There is no clear consensus on whether charter or traditional pubic schools in D.C. segregate Black students more. While the charter school system has been able to correct for some enrollment bias and lower the discrepancy between the exposure index and the reference population, more than two thirds of all Black students attend a school that is more than 90% Black.</p>
<p>A much clearer picture appears for Latino students in D.C. public charter schools: The exposure index discrepancy is larger in charter schools than in traditional public schools. Latino distribution also coincides with the finding that charter schools segregate Latinos at higher rates; 5% more Latino students attend majority-Latino charter schools. Roughly 3% of all Latinos attend a school that is at least 90% Latino, while no Latino students in the traditional public system attend such a segregated school. The comparison of exposure indices and student distributions show that Latinos, if only slightly, are more segregated within the charter school network. Given the unique linguistic characteristic of this group, it may be likely that only a few charter schools advertise in Spanish, which would concentrate Latino populations.</p>
<p>Segregation is remarkably high in both charter and traditional public school systems. However, the supports and market that supposedly would have desegregated school systems have not come close in creating enrollment patterns that represent an ideal student distribution; for Black, White, and Asian students, charter school free choice has only done marginally better than traditional reliance on neighborhood districts, which reinforce de facto neighborhood segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013124511407317">Orfield, 1995a</xref>).</p>

<title>Economics</title>
<p>The connection between levels of low-income students and minority students was a major theme of the Civil Rights Project recent report on school segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124511407317">Frankenberg et al., 2010</xref>). It concluded that in charter schools, the levels of high-poverty and high-minority students are intrinsically related. The discrepancy between the exposure index for economically disadvantaged students and the reference population supports a similar conclusion—charter schools segregate students along economic profiles. While 63.62% of charter school students are eligible for free or reduced price meals, they attend schools where 74.83% of their classmates are also economically disadvantaged. Out of all students attending a D.C. charter school, 80% of students attend a school where at least 50% of students have a low-economic status (LES). Out of all students, almost 6% of students attend a charter school where more than 90% of students are economically disadvantaged. This also means that 20% of charter school students are going to schools where a majority of students are not receiving free or reduced meals; this fact, in a system where almost two thirds of students qualify for economic assistance, means that economic segregation continues to persist, despite free choice and government supports meant to deter enrollment bias.</p>
<p>The data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013124511407317">tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0013124511407317">4</xref> suggest that the charter school system has been able to better correct economic segregation than the traditional public schools.The average low-income traditional public school student attends a school where 76.28% of his or her classmates also receive public assistance. In the traditional public schools, 60.57% of all students are of LES, so not only does the average traditional public school have a higher percentage of economically disadvantaged students but also is the discrepancy between the actual and reference population greater. In addition, 18.50% of traditional public school students attend a school where more than 90% of students are of LES. In comparison, only 5.61% of charter school students attend a school as intensely segregated.</p>

<p>An historical account of economic segregation in traditional public schools invites the same conclusion of de facto segregation—the drawing of school-district boundaries around neighborhoods reinforces levels of economic segregation created by housing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013124511407317">Orfield, 1995a</xref>). However, the high levels of economic segregation found in D.C.’s charter school system should not provoke such a conclusion because market forces supposedly do not enforce those de facto housing patterns. The range of supports, especially free transportation of LES students, would likely limit the amount of economic segregation in charter schools. It appears, however, that market forces have been unable to override the persistent clustering of economically disadvantaged students.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The percentage of LEP students in D.C. charter schools only represents 7.37% of the total student population, yet the exposure indices show that the system segregates students almost four times as much as a totally desegregated plan would allow. Furthermore, 35.12% of students in need of additional English instruction attend schools where more than half of students need similar assistance. Out of all the LEP students, 5.11% attend schools where more than 90% of students are not English proficient. Students who need additional English education require a different need of services and resources that even at-risk English speaking children may not need: translators for parent conferences, additional teachers, and additional time in the student’s schedule. All of these necessities can place additional burdens on to schools that have any LEP students. When LEP students concentrate in certain schools, as the above exposure indices suggest, it becomes much more difficult for that school to meet its objectives and for administrators to fairly evaluate teachers next to others who do not have such challenges.</p>
<p>This type of linguistic segregation not only creates problems for evaluating schools and teachers but also creates challenges in English instruction. When the majority of the school struggles in speaking English, it becomes much more difficult for students to learn the language. The amount of informal social conversations that take place in English is severely limited and the effects of linguistic segregation can have dire consequences on their ability to ever succeed on state standardized tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124511407317">Arias, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124511407317">Carhill &amp; Suárez-Orozco, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>When compared to traditional public schools, charter schools have created environments where these problems are more likely to exist. The discrepancies between actual exposure and the ideal are higher for charter schools and over twice as many LEP students enroll in segregated schools. There are no LEP students in traditional public schools who attend schools where more than 90% of students need additional instruction. The sustainment of de facto residential patterns through district drawing can also explain why linguistic segregation occurs in traditional D.C. public schools. Linguistic enclaves are just as likely, if not more likely, to occur like economic and racial housing patterns. This would funnel children from limited-English households into similar schools and provide a segregated experience.</p>
<p>But such reasoning runs contrary to the supposed theory on how free market systems distribute students. It is apparent, however, that none of the supports aimed at deterring segregation limit linguistic segregation. Students and parents may have limited access to resources because of their difficulty in understanding English. Therefore, students may only apply to schools that advertise in different languages or that aggressively seek out LEP students. It is likely that only a few schools do this since enrolling high percentages of LEP students tend to lower a school’s overall performance on standardized tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124511407317">Darling-Hammond, 2007</xref>). Public schools should spread the burden of such challenges evenly, especially since it will increase the chances of students becoming English proficient.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The charter school movement is rapidly becoming a catchall solution for the systematic problems of the American education system, especially in urban areas. We must first attempt to study the full effect of education reforms even while we want to quickly initiate them to ensure that no generation of students is left behind. The D.C. charter school system creates racially, economically, and linguistically segregated school environments in the wake of supposed policies meant to deter those effects. The switch from an all-inclusive neighborhood district into a free market parental choice model has not created the types of diversity that were at the heart of the <italic>Brown</italic> decision in 1954.</p>
<p>The D.C. charter school system, which has the alleged supports to limit enrollment bias, has not been able to avoid the same segregation patterns that other charter school systems across the nation have. To effectively combat market-created segregation, scholars need to further study the problems associated with the parental-choice model. The necessity at combating segregation does not imply that all-Black or all-Latino institutions are bad. The spirit of the civil rights movement, rather, fought against segregation that almost always produced unequal opportunities, sustained intolerance, and perpetuated damaging stereotypes.</p>
<p>Combating racial, economic, and linguistic segregation should be of the highest concern for all education professionals. Linguistic segregation can severely limit the ability of non-English speakers to become fluent and economic and racial segregation can create environments that are just as alienating. We must replicate the environment students will live in once they graduate from school. In an increasingly diverse United States, the market is not allowing students to get that experience, to create that cultural and racial empathy, and to understand the diversity of American society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013124511407317">Gutmann, 1987</xref>, p. 63). It is great to hear the stories of students who may not have graduated unless they attended a charter school, but graduating with a real understanding of the world that they are going into has to be reform’s ideal. Only through further study of why the market creates such imbalances will we be able to tell what types of market corrections are necessary or whether the free market does not have its place in education.</p>
