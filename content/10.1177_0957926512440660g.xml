<p>This book offers a discussion based on a comprehensive review of literature and a qualitative analysis of some American and British TV series. The author recognizes that her choice is culturally biased. After stating her awareness of these limits, Richardson presents her analysis in 10 chapters. The main idea is that dialogue in TV drama is a kind of onscreen talk that mediates two relationships as a part of dramatic storytelling. The first relationship occurs between the dramatist and the audience. This relationship is mediated by industrial and cultural conditions of production. The second relationship involves the interaction between the characters.</p>
<p>The initial reason which Richardson states for her study of language in TV dramatization is the lack of attention to television dramatic dialogue in academic research. This point is well explained in Chapter 2 where the author discusses different approaches: media research, linguistics, sociolinguistics, film studies and cognitive approaches. She notes that television drama research is an established field, but dialogue within this field has not yet drawn significant scholarly attention. In Chapter 3, Richardson focuses on a sociolinguistic approach to define TV dialogue as a particular kind of speech that is mediated and representational. Dialogue in TV drama is pre-scripted and interactive in order to convey a more or less naturalistic impression. TV dialogue is different from face-to-face interaction and media talk, but ‘TV dialogue relates to naturally occurring spoken interaction in real life (…). It relates to other depictions of talk (…) and it relates to television’s other kinds of mediated talk’ (p. 42).</p>
<p>Pointing out that dialogue in TV drama mediates these relationships, Richardson analyses it, taking into account TV screenwriters (Chapter 4) and audiences (Chapter 5). For this, she analyses printed and online texts for novice and apprentice writers, and online texts published by audience members (threads, blogs, review columns and fan fiction) about a number of TV series. Unlike for cinema, screenwriting for television is a collective task. Professionals work together in reaching audiences and dialogue is one of the elements they can utilize. For them, dialogue contributes to textual meaning in a way that gives it a naturalistic quality. It is intended to add weight to interpretations of characters, story and theme. Concerning audiences, the author asks how texts are interpreted and how dialogue contributes to interpretation. First, she defines audience and then continues with an analysis of texts written by audiences in order to evaluate how they respond to TV drama. Audiences can use dialogue in two ways: dialogue can influence the interpretation of the text itself and dialogue can play a role in their own social relationships and interactions, e.g. when viewers sometimes remember and use lines to communicate with their communities. In other words, dialogue is a resource. In fact, ‘writers and audiences bring together their real-world identities and interests into their media literacy practices’ (p. 86).</p>
<p>In Chapters 6 and 7, Richardson points out more specifically how to study dramatic TV dialogue. Chapter 6 analyses how dramatists display the relations between characters, drawing on an interactional sociolinguistic approach, and criticizes the fact that some scholars study this kind of dialogue as a relationship between real people and not as a dialogue crafted by a production team in order to reach audiences.</p>
<p>Richardson then offers two case studies based on two series, one British (<italic>Life on Mars</italic>) and one American (<italic>House</italic>). Analysing online viewers’ comments on <italic>Life on Mars</italic>, Chapter 8 addresses the sociolinguistics of dialogue. It takes dialogue along a narrative structure and explains how dialogue between characters mediates the social interaction between dramatists and audiences. Chapter 9 focuses more specifically on the forms and functions of impoliteness in studying the American TV drama <italic>House</italic>. Two functions of impoliteness are identified by the author: one that constructs the protagonist’s character (in interpersonal relationships with other characters) and one that entertains the audience (in the interpersonal relationship of dramatist–audience).</p>
<p>Finally, the conclusion (Chapter 10) summarizes the main theoretical issues developed throughout the book: the importance of dramatized material in everyday life, the TV drama, definition and role of dialogue in television drama.</p>
<p>This book is of interest to mass media researchers because it offers a comprehensive viewpoint that takes into account the production of mass media products and their reception. In fact, one of its most engaging ideas lies in the proposal made by Richardson for scholars and professionals to cooperate: ‘sociolinguistics has something to learn from the professional discourses, as well as something to contribute’ (p. 83). In this respect, the book is also a good example for novice researchers, because it points out the importance of active comprehension of the conditions of production, the product published or broadcast by the media and the activity of reception.</p>
