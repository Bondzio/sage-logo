<abstract>
<p>The <italic>Physical Activity Scale for Individuals With Physical Disabilities</italic> was examined as a physical activity measure for people with severe mental illness. Case manager ratings were more closely related to body mass index than clients’ ratings, challenging the accuracy of self-report physical activity measures for individuals with severe mental illness.</p>

<p>Individuals with severe mental illness are at greater risk for certain secondary conditions and premature death when compared with the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034355212439757">Pelletier, Nguyen, Bradley, Johnsen, &amp; McKay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0034355212439757">Sebastian &amp; Beer, 2007</xref>). Health risks include type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and there is a greater prevalence of obesity than in the general population, 42% versus 27%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034355212439757">Keck &amp; Kane, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0034355212439757">Kornegay, Vasilakis-Scaramozza, &amp; Jick, 2002</xref>). An estimated 50% of individuals with severe mental illness have at least one coexisting medical problem, and 35% have medical problems that are undiagnosed or untreated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034355212439757">Felker, Yazel, &amp; Short, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034355212439757">Lawrence, Velakoulis, &amp; Pantelis, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355212439757">Farnam, Zipple, Tyrrell, and Chittinanda (1999)</xref>, 60% of individuals with severe mental illness engage in low levels of physical activity. Assessment of physical activity, however, is challenging with this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034355212439757">Bezyak, Berven, &amp; Chan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355212439757">Jerome et al., 2009</xref>). Accelerometer data quality can be compromised due to data corruption or noncompliance with study protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034355212439757">Slaven, Andrew, Violanti, Burchfiel, &amp; Vila, 2006</xref>). Accelerometers are also problematic for assessing activities of daily living in comparison with activities such as walking and running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0034355212439757">Murphy, 2009</xref>). Challenges with self-report data may also be somewhat greater when studying people with severe mental illness. The impact of daily life stressors, which includes increased psychiatric symptoms, may significantly impact self-report ratings in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355212439757">Jerome et al., 2009</xref>). The use of key informants (e.g., case managers) to capture activity patterns has been proposed; however, surveys completed by key informants must be assessed for accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034355212439757">Zhu &amp; Chodzko-Zajko, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Physical Activity Scale for Individuals With Physical Disabilities</italic> (PASIPD) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0034355212439757">Washburn, Zhu, McAuley, Frogley, and Figoni (2002)</xref> is a well-validated, self-report tool. This tool measures additional types of physical activity (i.e., household and occupational activities), which captures the full extent of an individual’s physical activity and is often not provided in traditional measures of physical activity. The purpose of the current study was to investigate potential differences between ratings of physical activity provided by clients and case managers using body mass index (BMI) as a criterion for physical health outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section1-0034355212439757" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The sample included 72 individuals with severe mental illness in an assertive community treatment (ACT) program. The sample comprised all program clients who gave their consent to participate and had information available in the agency client database for measures used in the study. The sample consisted of 75% men and 25% women with ages ranging from 18 to 58 years. Primary psychiatric diagnoses were schizophrenia (55%), schizoaffective disorder (30%), bipolar disorder (8%), and other mood disorders (4%). Weights ranged from 128 to 449 pounds, with BMI estimates ranging from 19 to 54, and 46% of individuals met the definition of obesity, with a BMI greater than 30.</p>
<p>The ACT program used the measures incorporated into this study as a part of their biannual assessment protocol for all clients, and case file information was maintained in a computer database. The measures of physical activity and physical health outcomes were collected as a result of treatment priorities established by ACT program staff and clients. The most recent biannual assessment information, which included client and case manager ratings, was used in this study, and a data file was made available to the researchers by the ACT program, which was de-identified according to criteria specified in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. ACT program clients who agreed to participate in the current study had been assigned a case manager on intake, and they worked closely together with at least weekly contact to promote mental health recovery.</p>
<p>The PASIPD contains 12 items and five factors: (a) home repair and lawn and garden work, (b) housework, (c) vigorous sport and recreation, (d) light/moderate sport and recreation, and (e) occupation. Clients and case managers provided independent ratings using this instrument for the present study. Respondents are asked to indicate frequency and duration of engagement in each activity. Scores are computed by multiplying the average hours per day of an activity by a metabolic equivalent of task (MET) value, which represents the intensity of physical activities. The scores are summed across all items, and the maximum possible score is 199.5 MET hours per day (MET-hr/d). Internal consistency coefficients for the five PASIPD factors range from .37 to .59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0034355212439757">Washburn et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Prior to conducting the analyses, mean ratings for each of the items on the physical activity scale were examined to highlight any differences in client and case manager ratings. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0034355212439757">Table 1</xref> presents the means and standard deviation for each of the items on the PASIPD after multiplying average hours per day by the appropriate MET value.</p>

<p>Paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-test results, <italic>t</italic>(71) = 2.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, indicated that case managers’ rated their clients’ physical activity level (<italic>M</italic> = 7.69 MET-hr/d, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.48) significantly lower than the clients’ own assessment (<italic>M</italic> = 11.08 MET-hr/d, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.91). A comparison was also conducted between results of the current study and Washburn et al.’s (2002) study, which investigated physical activity among people with physical disabilities. Clients reported a significantly lower level of physical activity than people with physical disabilities (<italic>M</italic> = 20.2 MET-hr/d, <italic>SD</italic> = 14.5) in Washburn et al.’s study, <italic>t</italic>(442) = 5.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Clients rated themselves as spending more time on employment or volunteer work (<italic>M</italic> = 3.28, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.74), walking outside the home (<italic>M</italic> = 2.17, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.21), strenuous recreational activities (<italic>M</italic> = 1.96, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.87), moderate recreational activities (<italic>M</italic> = 1.47, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.62), heavy housework (<italic>M</italic> = 1.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.04), and strength training (<italic>M</italic> = 1.15, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.29). Conversely, case managers reported their clients spent relatively less time on physical activities related to employment or volunteer work (<italic>M</italic> = 2.54, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.34), walking outside the home (<italic>M</italic> = 1.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.44), and strenuous recreational activities (<italic>M</italic> = 0.97, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.89). Follow-up paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-test analyses on individual PASIPD items indicated that case manager ratings were significantly lower than client ratings in light recreational activities, light housework, heavy housework, and caregiving. Finally, the total score of case manager physical activity ratings were found to be significantly associated with clients’ BMI (<italic>r</italic> = –.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), whereas the correlation between the total score of client ratings and BMI scores was not statistically significant (<italic>r</italic> = –.21, <italic>ns</italic>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results of the current study indicate significant differences between physical activity ratings provided by clients and their case managers. In addition, people with severe mental illness rated levels of physical activity significantly lower than people with physical disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0034355212439757">Washburn et al., 2002</xref>). Case manager ratings of clients’ physical activity levels are significantly correlated with BMI, unlike client ratings. These results suggest that mental health professionals provide useful ratings of physical activity that may be more accurate than self-report data.</p>
<p>The results further suggest challenges with the accuracy of self-report physical activity measures for individuals with severe mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034355212439757">Bezyak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355212439757">Jerome et al., 2009</xref>). Previous research indicates alternative methods of physical activity measurement, including the use of accelerometers, could be useful in conjunction with subjective measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0034355212439757">Faulkner, Cohn, &amp; Remington, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355212439757">Jerome et al., 2009</xref>), although additional research is needed for confirmation. The development of a more concise measure of physical activity for people with severe mental illness may prove advantageous, and pairing this instrument with a similar measure of dietary habits would allow professionals to better understand the effectiveness of health promotion strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034355212439757">Daumit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034355212439757">Keck &amp; Kane, 2003</xref>). A thorough literature review of assessment methods, along with the use of focus groups, would provide a strong foundation for the development of this instrument, which could then be validated with existing physical activity measures. A brief and psychometrically sound self-report physical activity measure is important for epidemiology research, model testing, and health promotion intervention research for people with severe mental illness.</p>
