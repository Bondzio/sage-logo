<p>It is all well and good to have a single forecast of where humanity is headed in the decades ahead, as bravely offered by Jorgen Randers in <bold><italic>2052: A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years. Report to the Club of Rome</italic></bold> (Chelsea Green, June 2012, 392 pp., $24.95; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.2052.info">www.2052.info</ext-link>, GFB Book of the Month, July 2012). But it is equally important to have normative visions of what should be done to improve the human condition. An early effort to do so was provided by Ervin Laszlo et al. in <bold><italic>Goals for Mankind: A Report to the Club of Rome on the New Horizons of Global Community</italic></bold> (NAL/Signet, Updated and Revised Edition, 1978), a survey of goals for nations and regions, the United Nations (UN), multinational corporations, religions, global security, food, energy, resources, and development. Today, with much additional globalization and apparent proliferation of global problems approaching a “Global MegaCrisis,” there is also a proliferation of visions.</p>
<p>The report of the UN secretary general’s high-level panel on global sustainability, <bold><italic>Resilient People, Resilient Planet: A Future Worth Choosing</italic></bold> (United Nations, March 2012, 112 pp.; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.un.org/gsp">www.un.org/gsp</ext-link>; GFB Book of the Month, June 2012) presents fifty-six recommendations to advance its vision for a sustainable planet, a just society, and a growing economy. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development provides a policy framework for green growth (<bold><italic>Towards Green Growth</italic></bold>, June 2011, 142 pp.; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oecd.org/greengrowth">www.oecd.org/greengrowth</ext-link>; GFB Book of the Month, June 2011), along with a strategy to promote transition to green growth and to monitor progress. The Washington-based Worldwatch Institute, in its latest annual State of the World Report, <bold><italic>Moving Toward Sustainable Prosperity (</italic></bold>Island Press, April 2012, 241 pp.; GFB Book of the Month, April 2012) features a “Policy Toolbox” for population strategies to stop short of nine billion, sustainable buildings, sustainable consumption, a sustainable food system, protecting biodiversity, valuing natural capital and ecosystem services, getting local government right, “degrowth” in overdeveloped countries, sustainable transport, reinventing corporations, making the green economy work for everybody, and a new global architecture for sustainability governance.</p>
<p>Adding to this collection are three more reports briefly reviewed below, from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), Canada’s Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), and the Millennium Project (MP). These reports are all welcome, and each has something to offer. But an analysis beyond what is sketched here is badly needed—one that critically looks at similarities and differences among the current reports, and how the earlier Laszlo report to the Club of Rome may still be of some value.For background, it would also be useful to consult <bold><italic>Paths to a Green World</italic></bold> by Canadian political scientists Jennifer Clapp and Peter Dauvergne (MIT Press, 2nd edition, May 2011, 354 pp.; GFB Book of the Month, May 2011), which discusses four competing worldviews in great detail: Market Liberals, Institutionalists, Bioenvironmentalists, and Social Greens. Echoing this analysis, and what Robert E. Horn says (below), we should listen to everyone—and then improve our worldview, and move the evolving vision from the far periphery into the center of public discourse.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Vision 2050: The New Agenda for Business</italic></bold>. World Business Council for Sustainable Development, December 2010, 80 pp., $15 (download in eleven languages at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wbcsd.org/vision2050.aspx">www.wbcsd.org/vision2050.aspx</ext-link>). This report lays out a pathway leading to a global population of some nine billion people living well, within the resources of the planet, by 2050. The Vision results from an eighteen-month effort by CEOs and experts with more than 200 companies, and external stakeholders in some twenty countries. It produced seventy measures of success and 350 milestones for the next four decades using ten tracks: energy, buildings, mobility, materials, economy, governance, people, agriculture, forests, and ecosystems/biodiversity. It also lists forty “must haves”: things that must happen over the coming decade to make a sustainable planetary society possible. This includes (1) incorporating the costs of externalities—starting with carbon, water, and ecosystem services—into the structure of the marketplace; (2) doubling agricultural output without increasing the amount of land or water used; (3) halting deforestation and doubling yields from planted forests; (4) halving 2005-level carbon emissions worldwide by 2050, by shifting to low-carbon energy systems, improved energy efficiency, and universal access to low-carbon mobility; and (5) increasing reuse of materials in manufacturing by a factor of 4 to 10. This will require great cooperation between governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector to deal with the “wicked problem” of sustainability. The report is a best-case scenario, a tool for thought leadership, and a platform to begin the dialogue that must take place. If successful, “a shift to sustainability will trigger trillions of dollars in new investments in infrastructure, technology, and human services.”</p>
<p>Also see “To Save the Planet, Listen to Everyone” by Robert E. Horn of Stanford University (<italic>New Scientist</italic>, December 17, 2011, 28–31), who participated in the WBCSD project by preparing an accompanying “info-mural”—a supersized laminated wall chart translating these ideas into visual language (available at Foresight Canada from <email>RubenNelson@shaw.ca</email>). Horn goes on to acknowledge weaknesses of <italic>Vision 2050</italic>: failure to adequately deal with poverty and population (also human rights and failed states), no mention of oceans and displaced people, and use of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) proposed limit of 450 ppm of CO<sub>2</sub>, which may require reduction to 350 ppm to keep climate within tolerable limits.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Post-2015 Development Agenda: Goals, Targets, and Indicators</italic></bold>. Barry Carin (Senior Fellow, CIGI) et al. Waterloo, Canada: Centre for International Governance Innovation, October 2012, 63 pp. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cigionline.org/publications">www.cigionline.org/publications</ext-link>). The UN’s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for a more peaceful, prosperous, and just world, launched in 2000, set specific targets to be met by 2015, with indicators to measure progress. By 2015, the world will have met some of the MDG’s key targets, such as halving the poverty rate, and will be close to achieving primary education for all children. But health goals are difficult, and Africa lags behind, despite substantial progress since 2000.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Overall, the MDGs have been remarkably successful in focusing attention and mobilizing resources to address the major gaps in human development. <italic>Building on the MDGs, the global community should move beyond meeting basic human needs and promote dynamic, inclusive, and sustainable development. Future goals must reach beyond traditional development thinking to become sustainable one-world goals.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Based on discussions at a 2011 meeting in Italy, eleven potential “Bellagio Goals” are proposed: (1) inclusive growth for dignified livelihoods and adequate standards of living; (2) sufficient food and water; (3) appropriate education and skills for productive participation in society; (4) good health for the best possible physical and mental well-being; (5) security for ensuring freedom from violence; (6) gender equality, enabling women and men to participate and benefit equally in society; (7) building resilient communities and nations for reduced disaster risk; (8) improving infrastructure for access to essential information, services, and opportunities; (9) empowering people to realize their civil and political rights; (10) sustainable management of the biosphere, enabling people and the planet to thrive together; and (11) global governance and equitable rules for realizing human potential. Much of this report (pp. 30–58) reviews a menu of indicators and data sources for these goals, so as to measure progress and galvanize public support. In sum, this is an important step forward, nicely complementing—albeit complexifying—the WBSCD “Vision” (above) and the 15 MP “Challenges” (below).</p>
<p><bold><italic>2012 State of the Future</italic></bold> (Executive Edition). Jerome C. Glenn, Theodore J. Gordon, and Elizabeth Florescu (MP). Washington: Millennium Project, August 2012, 107 pp., $39.95 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.StateOfTheFuture.org">www.StateOfTheFuture.org</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.millennium-project.org">www.millennium-project.org</ext-link>). The sixteenth annual report providing “a context for global thinking and improved understanding of global issues, opportunities, challenges, and strategies.” It is based on a network 46 MP nodes of individuals and institutions in every global region. As in earlier editions since 1996, the main part of the report is devoted to an overview of fifteen global challenges: (1) sustainable development and climate change; (2) sufficient clean water; (3) population growth and food production brought into balance; (4) promoting genuine democracy; (5) promoting global long-term perspectives in policymaking (a Global Future Collective Intelligence System is needed, and heads of government should have a foresight office connected by a Collective Intelligence System (CIS) to government agencies); (6) global convergence of information technologies to work for everyone; (7) encouraging ethical market economies to help reduce the rich/poor gap (improved free trade, increased economic freedom, a level playing field guaranteed by an honest judicial system, reduced corruption, etc.); (8) reducing the threat of new and reemerging diseases; (9) improving decision making (“many of the world’s institutions and decision-making processes are inefficient, slow, and ill-informed”; common trans-institutional platforms are needed); (10) new security strategies to reduce conflict and terrorism; (11) empowering women; (12) addressing transnational organized crime networks; (13) meeting growing energy demands safely and efficiently; (14) accelerating sci/tech breakthroughs to improve the human condition (e.g., through synthetic biology, nano-robots, and nano-medicine, new physics enabling new forms of energy, a global collective intelligence system); and (15) incorporating ethical considerations into global decisions (so as to promote human rights and reduce corruption).</p>
<p>The report also includes (1) the annual State of the Future Index of twenty-eight indicators showing where humanity is winning and losing; (2) results of the 2012 RTD (Real-Time Delphi) panel on the probability of key developments by 2021; for example, increase of CO<sub>2</sub> burden by 20 percent (52 percent), economic expansion of greater than 5 percent from nanotechnology and other new technology (47 percent), global economic depression (42 percent), cost-effective desalination increases safe water 20 percent worldwide (39 percent), a pandemic on the scale of HIV/AIDS (33 percent), and so on; (3) a RTD study with 179 participants on how gender stereotypes are thought to be changing from fifty years ago to fifty years in the future; (4) a RTD study with more than a hundred experts on “Cooperatives 2030” as “a major generator of employment and development” (in line with the UN’s designation of 2012 as the International Year of Cooperation), noting the emergence of the concept of “nonownership” as distinct from private ownership or state ownership; (5) a RTD survey of sixteen hopes and sixteen fears in Kuwait involving 193 participants; and (6) a chapter on “Future of Ontology” (an emerging science and engineering discipline analogous to computer science some fifty years ago; ontologies form the underpinnings that allow data to “interoperate” or for machines to make useful “inferences.” This is by far the most ambitious of the three reports reviewed here, integrating a huge amount of material and promoting fresh perspectives on crime and corruption (Challenges 12, 15), ethical markets and global decisions [Challenges 7, 15], and improved decision making [Challenges 5, 6, 9, 14]—topics that are absent from more conventional agendas such as WBCSD and CIGI. However, the index-less presentation of abundant detail is unwieldy and probably overwhelming to many, especially in the 10,000-page electronic version that presents the cumulative work of the MP.</p>
