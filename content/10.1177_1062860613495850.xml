<p>The <italic>American Journal of Medical Quality</italic> is the official Journal of the American College of Medical Quality. The journal publishes original work in the entire field of quality measurement and improvement. Manuscripts submitted to <italic>AJMQ</italic> should meet the following criteria: the material is original, the writing is clear, the study methods are appropriate, the data are valid, the conclusions are reasonable and supported by the data, the information is important, and the topic has general medical quality interest. We will assess a paper’s eligibility for publication based on these basic criteria.</p>
<sec id="section1-1062860613495850">
<title>Manuscript Submission</title>
<p>Manuscripts must be submitted electronically at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ajmq">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ajmq</ext-link>, where authors will be required to set up an online account in the SAGETRACK system powered by ScholarOne. Questions about manuscript submission can be addressed to Deborah Meiris, Managing Editor, <italic>American Journal of Medical Quality</italic>, Tel: (215) 955-0745; Fax: (215) 923-7583; E-mail: <email>Deborah.meiris@jefferson.edu</email>.</p>
<p>Manuscripts are considered with the understanding that they have not been published previously in print or electronic format, and are not under consideration by another publication or electronic medium, except in the form of an abstract of not more than 400 words. Prior abstract presentations should be described in a footnote to the title. Submissions should be accompanied by a letter requesting evaluation for publication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1062860613495850">
<title>Preparation of Manuscript</title>
<p>Manuscripts should be submitted (in AMA style) double spaced with ample margins on all sides.</p>
<p>These are the <bold>word count limitations for manuscripts</bold>, effective October 1, 2009: Original manuscript—3500 words, excluding abstract, tables/figures, and references. It may include up to 5 tables or figures (total), and up to 40 references. Commentary, Perspective, or Editorial— 1300 words or 1000 words with 1 small table or figure, excluding references. A maximum of 10 references.</p>
<p>The title page should include the authors’ names and affiliations, the source of a work or study (if any), and a running title of approximately 45 characters. <bold>We require the full mailing address and contact information (telephone, fax, e-mail address, and alternate address) for the corresponding author listed on your article.</bold> This information should appear on the title page or on a separate sheet. Include full names and e-mail addresses for all co-authors.</p>
<p>Authors must disclose all current and foreseeable financial and personal relationships that might inappropriately influence their actions and create a <bold>conflict of interest</bold>. Complete disclosures of conflicts of interest, or the absence of any conflict of interest, must be provided for all authors on a conflict of interest notification page following the title page of the manuscript. Failure to include this information will delay the review process. Each author’s disclosure will be published. Additionally, a Conflict of Interest and Financial Disclosure Form, completed by all authors, must be submitted along with the manuscript. The form is available from the managing editor at <email>Deborah.meiris@jefferson.edu</email>.</p>
<p>The third page should consist of an abstract of not more than 150 words, which should be self-explanatory without reference to the text. Reference citations are not permitted in the abstract of a paper. Number pages consecutively. At the end of the paper, give the name and address of the individual to whom reprint requests should be directed.</p>
<p>Authors who want to refine the use of English in their manuscripts might consider utilizing the services of SPi, a non-affiliated company that offers Professional Editing Services. Please visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajmq.sagepub.com">http://ajmq.sagepub.com</ext-link> and click on “Manuscript Submission” for more information.</p>

<sec id="section3-1062860613495850">
<title>Tables and Figures</title>
<p>Each table or figure should appear on a separate page and be placed at the end of the document, following the text and references. Use Arabic numerals to number tables. Each table must stand alone (ie, contain all necessary information in the caption), and the table itself must be understood independently of the text. Details of experimental conditions should be included in table footnotes. Information that appears in the text should not be repeated in tables, and tables should not contain data that can be given in the text in one or two sentences. The text of the tables should be editable; that is, the tables should not be saved as images that cannot be altered or edited.</p>
<p>Position of figures and tables in the text should be indicated in the manuscript and cited in order in the text.</p>

<sec id="section4-1062860613495850">
<title>References</title>
<p>References must be double spaced, in AMA style, and numbered consecutively as they are cited in the text (using superscript numbers). References appearing for the first time in tables and figures must be numbered in sequence with those cited in the text where the table or figure is mentioned. Use journal abbreviations as provided by the <italic>Index Medicus</italic>, National Library of Medicine. List all authors when there are six or less. When there are more than six authors, list the first three, followed by et al. If references to personal communications or unpublished data are used, they are not to be included in the list of references. Refer to them in the text in parentheses (C.O. Tucker, personal communication). Among the references, include papers accepted but not yet published; designate the journal, and add “In Press.”</p>
