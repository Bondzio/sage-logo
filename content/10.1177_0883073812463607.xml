<abstract>
<p>Sturge-Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous disorder with skin, eye, and brain involvement. Prior series suggest about 50% of patients have seizures/neurodeterioration. Low-dose (3-5 mg/kg/d) aspirin use in this population is controversial. This study further addresses the side effects and outcomes of low-dose aspirin usage in Sturge-Weber syndrome. Fifty-eight subjects on aspirin with brain involvement were analyzed in a retrospective chart review. Charts were evaluated for brain involvement, age at first seizure, and side effects. Subjects’ clinical stability was compared using neurologic scores. The majority of subjects had neurologic scores reflecting reasonable seizure control (91%), none or mild hemiparesis (57%), no vision impairment (71%), and none or mild cognitive impairment (80%). Forty-nine reported no significant side effects, and 9 reported either allergic reaction or minimal to significant bleeding on aspirin. This cohort’s clinical experience adds significant support for low-dose aspirin use to optimize neurodevelopmental outcome in Sturge-Weber syndrome with minimal side effects.</p>

<body>
<p>Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare neurocutaneous syndrome associated with vascular malformations of the face, eyes, and brain. Facial capillary malformations (port wine birthmarks) typically affect skin innervated by the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, whereas brain vascular malformations (leptomeningeal angiomatosis) occur mostly in the occipital and posterior parietal lobes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812463607">1</xref>
</sup> Patients commonly have ophthalmologic and neurologic clinical features including glaucoma, visual field deficits, seizures, strokelike episodes, cognitive and behavioral issues, and headaches. Clinical profiles within the disorder vary: some patients are mildly affected, whereas others exhibit rapid progression with severe disability.</p>
<p>Disease progression has been linked to recurrent thrombosis and resulting venous stasis. Antiplatelet medications could reduce thrombosis and promote perfusion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812463607">2</xref>
</sup> Low-dose aspirin use has been reported in a few small series of subjects. One study by Maria showed a 65% reduction of strokelike episodes in 14 Sturge-Weber syndrome subjects on low-dose aspirin; another study by Udani reported decreased frequency of seizures and strokelike episodes coinciding with low-dose aspirin use in 6 Sturge-Weber syndrome patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812463607">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812463607">4</xref>
</sup> A recent online anonymous survey from our center reported decreased frequency of seizures and strokelike episodes in 34 Sturge-Weber syndrome subjects on low-dose aspirin. Side effects were seen in a small number of patients, specifically, increased bruising and gum bleeding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812463607">5</xref>
</sup> In addition, low-dose aspirin is used in pediatric patients as a preventive treatment in children with recurrent stroke.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812463607">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Overall, the use of low-dose aspirin as a treatment of Sturge-Weber syndrome is controversial; aspirin is not widely used in clinical practice. This study of the clinical experience at the Hunter Nelson Sturge-Weber Center follows up on the prior survey and summarizes data from a large number of Sturge-Weber syndrome patients treated with low-dose aspirin. We hypothesized that low-dose aspirin is safe and well tolerated in Sturge-Weber syndrome patients and that low-dose aspirin may improve or stabilize Sturge-Weber syndrome patients’ seizures and neurologic outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073812463607" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The subjects were patients seen at the Kennedy Krieger Institute Hunter Nelson Sturge-Weber Center, a multidisciplinary clinic dedicated to the care and research of Sturge-Weber syndrome. The Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board approved this research and all subjects signed informed consent. The Sturge-Weber Center research database contains records of subjects seen between January 2000 and August 2011. Sturge-Weber syndrome brain involvement was diagnosed based on unilateral or bilateral leptomeningeal enhancement on neuroimaging. Participants were on low-dose aspirin (3-5 mg/kg/d) therapy as part of their clinical treatment. Aspirin levels were not checked in patients. The dose was decreased or spaced out for those subjects with minor side effects in whom aspirin was not discontinued.</p>
<p>Charts for subjects under 18 years of age with confirmed Sturge-Weber syndrome brain involvement were evaluated for the following variables: gender, side of brain involvement (left, right, or bilateral), age of first seizure, age at which aspirin was started, and relevant side effects. Prospectively assigned Sturge-Weber syndrome neurologic scores were collected from each patient over multiple visits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812463607">Figure 1</xref>). This scoring system is based on disease severity with regard to seizures, cognition, hemiparesis, and vision, and has been clinically validated through correlation with MRI scores, perfusion deficits on neuroimaging, decreased power on quantitative EEG, and adaptive function testing.<sup>

</fig>
<p>Three subgroups from the Sturge-Weber syndrome database were compiled for analyses. Subgroup 1 (n = 58) was composed of all the subjects on whom information regarding side effects to aspirin therapy was available through follow-up visits at the center (n = 50) or e-mail/telephone follow-up (n = 8). Of these, 53 had epilepsy and 5 had no history of epilepsy; 4 of these 5 had a history of a visual gaze preference. This group was used to investigate the occurrence of side effects linked with low-dose aspirin use in Sturge-Weber syndrome.</p>
<p>Subgroup 2 (n = 35) was composed of the subjects with available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that had at least 2 visits to the Sturge-Weber Center during which they received prospective Sturge-Weber syndrome neurologic scores while on low-dose aspirin. Subjects from this subgroup were seen at the Center between July 2005 and August 2011. MRIs were reviewed by 2 researchers trained to look for atrophy and leptomeningeal enhancement based on a previously described scoring system.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812463607">7</xref>
</sup> Both reviewers rated each MRI separately at 2 different times, then together once to reach consensus. Subjects from group 2 were classified as worsening, improving, or stable based on whether their neurologic scores on aspirin worsened (increased), improved (decreased), or remained stable (unchanged) between their first and last neurologic score as well as “good” and bad” based on a functional classification system of their neurologic scores. The group was used to determine the effects of aspirin on clinical symptoms longitudinally.</p>
<p>Subgroup 3 (n = 5) consisted of subjects who were started on low-dose aspirin prior to onset of their seizures. This group was used to evaluate the effects of starting low-dose aspirin prior to onset of seizures in young children with Sturge-Weber syndrome brain involvement. Additional demographic information for all 3 subgroups can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812463607">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Ninety-three Sturge-Weber syndrome subjects with diagnosed brain involvement were seen at the Hunter Nelson Sturge-Weber Center between January 2000 and August 2011. Of the 93 Sturge-Weber syndrome subjects with brain involvement seen during that period, 82 were either on aspirin at the time of their visit (n = 24) or were recommended to start aspirin (n = 58). Of those, 50 had at least 1 follow-up visit. The median number of follow-ups for those 50 subjects was 3.5 (mean 5.2 ± 4.84 visits) with a range from 1 to 18 follow-up visits. The median length of follow-up was 37.5 months (mean 37 ± 31 months) with a range from 1 to 153 months. An additional 8 subjects were seen only once at the Center but we obtained historical data on aspirin side effects prior to that visit or through subsequent emails or phone calls.</p>
<p>For the 35 Sturge-Weber syndrome subjects in subgroup 2, the median number of follow-up visits for those subjects was 4 (mean 6 ± 4.5 visits), with a range from 2 to 20 follow-up visits. The median length of follow-up was 47 months (mean 41.5 ± 25.1 months) with a range from 2 to 99 months.</p>
<sec id="section3-0883073812463607">
<title>Aspirin Side Effects and Complications</title>
<p>Of 58 Sturge-Weber syndrome subjects with brain involvement started on aspirin who have follow-up data (subgroup 1), 49 reported no significant side effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812463607">Figure 1A</xref>). Of the 9 subjects reporting complications, 6 reported experiencing only minor side effects (increased nosebleeds or bruising). Three subjects reported serious side effects or had associated significant bleeding events that led to stopping the aspirin, including 1 instance each of allergic rash, hematemesis, and subdural hematoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812463607">Figure 1B</xref>). The allergic rash resolved immediately on stopping the aspirin without further complications. The hematemesis occurred a week after starting the low-dose aspirin in an infant in the setting of severe hand-foot-and-mouth disease with upper GI lesions. The child required a transfusion but recovered completely and continued to do well with no onset of neurologic symptoms (seizures) until 5 years of age, at which time aspirin was restarted. The subdural hematoma occurred after minor trauma in a toddler. The low-dose aspirin was stopped and the subdural hematoma and symptoms (seizures and increased hemiparesis) resolved completely. Aspirin was stopped in 6 of the 9 subjects because of side effects, complications, or associated serious bleeding events.</p>

<title>MRI Results</title>
<p>Subjects that had at least 2 prospective neurologic scores assigned at the Sturge-Weber Center and available MRIs for analyses were selected for subgroup 2. MRIs were scored using criteria that allowed a minimum score of 8 (no asymmetry) and a maximum score of 32 (severe asymmetry). Subjects’ brain injury scores ranged from 9 to 31 with a median total score of 14. Median scores were higher in the parietal lobes and on the left side (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073812463607">Table 2</xref>).</p>

Thirty-two of thirty-five subjects had a good seizure score between 0 and 2 (no seizures ever to breakthrough seizures in the past 6 months but not monthly) indicating that the majority of subjects had reasonably well-controlled seizures at their last visit. In comparing the frequency of “good” and “bad” seizure scores at the first and last neurologic score, there were fewer scores in the “bad” category at the last neurologic score (3) than there were at the first neurologic score (6).

<title>Presymptomatic Aspirin Treatment Results</title>
<p>Out of the 82 patients seen at the Hunter Nelson Sturge-Weber Center on aspirin, 5 were started on low-dose aspirin before their first seizure, typically after other symptoms developed (early handedness, visual gaze preference, or strokelike episode). Potential risks/benefits were discussed with the parents before low-dose aspirin administration. Infants ≥4 kg in weight were started on one-fourth of an 81-mg baby aspirin tablet crushed or compounded for a dose of 3 to 5 mg/kg/d. The age of first seizure, age of final neurologic score, and the distribution of final neurologic scores and subscores between the 5 subjects started on low-dose aspirin presymptomatically and the 30 subjects in group 2 that were started on low-dose aspirin after seizure onset were not statistically significantly different by Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> analysis (Supplemental Table 2).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In a group of 58 subjects, very few serious complications were reported, and low-dose aspirin (3-5 mg/kg/d) was well tolerated by almost all subjects. The majority of side-effects were minor (nosebleeds, bruising) and not every subject with complications found them severe enough to discontinue aspirin.</p>
<p>In 2 of the 3 cases with more significant events, low-dose aspirin was likely taken in association with the complications. For instance, with the allergic rash, the side-effect was directly attributable to low-dose aspirin. The rash immediately resolved when aspirin was discontinued. The subdural hematoma was caused by minor head trauma as a result of the subject falling from a chair; the child returned to baseline afterwards and the hematoma resolved completely. Subdural hematomas occur rarely in Sturge-Weber syndrome patients.<sup>

</sup> The hematemesis was attributed to severe hand-foot-and-mouth disease with internal lesions instead of aspirin. The low-dose aspirin was stopped to prevent exacerbation of the hematemesis, but it was unlikely to be the cause. From these data and the literature, we conclude that the use of low-dose aspirin in young Sturge-Weber syndrome patients is generally safe, and any complications that occur can usually be quickly resolved by discontinuation of aspirin. As in other cases where low-dose aspirin is used for secondary stroke prevention, it is important for parents to be educated about the antiplatelet function of aspirin, and to report increased bruising, bleeding, or unexplained rashes and to inform other medical caregivers of the child’s aspirin usage.</p>
<p>The spectrum of neurologic involvement reported with Sturge-Weber Syndrome varies widely.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812463607">4</xref>
</sup> Final clinical neurologic scores indicated that most subjects displayed no visual field cuts or intermittent motor posturing/hemiparesis and had reasonably well-controlled seizures over the last 6 months. The cognitive function of most patients was mildly affected as well. Overall, a majority of Sturge-Weber syndrome patients on low-dose aspirin therapy were doing well both in terms of academics (attending regular schools with tutoring/assistance) and motor abilities (able to swim, ride a bike, or participate in dance/recreational sports). Their epilepsy was also sufficiently controlled and surgery was not pursued.</p>
<p>All 5 of the subjects with bilateral brain involvement had worsening cognitive function neurologic scores over time, despite being on low-dose aspirin. This is not unexpected, as subjects with bilateral brain involvement do have worsening cognitive function in previous studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812463607">3</xref>
</sup> Worsening of cognitive function was also seen in a subset of the unilateral subjects; however, many subjects were infants when first seen and cognitive issues may become more apparent as children age. In addition, the cognitive function subscores reported here are more encouraging than in the literature. Many reports describe the number of Sturge-Weber syndrome patients suffering from intellectual disability (mental retardation) at 50% to 60%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812463607">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812463607">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812463607">13</xref>
</sup> In the data presented here, 80% of subgroup 2 subjects had cognitive function subscores labeled “good.” Although the cognitive function subscore of the neurologic score is not a direct measure of IQ, a prior study showed correlation between the total neurologic score and adaptive functioning of Sturge-Weber syndrome patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812463607">9</xref>
</sup> Low-dose aspirin may contribute to improved cognitive outcomes; however, more research is needed.</p>
<p>Most (91%) of the subjects on low-dose aspirin had good final seizure scores (either no seizures in the last 6 months, or breakthrough seizures within the last 6 months but not monthly seizures). This was in an improvement from 83% at the first seizure score. This is a very high percentage compared to previous reports of Sturge-Weber syndrome patients with seizures not on low-dose aspirin. Pascual-Castroviejo reports 38% of patients achieved “satisfactory” seizure control without surgery (n = 47), and Kramer reports 50% of nonsurgical subjects with “high seizure frequency” (n = 10).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812463607">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812463607">15</xref>
</sup> This data provides further evidence that low-dose aspirin may be helpful in patients with Sturge-Weber Syndrome and epilepsy.</p>
<p>Twenty-four subjects were recommended to start on low-dose aspirin at their last visit to the Sturge-Weber Syndrome Center, but did not follow up at the clinic or were not able to be contacted for follow-up questions. We do not know if these subjects started aspirin therapy, if they had side effects or complications, or how they responded to the treatment. It is possible that they did not do well and did not return to this center. The majority of these subjects came from outside the mid-Atlantic region; the most likely reason for lack of follow-up is distance. Another limitation is referral bias. The Sturge-Weber Syndrome Center is a tertiary care center and subjects seen here likely have a higher disease severity than the general population. Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare disease and our sample size is the largest series of subjects with Sturge-Weber syndrome treated with low-dose aspirin. We also did not look specifically at the effects of anticonvulsant regimes; all patients in the database are on combined therapy with 1 or more anticonvulsant. Typical anticonvulsants utilized include oxcarbazepine and levetiracetam at moderate to high dosage (40 and 55 mg/kg/d, respectively). The data presented here reflect not only the impact of low-dose aspirin but its combination with anticonvulsants tolerated and maximally effected for particular subjects. Finally, we did not check aspirin levels, and doing so in the future may further assist the management of subjects who demonstrate an inadequate clinical response.</p>
<p>This study summarizes the clinical experience of Sturge-Weber patients at the Hunter Nelson Sturge-Weber Center. Unlike the Internet-based questionnaire, this series encompassed clinical records for children with Sturge-Weber syndrome and information obtained by physicians rather than parents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812463607">5</xref>
</sup> Similar to that survey-based study, we found low-dose aspirin was well tolerated in Sturge-Weber syndrome patients as young as 1 month old. The effects of low-dose aspirin on seizure frequency and cognitive function are complicated by the natural progression of the disease as each subject ages; conclusions regarding these data are less clear. However, comparison of the follow-up data of the low-dose aspirin-treated population presented here to published descriptions of other Sturge-Weber syndrome populations suggests that those treated with a combination of low-dose aspirin and anticonvulsants may have better outcomes in terms of seizure frequency and cognitive disability than what has been reported. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of low-dose aspirin’s effect and how to optimize its use in Sturge-Weber syndrome. In addition, investigation into the safety and efficacy of other antiplatelet agents (such as clopidogrel) might reveal whether these agents can be used instead of/in conjunction with low-dose aspirin in certain cases.</p>
