<abstract>
<p>Competing risks data arise naturally in medical research, when subjects under study are at risk of more than one mutually exclusive event such as death from different causes. The competing risks framework also includes settings where different possible events are not mutually exclusive but the interest lies on the first occurring event. For example, in HIV studies where seropositive subjects are receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), treatment interruption and switching to a new HAART regimen act as competing risks for the first major change in HAART. This article introduces competing risks data and critically reviews the widely used statistical methods for estimation and modelling of the basic (estimable) quantities of interest. We discuss the increasingly popular Fine and Gray model for subdistribution hazard of interest, which can be readily fitted using standard software under the assumption of administrative censoring. We present a simulation study, which explores the robustness of inference for the subdistribution hazard to the assumption of administrative censoring. This shows a range of scenarios within which the strictly incorrect assumption of administrative censoring has a relatively small effect on parameter estimates and confidence interval coverage. The methods are illustrated using data from HIV-1 seropositive patients from the collaborative multicentre study CASCADE (Concerted Action on SeroConversion to AIDS and Death in Europe).</p>

<sec id="sec1-0962280210394479"><title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>In cohort studies and clinical trials, interest frequently focuses on time to event, otherwise known as survival, data. For example, in natural history studies of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), the focus is often on factors affecting the distribution of time from HIV seroconversion to the onset of clinical AIDS or death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0962280210394479">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0962280210394479">2</xref></sup> The basic quantities characterising the distribution of time to an event are the corresponding density function, the cumulative distribution function, the hazard and the survival function. Established methods for estimating and modelling these include the Kaplan–Meier estimator of the survival function and the Cox proportional hazards model for the hazard function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0962280210394479">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0962280210394479">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Competing risks data are encountered in studies where the subjects under study are at risk for more than one mutually exclusive event or failure cause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0962280210394479">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0962280210394479">6</xref></sup> For example, in studies of cardiovascular disease mortality, patients can either die from cardiovascular diseases or from other causes (e.g. cancer).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0962280210394479">7</xref></sup> The term ‘competing risks’ also refers to data where the possible events are not mutually exclusive but the interest lies in time to the first event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0962280210394479">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0962280210394479">9</xref></sup> For example, in HIV seropositive subjects receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), treatment interruption (TI) and switching to a new HAART regimen act as competing risks for the first major change in HAART.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0962280210394479">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the past, competing risks studies aimed to draw inferences about the distribution of time to a specific event in the hypothetical situation where the other events were absent. However, the distribution of time to a specific event if the other events were absent cannot be estimated from the observed data without making strong and untestable assumptions. More recently, competing risks data analysis has focused on quantities estimable from the data, like the instantaneous failure rate for a specific event under the presence of all other events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0962280210394479">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0962280210394479">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0962280210394479">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0962280210394479">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article introduces competing risks data and critically reviews the widely used statistical methods for estimation and modelling of the basic (estimable) quantities of interest. While the main focus is Cox-type models, we also briefly discuss some broader issues which frequently arise in this area. To illustrate the various approaches, we use data from a collaborative cohort study of HIV-1 infected individuals with well-estimated HIV-1 seroconversion dates, known as Concerted Action on SeroConversion to AIDS and Death in Europe (CASCADE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0962280210394479">12</xref></sup> The main focus of the analyses presented in this review is to describe the incidence of TI and to investigate its predictors. Full details are presented elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0962280210394479">10</xref></sup> The study population consists of all subjects (followed up until 2003) who initiated a stable (for at least 90 days) first-line HAART regimen at least 1 year after their seroconversion date. Switching to a new HAART regimen (NH) was the competing event to TI.</p>
<p>This article is organised as follows: In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-0962280210394479">Section 2</xref>, we present the basic theory about competing risks data. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-0962280210394479">Section 3</xref> concerns the analysis of competing risks data, including estimation, regression modelling and software references. A simulation study is reported in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec11-0962280210394479">Section 4</xref>.

<sec id="sec2-0962280210394479"><title>2 Basic theory for competing risks analysis</title>
<p>Two broad approaches can be taken to modelling competing risks data. The older approach to competing risks assumes the existence of <italic>k</italic> latent failure times, one for each possible type of failure. In studies where competing risks are present, we only observe the minimum of the latent failures times (<italic>T</italic>) and the corresponding cause of failure (<italic>C</italic>). The basic problem with this approach is that neither the joint distribution of the failure times nor the corresponding marginal distributions are identifiable from the observed data without additional assumptions (such as independence of the different latent failure times).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0962280210394479">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0962280210394479">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0962280210394479">13</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0962280210394479">15</xref></sup> Even worse, such assumptions are not testable. More discussion on this issue can be found elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0962280210394479">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0962280210394479">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0962280210394479">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second and more recent approach to competing risks considers the joint distribution of failure time <italic>T</italic> and cause of failure <italic>C</italic>, two observable random variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0962280210394479">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0962280210394479">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0962280210394479">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0962280210394479">11</xref></sup> Taking this approach, we define the <italic>j</italic>th cause-specific hazard at time <italic>t</italic> by
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0962280210394479"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394479-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>This quantity represents the instantaneous failure rate from cause <italic>j</italic> at time <italic>t</italic> in the presence of all other possible causes of failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0962280210394479">4</xref></sup> It should be noted that the overall hazard <italic>λ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), i.e. the hazard function of any cause of failure, is equal to the sum of the cause-specific hazards over each failure type. This holds by the additivity axiom of probability for pairwise disjoint events and, thus, does not require further assumptions. If <italic>d<sub>ic</sub></italic> is the indicator that subject <italic>i</italic> has failed from cause <italic>c</italic> and <italic>t<sub>i</sub></italic> the minimum of event time or censoring time of the <italic>i</italic>th subject, the likelihood function for hazard parameters <italic>β</italic> under independent right censoring and without further assumptions is:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0962280210394479">4</xref></sup>

</p>
<p>Since the likelihood is a function of the cause-specific hazards, these quantities, as well as functions of them, are estimable from the data.</p>
<p>The probability of failure from cause <italic>j</italic> before time <italic>t</italic> in the presence of all other possible causes is known as cumulative incidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0962280210394479">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0962280210394479">17</xref></sup> and can be defined as a function of the cause-specific hazards for all causes of failure:

<sec id="sec4-0962280210394479"><title>3.1 Cumulative incidence estimation</title>
<p>The cumulative incidence function (CIF) (2) can be estimated by the non-parametric plug-in estimator:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0962280210394479">18</xref></sup>

Thus, <inline-formula id="ilm3-0962280210394479"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math3-0962280210394479"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mi>∧</mml:mi></mml:mover><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> overestimates, in general, the cumulative incidence of the cause <italic>j</italic>. In fact, it is possible for the sum of the naïve estimates of the cumulative incidence at time <italic>t</italic> over all possible causes to be greater than 1, which should be impossible as this sum is the cumulative probability for failure from any cause. The naïve estimator estimates correctly the cumulative incidence in the hypothetical situation where failures from competing causes have been eliminated (i.e. assuming that failure from other causes is not possible) and the cause-specific hazard of interest does not change after this elimination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0962280210394479">17</xref></sup> More methods and details on cumulative incidence estimation and hypothesis testing procedures can be found elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0962280210394479">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0962280210394479">17</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0962280210394479">21</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec5-0962280210394479"><title>3.1.1 CASCADE example</title>
<p>In the CASCADE dataset described above, both the naïve and the proper estimators were used to estimate the cumulative incidence for TI and switching to a new HAART regimen. Of the 1551 subjects included in the analysis, 299 (19.3%) had a TI, 283 (18.2%) started NH and 969 (62.5%) neither interrupted nor switched to a new HAART regimen throughout their follow-up. In total, 98 patients died during the follow-up, 58 of whom prior to experiencing a TI or a NH. For these 58 patients, follow-up was censored at the date of death. For our illustration purposes, we consider only the two competing events TI and NH. This implicitly assumes the cause-specific hazard of death is zero. If desired, a further analysis could relax this assumption by allowing death as a third competing event. The cumulative incidence estimates for both TI and NH, as the first major change in HAART, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0962280210394479">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-0962280210394479" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Cumulative incidence (CI) estimates of TI (black lines) and 1-CI estimates of switching to a NH regimen (grey lines) from the naïve (1-KM) and proper CI estimator.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394479-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It is clear that, as expected, the naïve estimator systematically overestimates the CIF for both events. Using the valid estimator, the cumulative incidence of TI or of switching to a NH at 4 years were 26.7% and 25.0%, respectively. The corresponding figures based on 1-KM estimator were 31.5% and 29.5%, respectively. In fact, the difference between the two estimators may at least partly explain the differences in the published results regarding cumulative incidence of TI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0962280210394479">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0962280210394479">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0962280210394479">23</xref></sup> Note that in our example, only 37.5% of the patients experience one of the two competing events. The difference between the two estimators can be larger when the hazard of the competing risk is higher. In general, the cumulative incidence of a TI will be low if the cumulative incidence of a NH is high since the sum of the two quantities cannot exceed 1. Therefore, to understand competing risks data, the cumulative incidences of each competing risk should be considered simultaneously.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0962280210394479"><title>3.2 Modelling cause-specific hazards</title>
<p>To investigate factors that may affect the instantaneous failure rate from a specific cause in the presence of all the others, a competing risks analogue of the Cox proportional hazards model seems a reasonable choice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0962280210394479">24</xref></sup> A semiparametric proportional hazards model for the cause-specific hazard function can be defined as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula6-0962280210394479"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394479-eq6.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>In practice, such a model can be estimated by treating observations with failures from all other causes but <italic>j</italic> as censored and fitting a Cox proportional hazards model on the resulting data using any standard statistical package. As it has been pointed out,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0962280210394479">4</xref></sup> this procedure does not require independence of latent failure times (or any other similar untestable assumption). A thorough review on extension of Cox-type models to competing risks can be found in Andersen and Borgan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0962280210394479">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the common approach is to fit separate models, one for each cause, it is possible to simultaneously fit cause-specific hazard models for all causes, and to test the equality of the effects of covariates on different failure modes, through a data augmentation method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0962280210394479">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0962280210394479">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0962280210394479">26</xref></sup> To use this approach, one has to reshape data in ‘long format’, so that each subject has <italic>k</italic> records, one for each possible failure type. A failure indicator taking the value of one in the record corresponding to the actual failure cause of each subject and zero otherwise has to be generated. Similarly, for each covariate of interest, <italic>k</italic> type-specific covariates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0962280210394479">27</xref></sup> must be defined, such that the <italic>j</italic>th type-specific covariate takes the value of the initial covariate in the record corresponding to the <italic>j</italic>th cause of failure and zero in the remaining records of each individual. More details on this method can be found in Putter et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0962280210394479">8</xref></sup> There are two approaches to fitting the cause-specific hazards model. The first is to stratify by failure type, which gives identical estimates to those obtained by fitting separate proportional hazards models for each failure cause. The second is to include failure type as a covariate, which assumes proportional baseline hazards between the different failure types. It must be noted though that the latter assumption may not be appropriate in many situations in biomedical research. In both approaches, the effect of a covariate on each failure type can be estimated by including in the model the corresponding type-specific covariates. Alternatively, it is possible to include in the model interaction terms of a covariate with failure type, in order to test the assumption of a common effect of the covariate on different failure types. If the assumption holds, efficiency is gained.</p>

<fn id="table-fn1-0962280210394479"><p>Results from fitting two separate models (Panel A), and using the data augmentation approach with (Panel B) and without (Panel C) stratification.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap></p>
<p>There is a statistically significant effect of gender on cause-specific hazard of TI. Based on the two separate models, the hazard of having a TI was 1.7 times higher in women than in men. However, there was no evidence that gender had an effect on cause-specific hazard of switching to a new HAART regimen (hazard ratio – HR: 0.98, 95%; C.I.: 0.71–1.35). As expected, the estimates from the stratified version of the augmentation method are identical to those from fitting separate models for each cause-specific hazard (HR of females <italic>vs</italic> males 1.70 for TI and 1.70 × 0.578 ≈ 0.98 for NH). The interaction term is highly significant as the gender effect on TI is different from that on NH. Under the unstratified model, there is no evidence for different baseline hazards among the two failure types (HR for NH/TI: 1.06, <italic>p</italic> = 0.546). Note though that this model assumes proportionality between the baseline cause-specific hazards of TI and NH and this assumption should be checked. For that, we plotted the logarithm of the cumulative baseline hazard for TI and NH, as estimated from the stratified model, <italic>versus</italic> the logarithm of analysis time (plot not shown). The two log-cumulative hazards are crossing each other suggesting that the proportionality assumption does not hold. Therefore, the stratified model is more appropriate for our data.</p>
<p>It is common practice to graph the effect of a covariate on the risk of an event. In the case of a single cause of failure, there is a one-to-one relationship between hazard and cumulative distribution. However, this does not hold in the case of competing risks data. That is because CIF is a function of all cause-specific hazards and a covariate may have different effects on the different cause-specific hazards. An increase in the CIF could be due to either a positive effect of a covariate on the corresponding cause-specific hazard or a negative effect on the cause-specific hazards of the competing events.</p>
<p>To better illustrate this phenomenon, we present results from an artificial example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0962280210394479">Figure 2</xref>. In this figure, cumulative incidence of TI is estimated based on the cause-specific hazards models given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0962280210394479">Table 1</xref> (Panel A). In the first sub-plot, the gender effect on the competing risk (NH) is equal to that estimated from the cause-specific hazard model given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0962280210394479">Table 1</xref> (Panel A) (and does not differ significantly from 0). In sub-plots 2(b)–(f), the gender effect on NH ranged from no effect (b_NH = 0) to a very strong effect (b_NH = 1.75 with women having higher hazard of NH than men), while the effect of gender on TI and the cause-specific baseline hazards remained constant. As the HR of TI for women/men is in all sub-plots 1.7, one could, naively, expect the cumulative incidence to be consistently higher for women than for men and the difference to increase over time. While this is so in the first two sub-plots (where the gender does not influence the competing risk), as the effect of gender on the competing risk increases, more women experience the competing NH event and thus cannot experience TI. Thus, the gender difference in the cumulative incidence of TI becomes smaller. In the extreme case (6th sub-plot), where the gender effect on the competing risk substantially exceeds that on TI (HR for NH is 3.4 times higher from that for TI), the two curves cross.

<p>This example clearly illustrates the point made by Putter et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0962280210394479">8</xref></sup> that the effect of a covariate on cumulative incidence depends on the effect of this covariate on the competing risks. This effect depends also on the baseline hazard of the competing risks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0962280210394479">8</xref></sup> although in our example, we do not illustrate this, since we hold the baseline hazard of the competing event constant. Given the complicated nature of the relationship between cause-specific hazards and CIF, they should be investigated simultaneously.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0962280210394479"><title>3.3 Modelling cumulative incidence</title>
<p>Cause-specific hazard functions, being instantaneous risk functions, do not quantify the overall benefit or harm of an exposure (e.g. treatment) to the patient. In several cases, modelling the cumulative incidence may be more relevant. Fine and Gray<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0962280210394479">28</xref></sup> proposed a framework for regression modelling with CIFs. Their method makes use of the subdistribution hazard,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0962280210394479">19</xref></sup> which is a function of the cumulative incidence for the corresponding cause of failure and can be defined as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula7-0962280210394479"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394479-eq7.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The difference from the cause-specific hazard (1) is that the risk set of the above hazard is not natural, since it includes at time <italic>t</italic> not only subjects who have not yet failed, but also subjects who have failed from other causes before <italic>t</italic>, and are not physically at risk at that time. In other words, patients who have failed from another than <italic>j</italic> cause remain in the risk set for <italic>j</italic>. Fine and Gray<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0962280210394479">28</xref></sup> proposed a semiparametric proportional hazards model for the subdistribution hazard of the event of interest:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula8-0962280210394479"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394479-eq8.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Based on this model, the CIF is
<disp-formula id="disp-formula9-0962280210394479"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394479-eq9.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Parameter estimation for this model depends on the right censoring mechanism. Consider first, the case when it is administrative. In this case, even for subjects who fail before the administrative censoring time, the censoring time is known. To estimate <italic>F<sub>j</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>;<italic>x</italic>) using such data, one can proceed as follows:
<list id="list1-0962280210394479" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>For subjects who fail from a competing cause (not <italic>j</italic>), replace their failure time by the administrative censoring time and treat them as censored.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using the resulting data, fit the standard Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the parameters of <italic>F<sub>j</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>;<italic>x</italic>).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Unfortunately, for general censoring at random, the time for which a patient who has failed from a competing event remains ‘at risk’ for cause <italic>j</italic> is not known. In this situation, Fine and Gray<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0962280210394479">28</xref></sup> proposed weighting by inverse probability of censoring (IPCW; inverse probability of censoring weighting).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0962280210394479">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, a potentially more accessible alternative based on multiple imputations (MIs) has been proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0962280210394479">30</xref></sup> The basic idea is that the unknown censoring times are imputed by random draws from the conditional censoring distribution given that censoring occurred after the failure from one of the competing events. For the imputation, the Kaplan–Meier estimates of the censoring distribution are obtained by treating censored observations as events and the actual events from any cause as censoring times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0962280210394479">31</xref></sup> These estimates are then used to impute the unknown censoring times for patients with competing events. The MI approach has an advantage over the IPCW method since it does not require special software. Finally, a third approach has just been proposed, which is based on a weighted product-limit estimator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0962280210394479">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>It must be pointed out that in most practical settings, censoring results not only from administrative study termination but also from other (independent of the outcomes) reasons, leading to random right censoring. As a result, random right censoring is encountered more frequently in medical research than pure administrative censoring.</p>
<sec id="sec9-0962280210394479"><title>3.3.1 CASCADE example (continued)</title>
<p>In the CASCADE data, we investigated the effect of gender on the cumulative incidence of TI and NH. As TI and NH are not terminating events, each individual’s censoring time was observed even in cases with competing events. Thus, we can assume administrative censoring. As a comparison, we also applied the IPCW method to account for random right censoring. Further, since calendar year of HAART initiation is related to censoring time, we also applied the IPCW method with different weights according to the calendar period of HAART initiation.

<p>In this example, results from modelling the subdistribution hazard function are similar to those obtained from modelling the cause-specific hazard function (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0962280210394479">Table 1</xref>), although, as we have previously shown in the artificial example presented in the last two paragraphs of <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6-0962280210394479">Section 3.2</xref>, this is not always the case. Briefly, the cumulative incidence of TI was higher for women than for men with the subdistribution HR (based on the administrative censoring approach) for women/men being 1.73 (95% C.I., 1.33–2.25). By contrast, the cumulative incidence of NH does not differ significantly by gender. Of the three methods used, that for administrative censoring can be considered adequate for these data since, as already mentioned, potential censoring times were known even for individuals experienced competing events. It is reassuring, though, that the differences between the three procedures are minimal. Although, if someone wished to perform the IPCW method, then the dependence of the censoring distribution on the calendar period of HAART initiation should have been taken into account (last method).</p>

<sec id="sec11-0962280210394479"><title>4 Sensitivity of inference to the assumption of administrative censoring in the Fine and Gray model</title>
<p>Given that estimation and inference for the subdistribution hazard is much simpler under administrative censoring, it is interesting to explore the effect of assuming administrative censoring when a more general censoring at random mechanism is operating. In general, this will depend on a number of factors, including the hazard of the censoring distribution, the total duration of the study and the fraction of the competing events.</p>
<p>Here, we report a simulation study in a setting with two competing failure events. Failure time and cause of failure were generated using models analogous to those used in Fine and Gray,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0962280210394479">28</xref></sup> but we only considered one covariate (either continuous following a standard normal distribution or binary following a Bernoulli distribution with probability of success equal to 0.4, depending on the scenario). A parameter <italic>p</italic> related to the probability of experiencing the cause of interest ranged from 0.3 to 0.7. More specifically, the cause of failure was simulated from
<disp-formula id="disp-formula10-0962280210394479"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394479-eq10.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Conditional on the cause, failure times were simulated from
<disp-formula id="disp-formula11-0962280210394479"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394479-eq11.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>This simulation setting results in the following proportional subdistribution hazards model for cause 1:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula12-0962280210394479"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394479-eq12.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The covariate effect on the failure type of interest was assumed to be 0.5 (log subdistribution HR), whereas the corresponding effect on the competing failure type was assumed to be either of similar magnitude and of same (<italic>β</italic> = 0.5) or opposite direction (<italic>β</italic> = −0.5) or stronger and of opposite direction (<italic>β</italic> = −1). Censoring times <italic>U<sub>i</sub></italic> were simulated from an exponential distribution with parameter <italic>θ</italic> that ranged from 0.2 (relative small rate of right censoring) to 4 (heavy right censoring). The total study duration <italic>d</italic> (i.e. the time from study initiation to study termination) was also a parameter ranging from 1 to 8 years depending on the scenario. The time from study initiation to entry of the subject <italic>i</italic>, <italic>W<sub>i</sub></italic>, was simulated from a <italic>U</italic>(0,1) distribution. It should be noted that time of entry of subject <italic>i</italic> was assumed to coincide with onset of the risk, so there was no left truncation. Based on the above, failure times were censored by min(<italic>U<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>d<sub>i</sub></italic>), where <italic>d<sub>i</sub></italic> was the administrative censoring time of subject <italic>i</italic> (i.e. <italic>d<sub>i</sub></italic> = <italic>d</italic> − <italic>W<sub>i</sub></italic>). The different scenarios were defined by combinations of the following parameter values:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula13-0962280210394479"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280210394479-eq13.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>For each of the 432 [=4 (total durations of the study) × 6 (hazards of the censoring distribution) × 3 (parameters related to the probability of the cause of interest) × 3 (log HRs for competing cause) × 2 (types of covariate <italic>x</italic>)] derived scenarios, we generated 1000 simulated datasets, each consisting of 1000 subjects.</p>
<p>In every dataset, we calculated the median administrative censoring time of subjects with the competing event and then we estimated the cumulative probability of being censored at this time (using all subjects and after treating censored observations as events and <italic>vice versa</italic>). This quantity could be a measure of the plausibility of administrative censoring assumption: if the cumulative probability of random censoring at the time of administrative termination of the study is high, then most subjects with competing events are expected to be randomly censored before study termination, and thus the administrative censoring assumption does not seem plausible, and <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p>
<p>Simulation results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0962280210394479">Figure 3</xref>. In general, the percentage of bias in the covariate effect, when assuming administrative censoring instead of using the IPCW method, was relatively small, remaining in absolute value below 20% in all scenarios. The extent of bias was not related to values of a particular factor, but rather to several working in combination. The largest biases were observed in scenarios with high hazard of censoring (heavy right censoring), long study duration, increased fraction of the competing event and strong and of opposite direction covariate effect on the competing event. In such cases, the percentage of bias ranged from −7.59% to 19.88% with the corresponding empirical coverage probabilities ranging from to 0.771 to 0.963. In scenarios where the estimated cumulative probability of censoring at the median administrative censoring time was below 0.5, regardless of values of the other factors, we found that the percentage of bias was smaller. In such scenarios, the corresponding biases and empirical coverage probabilities ranged from −3.16% to 6.37% and from 0.927 to 0.960, respectively.

<sec id="sec12-0962280210394479"><title>5 Concluding remarks</title>
<p>In competing risks settings, the key identifiable quantity is the cause-specific hazard, and functions thereof – such as the CIF. In contrast to modelling the latent failure times, inference for these quantities does not rest on inherently untestable assumptions. Despite the long history of the latent failure times approach and the efforts by several researchers to deal with the non-identifiably problem under specific circumstances,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0962280210394479">33</xref></sup> this approach does not seem very promising, at least from a practical perspective, at present.</p>
<p>The standard Cox proportional hazards model can be used to investigate the effect of a set of covariates on cause-specific hazards in competing risks settings. It has to be clear that cause-specific hazard models do not depend (as is sometimes, incorrectly, claimed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0962280210394479">34</xref></sup>) on untestable assumptions such as independence between the competing events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0962280210394479">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0962280210394479">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>While cause-specific hazard models are commonly used, modelling the CIF may be more relevant to clinical practice. The naïve estimator of one minus Kaplan–Meier overestimates the true CIF and is not interpretable in the competing risks setting. Therefore, it should not be used. Therefore, the proper non-parametric estimator should be preferred.</p>
<p>Unlike the one-cause-of-failure case, where there is a one-to-one relationship between the effect of a covariate on the hazard and on the cumulative incidence, in the competing risks settings a one-to-one relationship does not exist. In fact, the effect of a covariate may be quite different on the two quantities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0962280210394479">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0962280210394479">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0962280210394479">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0962280210394479">37</xref></sup> In extreme cases, the effect of a covariate on cumulative incidence may be the reverse of that on the corresponding cause-specific hazard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0962280210394479">38</xref></sup> Nevertheless, it has been shown that the effect of a covariate on a cause-specific hazard is, in general, in good agreement with that on the corresponding cumulative incidence if there is no effect of the covariate on the competing events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0962280210394479">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0962280210394479">40</xref></sup> This corresponds to what we saw in our example: the gender effect was of similar magnitude on both the cause-specific hazard and the cumulative incidence of TI, while it did not significantly affect the cause-specific hazard or cumulative incidence of NH.</p>
<p>The Fine and Gray model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0962280210394479">28</xref></sup> allows direct modelling of the cumulative incidence, and has recently markedly increased in popularity. However, estimation of this model under the usual random right censoring requires IPCW, which can only be applied in some, but not all, standard, widely used statistical software. By contrast, a new proposal based on MIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0962280210394479">30</xref></sup> can be relatively easily implemented in most standard software. Additional advantage of this MI approach when modelling the cumulative incidence is that it handles special situations (e.g. stratified or clustered analysis) relatively straightforwardly. Both approaches allow taking into account possible dependence of the censoring distribution on a set of variables. The most recent method for fitting the Fine and Gray model under random right censoring, which is based on a weighted product-limit estimator,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0962280210394479">32</xref></sup> requires software that allows for time-dependent weights.</p>
<p>Although random right censoring is common in biomedical settings, one possible approach to simplify the analysis is to assume that all observed censoring is administrative and include in the risk set all subjects who failed from competing causes up to their administrative censoring time. This has the practical advantage that the Fine and Gray model can then be readily fitted using any software that fits the Cox proportional hazards model. Clearly, this assumption comes at a price in terms of bias and confidence interval coverage. Our simulation study indicates a range of scenarios within which the strictly incorrect assumption of administrative censoring has a relatively small effect on parameter estimates and confidence interval coverage. This is particularly so, when the estimated (cumulative) probability of censoring at the median administrative censoring time (i.e. median time from enrolment to study termination) is smaller than 0.5. While our simulation study represents a range of plausible practical settings, further work is needed before the results can be interpreted more broadly. In particular, we have only examined the case where the censoring distribution is independent of other variables. Moreover, we have focused on subdistribution HRs, but not the underlying baseline hazard. Since censoring observed competing events at their administrative censoring times tends to artificially increase the risk sets, the corresponding baseline subdistribution hazard will likely be underestimated. This is of greatest concern when prediction is the focus of inference. Also, we have not investigated the performance of this approach under plausible model misspecification settings neither compared its performance to that of the other (more proper) approaches.</p>
<p>In many studies, time-varying covariates are a focus of inference. Such time-varying covariates come in two forms. External, or exogenous, time-dependent covariates are changing over time independently of the subject’s vital status. Typical examples include age, calendar year and independent of the subject’s behaviour environmental conditions. By contrast, internal or indigenous, time-dependent covariates – such as a biological marker – typically require the subject’s survival in order to exist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0962280210394479">4</xref></sup> External time-dependent covariates can be incorporated in the proportional cause-specific hazards as well as in the Fine and Gray model (although estimation in the latter model is less straightforward in the case of continuous covariates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0962280210394479">32</xref></sup>). Internal time-dependent covariates on the other hand, can only be incorporated in the proportional cause-specific hazards model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0962280210394479">41</xref></sup> However, when this is done, it is not possible to proceed to predict the CIF based on the cause-specific hazards estimates and using (2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0962280210394479">41</xref></sup> To see why, consider the analogous classical survival analysis setting. Here, models for the hazard function which include internal time-dependent covariates cannot be used to predict the cumulative probability of failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0962280210394479">4</xref></sup> A recent proposal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0962280210394479">42</xref></sup> which allows considering internal time-dependent covariates in the subdistribution hazard framework, offers a useful, from a practical perspective, synopsis of separate cause-specific hazard analyses.</p>
<p>To have a better understanding of the competing risks, cause-specific hazards and CIFs for all possible events should be investigated simultaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0962280210394479">43</xref></sup> However, notice that while the cause-specific hazards and the Fine and Gray model both assume proportional hazards, these assumptions cannot both be true in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0962280210394479">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0962280210394479">42</xref></sup> Model misspecification in the competing risks setting has been explored by several authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0962280210394479">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0962280210394479">44</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0962280210394479">46</xref></sup> and an explicit (though complicated) relationship between subdistribution hazard and cause-specific hazard has been derived.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0962280210394479">47</xref></sup> Nevertheless, even if one of the cause-specific hazard models or the subdistribution hazard models are expected to be misspecified in general, parameter estimates can be seen, in both types of models, as time-averaged log HRs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0962280210394479">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0962280210394479">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0962280210394479">46</xref></sup> Additionally, including interactions of covariates with functions of time in proportional hazards models is a useful approach for dealing with non-proportionality and may also contribute to a better understanding of the phenomena under study. Of course, in some settings, the proportional hazards models may not be biologically plausible and that additive hazards or additive probability models may be more relevant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0962280210394479">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this review, we focused on semiparametric models for the cause-specific hazard and subdistribution hazard since they do not rely on distributional assumptions and thus are flexible. Further, most of these models can be conveniently fitted in standard software. However, parametric models could be used to gain efficiency especially with small samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0962280210394479">49</xref></sup> Jeong and Fine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0962280210394479">50</xref></sup> have proposed a parametric regression method for the cumulative incidence that uses a two-parameter Gompertz distribution to parameterise the baseline distribution. In contrast to non-parametric or semiparametric methods for the cumulative incidence, this method enables estimation of the long-term probability of experiencing a specific event. In general, when performing a parametric analysis, it may be useful to cross check results with those obtained from non-parametric or semiparametric methods to assess the fit of the chosen parametric form.</p>
<p>A frequent complication in competing risks studies is that the actual cause of failure is unknown for some subjects. Since missingness cannot be considered as ‘completely at random’ in many practical situations, it is not advisable to discard the corresponding subjects from the analysis. Instead, proper techniques for missing data should be applied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0962280210394479">51</xref></sup> The proposed methods for competing risks analysis under partially observed causes of failure assume these are missing at random. Further methodological work on this issue could usefully focus on sensitivity analysis for non-ignorable missingness, where the probability of missingness is related to the unobserved cause of failure. Another issue is that some individuals may not be under observation from the onset of risks as they may have been recruited into the study at a later stage. This phenomenon is known as left truncation. The proportional cause-specific hazards and also the Fine and Gray model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0962280210394479">32</xref></sup> can deal with independent left truncation (i.e. when entry time and risk of failure are independent) in the same way as in classical survival analysis. However, lack of independence (dependent left truncation or late entry bias) can lead to seriously biased effect estimates, just as in classical survival analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0962280210394479">52</xref></sup> As a result, further methodological research on this issue is crucial.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we would like to stress that the analysis of competing risks data should be focused on identifiable quantities like the cause-specific hazard and the CIF, in order to avoid the inherently untestable assumptions associated with latent failure time modelling. Cox-type models for both quantities have been extensively used in practice, mainly due to the fact that they do not depend on distributional assumptions, but also because they can be easily fitted in common statistical packages. To have a clearer picture of the data, simultaneous investigation of both the cause-specific hazards and the CIFs is advisable. Model misspecification and complications which arise frequently in medical research, such as missing cause of failure and left truncation, should be carefully explored, to avoid misleading inferences being drawn. The ubiquity of competing risks data should act as a spur to further methodological work on these issues.</p>
