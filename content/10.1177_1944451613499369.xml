<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To provide a general descriptive account and review of the literature regarding the use of dexmedetomidine for sedation during fiberoptic bronchscopic (FOB) intubation. <italic>Data Source</italic>. A computerized bibliographic search of the literature regarding dexmedetomidine for FOB intubation. <italic>Main Results</italic>. Several anecdotal reports describe the use of dexmedetomidine to provide sedation during FOB intubation. Additionally, 7 prospective trials were identified. These prospective trials demonstrate the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in providing sedation during FOB intubation of the airway. In a placebo-controlled trial with midazolam used as the rescue medication, dexmedetomidine decreased the need for rescue midazolam and the combination of the 2 agents was better than midazolam alone. When compared with propofol, there were fewer airway and respiratory issues as well as improved patient comfort with dexmedetomidine. Although dexmedetomidine was found to be better than fentanyl, there was a higher incidence of adverse hemodynamic effects. Although dexmedetomidine was inferior to remifentanil, the study used a lower loading dose of dexmedetomidine than other studies (0.4 vs 1.0 µg/kg). Despite its efficacy, adverse hemodynamic effects were noted. In many cases, the incidence was higher with dexmedetomidine than the comparator agent. In all reported cases, these were corrected with the administration of atropine, a vasoactive medication (phenylephrine or ephedrine), and/or fluid. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. The present literature clearly reports the advantage of using dexmedetomidine to decrease the risk of adverse respiratory effects, including airway obstruction. However, there remain unanswered questions about dexmedetomidine for sedation during FOB intubation of the airway including dosing regimens for both the bolus and infusion, techniques to limit the potential for adverse hemodynamic effects, and whether it should be the sole agent or used in combination with another agent.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dexmedetomidine (Precedex, Hospira Worldwide Inc, Lake Forest, IL), the pharmacologically active dextro isomer of medetomidine, exerts its physiologic effects through α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors. Dexmedetomidine, relative to clonidine, has a high ratio of specificity for the α<sub>2</sub> versus the α<sub>1</sub> receptor (1600:1 vs 200:1 for clonidine) making it a complete agonist at the α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor. Stimulation of parasympathetic outflow from central nervous system and inhibition of sympathetic outflow from the <italic>locus cereleus</italic> produces sedation and anxiolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451613499369">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451613499369"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451613499369">3</xref></sup> Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the sedative response of dexmedetomidine has been shown to parallel that which is seen with natural sleep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451613499369">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451613499369">5</xref></sup> Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies demonstrate that dexmedetomidine induces a qualitatively similar pattern of c-fos expression in sleep-promoting brain nuclei of rats as that seen during non–rapid eye movement sleep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451613499369">5</xref></sup> At the appropriate dexmedetomidine dose, patients are adequately sedated and easily aroused to follow commands, though patients will be unarouseable at higher doses. Previous studies have demonstrated sedation with dexmedetomidine is comparable to stage 2 non–rapid eye movement sleep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451613499369">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451613499369">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1999, dexmedetomidine initially received approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the short-term (less than 24 hours) provision of sedation for adult patients in the ICU setting who were receiving mechanical ventilation with endotracheal intubation. More recently, in 2009, dexmedetomidine received FDA approval for monitored anesthesia care in adults. Although used predominantly for sedation in the ICU patient, non-ICU applications have included novel applications in the arena of procedural sedation. In the area of procedural sedation, reported advantages include improved efficacy with limited effects on respiratory function when compared with other commonly used agents including benzodiazepines, opioids and propofol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451613499369">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451613499369"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451613499369">10</xref></sup> Despite the initial enthusiasm for the use of dexmedetomidine as an agent for procedural sedation, subsequent studies in both the pediatric and adult population questioned its efficacy especially for painful procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451613499369">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451613499369"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451613499369">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>When confronted with the patient with a potentially difficult airway, fiberoptic bronchoscopic (FOB) intubation remains a useful technique to facilitate tracheal intubation under direct vision. Although topical anesthesia of the airway is of paramount importance in ensuring success, some degree of anxiolysis is frequently necessary and may be beneficial. When considering the options for the agent to be used, dexmedetomidine appears to offer the advantages outlined above, including achieving adequate sedation yet maintaining a patient who can be aroused and cooperate with the procedure as necessary. Additionally, given its limited effects on respiratory function, clinically significant respiratory depression or upper airway obstruction is unlikely, particularly when using lower doses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451613499369">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451613499369"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451613499369">17</xref></sup> Dexmedetomidine infusion also carries the disadvantage of cardiovascular depression, relatively slow onset, and longer duration of action compared to other sedatives,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1944451613499369">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1944451613499369"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1944451613499369">21</xref></sup> as well as being more expensive.

<title>Dexmedetomidine and Fiberoptic Intubation of the Trachea (Retrospective Data)</title>
<p>Much of the literature regarding the use of dexmedetomidine for sedation during management of the difficult airway, including FOB intubation, has appeared in the literature as single case reports or small case series (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1944451613499369">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1944451613499369">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1944451613499369"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1944451613499369">36</xref></sup> The significant findings are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1944451613499369">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1944451613499369">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1944451613499369">3</xref> based on age of population and combination with other anesthetics. As a whole these anecdotal reports demonstrate the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in these scenarios for approximately 30 adult patients and 3 children. When assessed, the dexmedetomidine infusion provided a Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) indicative of deep sedation during the procedure with minimal patient response as well as limited to no coughing with placement of the endotracheal tube. In the majority of the cases, the sedation was supplemented by effective anesthesia of the airway using some combination of topical anesthetic agents and airway blocks. An anticholinergic agent (glycopyrrolate) was administered to provide drying of airway secretions in several of the reports. Dosing regimens for dexmedetomidine in general included a bolus dose of 0.5 to 1.0 µg/kg administered over 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 0.3-0.7 µg/kg/h. In a limited number of cases, no bolus dose was administered and sedation provided by the initiation of the infusion. The majority of patients, who were asked, reported amnesia, though this was not assessed systematically in many cases. Existing literature evaluated memory recall as a main objective and the results do suggest a relatively higher plasma concentration required to achieve amnesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451613499369">15</xref></sup> This dosing may be considered if amnesia is imperative when adjunctive doses of a benzodiazepine (midazolam) are not administered preoperatively or concurrently with dexmedetomidine. The need for amnesia must be weighed against the inherent risks of a greater incidence of hemodynamic effects when higher dosing regimens are used.</p>

<p>In a small number of the cases, ketamine or midazolam was administered along with dexmedetomidine, in an effort to ensure amnesia or provide additional analgesia and sedation. When necessary, the infusion was discontinued following the procedure, and an adequate neurologic examination could be obtained. In the majority of cases, no clinically significant adverse effects on hemodynamic or respiratory function were noted. However, isolated reports demonstrated occasional episodes of hypotension. Of note, Abdelmalak et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1944451613499369">25</xref></sup> in their series of 5 patients, reported hypotension (mean arterial pressure reduction of 27% to 48% from baseline) in 4 patients with 2 of them requiring pharmacologic treatment with phenylephrine and/or ephedrine.</p>
<p>Additional retrospective information is provided by a large case series involving the use of dexmedetomidine sedation over a 10-month period during 20 FOB intubations in 19 adult patients with cervical spine myelopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1944451613499369">37</xref></sup> The patients ranged in age from 42 to 88 years. Premedication including fentanyl (50-150 µg, n = 13) and/or midazolam (0.5-3.0 mg, n = 13) was administered in 18 of the 20 cases. Glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg) was administered in 7 cases. Dexmedetomidine was administered as a loading dose of 1 µg/kg was administered over 10 minutes in the operating room. During this time, topical anesthesia of the airway was achieved with 4% lidocaine administered by an atomizer or spray. If endotracheal intubation had not been accomplished during the 10 minute period while the loading dose was being administered, a dexmedetomidine infusion was started at 0.2-0.7 µg/kg/h. Endotracheal intubation was successful in all 20 cases without respiratory depression or airway obstruction. The time to intubation and the number of attempts was not provided. Hypotension developed in 13 patients and required therapy with either phenylephrine or ephedrine. In 1 patient, the hypotension was refractory to treatment with these agents and a single bolus dose of epinephrine (10 µg) was administered.</p>
<p>The authors recommended close monitoring of hemodynamic function especially in patients with cervical spine disease given the potential deleterious effects of hypotension on spinal cord blood flow. Despite these issues, the authors suggest that the benefits of dexmedetomidine include its limited effects on respiratory function as well as its ability to provide a sedated patient who is able to respond to commands. The latter being important because it allows for the completion of a neurologic examination immediately following endotracheal intubation. Furthermore, for thoracoabdominal cases, where patients may be at risk to experience spinal cord ischemia, evidence exists showing dexmedetomidine may preserve neurologic function mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1944451613499369">38</xref></sup></p>

<title>Dexmedetomidine and Fiberoptic Intubation of the Trachea (Prospective Data)</title>
<p>Several prospective trials have evaluated the efficacy of dexmedetomidine for sedation during FOB intubation of the trachea. In a phase IIIb placebo-controlled trial, dexmedetomidine was compared with saline placebo in adults requiring FOB intubation of the airway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1944451613499369">39</xref></sup> The study cohort included a total of 105 patients, 55 of whom received dexmedetomidine. All the patients received glycopyrrolate (0.1 mg). Dexmedetomidine was administered as a bolus dose of 1 µg/kg over 10 minutes followed by 0.7 µg/kg/hour while an equivalent volume of saline was administered to the placebo group. Fifteen minutes after the start of the study drug, the patient’s level of sedation was assessed using the RSS and supplemental midazolam (0.5 mg bolus dose up to 0.2 mg/kg) was administered to achieve an RSS ≥2. Topical anesthesia of the airway was provided with lidocaine. Fewer patients who received dexmedetomidine required midazolam to maintain a RSS ≥2 (47.3% vs 86.0%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and the total amount of supplemental midazolam was lower (1.07 ± 1.5 mg vs 2.85 ± 3.0 mg, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). None of the patients in the dexmedetomidine group required a medication other than midazolam to complete the FOB intubation while 4 placebo patients required either fentanyl or propofol. More Mallampati class IV patients were successfully intubated without midazolam in the dexmedetomidine group than with placebo (66.7% vs 8.3%, <italic>P</italic> = .009). Blood pressure and heart rate were lower with dexmedetomidine than placebo patients sedated with midazolam. Satisfaction responses, adverse effects, and patient recall (60.8% vs 57.4%) were similar in the 2 groups. The most common adverse effects were hypotension (27.3%) with dexmedetomidine and hypertension (28%) and tachycardia (24%) with placebo.</p>
<p>Other investigators have prospectively compared dexmedetomidine to various sedative and analgesic agents for sedation during FOB intubation of the trachea. In a prospective trial of 40 patients, dexmedetomidine was compared with propofol administered via target-controlled infusion (TCI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1944451613499369">40</xref></sup> No premedication was administered and topical anesthesia of the airway was achieved with 6% cocaine for the nasopharynx and 2% to 4% lidocaine for the airway. Dexmedetomidine was administered as a loading dose of 1 µg/kg over 10 minutes without a subsequent infusion. Propofol was administered by TCI to achieve a plasma concentration of 3 µg/mL. The propofol infusion was adjusted in increments of 1 µg/mL according to patient comfort at 60-second intervals. FOB intubation was successful in all 40 patients requiring an average of 3.8 minutes with dexmedetomidine and 3.5 minutes with propofol. There were no differences in the intubation scores for cough or movement during the procedure; however, one patient in the propofol group responded significantly to the procedure and had the propofol infusion increased to achieve a plasma concentration of 5 µg/mL, which resulted in upper airway obstruction and hypoxemia (oxygen saturation 80%), which required bag-valve-mask ventilation. One patient in the dexmedetomidine group experienced gross motor movements of the extremities during the procedure and was given a single bolus dose of propofol (30 mg). Both the comfort score (scale of 1-5, 1 = favorable) during the procedure and the postintubation scores (scale of 1-3) were lower with dexmedetomidine than with propofol (2 vs 3, <italic>P</italic> = .027 and 1 vs 2, <italic>P</italic> = .014). Vocal cord movement during the procedure was less with dexmedetomidine. Airway obstruction was graded on a 1 to 3 scale (1 = patent airway, 2 = airway obstruction relieved by neck extension, and 3 = airway obstruction requiring jaw retraction). There was no evidence of airway obstruction in any of the 20 patients with dexmedetomidine versus 8 patients with dexmedetomidine (<italic>P</italic> = .007). Although recall for topicalization of the airway and the procedure were higher with dexmedetomidine compared with propofol, there was no difference in the patient satisfaction score. Hemodynamic support with either atropine or ephedrine was required in 3 patients who received dexmedetomidine versus none of those receiving propofol.</p>
<p>Kunisawa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1944451613499369">41</xref></sup> corroborated the findings of Tsai et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1944451613499369">40</xref></sup> and provided specific data using a TCI of dexmedetomidine in a cohort of 5 adult patients. No premedication was administered. Topical anesthesia of the airway was achieved with 8% lidocaine. The plasma concentration of dexmedetomidine was escalated in a stepwise fashion until the patients were able to tolerate the procedure. The dexmedetomidine infusion was targeted to achieve a plasma concentration of 0.35 to 0.70 ng/mL. The infusion was escalated every 3 to 5 minutes in accordance with the RSS. The time required to achieve successful endotracheal intubation varied from 25 to 37 minutes. The target dexmedetomidine concentration at the time of successful endotracheal intubation varied from 2.10 to 5.95 ng/mL, which the authors noted was higher than those required to achieve sedation in the ICU setting. The total amount of dexmedetomidine administered varied from 2.3 to 8.5 µg/kg. One limitation of this case series is a clear description of the actual dosing infusion range to achieve the reported plasma concentration is lacking. Ephedrine was administered to 1 patient for hypotension whereas 3 patients received nicardipine to treat hypertension during the TCI, but no clinically significant hemodynamic response was noted to endotracheal intubation.</p>
<p>Bergese et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1944451613499369">42</xref></sup> compared the efficacy of dexmedetomidine and midazolam versus midazolam alone in 55 adults requiring FOB intubation of the airway during nonemergency surgery. All patients received intravenous glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg) and topical local anesthesia of the airway. Midazolam was administered in incremental doses of 0.05 mg/kg to achieve an RSS ≥2. In the dexmedetomidine–midazolam group, midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) was administered followed by dexmedetomidine (1 µg/kg followed by 0.7 µg/kg/h) to achieve an RSS ≥2. The response to endotracheal intubation and the degree of sedation were assessed by 2 observers using the Observers’ Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S), comfort score, and RSS. The anesthesiologist also rated the ease of completion of the procedure. Although the OAS/S showed no difference between the 2 groups, patients who received the dexmedetomidine–midazolam combination were significantly calmer and more cooperative during FOB intubation than patients who received midazolam alone. Additionally, using a visual analogue scale (0-10, 10 = very satisfied), patients who received dexmedetomidine–midazolam were more satisfied with their sedation than patients who received only midazolam (9.19 ± 0.84 vs 4.80 ± 2.05, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). However, there was no difference in the incidence of recall for the procedure between the 2 groups.</p>
<p>Two additional studies compared dexmedetomidine with a primary opioid-based technique (remifentanil or fentanyl).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1944451613499369">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1944451613499369">44</xref></sup> Cattano et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1944451613499369">43</xref></sup> randomized patients to receive either remifentanil or dexmedetomidine. The final cohort for the study included 30 patients, 17 receiving remifentanil and 13 receiving dexmedetomidine. Standard premedication for both groups included midazolam (2 mg) and glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg) followed by topical anesthesia of the airway with 2% lidocaine. Dexmedetomidine dosing included a loading dose of 0.4 µg/kg over 10 minutes followed by an infusion at 0.7 µg/kg/h. Remifentanil dosing included a loading dose of 0.75 µg/kg over 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 0.075 µg/kg/min. Although the authors stated that there was no difference in hemodynamic or respiratory effects, including oxygen saturation and respiratory rates between the 2 groups, desaturation (pulse oximeter less than 90%) was noted in 6 of 17 patients (35%) sedated with remifentanil versus 2 of 13 (15%) patients sedated with dexmedetomidine. The onset of sedation defined as the time to achieve an RSS ≥3 was longer in the dexmedetomidine patients. After 1 minute, the RSS was ≥3 in the majority of remifentanil patients compared with only half of the dexmedetomidine patients. Likewise, remifentanil patients attained a bispectral index ≤80 more quickly than dexmedetomidine patients. The time for 50% of the patients to achieve a bispectral index ≤80 was 5 minutes with remifentanil versus 13 minutes with dexmedetomidine. Most important, endotracheal intubation was successful on the first attempt in 13 of 17 (76%) patients sedated with remifentanil versus 5 of 13 patients (38%) sedated with dexmedetomidine (<italic>P</italic> = .02). The authors concluded that the efficacy of the 2 drugs was “relatively similar” in providing sedation although the onset time was faster and the number of successful first intubation attempts was greater with remifentanil. They also noted that their study used a lower loading dose of dexmedetomidine which also could have accounted for the differences seen.</p>
<p>Different results were reported when evaluating a cohort of 30 adults who received a single bolus dose of either dexmedetomidine (1 µg/kg) or fentanyl (1 µg/kg) administered over 10 minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1944451613499369">44</xref></sup> No premedication was administered. Topical anesthesia of the airway was provided by spraying the oropharynx with 10% lidocaine and packing the nasopharynx with 6% cocaine. The ease of intubation and the postintubation score, judged by using a 1 to 5 scale, was better with dexmedetomidine (2 vs 3, <italic>P</italic> = .001 and 1 vs 2, <italic>P</italic> = .002). The heart rate was lower with dexmedetomidine while no difference was noted in blood pressure. The number of patients reporting amnesia to endoscopy (50% vs 0%) and to endotracheal intubation (100% vs 7%) was higher with dexmedetomidine. Two episodes of bradycardia and one of hypotension occurred in patients receiving dexmedetomidine. These were easily treated with atropine, ephedrine, and fluid administration.</p>
<p>The final and most recent study evaluated the effect of premedication with dexmedetomidine on propofol dose requirements for FOB intubation of the airway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1944451613499369">45</xref></sup> The cohort for the study included 46 patients ranging in age from 14 to 38 years with temporomandibular joint ankylosis presenting for gap arthroplasty. Half of the patients received a dexmedetomidine loading dose (1 µg/kg over 10 minutes) prior to a propofol infusion during the procedure while the remaining patients received only a propofol infusion. Topical airway anesthesia was achieved with lidocaine. The desired level of sedation was achieved easily in both groups with no difference in the procedure time. However, the procedure was better tolerated and there was less vocal cord movement in patients receiving dexmedetomidine. Additionally, total propofol requirements were significantly decreased by dexmedetomidine (65.5 ± 12.8 vs 138.45 ± 37.42 mg, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). This observation may be advantageous since previous reports have cited less favorable intubating conditions including the potential for a higher degree of airway obstruction with propofol infusion during FOB cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1944451613499369">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1944451613499369">47</xref></sup> The increase in heart rate and blood pressure during the procedure was also less in the patients who had received dexmedetomidine.</p>
<p>In general, these prospective trials demonstrate the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in providing sedation during FOB intubation of the airway. However, as noted in the retrospective series and case reports, adverse hemodynamic can occur. In all reported cases, these were corrected with the administration of atropine, a vasoactive medication (phenylephrine or ephedrine), and/or fluid. In rare cases, hypertension was noted during the loading dose. In the study using a TCI, the time to achieve the desired level of sedation was somewhat prolonged at 25 to 37 minutes. A longer onset time was also noted when comparing dexmedetomidine with remifentanil. In a placebo controlled trial with midazolam as the rescue medication, dexmedetomidine decreased the need for rescue midazolam and the combination of the 2 agents was better than midazolam alone. The latter was especially true in patients with a class IV airway. When compared with propofol, there were fewer airway and respiratory issues as well as improved patient comfort with dexmedetomidine. However, there was more recall and a greater need for temporary pharmacologic support of hemodynamic function when dexmedetomidine was used. When compared to the opioids, dexmedetomidine proved to be better than fentanyl, but again with a higher incidence of hemodynamic effects. Dexmedetomidine was perhaps not as good as remifentanil. However, the latter study used a lower loading dose of dexmedetomidine than other studies (0.4 vs 1 µg/kg).</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Dexmedetomidine (Precedex) is an α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist that shares physiologic similarities with clonidine. It is currently approved by the FDA for continuous infusions for up to 24 hours in adult ICU patients who are initially intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation and for the provision of monitored anesthesia care. To date, there are no FDA-approved indications for its use in the pediatric population. Over the past 4 to 5 years, its applications in the clinical practice of anesthesiology and critical care have increased in both the adult and pediatric population. As with any sedative agent, the potential exists for adverse end-organ effects with dexmedetomidine. Potential cardiovascular effects include bradycardia with rare reports of sinus pause or cardiac arrest. Hypotension has also been reported as well as hypertension, the latter postulated to be due to peripheral α<sub>2B</sub> adrenergic effects resulting in peripheral vasoconstriction. Hypotension and bradycardia occur more commonly during the initial loading dose, with higher doses, in the presence of comorbid cardiovascular disease, and when dexmedetomidine is coadministered with other medications that have negative chronotropic effects. Although generally easily treated by the administration of atropine, vasoactive agents or fluid, there are also rare reports in the literature of profound bradycardia, asystole, and cardiac arrest following the administration of dexmedetomidine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1944451613499369">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1944451613499369"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1944451613499369"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1944451613499369">52</xref></sup> These effects are most prominent in patients with comorbid cardiovascular diseases. Regardless of the scenario in which dexmedetomidine or any sedative agent is used, adherence to preparation and monitoring guidelines is suggested with ready access to medications to treat the potential adverse effects of bradycardia and hypotension. In the current report, we would speculate that the true incidence of bradycardia may have been decreased by the preadministration of glycopyrrolate to many of these patients.</p>
<p>When compared with other agents or combinations of agents used for procedural sedation, there appears to be a decreased potential to cause respiratory depression or upper airway compromise. This effect may be particularly beneficial in patients with compromised airways and explains the numerous reports of its use for sedation during fiberoptic intubation. None of the studies or case reports reviewed in this article reported any adverse effects on upper airway or respiratory function. However, there is evidence of volunteers experiencing upper airway obstruction at higher doses of dexmedetomidine in the supine position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451613499369">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to its limited effects on respiratory function, dexmedetomidine’s mechanism of sedation provides anxiolysis while maintaining a cooperative, responsive patient who is able to follow commands as needed. The latter may be beneficial not only during the procedure but also following endotracheal intubation, when an assessment of neurologic function is necessary prior to inducing general anesthesia. Agonism at α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors results in a sympatholytic effect that blunts the hemodynamic response to airway instrumentation and decreases airway secretions.</p>
<p>Dexmedetomidine is available as a 2 mL, 100 µg/mL solution, which can be diluted in 50 mL of saline to provide a 4 µg/mL solution. Dosing regimens for FOB intubation of the airway have generally included a loading dose of 1 µg/kg administered over 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 0.4 to 0.7 µg/kg/h. Given the brevity of the procedure, in specific circumstances, some of the reports used solely a loading dose. Although the loading dose may increase the incidence of on hemodynamic function adverse effects, omission of the loading dose and use of only an infusion may result in a prolonged time to achieve the desired level of sedation. Topical anesthesia of the airway is recommended and may greatly facilitate completion of the procedure. Anecdotal experience in a patient with a local anesthetic allergy demonstrates the feasibility of using dexmedetomidine without topical preparation of the airway.</p>
<p>Although generally effective as the sole agent for the FOB procedure, concerns have been raised with the efficacy of dexmedetomidine alone especially for painful or invasive procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451613499369">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451613499369"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451613499369">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1944451613499369">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1944451613499369">54</xref></sup> In some of the reports reviewed, dexmedetomidine was used following premedication with intravenous midazolam or in conjunction with propofol, midazolam, and in the pediatric population, ketamine. The benefits of adding ketamine to dexmedetomidine include speeding the onset time, offsetting the hemodynamic effects, and providing potent analgesia. Dexmedetomidine has been shown to prevent the emergence phenomena from ketamine apart from acting as an anti-sialogogue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1944451613499369">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>While lowering of the bispectral index has been noted with the administration of dexmedetomidine, the true amnestic properties of dexmedetomidine have not been thoroughly documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1944451613499369">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our synthesis of the dexmedetomidine FOB cases demonstrates the increasing prevelance of this method. The present literature clearly reports the advantage of using dexmedetomidine to decrease the risk of adverse respiratory effects, including airway obstruction. Although the literature is generally favorable, there remain unanswered questions about dexmedetomidine for sedation during fiberoptic intubation of the airway, including dosing regimens for both the bolus and infusion, techniques to limit the potential for adverse hemodynamic effects, and whether it should be the sole agent or used in combination with other agents. Future trials should consider an evaluation of the efficacy of dexmedetomidine alone versus dexmedetomidine combined with a low-dose remifentanil infusion, the benefits of the use of a benzodiazepine prior to the use of dexmedetomidine, or perhaps the combination of dexmedetomidine with ketamine. The latter may be advantageous in the pediatric population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1944451613499369">55</xref></sup></p>
