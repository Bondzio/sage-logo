<p>The subject of this book, the Victorian artist Richard Dadd (1817–86), will be familiar to historians of art and insanity. A product of the Royal Academy Schools, he looked set for a glittering career as a painter of fairies and fantasy, but the murder of his father in 1843 led to a life-time of confinement, first at Bethlem and from 1864 at Broadmoor. In 1974 Patricia Allderidge, Bethlem Royal Hospital Archivist, produced a catalogue for a major exhibition on Dadd at the Tate. As Nicholas Tromans, Senior Lecturer at London’s Kingston University, observes (p. 6), such was the detailed nature of Allderidge’s publication that only a handful of historians (most notably MacGregor in <italic>The Discovery of the Art of the Insane</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957154X12472612">1989</xref>) have been able to add to her research. But in <italic>Richard Dadd: The Artist and the Asylum</italic>, Tromans does precisely that, presenting an art historian’s perspective of Dadd’s <italic>oeuvre</italic> and placing it within the context of more recent research into the history of nineteenth-century psychiatry. Tromans offers us a ‘single case study’ which he hopes will ‘elucidate some of the more subtle interrelationships between medicine and Victorian culture’ (p. 7). The result is this very well-written, informative and beautifully illustrated publication.</p>
<p>The book traces Dadd’s life and career, beginning with his early years in Chatham and London, and examines some of his early illustrations and fairy paintings such as <italic>Puck</italic> (1841) and <italic>Titania Sleeping</italic> (1841). Tromans provides a detailed narrative of Dadd’s 1842–3 tour of Europe and the Near East in the company of Sir Thomas Phillips, during which the artist’s behaviour underwent a marked change. On 28 August 1843, shortly after his return to England, Dadd murdered his father at Cobham Park, Surrey, in the belief that he was a demon. Escaping to France, he was arrested and confined in the Maison d’Aliénés de Clermont before being handed over to British authorities in July 1844. One month later he was admitted to Bethlem as a criminal lunatic and remained there for the next 20 years. Soon after his arrival, confined within an environment lacking in mental stimulation and armed with his own sketchbooks of drawings from his foreign travels, Dadd found an outlet for his creative energies in the production of art.</p>
<p>Tromans sets Dadd’s confinement within the context of the medicalization of madness, moral treatment and the non-restraint movement of John Conolly. He describes how Bethlem’s woefully inadequate provision for criminals, segregated from the other patients, was improved gradually after the appointment of William Charles Hood as resident physician superintendent in 1852, and highlights recent debates on how physicians used such management to extend their control over patients. For the first time, this book provides transcriptions of the full case notes for Dadd at Clermont, Bethlem and Broadmoor; they reveal that the artist received almost no treatment for his mental condition throughout his confinement.</p>
<p>In 1845 Dadd gave an account of his crime, recording his belief that his father had been an impostor and that he was descended from the Egyptian god Osiris. Tromans examines the nature of Dadd’s illness and the possibility of hereditary taint; a brother and a sister also ended their days in asylums. He highlights the historical observations of Dadd’s behaviour at Bethlem as ‘violent and dangerous’ and his beliefs as ‘full of delusions’, noting how retrospective attempts at diagnosis such as schizophrenia and Capgras Syndrome have been hampered by the scanty documentary evidence available (Dadd’s Bethlem case notes were not begun until 1854). The links between the artist’s creativity and his mental disturbance – Dadd believed that spirits influenced the production of art – are also discussed.</p>
<p>The asylum staff including Sir Alexander Morison, Hood and Bethlem’s Steward, GH Haydon, encouraged Dadd’s art activity, but Tromans observes that while they collected and even commissioned works from him – Dadd’s most famous painting, <italic>The Fairy Feller’s Master-Stroke</italic> (<italic>c</italic>.1855–64) was painted for Haydon – they rarely allowed his work to be viewed beyond the asylum walls. After Dadd’s transfer to the newly-opened Broadmoor Hospital in 1864, while becoming calmer in his behaviour he continued his ‘fanciful ideas connected with spiritual agency’ (p. 154) and his artistic productions. Although other British asylums such as Crichton Royal Institution in Dumfries promoted art activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957154X12472612">Park, 2010</xref>), Dadd was by far the most celebrated and accomplished artist-patient in Victorian Britain.</p>
<p>After his death in 1886, Dadd was not completely forgotten but he remained outside the mainstream of nineteenth-century and modern artistic developments. He enjoyed a brief revival in the early 1960s as a counter-culture figure before the Tate Exhibition in 1974. Unlike the collections of patient art formed by Lombroso and Prinzhorn, Dadd’s work betrays little of the delusions of the maker and defies labels such as ‘psychotic art’, <italic>Art Brut</italic> or <italic>Outsider Art</italic>. The top-quality illustrations in Tromans’ publication reveal Dadd’s art as both technically brilliant and visually arresting. This is a book that will appeal to historians of psychiatry and art alike and adds valuable scholarship to the growing body of research on the art of the insane.</p>
