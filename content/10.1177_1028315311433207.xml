<abstract>
<p>At the intersection of the topics of migration and diversity in higher education lies the experience of people who grow up overseas, or who go overseas for education or military service, and then return as college students. This article addresses their experience, drawing from a series of exploratory interviews conducted—as part of a broader distributed research process on diversity—at one particularly diverse American university. The overseas experience, as would be expected, generally broadens student perspectives but also individuates them by first removing people from existing personal networks and established cognitive routines, then inserting them into new networks and cognitive patterns overseas, and finally reinserting them back into a “home” situation in the United States that is both familiar and now newly alien. The legacies of return thus include a resorting and reconfiguration of notions of self and identity as well as those of family, community, and nation. Overall, the process suggests a useful parallel between the student as traveler and the traveler as student. There is also a warning in this material that much human diversity involves very individualized experiences that may be overlooked in the more generalized literatures on education (especially higher education) and human mobility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Based on a series of exploratory interviews at a particularly diverse American university, this article considers the experiences of Americans who go abroad and then return as students in higher education. The topic lies at the intersection of new conceptualizations of people in motion (whether under the rubric of migration or human mobility) and of the nature and meaning of diversity in higher education. Furthermore, the topic reflects a fundamental dilemma in studies of both migration and diversity in higher education: that people’s lives are social ones embedded in human networks but those lives become more individualized as people separate from those networks, enter new networks in a new place, and then leave those to only partially integrate back into the original networks after return.</p>
<p>Return is, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1028315311433207">Long and Oxfeld (2004)</xref> suggest, an “integral part of the migration experience” (p. 2). But there are many different kinds of return. Three are covered in this discussion. The first are those who grew up abroad, at least in part, before returning for college in the United States. The second are those who have taken some kind of exchange program during their college years or simply used a summer vacation for foreign travel. The third are returning veterans, specifically those who have served at least one tour of duty overseas. These groups are often addressed separately and, indeed, our interviews suggest the three groups often go in somewhat different directions. In particular, veterans differ in the danger of their lives overseas and their frequent double transition on return as they readjust both to America and to civilian life. Yet the very heterogeneity of these three groups provides an opportunity to focus on the experience of return in broader terms, including its effects on higher education, without presupposing any hard and fast typological distinctions among returnees.</p>
<p>The discussion that follows begins by addressing some of the implications of the literature on returnees and its intersection with the broader literatures on migration and on higher education, and then the specific setting in which the interviews were conducted. The article then moves to the experiences of these particular interviewees, providing an overview of both going and coming, followed by more focused analysis of how going away requires a readjustment of social networks and cognitive patterns and how return then requires yet another adjustment in social networks and cognitive patterns. Throughout, the focus remains on the parallel and potentially mutually reinforcing nature of physical movements and cognitive ones: the traveler as student and the student as traveler. Although overseas experience may have a complicated interaction with education, and that interaction may not always be a positive one, yet still that experience with a different environment—sensory, social, cognitive, and linguistic—lies at the heart of most educational visions, from Piaget’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1028315311433207">1950/2001</xref>) sensing that situations of change and disequilibrium are the key to cognitive development to contemporary calls for international education as the key to effective global citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1028315311433207">Lewin, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>At the Intersection of Physical Movement and Cognitive Change</title>
<p>Much of the spirit of the returnee experience is captured in book titles. Thus <italic>Coming Home</italic> appears in the title for a practical guide on how returnees can better reintegrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1028315311433207">Storti, 1996/2003</xref>) and in an academic volume on the experience of repatriation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1028315311433207">Long &amp; Oxfeld, 2004</xref>). <italic>Re-Entry</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311433207">Jordan, 1992</xref>) suggests that life after return may eventually return to normal but that it will be a difficult and ragged process, and <italic>Hidden Immigrants</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311433207">Bell, 1997</xref>) goes a step further in implying that returnees are so different after their return that they are more like newcomers. That people growing up abroad are somehow different to begin with is well-captured by titles like <italic>Military Brats</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1028315311433207">Wertsch, 1991/2006</xref>), <italic>Third Culture Kids</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1028315311433207">Pollack &amp; Van Reken, 2001</xref>), and perhaps most evocatively by <italic>Unrooted Childhoods</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1028315311433207">Eidse &amp; Sichel, 2004</xref>). But it is <italic>Strangers at Home</italic> that bears the distinction of widest usage whether as the main title for an edited volume on different kinds of return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1028315311433207">Smith, 1996</xref>), an edited volume on returning Vietnam veterans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1028315311433207">Figley &amp; Leventman, 1980</xref>), or as the subtitle for a book on students returning from abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1028315311433207">Kaufmann, Martin, &amp; Weaver, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>All these titles suggest, as with Homer, that it will be hard to return home. Furthermore, it may not be clear where home is or whether it is indeed still home. A nod to Greek tragedy would yield the darker fate of Oedipus who, unknowingly, returns home to a woman who is mother but becomes wife. While the story has been appropriated by psychology, its social implications are perhaps as interesting, an instinctive sensing that this place and this person are home but a tragic confusion of one’s role in this home—“the same spacious place of refuge served you both as child and father” (<italic>Oedipus Rex</italic>, line 1208-1209).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1028315311433207">1</xref></sup> Coming home, then, is both the culmination of an often overwhelming yearning and also the source of problems that range from the minor to the life damaging. The cases from our interviews of soldiers returning home to a spouse and a quick divorce, or to a soon-to-be-former girlfriend, echo that potentiality of loss in return. Coming home may mean losing home.</p>
<p>The simple human act of going-and-coming thus has reverberations. A return may be triumphant or despairing; its aftermath may involve few or many changes, and those changes may be life enhancing, life draining, or even life claiming. Understanding this human act of going-and-coming thus requires a plunge into the crucial domains and transitions of human life. That plunge lies at the intersection of many fields. Two are of crucial importance here. The first is migration, or what is sometimes now conceptualized more broadly as human mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1028315311433207">2</xref></sup> In most of the migration literature from North America (and Europe to a lesser extent), the generic process of migration has tended to focus on a linear view of emigration from and immigration to. Immigration is often viewed as a finalized process, an assumption that matches the degree to which the United States is indeed the focal point of migration desires and migration trajectories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1028315311433207">3</xref></sup> One result is an enormous emphasis on issues relating to immigrant adaptation, and the consequent durability of assimilation as the standard vector that requires investigation. In recent years and in other places,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1028315311433207">4</xref></sup> however, there has been an increasing recognition that migration is not necessarily permanent or total—that people do often return and may be involved in reiterative migration that leaves them grounded in more than one place. Here then, there tends to be an emphasis on the “transnational,” usually now used to describe people—although historically the word was applied to places as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1028315311433207">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Against this admittedly generalized portrait of migration studies, the case of returnees is a useful addition. Some of that complementary value is obvious: returnees are often on explicitly temporary sojourns (although with lasting effects), they frequently move on a very individualized basis, and their return is both a movement to a place and away from it—they are both going home and coming home. Some of the reasons why return is such an important topic may be somewhat less obvious. For example, returnees’ sense of time is altered as they both move forward in time but also backwards when they return—a point that frequently emerged in our interviews. Furthermore, the balance of their identity that is group based and individualized also shifts, with the frequent result that returnees are uncertain whether they wish to reveal themselves as the new people they have become or the people they used to be before they left. Returnees thus provide a particularly fluid version of human mobility that is a challenge to most efforts to stabilize and generalize migration as a relatively orderly and predictable group-based human movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1028315311433207">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The complexity of the returnee experience is sometimes treated in rather conventional migration terms, as a resumption of relatively normal life after the dislocation of movement. Thus return mirrors the rooted/uprooted/transplanted metaphors of the immigration literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311433207">Handlin, 1951</xref>). The adjustment process then might be conceptualized as a “U” pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1028315311433207">Lysgaard, 1955</xref>) of stability/instability/stability; people experience “culture shock” in the new environment before achieving some level of adaptational equilibrium. Since returnees go and return, they experience a double process of stability/instability/stability, which can be characterized as a “W” pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311433207">Gullahorn &amp; Gullahorn, 1963</xref>). But the returnee literature also indicates far greater complexities than such simple “U” and “W” patterns seem to imply. In the case of postcolonial returnees, for example, similar difficulties have been noted in both the European and Asian contexts. For Europe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1028315311433207">Smith (2003)</xref> notes not only the invisibility of repatriates but also the mutual alienation with the home society. There is, she notes, a “sense of alienation on the part of the migrants toward the metropolitans as well as the reverse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1028315311433207">2003</xref>, p. 30). For Japanese returnees from China after the Second World War, there was a similar process, including an alienation on the part of the home society so severe that the Japanese government blocked many of these colonial subjects from returning at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1028315311433207">Murai, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1028315311433207">Nishioka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1028315311433207">Watt, 2009</xref>). When there was repatriation, the adjustment was delayed and thus more difficult. Those returnees faced, as one of Hideko Nishioka’s interviewees put it, living “without identity, rights, and a place to die” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1028315311433207">Nishioka, 2005</xref>). There is in this kind of returnee experience thus no return to an equilibriated adaptation to the home society, just as there never was a truly equilibriated adjustment to the original colonial migration destination.</p>
<p>This lack of any clear resolution—any settlement in the general sense—of the returnee experience is also very clear in the more recent literature on returnees from Latin America to Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1028315311433207">Linger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1028315311433207">Roth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1028315311433207">Takenaka, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1028315311433207">Tsuda, 2003</xref>). In that case, there is a narrowing of identity as people migrate, first being Japanese-Brazilian in Brazil, then being Brazilian-Japanese in Japan (and realizing they are not so Japanese after all), then often being returned Japanese-Brazilians in Brazil (and realizing they are not so Brazilian after all), and finally being a yet more narrowly defined set of people who have both Brazilian and Japanese ancestry and connections, but are defined more as a set of people who migrate between the two, with their very homes becoming a “space for socialization of a new generation of potential migrants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1028315311433207">Sasaki, 2008</xref>, p. 63).</p>
<p>Although much of the returnee literature thus suggests a narrowing (even loss) of identity with successive migrations back and forth, much of that literature also suggests an expansion of identity as people come to incorporate different experiences, expectations, and values. In some cases, return migration even begins to look more linear than circular. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1028315311433207">Pritchard (2011)</xref>, for example, finds that students returning to Taiwan and Sri Lanka after education in Great Britain experience relatively little disruption in their lives largely because their employment trajectory is clear: they came to Great Britain for a professional MA (in TESOL) and, on return to their home countries, worked in that field. In that light, the differences that people have on return appear less as disruption or misfit, than as a new expanded repertoire of skills. Returnees may also experience changes in identity that are additive rather than substitutive. They develop, in Pritchard’s terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1028315311433207">2011</xref>) “multiple cultural identities” (p. 105) rather than simply reformulating a single identity. That expanded range of skills and personal understanding may cause difficulties, but is often explicitly valued and valorized. Employees with overseas experience may be seen as having a “unique global perspective on issues central to the company’s well-being” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1028315311433207">Storti, 1996/2003</xref>, p. 68). Returning missionaries may be admonished to “translate the blessings of what you experienced overseas into daily life back home” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1028315311433207">McClung, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>That issue of enhanced human potential suggests that the issue of returnees is not simply a question about patterns in migration but also one about education in both the specific and general senses. For example, given the increasing degree of student mobility in higher education (an annual increase of above 5% over roughly the last decade and an annual increase of over 10% over the last three decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1028315311433207">UNESCO, 2009</xref>, pp. 36-37]), the case of returnee students lies at the heart of what “global” will mean for higher education, and thus for many people’s personal and professional lives, in this century. Higher education, then, is a second crucial context for considering the returnee experience. Higher education is, after all, itself a kind of human mobility. It lies at the crucial juncture when people are becoming detached from their original families but before they are fully launched on their adult lives, whether in professional or personal dimensions. Following Erik Erikson’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1028315311433207">1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1028315311433207">1959/1980</xref>) classic analysis, it is a time of some immunity from normal life. The implication is that only with detachment from context can the movement forward of thinking (or other aspects of personal development) take place. It is particularly fitting in that context that Erikson himself eschewed college for travel around Europe, that the reflective physical journey was a more appropriate and effective higher education than the standard, formal, in-place academic version.</p>
<p>Much of the recent discussion of how education can foster critical thinking has been couched in terms of diversity. It is not always precisely clear whether the emphasis on diversity is about recognizing the diversity that students already have, moving students toward an increasingly diverse (and global) society, or somehow actually using diversity as a prod toward intellectual growth—that diversity itself is inherently good for intellectual development. Yet the basic arguments about the value of diversity in higher education are well established. <italic>Diversity Works</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1028315311433207">Smith, 1997</xref>), for example, notes the full range of benefits to students on both the personal and cognitive levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1028315311433207">Chang (2001)</xref> provides a specific argument about racial diversity and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1028315311433207">Hurtado (2007)</xref> provides a nice review of the more general importance of diversity in the university—including how it has been affected by court challenges of special admission provisions.</p>
<p>Although much of this literature is about power differentials and the search for equity in access, it nevertheless also underlines the importance of diversity as a spur to personal and intellectual growth. It thus echoes much of the classic work on the interaction of education and experience, particularly if education is considered as, for example, an expansion of capacity to deal with new situations, such that the individual is no longer subject to disequilibrium in response to new stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1028315311433207">Piaget, 1950/2001</xref>). The strong effects of international experience on such intellectual development are often noted in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1028315311433207">Lewin, 2009</xref>), in particular studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1028315311433207">McKeown, 2009</xref>), and in the yet further heightened impact of experience in less familiar foreign destinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1028315311433207">Che, Spearman, &amp; Manizade, 2009</xref>). The links to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311433207">Dewey’s (1938</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1028315311433207">1916/2009)</xref> emphasis on the organic connection between experience and education and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1028315311433207">Kolb’s (1984)</xref> emphasis on the way education is a transformation of experience are especially clear, particularly in that the test of the effectiveness of learning is the ability to actively experiment in yet other situations. That personal potential inevitably connects to the overall capacity of a society like the United States, that the lack of this particular kind of international experience, this “isolated habit of mind,” is an even more serious impediment in a more global world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1028315311433207">Kolb, 2009</xref>, p. 59; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1028315311433207">Bhandari &amp; Laughlin, 2009</xref>). Indeed the emphasis on the foreign language aspect of international experience also invokes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1028315311433207">Vygotsky’s (1962)</xref> efforts to link the issues of thought and language. The issues of international diversity—very well represented by student returnees—lie very much at the heart, then, of educational theory and practice.</p>
<p>Such international diversity lies partly with people from different backgrounds and the common university “festival of flags” kind of event that reflects the notion—part hope and part recruitment tool—that diversity of origin is both socially and intellectually valuable in higher education. Here too student returnees are a challenging set of people. They do not fit well into the usual diversity approaches since their origins are not different in the usual ethnic or national sense: they march under no recognizable flag of origin. Furthermore, they are not readily identifiable in physical or cultural ways, thus eluding the racial and ethnic labels usually used as the primary categorization of diversity in the United States. Rather, it is their personal experience of movement, their individual going-and-coming, that makes them different, and that is a diversity that can be relatively easily hidden.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the experience of student returnees provides a vital addition to the contemporary understanding of migration and of diversity in higher education. Perhaps no other set of people is as revealing of the potential shape and meaning of a more globalized future of human physical movement or intellectual development. Perhaps no other set of people provides such an evocative reminder that people are what they have experienced on an individual basis in multiple environments, that it is often such experiential—rather than categorical—diversity that truly makes people different, whether that difference is visible or not, in higher education or elsewhere.</p>

<sec id="section3-1028315311433207">
<title>The Setting</title>
<p>The interviews discussed here reflect the university setting in which they were conducted and the 7-year project on diversity of which they are one component. The university is a rapidly growing one located in a diverse region. The region has a broad range of foreign groups both as permanent immigrants and as temporary ones. The university reflects that diversity. Whether it is the overall number of countries represented (133 at last estimate), the relatively high proportion of international students (consistently above 5%), significant representation of minority religious groups (including 6% Muslim, 2% Buddhist, and 2% Hindu among incoming freshmen), the broad range of diversity within particular regional groups (perhaps especially the broad representation of different Latin American countries), or even the diversity within a single national origin (e.g., the multiple native languages of those from India), diversity is manifest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1028315311433207">7</xref></sup> The university also has a number of cases in which there are sizable components of native-born, immigrant, and foreign student representatives of the same origin country, perhaps especially those from China, Korea, India, and Vietnam. All these kinds of diversity have the effect of limiting the forces that create difficulties in social diversity, whether racial dichotomies (Black vs. White), the somewhat broader set of racialized ethnic groups (Asian, Black, Hispanic, White), or dominance by a particular group (e.g., Mexicans as the dominant Latino group in much of the West and Southwest). This university’s environment is thus a relatively open one in terms of national, ethnic, racial, and religious identification. That does not always mean there is extensive interaction, but there is considerable coexistence.</p>
<p>This degree of diversity was the impetus for establishing a diversity research group (hereafter the DRG) that has now completed its 7th year. The group is explicitly aimed at bridging the student, faculty, student services, and administration divides. The group’s efforts now include an initial set of focus groups with students, several pilot research projects that looked at such issues as the English language writing dilemmas of foreign students and the views of education held by the U.S.-born children of immigrants. There was also a series of individual student research projects on diversity (whether involving nationality, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability) and other miscellaneous projects (as in the examination of the interactional patterns between U.S. and South Asian–born South Asian students and the consideration of identity among Iranian Americans).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1028315311433207">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was as one component of these DRG efforts that a series of interviews was undertaken with returnees. The research was a joint faculty and student effort, following the DRG’s emphasis on students as necessarily both the subjects and authors of the university’s diversity. The first publication of the group, for example, was a series of free-form student essays on what diversity might actually be and mean in the university context. Given that general emphasis on flexibility and emergent diversity, the project on returnees did not follow the usual practice of separating different kind of returnees, instead simultaneously considering the experience of those who had grown up abroad, those who had gone abroad as part of their college education, and those returning from military service overseas. The intent was thus to provide an integrated understanding of the return experience rather than typologizing it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1028315311433207">9</xref></sup> Certainly there are reasons for dealing with the different kinds of returnees separately—and indeed the groups have relatively little interest in each other and sometimes even some antagonism. Yet they share many of the same experiences and, if the intent is to truly examine returnees as both contributors to diversity and themselves diverse, the decision for an inclusive framework seemed appropriate.</p>
<p>As a general methodological note, the interviews were designed to be about an hour in length although they sometimes extended longer (the longest was about 2.5 hr). Probably the most difficult part of the interviewing was keeping the discussion moving toward return. Interviewees were often extremely happy to be talking about their experience overseas—even most veterans—and it required some effort to keep pushing toward the less conventional set of questions about life after return. Also as a general note, interviewees were found by several mechanisms, but in the end were largely through personal contacts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1028315311433207">10</xref></sup> One of the interviewers, for example, was ultimately an officer of the student veterans association (even though herself not a veteran) and she conducted all but two of the veteran interviews. There were a total of 23 of these interviews at the time this article was written.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article turns to the interviews themselves, providing first an integrated portrait of the personal and social process of going-and-coming, and then an assessment of what its crucial components and effects seem to be.</p>

<title>Going . . .</title>
<p>Accounts of migration often begin with the decision to move. However, that decision often takes place within a latency grid that includes prior physical moves overseas, cultural interest in other countries or cultures, and at least sometimes family histories that include migration. We did not—perhaps unfortunately—do extended discussion with interviewees about their family history and what in it might spark an interest in going overseas. Clearly, however, some actual or emotional sense of connection to other countries factored into decisions to move, and many interviewees had been “forced” migrants at some point, whether by their families in childhood or their Uncle Sam in adulthood. The decisions that people made reflected these prior experiences. Thus a student choosing to go to England did so at least in part because “I am kind of Anglo-Saxon probably from Britain at least ancestrally, and there was a factor of wanting to try to connect” (No. 15). A veteran pushed himself to the top of his training group so he “got to pick my orders” and went to Japan since it had “been a place I’d always wanted to go since I was a kid” (No. 20).</p>
<p>The connection was, however, often more recent and personal. One student, for example, took the summer to visit her boyfriend’s home country (No. 22); another went to Mexico (rather than Spain) for language work because the people she had met from there in the United States just seemed like “nice people” (No. 23). For several others, there was a longer sequence of trips, beginning small and then extending in length. One student, for example, started with a short spring break trip to Latin America, extended that to enrolling for a year in an international university in the Middle East, and ultimately went to Africa for graduate research (No. 21). These subsequent trips were sometimes to the same country but also often to different countries, sometimes for their own intrinsic appeal and sometimes because they would just be different from other places. One student, for example, went to Africa because “I assumed Africa would be a little less cold and consumer oriented than if I had gone to Europe.” Her subsequent trip after Africa, however, brought her closer to Europe—Malta in the middle of the Mediterranean (No. 17). The desire to go overseas was also for many a desire to escape. One recounted that he had “decided to go overseas because I was just kind of bored with the U.S. culture” (No. 19). For many veterans the desire to escape was explicit in enlisting in the military. One veteran, for example, noted he came from “a small little town in the middle of nowhere” and “hated school, I sucked at it, it was hard” (No. 10).</p>
<p>Given this range of reasons for going and the prior experiences underlying those decisions—what might be conceptualized as a latency grid—the nature of the actual trips was highly variable, but the stages were relatively similar. Arrival in the new place often had a sharp physical jolt and considerable uncertainty: a traveler arriving alone to find no greeting party in a Ghana airport that “was scary as hell” (No. 21); a woman savoring the “smell of dust and heat” in Senegal; a soldier arriving in the middle of the night on a totally blacked out plane in the Middle East (No. 11) or just landing “in the middle of nowhere in the desert” (No. 8). Even on more orderly trips to better known places, or places at least with known people, the sheer effect of flight often disoriented people, whether the physical effects of jet lag from sleepiness to being “incredibly sick” (No. 22) or just lost luggage (No. 21)—losing your bearings or losing your stuff.</p>
<p>Over the first few weeks in the new country, most interviewees found some mix of the expected and the unexpected as they adapted to new circumstances and new people. The term “culture shock” has been widely incorporated into how people talk about international experiences, and these returnees often used the term. Sometimes it was hard to separate the physical environment from the cultural one. Thus the “shock” could be the differential configuration of space or even the climate. The desert that soldiers found in the Middle East was sometimes cold, often hot, and incredibly empty. The places students found were often urban in a way they had not experienced, whether in Asia (No. 22), Africa (No. 17), or Europe (No. 15). The shock was sometimes more socioeconomic: “I constantly saw people dying from AIDS, and just the level of poverty” (No. 16). The sense of physical danger was often strong, whether in military situations (true of almost all the veterans) or simply in places, like Korea, where the threat of military confrontation affects everyone, whether civilian or military, permanent resident or short-term visitor (No. 22). Sometimes it wasn’t quite danger, but a certain unease. Protests in Okinawa served as a reminder that, even in the safest countries and among the strongest allies, Americans are not always welcome or their views supported (No. 16). Sometimes, however, the shock was more directly cultural. Several described the different way space was used. Others found a very different tone and structure to personal relationships. One interviewee, for example, attempted to explain the Korean sense of <italic>chong</italic>: “There is no translation for it . . . It’s basically like the development of an empathy or sympathy in a relationship” (No. 22).</p>
<p>One crucial part of the experience, and the one most germane to this intersection of people in motion geographically and students in motion intellectually, is the degree to which people did find some room for thinking. Sometimes this was a fairly predictable part of the experience. Virtually all of the interviewees came to see the world and their own country in a different way. They saw both the limits of American power and its importance. They saw not only the benefits of other cultures but also the benefits of their own. It may, however, be the unexpected ways their thinking developed that are the most intriguing. For example, Mark (a veteran who will reappear later) served on a ship in the Gulf region. There, with time on his hands, he began to read the books that a friend gave him. A product of the White working class in a Florida city, he was now reading about the revolution in Cuba and South America. Che Guevara in the Persian Gulf. Another had an unexpected introduction to social class since the Mexican university she attended turned out to be an extraordinarily elite institution whose gate separated it from a very different, far poorer Mexico. Yet another discovered gender issues as the wonderfully warm family that “adopted” her then tried to marry her off. These were not, then, predictable lessons about a different culture, but more like sideways glances into the nature of human society—what any teacher of contemporary society would want students to learn.</p>

<title>. . . and Coming</title>
<p>This sketch of the experience of going abroad suggests a fairly predictable pattern—if considerable range—in people’s reasons for going abroad and also a fairly predictable mix of the expected and unexpected, known and unknown that they experience while abroad. But the focus in this article is on return, on what effects the return to what is supposedly home has on returnees, particularly in the context of being students in higher education. How does this physical passage going-and-coming interleave with the experience of college as itself a journey away from “regular” life in preparation for a return to it? One might expect, after all, that the person returning to society from college may resemble the person returning to America from abroad, that both sojourns bring people back into the system smoothly but with enhanced skills and personal resonances.</p>
<p>What then are the key elements of return? In many ways the return process mirrors the going process. The first experience on return for most interviewees was a positive one of reunion with family and friends, and sometimes even a rather triumphant return. One veteran noted a return almost like that of a hero, “like a rock star pulling up to a concert” (No. 10). Another noted how “you just feel elated, it’s just awesome to come back” (No. 5). The return to family was often the lynchpin of those early days but there was also a more general appreciation of the expanse of America itself, “wide open” (No. 19) and with “clean air” (No. 21). “Holy Jesus,” remarked one veteran about his reaction to America after returning from Iraq, “this land is so green” (No. 9). Return could also be a time of calm, perhaps especially for veterans: “I felt like I could revert back to some more relaxed behavior” (No. 20); “that ultimate feel of relaxment . . . a resting state [that] no stress could affect” (No. 16); everything “was just so still” (No. 20).</p>
<p>But there were also more disquieting moments. Again “culture shock” emerged in discussions, this time as reverse culture shock. “Americans are fat” noted one about first impressions on return (No. 12), while another noted that the very smell of American fast food now made him “nauseous” (No. 16). Several noted the impact of being isolated in cars rather than walking on the streets. America seemed “more impersonal” (No. 17). There was also in that first reaction to America a regret for what had been lost in the return. “I cried all day” and when reaching the United States “all I could think about was Berlin” (No. 1). Home had somehow gone from being familiar to being strange. “When I returned it felt like I was going to a foreign country” (No. 2). Coming back was just “really weird” (No. 4) and “so disconnected” (No. 22). Remarked one veteran, “we were forgotten” (No. 11).</p>
<p>These problems sometimes emerged very rapidly. Even on the trip from the airport with her family, noted one, “we had nothing to talk about on the way home; and that was weird” (No. 22). Other problems took longer to develop. Almost all those interviewed noted a lapse into silence as family seemed to quickly return to their own concerns, leaving the returnees with no outlets for what they wanted to discuss. Like Ulysses, they had finally made it home. They had changed and life had gone on in their absence. Sometimes their families had stayed the same and sometimes they too had changed. Whichever the case, the fit was different. Home was not quite the same.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1028315311433207">
<title>Experiencing Change</title>
<p>Through this going-and-coming, interviewees almost unanimously indicated they had experienced profound personal change. “You know,” remarked one, “I became more aware of everything” (No. 2). Part of what the returnee experience reflects is simply a break in the routine. Many of the veterans, for example, were quite explicitly taking a break—indeed making a break—from lives that they found pointless, often because they rejected school in general or found the prospect of college unappealing. For them overseas tours were often not the intent. Several had enlisted before 9/11 and thus were caught up in a very different military experience than they had originally expected. Much of their subsequent interest in education can be attributed to that break from a routine. But the process was similar for the other returnees. John, for example, went on a semester abroad program in England. After high school, and a financially unsuccessful venture into the entertainment business, he had ended up going to community college. He was by his own admission an indifferent student, but decided he would like to go abroad. In England, he lived in a dorm with other exchange students. The dorm happened to be near the classrooms and, since he had no other plan for his time, he started going to class. He also began to take more responsibility for himself:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well it was the first time I had lived on my own. And so I experienced that for the first time . . . I was having to pay attention to my expenses. I was able to not be accountable to anyone as for like staying out. You know, whatever it might be there was no direct authority structure over me, I didn’t really have to go to class, I didn’t really have to do anything I didn’t want to . . . What I didn’t expect was how well I was doing to step into that role. (No. 15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For John, then, much of the value of the experience was simply being away and being in a more responsible position for himself. Many others had this same sense of new found independence that, in turn, heightened their sense of personal responsibility. For veterans, in particular, that sense of responsibility extended not only to themselves but to those with whom they were fighting. The effect was ultimately a very different kind of person generally and these differences tended to fuel a greater academic commitment after return. One veteran who joined the military precisely because he “just didn’t want to go to school,” for example, noted in his interview his great appreciation after return for “this great opportunity to go to school and get an education.”</p>
<p>In John’s case, however, that simple break in the physical routine was a shift in social and cultural context as well. He had not gone overseas with any of his existing friends, so he had to start again to make friends and social networks. He ultimately fell in with a group that was quite cosmopolitan, among whom he suddenly found himself more socially adept. He met the woman he would marry, and her commitment to academic work increased his own interest in his studies. So this was not only a new place, but a new set of interactions. Sometimes such interactions are new to the overseas experience, and sometimes—particularly with veterans—those new interactions are established before going overseas, so people were going on overseas duty with people whom they universally recognized as their new “family.”</p>
<p>This realignment of social relations while abroad was followed by another realignment after return. Here, the realignment was more unexpected. Veterans were, again, most likely to be able to maintain overseas ties after return. Many found great value in the university’s veterans association (which had a particularly energetic president during this period). Some advocated strongly for a special veteran’s center, where they could be with those who understood them; several showed rather sharp hostility to the “kids” with whom they went to class. But even for veterans, change often occurred in relationships. Post-tour time on a U.S. base could be extremely isolating, and interaction with other veterans (as at security jobs where a veteran’s security clearance has a direct payoff) could be fairly limited (No. 16).</p>
<p>One veteran, Mark, was not happy with the military even when on active duty and instead spent what time he could with the local culture. One effect was isolation from his military “family”:
<disp-quote>
<p>You know, just the whole power structure in the military, I had a lot of problems with, you know, I was always having these little, not really getting into trouble, over power, telling me what to do and stuff like that. So I kind of got, I kind of isolated myself, somebody that was not going to be in the military for a career. Which kind of puts a stick on some people (No. 20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After returning to the states, Mark remained generally isolated from other veterans, keeping alive only a few very close relationships. His return home, including seeing his very best friend from before military service, was frustrating. Here there was effectively no return, but instead a moving on to something new. His intellectual commitments, for example, now lay with a critique of American society based on the new and varied Americans he had met in military service. That rearrangement of social relations and intellectual interests, including the Hispanic who introduced him to leftist critiques of the American power structure, made him a very committed student. The returnee experience, with this two-step rearrangement of social relations in going and in coming, provides great insight into how new engagements with new people produce new relationships, heightened intellectual engagements, and a revised and more fully portable individual self.</p>
<p>Mark’s isolation from his military peers had the compensation of greater involvement with host country nationals. With less of a buffer group he moved closer to the host society, just as those with very strong buffer groups tend to remain isolated from the host society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311433207">Guterbock &amp; Hochstein, 2009</xref>). Mark’s case, however, was not just about this new social set but about the culture they represented. He spent considerable time learning the language. Language, for him, was the key to understanding cultural difference:
<disp-quote>
<p>You know, they grew up in a Japanese mind set, you grew up in an English mind set, or American mind set where we speak English, so we have some cultural connections with it. Your have to forget about that when you learn Japanese and put yourself in a Japanese mind set. For me, it was a lot easier because I was actually in Japan. (No. 20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There was a similar comment by another interviewee about German, how speaking the language meant becoming German: “I’d be at a store and somebody would start talking to me and I’d start being German. It was so strange” (No. 1).</p>
<p>That experience of a different culture often generated new contrasts between the places visited and the America that they found on return. Sarah, after stints in both the Middle East and Africa tried to explain the overall difference:
<disp-quote>
<p>We’re just not open people. In [country in Africa] . . . even though these people are in the worst situations imaginable . . . they get up, they’re smiling, they’re out, and they want to do something. And they want to engage people. And people will just come together for the sake of engaging with other people. And I feel like here [in the United States] people are so busy being self-absorbed in their little world, closed off from everybody, they can’t even bother to fathom. (No. 21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When they returned, then, returnees often found that while the strange of “there” had become more familiar, the known territory of “here” had become strange.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1028315311433207">
<title>Considerations</title>
<p>The exploratory nature of this research, the limited number of interviewees, and the restriction to one particularly diverse university suggest the need for caution in generalizing to broader groups of students in other places at other times. However, exploratory research can often be quite helpful in suggesting issues for further study and considering alternative ways of organizing inquiry—for example, the potential benefits and limitations in considering veterans, study abroad students, and “third culture kids” within the same general framework. As well, in smaller scale research it is often possible to give fuller consideration to the depth and complexity of the individual cases that can be obscured in larger scale, more quantitative research.</p>
<p>Despite those methodological caveats, these particular interviews nevertheless suggest that in the experience of going-and-coming, returnees are likely to navigate through two realignments of their daily routines, their social networks, and their ways of looking at the world. The interviewees attributed these changes to their own experience although there was some variability in whether they thought people in the United States had stayed the same or whether they too had changed. “America changed on me,” noted one (No. 2). “It left me behind . . . It went on without me and I got stuck in the back, in the outfield or whatever.” In some cases, the effects of going-and-coming were modest, but even relatively short trips (a summer, a semester) seemed to reverberate in multiple ways. Sometimes the effect was to isolate people but sometimes to move them toward deeper social commitments and social interactions. Sometimes the effect was to make them uncertain about their place in society, but sometimes the effect was to make them more confident and committed. For all, the effect was change. That change made many nonstudents into students and many students into better students—although sometimes less conventional ones.</p>
<p>The price that almost all of them paid was at least occasional isolation as the individual they had become fit less smoothly into old patterns and old relationships. There was thus a double disjunction. One noted that “you spend so much time being alone and not alone” while abroad and then “it felt kind of weird to lead a double life” on return (No. 8). One effect of that disorientation was a frequent search—even yearning—for the next foreign trip that would reactivate all those physical, social, and intellectual senses that had been stimulated on the last trip. As one put it,
<disp-quote>
<p>I want to experience as many places as I can. So I think that’s something I definitely got out of it. I do not want to be stuck on one place, ever. It’s sort of killing me right now to be in school and being stuck in one place. I really want to just go somewhere else right now and do something else. (No. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The new latency grid for further physical travel and further intellectual development was a broader one, a deeper one, and perhaps a more demanding one. Travel was no longer an option but a need. And it was not necessarily a return to the previous place visited. As one veteran noted, “being overseas motivates me to go back overseas but not necessarily to be in the same place” (No. 12).</p>
<p>These returnees—at the intersection of human mobility over space and human mobility through the personal and intellectual life course—shed much light on the promise and perils of a more truly international experience of diversity. It is a diversity in what is encountered and also an increased diversity in the capacities of people to respond to difference. This exploratory research on returnees at one American university suggests one way to move closer, through research on and with students, to the actual experiences of personal and intellectual growth that conjoint travels of the body and the mind can foster. As John noted about his semester abroad in England, “Before that, like college, there’s no way.” Going-and-coming had given him a sense of the importance of higher education and his ability to succeed at it. For others the effect was more subtle. But this interplay between student as traveler and traveler as student still yielded a heightened sense of the practical, intellectual, and even moral importance of higher education and of international travel, a desire—even need—“to go somewhere else right now and do something else.” Being “more aware of everything,” then, was both an accomplishment and a challenge, a reflection on past experience and a vision for the future.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this particular analysis does not focus on differences by age, sex, gender, or sexual orientation. The interviews do indicate some differences. Female veterans, for example, have a somewhat different tone to their experiences; being older when going overseas clearly affects the experience. But, as Sussman’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1028315311433207">2001</xref>) suggests, gender may be overemphasized as a factor in the returnee experience.

It is not that these experiences are not gendered, or aged, classed, raced, and so forth, but simply that it is also important—and perhaps more important at an exploratory stage – to <italic>not</italic> assume such differences or structure them into the framework of analysis.</p>

<p>This is not then a “sample” and it may well be impossible to ever construct returnees as a defined population that can be sampled. There are, of course, lists of veterans who are using VA benefits and of students who have returned from this university’s official study abroad programs. But neither of those covers the full population. The situation for those raised abroad is especially difficult, since they are, as one of the book titles cited in the text suggests, “hidden immigrants.”</p>
