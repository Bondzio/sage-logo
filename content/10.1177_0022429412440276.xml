<p><italic>Research Perspectives in Music Education</italic> (<italic>RPME</italic>) is the official refereed research journal of the Florida Music Educators’ Association. Its Editorial Board is seeking manuscripts for publication. The journal publishes music education research using qualitative and/or quantitative methodologies and manuscripts of a philosophical, historical, or theoretical nature. Reviews of literature with critical synthesis are also considered. In all cases, implications for music educators must be included.</p>

Papers may be submitted at any time, but to ensure consideration for publication in the following volume, submissions should be received by the editor as soon as possible.</p>
