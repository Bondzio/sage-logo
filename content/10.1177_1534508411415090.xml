<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are present early in development and affect essential aspects of human behavior such as social interaction, communication, expression of complex ideas and emotions, and the building and maintaining of interpersonal relationships. A diagnosis of ASD has lifelong implications for adaptive behavior that can include difficulties in school and work, need for supported living situations, and extreme behavior. Each child on the autism spectrum exhibits unique patterns of strengths and deficits, making diagnosis, educational planning, and progress monitoring challenging, if not daunting, tasks. Current estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report a prevalence rate of ASD to be 1 case per every 110 children ages 3 to 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411415090">CDC, 2010</xref>). In 1992, there were 15,580 students nationwide served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411415090">U.S. Department of Education, 2010</xref>) category of Autism (Au). In 2005, this number rose dramatically to 192,643 students, due in part to a greater awareness of the broad spectrum of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411415090">U.S. Department of Education, 2007</xref>). Autism spectrum disorders appear to be composed of a continuum of disorders of varying etiology and severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411415090">Volker &amp; Lopata, 2008</xref>); for the purposes of this article, the abbreviation ASD will be used in the discussion to refer collectively to the broad spectrum of autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder–Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS).</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to highlight features of frequently used instruments to assess ASD with respect to diagnostic criteria laid out in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders–Fourth Edition–Text Revision</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411415090">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>) and IDEA 2004 guidelines; and, second, to provide recommendations for best practices for school-based evaluation teams. Promising evidence-based interventions, which follow accurate and comprehensive diagnostic procedures, are emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411415090">Volker &amp; Lopata, 2008</xref>). Although intervention strategies for ASD are beyond the scope of this article, the informed use of assessment tools represents an integral step toward efficient and appropriate intervention. Informed use also includes considerations of feasibility with respect to time and cost of assessment, training of assessment professionals, the psychometric properties of the instruments, and utility of measures for differential diagnosis.</p>
<p>Because specific diagnostic criteria are necessary to guide school-based evaluation for individuals with suspected ASD, the IDEA eligibility guidelines and the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> diagnostic criteria will provide the framework for this discussion of assessment tools. The selection of instruments was determined by reviews of autism evaluation literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411415090">Akshoomoff, Corsello, &amp; Schmidt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508411415090">Allen, Robins, &amp; Decker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508411415090">Landa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411415090">LeCouteur, Haden, Hammal, &amp; McConachie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411415090">Mazefsky &amp; Oswald, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508411415090">Naglieri &amp; Chambers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411415090">Reaven, Hepburn, &amp; Ross, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411415090">Tomanik, Pearson, Loveland, Lane, &amp; Shaw, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508411415090">Ventola et al., 2006</xref>) and informal data collection from local, regional, and national school systems, and university clinics. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534508411415090">Table 1</xref> presents summary information regarding practical considerations when choosing ASD assessment measures.</p>

<p>Numerous other measures are currently available for use in the assessment of ASD. Notably, these include the <italic>Social Responsiveness Scale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508411415090">Constantino, 2005</xref>), the <italic>Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534508411415090">Robins, Fein, Barton, &amp; Green, 1999</xref>), the <italic>Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411415090">Myles, Bock, &amp; Simpson, 2000</xref>) and the <italic>Autism Spectrum Rating Scales</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411415090">Goldstein &amp; Naglieri, 2009</xref>). These measures, along with a number of other rating scales, were not included in this review because of less frequent reported use by school-based or university-based assessment teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508411415090">Allen et al., 2008</xref>). This decision in no way assumes that these measures are not effective or appropriate for assessing for ASD.</p>
<p>To establish the context for describing and discussing specific assessment tools, we first review federal guidelines and clinical diagnostic criteria (<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>) for diagnosis of ASD.

<p>In general, the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> criteria for diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders are much more specific and focus on the discrete symptoms and characteristics whereas the IDEA eligibility criteria focus more specifically on the impact of general symptoms on daily functioning. Therefore, it is important that school-based teams evaluate for both the diagnostic criteria and for the impact of symptoms on a child’s daily functioning.</p>
<p>Next, we will describe and discuss several key instruments for ASD assessment and diagnosis with respect to their alignment with IDEA and <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> criteria. Implications for school-based practice, including the role of the multidisciplinary team, will follow.</p>

<title>Federal Regulations Related to Autism and Eligibility for Special Education</title>
<p>School psychologists and other school personnel, including speech–language pathologists, occupational therapists, and special educators are being called on with increasing frequency to identify, assess, and develop treatment plans for students suspected of having ASD. When school-based multidisciplinary teams make diagnostic and eligibility decisions regarding referred students, a number of requirements and regulations must be considered. Federal regulations are interpreted and rules for implementation are designed by state education agencies. Local education agencies, that is, school districts, use state rules and guidelines to develop policies for implementation.</p>
<p>Terminology with respect to research, diagnosis, and intervention with ASD has been especially problematic for school professionals, who must adhere to federal and state regulations, keep up with the relevant research, and communicate with a variety of outside professionals. Federal regulations use the term <italic>autism</italic>, with the designation <italic>Au</italic> to define all disorders that fall under the ASD umbrella, whereas the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> uses the umbrella term Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). Further complicating communication among professionals, research studies often use the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) designation. It often falls to school professionals to clarify to parents and other consumers the distinctions and overlap among these terms.</p>
<p>The federal definition of autism as specified by IDEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411415090">U.S. Department of Education, 2010</xref>) is
<disp-quote>
<p>A developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and non-verbal communication and social interaction, generally evident before age three that adversely affects a child’s educational performance. Other characteristics often associated with autism are engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movement, resistance to environmental change or change in daily routine and unusual responses to sensory experiences. The term autism does not apply if a child’s educational performance is adversely affected primarily because the child has an emotional disturbance. [34 C.F.R. 300.8(c) (i)(ii)].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although federal law has defined autism for special education eligibility, little guidance has been given as to how to assess for diagnosis in the school setting. Currently, there are no definitive medical diagnostic tests for ASD, but the identification of early developmental disruption may allow for earlier detection and intervention, which are key in facilitating positive outcomes, and ultimately, to disorder management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508411415090">Landa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508411415090">Plotts &amp; Webber, 2001–2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411415090">Volker &amp; Lopata, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Federal law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411415090">U.S. Department of Education, 2010</xref>) requires that eligibility decisions be made by a multidisciplinary team [20 U.S.C., 1414 (d)(1)(B)]. Each potential team member, including parents, assessment personnel, general and special education representatives, speech–language pathologists, occupational and physical therapists, and administrators, offers unique contributions to assessment and intervention for ASD. Parents are an integral part of the assessment team as a comprehensive developmental history is essential to accurate diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508411415090">Plotts &amp; Webber, 2001–2002</xref>). Assessment personnel, including school psychologists, have expertise in assessment of cognitive functioning, child development, adaptive behavior, and problematic behavior and offer expertise regarding differential diagnosis with other disorders that may share behavioral features. Classroom teachers, administrators, and special education professionals offer valuable insights regarding how each child’s unique characteristics affect academic and social functioning on a daily basis and may be best positioned to document intervention efforts. Speech-language pathologists provide evaluation of language functioning, including verbal and nonverbal communication, and audiologists can rule out hearing impairment as a contributing factor in referral concerns. Occupational and physical therapists focus on sensory and motor issues that are of considerable import in the understanding of ASD and the impact on daily functioning. Other members might include medical providers and applied behavioral analysis specialists.</p>
<p>Each member of the multidisciplinary team is expected to contribute to a consensus decision regarding eligibility for special education under the Au classification. Determining subtle differences between Au eligibility and other eligibility categories, such as Emotional Disturbance and Intellectual Disability, requires a thorough understanding of diagnostic criteria and assessment techniques.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534508411415090">Table 3</xref> lists the criteria used for establishing eligibility for special education and related services and to what extent each of the measures under analysis addresses these criteria. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534508411415090">Table 3</xref> also provides a rating of the contribution of each measure to the generation of intervention goals and educational planning. Each measure on each criterion has a rating of <italic>strong</italic>, <italic>adequate</italic>, <italic>minimal</italic>, or <italic>not addressed</italic>. A rating of <italic>strong</italic> indicates that the measure addresses multiple dimensions of the criterion. A rating of <italic>adequate</italic> indicates that the criterion is addressed sufficiently but not in depth or on multiple dimensions and uses multiple informants for the criteria. A rating of <italic>minimal</italic> indicates that items or techniques address the criterion on a single dimension, rely on a single informant, or criteria are confounded within the item. <italic>Not addressed</italic> indicates that the criterion is not addressed by the measure.</p>

<title>Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for ASD</title>
<p>The <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411415090">APA, 2000</xref>) outlines more specific and extensive criteria for diagnosis of ASD than those set forth by the federal special education eligibility definition.

As noted previously, the umbrella term in the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> is Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). Under the PDD umbrella, Autistic disorder, Rett’s disorder, Childhood Disintegrative disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and PDD-NOS are included. The <italic>DSM-5</italic>, currently in preparation, may incorporate significant changes, including removal of Rett’s disorder, and subsuming of Asperger’s and PDD-NOS as differing expressions of autistic disorder, but is not expected to be published before May 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411415090">APA, 2010</xref>). For a diagnosis of autistic disorder, the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> requires the positive identification of a total of six (or more) diagnostic criteria listed under the categories of social impairment, impairment in communication, and repetitive/restricted/stereotyped behavior patterns. At least two of these criteria must reflect social impairment, with a minimum of one criterion each from the categories of impaired communication and repetitive/restricted/stereotyped behavior patterns. For Asperger’s disorder, the criteria do not include impairment in communication and in fact specify that there is no clinically significant general delay in language or cognitive development. PDD-NOS is a residual category for similar patterns of severe and pervasive impairment that do not meet <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> criteria for autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, or any other specific disorder.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534508411415090">Table 4</xref> presents the diagnostic criteria for Autistic Disorder and the extent to which each of the measures under analysis address the specific criteria. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534508411415090">Table 4</xref> also provides a rating of the contribution of each measure to treatment planning. Each measure on each criterion has a rating of <italic>strong</italic>, <italic>adequate</italic>, <italic>minimal</italic>, or <italic>not addressed</italic>. A rating of <italic>strong</italic> indicates that the measure addresses multiple dimensions of the criterion. A rating of <italic>adequate</italic> indicates that the criterion is addressed sufficiently but not in depth or on multiple dimensions and uses multiple informants for the criterion. A rating of <italic>minimal</italic> indicates that items or techniques address the criterion on a single dimension, rely on a single informant, or the criteria are confounded within the item. <italic>Not addressed</italic> indicates that the criterion is not addressed by the measure.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Research and knowledge related to ASD are increasing at a dramatic rate and drive the need to provide appropriate assessment and intervention within the schools. Multidisciplinary teams in schools are being called on with increasing frequency to identify, assess, and develop treatment and educational plans for these students. A particular concern is the significant variability in how these assessments and services are implemented from state to state and across school districts, given that federal guidelines are general and consideration of diagnostic criteria requires multiple measures. Across disciplines, such as school psychology, speech–language pathology, occupational therapy, special education, neurology, and psychiatry, training emphasis, terminology, and assessment tools vary. A further issue is the lack of specific measures of ASD for children who speak languages other than English, even though federal regulations are very specific about selection of tests that take into account language and cultural issues.</p>
<p>To accurately assess ASD, assessment professionals must have knowledge of diagnostic characteristics, differential diagnosis, and implications for interventions. To become proficient in assessing ASD, the school psychologist and/or other assessment professional should undergo specific training, with extensive practice opportunities with tools such as the <italic>Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised</italic>, <italic>Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule</italic>, and <italic>Psychoeducational Profile–3rd Edition</italic>, under the supervision of a trained expert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411415090">Ikeda, 2002</xref>). A comprehensive school-based autism assessment should go beyond ASD-specific measures to include cognitive assessment, adaptive functioning, direct observations in natural settings, parent and teacher interviews, assessment of emotional/behavioral functioning, audiological and speech–language assessment, sensory-motor assessment, and medical evaluation. A possible extension of this analysis might include consideration of additional measures, including very recently published instruments. Although this assessment process is challenging, time consuming, training intensive, and initially costly, thorough and precise diagnostic procedures may provide valuable information for planning early intervention for children with ASD that may ultimately greatly improve prognosis.</p>
