<body>
<p>Tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) has become the gold standard for speech rehabilitation following total laryngectomy since Drs Blom and Singer first introduced this technique in 1980. However, changes in the nature of the laryngectomized population have occurred with organ preservation being more common with individuals who previously may have required a total laryngectomy at initial presentation. These organ preservation techniques include radiation with or without chemotherapy or modifications of partial laryngectomy procedures. Thus, the typical patient who undergoes a total laryngectomy today has failed organ preservation, has disease that recurred after treatment, or initially presented with more extensive disease requiring larger and more complicated reconstructive procedures. It is not known how these variables affect TEP prostheses.</p>
<p>The purpose of a voice prosthesis is dual. First, the device acts as a stent to maintain patency of the fistula tract that is otherwise subject to closing within 24 hours. Second, the prosthesis serves as a 1-way valve to permit airflow from the lungs to enter the esophagus when the tracheostoma is occluded, which then vibrates the upper esophageal sphincter and generates sound. Optimal fit of the voice prosthesis then depends on the distance between the 2 flanges or the length of the shaft. Factors that may influence the distance between the esophageal and tracheal flanges include inflammation, false tracts, recurrent disease, fungal infection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812449293">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812449293">2</xref></sup> fistula migration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812449293">3</xref></sup> and granulation tissue.</p>
<p>Initial prosthesis fitting is known to change in the first 1 to 2 months after tracheoesophageal puncture related to the overall healing process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812449293">4</xref></sup> After this initial adjustment phase, size is anticipated to be stable. However, Leder and Sasaki<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812449293">5</xref></sup> reported that changes in size may continue to take place over time. They emphasized the need to continually resize patients at follow-up visits to ensure that the prosthesis size is of the appropriate length and diameter. Despite this important report, patients with non-indwelling prostheses continue to be instructed in self-care of their devices without a means of resizing. An additional factor that requires attention is the change in insurance regulations and reimbursement policies that have limited the stock that many facilities are able to carry on hand. Finally, the Leder and Sasaki<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812449293">5</xref></sup> report was published prior to the changes in the laryngectomized population that now include salvage laryngectomies that are performed for recurrent and/or persistent disease following organ preservation or for more advanced disease necessitating a larger excision and flap reconstruction. It is not known if these changes in the patient population undergoing total laryngectomy may further affect the voice prosthesis fit. All of these factors stimulate interest in restudying the stability of prosthesis sizing.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate prosthesis size stability, with no change in length or diameter, over time and determine which factors influence a need for change in size.</p>

<title>Methods and Materials</title>
<p>Retrospective chart review was performed on all individuals who had previously undergone total laryngectomy and TEP. Patients were included only if they had a minimum of 3 years of consistent and consecutive follow-up data after their TEP regarding prosthesis management. Three years of consecutive data were chosen to represent a consistent amount of data on their prosthesis wear as an average indwelling prosthesis lasts 6 months. In addition, only patients with consecutive changes at our clinic were included to eliminate prosthesis-changing practices that might be different either philosophically or by nature of the practice. The data from the first 3 months after the puncture were omitted because of natural evolution of the fistula tract with wound healing that would be expected to result in prosthesis length and/or diameter changes. Although 1 month is considered the average amount of time for adequate healing, it was elected to extend this period to 3 months to eliminate patients with delayed healing. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (#20110093; Longitudinal Analysis of Tracheoesophageal Speech Rehabilitation in Patients following Total Laryngectomy).</p>
<p>Data reviewed included demographic variables of age at time of TEP, ethnicity, and sex. Medical variables studied included whether laryngectomy was performed as primary treatment vs salvage surgery for recurrent or persistent disease, primary closure vs flap reconstruction, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, and primary vs secondary TEP. Social variables studied included prior use of tobacco and alcohol intake.</p>
<p>Multiple prosthesis factors were evaluated, including the type of device and indwelling vs non-indwelling. The choice for an indwelling prosthesis is made based on a number of individual factors, including how long the patient can wear a non-indwelling prosthesis before requiring replacement and if he or she will be using a heat-moisture exchange system (HME) and/or hands-free valve that benefits from having the prosthesis strap trimmed to facilitate improved seal of a housing device circumferentially about the stoma. For patients not using these housing devices who are able to wear a non-indwelling prosthesis at least 3 months before requiring a change, the benefit of an indwelling device with its increased cost is not felt to be warranted. All patients are initially fit with a non-indwelling prosthesis that has a diameter of 16 French and length determined after using a sizing device to measure the distance between the anterior esophageal opening of the fistula and the tracheostoma. The diameter of the prosthesis is only increased to a 20 French if the fistula dilates on its own or to facilitate easier cleaning of the inner shaft of the prosthesis. All patients included in this study were dependent on the speech-language pathologists for prosthesis changes and thus did not change the prosthesis on their own. Follow-up visits to change a prosthesis were made by the patients when they either experienced leakage when drinking liquids and/or had difficulty speaking.</p>
<p>The primary outcome variable was the need to change prosthesis size either in length and/or diameter vs consistent use of the same-size device with each recorded visit to change the prosthesis. For the purposes of this study, prosthesis size stability was defined as either stable (maintaining the same size both in length and diameter at each replacement) or unstable (requiring a minimum of 1 change in length or diameter over the study period). The number of size changes over time was recorded as well.</p>
<p>Data were analyzed using the SPSS system (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois), and simple statistics (means, range, and standard deviations) were calculated to describe the overall group. Fisher exact test was then computed to assess the difference between the groups.</p>

<sec id="section8-0194599812449293" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Fifty patients who met criteria for study inclusion were identified. Mean age was 64.7 years (range, 43-86 years), with 41 (82%) being men and 9 (18%) women. Ethnicity included 16 (32%) whites, 30 (60%) Hispanics, 2 (4%) African Americans, and 2 (4%) other. Surgical management was equally divided between those who underwent total laryngectomy as primary treatment for their laryngeal cancer vs those who had a salvage laryngectomy for persistent or recurrent disease, with 25 in each group. Extent of surgery included laryngectomy with or without neck dissection alone in 40 patients (80%) and laryngectomy with a flap reconstruction in 10 (20%). Thirty-one (62%) patients used an indwelling prosthesis vs 19 (38%) with a non-indwelling prosthesis. Fifteen patients underwent primary TEP, whereas 25 underwent secondary puncture. All patients had a red rubber catheter placed at the time of puncture and were fit with a prosthesis approximately 1 week later or when medically cleared for placement.</p>
<p>Prosthesis size was stable in only 5 (10%) patients and unstable in 45 (90%), as they were changed at least once. The number of prosthesis size changes ranged from 1 to 24, with 17 patients requiring 5 or more changes in size over time. The time to the first change after the 3-month period was extremely variable and was not found to be a significant factor. Multiple parameters were evaluated for their potential relationship to the stable vs unstable outcome, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812449293"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. The only factor that demonstrated statistical significance was sex (Fisher exact test = 0.035), with women being more likely to have a stable prosthesis size over time.</p>

<p>Because of the small size of the stable prosthesis group (n = 5), each subject was analyzed individually to determine specific relationships and trends (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812449293"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). It can be seen that the 5 patients with stable prosthesis size tended to be older (71 vs 64 years). Eighty percent of the stable group had their laryngectomy as their primary treatment vs 46% of the unstable group. Four of the 5 in the stable group had postoperative radiation, and only 1 of the 5 in the stable group was a former smoker and consumed alcohol in the past. Only 1 subject in the stable group had previously undergone microlaryngoscopies for excision of a carcinoma in situ and dysphagia in the larynx with salvage laryngectomy being performed for recurrent disease. Three of the 5 in the stable group or 60% used an indwelling prosthesis. It should also be added that all TEPs were performed as secondary procedures in the stable group.</p>

<p>Further factors were investigated that might conceivably affect prosthesis stability, including the use of a stoma vent, which is typically necessary in cases of stomal stenosis. This factor was deemed important to investigate due to the potential for pressure against the tracheal flange of the prosthesis. At this institution, stomal stenosis is a selection criterion for candidacy for a secondary TEP. All attempts are made to manage the small stoma with a vent prior to undergoing a secondary puncture. Patients with stomal stenosis are fit with a stoma vent and initially wear it 24 hours, removing it only for cleaning purposes. They are then gradually weaned from dependence with only a small number (less than 5) of patients in this study needing more consistent use. However, only 2 of the 5 (40%) with stable prosthesis size and 19 of the 45 (42%) with unstable prosthesis size used a stoma vent at some point after their laryngectomy surgery. Although not statistically significant, this seems to point to an area that requires further investigation. Analysis of the number of changes over time revealed a range from 1 to 24, with a mean of 5.5 changes being required. Thirty-three (66%) used a 16 French diameter vs 17 (34%) in the larger 20 French size. Thirty-one patients (62%) wore an indwelling device vs 19 (38%) who continued to use a non-indwelling device. Again, none of these factors were significantly associated with the group that was stable with regard to prosthesis size.</p>

<sec id="section9-0194599812449293" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Correct prosthesis size is critical to the success of surgical voice restoration after total laryngectomy. The best fit is one that allows the tracheal and esophageal flanges of the prosthesis to fit snugly against the tracheal and esophageal walls, respectively. Prostheses that are too long run the risk of abutting the posterior esophageal wall with voicing, restricting air flow, and diminishing voice output while also potentially facilitating aspiration due to pistoning within the fistula tract. On the other hand, a prosthesis that is too short runs the risk of allowing the distal portion of the fistula to either narrow or close. This may require repeat surgery to create a new tracheoesophageal fistula or reopening of the posterior portion. It is expected that these problems can be prevented by the placement of an accurately sized voice prosthesis.</p>
<p>In this study, only 5 patients or 10% of the study group had a stable prosthesis size after the first 3 months following puncture and for at least 3 years of follow-up. The pattern of change was random over the study period, with change events occurring throughout the studied time period. This rate of prosthesis stability was lower than expected and supports the Leder and Sasaki study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812449293">5</xref></sup> recommending continued surveillance of prosthesis size for the life of the patient.</p>
<p>Sex was the only statistically significant factor that distinguished the 2 groups. However, this finding must be interpreted with caution given the lower numbers of women in the overall subject population (9 of 50). Thus, although sex was a statistically significant factor, it should not necessarily be interpreted as a defining characteristic of patients expected to have a higher likelihood of a stable prosthesis size over time.</p>
<p>It was originally anticipated that patients who underwent laryngectomy as their primary treatment vs those who had salvage surgery for either recurrence or persistent disease might have more stable fistula size for prosthesis placement as the tissues would not be expected to have the degree of fibrosis and scarring from prior treatments. Although not statistically significant, the trend in this study supports that hypothesis as 4 of 5 patients with a stable prosthesis size had laryngectomy as their primary treatment vs 21 of 45 who had unstable prosthesis size.</p>
<p>In general, patients in the smaller group who were stable with prosthesis size tended to be older, were more likely to be women, were less likely to use a stoma vent, and were more likely to have had a laryngectomy as their primary treatment. Despite the small numbers in the stable group (n = 5), or perhaps because of the small numbers, this study demonstrates the importance of continued assessment of prosthesis size at each prosthesis replacement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599812449293" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this study demonstrate that 90% of patients who underwent total laryngectomy and TEP required a change in their prosthesis size beyond the first 3 months of expected healing. Although not statistically significant because of the small size of the group that had a stable prosthesis size, this finding is nonetheless important and compelling. These results support the need for continual reassessment of the fistula tract when changing the prosthesis to ensure appropriate fit. Optimal prosthesis management involves more than routine prosthesis change with a new prosthesis of same size—it requires a reevaluation of appropriate prosthesis size based on examination of the fistula tract with each change. Refitting of the prosthesis may be necessary at any follow-up visit, and facilities where these patients are evaluated should stock an appropriate range of prosthesis sizes for this eventuality.</p>
