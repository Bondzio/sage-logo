<p>A new addition to the established and long-standing Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries (TOTC) series, this work is an updated version of the previous Deuteronomy volume within that grouping (i.e. that of J. A. Thompson, published in 1974). In view of the titular or putative ‘secondness’ of Deuteronomy itself, and particularly bearing in mind its own reworking of existing tradition, it might be tempting to think of such a replacement volume as merely a revising or updating of the original commentary. That is not the case, however. Woods’ volume is distinctive in its own right and stands, or otherwise, on its own merits; beyond the series identification, it has no direct association with its predecessor. The justification for a new volume is twofold. On the one hand, the series editors wish it to remain conversant with recent scholarship in respective subject areas, and a cursory glance through the volume’s bibliography confirms some degree of success in that. On the other hand, the particular (confessional) hermeneutical agenda of the TOTC series is apparent here; it seeks to let the biblical text address contemporary concerns, and the editors explicitly note how the issues of the world of the second half of the twentieth century differ from those of the first half of the twenty-first. This version also varies from its predecessor by dealing with units of text, rather than offering a verse-by-verse analysis. Each unit is divided up into three constituent sections that respectively set the <italic>Context</italic> of the unit under discussion, offer detailed <italic>Comment</italic> on appropriate interpretative matters, and then lay out the <italic>Meaning</italic> of the given section. The <italic>Comment</italic> sections are the bulkiest, and form the vast majority of the book’s content; the <italic>Context</italic> material, by comparison, remains fairly brief. (Chapters 29-30, for example, have just three short paragraphs on such contextual matters, which seems a little insubstantial bearing in mind the significance of this portion of the canonical text). There is also an Additional Note section, in which the contested theme of <italic>herem</italic> is examined in more detail.</p>
<p>The volume opens with a lengthy introduction covering customary matters such as authorship, dating and structure, but also includes issues such as the ‘theology’ of the text. Asserting that Deuteronomy is ‘self-conscious of being a <italic>theological</italic> work built around a number of important themes’ (p. 55), Woods considers four such themes that he believes to be foundational to the theological agenda of the text: God, people, the Land and worship. Alongside these, he also includes discussion of other pertinent Deuteronomic literary characteristics (for example, its covenant form, or the thou/you address feature). Particularly useful is his discussion of the key role of Deut 4-5 in reading the whole book; chapter 4 offers ‘reading instructions’ for the text (notably the experience of the nearness and holiness of God at Horeb), whilst the subsequent chapter acts as a ‘blueprint’ for what will be outlined in the rest of the Deuteronomic text. In particular, he proposes that chapter 5 is some form of guide or map for the central legal material of chapters 12-26, and that the individual commandments of the Decalogue are expanded, explicated or developed in turn within the subsequent discourse. Whilst others have made this argument before (and Woods rightly acknowledges this), the reasoning for it is laid out in accessible fashion and helps particularly the uninitiated reader make sense of the core legal material.</p>
<p>The rest of the volume then proceeds with unit-by-unit discussion of the Deuteronomic text. Such discussion is divided up into four chapters or sections, reflecting the four-part structure Woods accords to Deuteronomy (1:1-4:43; 4:44-28:68; 29:1-30:20; 31:1-34:12), and it is reasonably comprehensive in its content. At the same time, the exegesis is not especially detailed; instead, the comments are more like an annotated guide through the verse units, with the implicit invitation to the reader to delve further if required. As such, one senses that it is not trying to replace other commentaries (except its predecessor!), but rather to encourage its readers to explore such scholarship for themselves should they so wish. It therefore stands on the shoulders of other commentators; Christiansen’s work on the concentric structure of Deuteronomy would be one such debt. But that does not mean that the volume does not have any distinctive aspect of its own. It notably, for example, places a particular emphasis on the way in which Deuteronomy makes connections between Horeb and the burning bush of Exodus. Likewise, in terms of articulating the nature of the text, Woods places great measure on its ‘Boundary’ or threshold aspect, emphasizing its testamentary character.</p>
<p>Because of this style or approach, one suspects that this volume will ultimately be fit for its intended purpose. It offers a solid overview to the text of Deuteronomy, covering key interpretative issues, but without assuming too much prior knowledge on the part of the reader, nor getting too bogged down in exegetical detail. No familiarity with Hebrew is required; it is not a technical commentary, though transliterated words and phrases are alluded to in the course of the analysis. Overall, Deuteronomy specialists will not find much here that is new, but one suspects that they are not the intended audience; instead, it will be likely be of more value for those relatively uninitiated into Deuteronomic studies, or to those preaching on, or through, the canonical book. Indeed, Woods himself admits that his initial interest in the text was piqued by homiletic considerations (he concludes that Deuteronomy ‘is arguably Old Testament preaching at its best’ (p. 9)), and the volume seemingly reflects a lifetime of engagement and interaction with the biblical text. Thus its particular strengths would include making what can initially seem like a formidable text become more accessible to lay readers, whilst also enabling those unfamiliar with the scholarly horizons of Deuteronomy to become aware of the contributions of previous commentators.</p>
<p>Both the volume and the series reflect a more conservative perspective on the biblical text, and, in the <italic>Meaning</italic> sections at least, there is little sense that a passage or unit might have a plurality of interpretative options, or that it might be heard differently according to the particular reading context. ‘Meaning’ is thus a fairly fixed entity, and relates primarily to how the unit functions within the overall message of the book. Consequently perhaps, it takes more conservative positions in regard to <italic>crux</italic> issues within the text itself. It suggests, for example, a relatively early dating for much of the material and notably wants to limit any association with Josianic reform, at least as the main factor in dating material. Likewise, it is less interested in the way that Deuteronomy reworks or revises material (perhaps tending to minimize the differences in the Decalogue between Deuteronomy and Exodus); it is a text of covenant <italic>renewal</italic> rather than covenant <italic>replacement</italic>. At the same time, the volume is reasonably well aware of the scholarly landscape and of variant positions, and points the reader in the direction of where to go for more in-depth discussion should that be required. It is still likely, though, that it will appeal to a more conservative readership.</p>
<p>Although it begins with a comprehensive bibliography, the book lacks any indices – textual, thematic or authorial. As it stands, one cannot easily locate where Woods engages with scholarship mentioned in the bibliography, or where particular textual links are made; bearing in mind that the ‘feel’ of the book is as an overview, and that it is a commentary which readers will dip into, rather than read cover-to-cover, this feels like a not insignificant omission – one cannot so easily follow up on themes or topics raised. But that is a relatively minor criticism; for those charged with preaching on the text of Deuteronomy, this volume offers a very handy and accessible resource.</p>

<p>This is a remarkable achievement by one who has done so much else with his life, and is beautifully produced by the publishers, at a very reasonable price. Translation of the Bible, as Tom Wright points out in his excellent preface, is something you have to do afresh in every generation. It is also the first thing that happened in the history of the Church, as we read in the electrifying narrative of Acts 2. How does one review a translation, though? For ‘traduttore, traditore’, as the Italians have it, and (experto crede), all translation fails, at least sometimes. There is a horrid temptation for the reviewer to go straight to ‘my favourite texts’ or the well-known heffalump traps, just to enjoy a bit of ‘translator-bashing’. This translation, though, has a lovely feel to it, and there are some commendably imaginative renderings, such as ‘pile up a jumbled heap of words’ for βατταλoγέω, or ‘a bunch of …’, to translate a plural in a polemical setting (Mt 7:23); or ‘you little-faith lot’ at Matthew 8:26, which is a bit rougher, but still works well enough. There are many such touches throughout the translation. Not all scholars will agree with all of them (and what else, you may ask, is new?), but Tom Wright has a very attractive feel for English; and the mere fact of producing a fresh translation that is both scholarly and written in non-repellent language makes this work a major triumph. Some excellent maps make the story clear, especially of Acts, where the translation is just as readable as it should be, of that beautifully told tale. And it starts, happily, ‘Dear Theophilus’.</p>
<p>If it is permitted to be churlish, I should have welcomed some notes that told us why he went for this translation rather than that; it would have been instructive to hear him ‘thinking aloud’. Space does not here permit a thoroughgoing investigation for the reader, but let me offer a few texts, to give the flavour; see, for instance, what you think of the following: Romans 1:1 ‘Paul, a slave of King Jesus’. Ephesians 3:2 ‘I’m assuming, by the way, that you’ve heard about the plan of God’s grace that was given to me to pass on to you?’ 1 Timothy 4:7 ‘Keep away from worthless myths, the sort of things some old women mumble on about’. Philemon 10-11: ‘Onesimus, “Mr Useful”. There was a time when he was useless to you; but now he’s very useful to you and to me’. Jude 1: ‘Judah, slave of Jesus the Messiah, brother of James, to those who are called, the people whom God loves, and whom Jesus, the Messiah, keeps safe!’. Revelation 22:14: ‘God’s blessing on those who wash their clothes, so that they may have the right to eat from the tree of life and may enter the city by its gates’.</p>
<p>This is a really commendable enterprise, whatever you may think of this or that rendition of a verse, and I welcome it warmly as an addition to the list of versions that you should have on your shelf.</p>
