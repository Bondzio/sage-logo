<abstract>
<p>The article attempts to empirically test a multi-dimensional and multi-level hierarchical structure of service quality in Life Insurance services in India. The study draws evidence from India to develop and compare a second-order hierarchical model with a first-order model to draw better insight into the determinants and structure of perceived service quality in Indian Life Insurance services. Five component dimensions of perceived service quality were extracted through exploratory factor analysis from a list of initially generated 38 items of service quality from literature and expert review. The five dimensional structure was then tested through confirmatory factor analysis using first-order and second-order reflective model to determine the best model of perceived service quality. The second-order reflective model was found to be of better fit based on indices of fit using AMOS ver 4.0 software. The results showed that both the first-order and hierarchical second-order models are of excellent fit after some modification based on modification indices. The second-order model was however accepted for interpretation of results since it has relatively better fit (significantly lower chi-square value and better fit indices values) and is a more parsimonious model. The results thus provide support for a multi-dimensional and multi-level hierarchical structure of service quality as suggested by Brady and Cronin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2319510X13483513">2001</xref>), third in Life Insurance services in India. The results show that perceived service quality of Life insurance services is a multi-dimensional second-order construct consisting of the primary dimensions of Service Delivery, Sales Agent Quality, Tangibles, Value and Core Service.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The improvement of customer-perceived service quality has been found to be correlated with increases in profits through revenue expansion. Several studies have emphasized the relevance of service quality in financial services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2319510X13483513">Akamavi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2319510X13483513">Newman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2319510X13483513">Sureshchandar et al., 2003</xref>). Enhanced service quality perceptions are considered to be significant antecedents of customer loyalty (or disloyalty) of customers to a service provider (for example, Bloemer et al., 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2319510X13483513">Durvasula et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2319510X13483513">Zeithaml et al., 1996</xref>), which is a driver of customer retention (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2319510X13483513">Bansal &amp; Taylor, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2319510X13483513">Jacoby &amp; Kyner, 1973</xref>). Delivering excellent/superior services is thus important for life insurance service providers. In insurance, high retention rates are close determinants of economic performance of companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2319510X13483513">Diacon &amp; O’Brien, 2002</xref>). Insurers in the USA consider retention as the most important determinant of economic success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2319510X13483513">Moore &amp; Santomero, 1999</xref>), as the selling cost of an insurance policy is not recovered unless the policy is renewed for at least three or four years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2319510X13483513">Zeithaml et al., 1996</xref>). The industry has recognised that the quality of services and the achievement of customer satisfaction and loyalty are fundamental principles of successful marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2319510X13483513">Marwa, 2005</xref>). However, insurers are often accused of not being prepared to take all the necessary actions for adapting the quality of their services to their customers’ preferences, especially when customer needs are changing through time. They, often, find it difficult to envision and understand what service attributes and at what levels, are required to indicate high quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2319510X13483513">Sureshchandar et al., 2002</xref>). Some, mistakenly, even define service quality as their promptness in compensating sincere customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2319510X13483513">Anderson &amp; Skogh, 2003</xref>) while others confuse service quality with generosity, that is, their readiness to compensate more than a policy states or a court of justice orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2319510X13483513">Roos, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Measuring and managing perceived service quality in Life insurance services is difficult since they are credence products with very few tangible cues that signal quality. Consumers mostly rely on extrinsic cues like brand image to evaluate perceived service quality for ‘pure’ services such as insurance, which is highly relational and has very few tangible cues. It’s difficult to compare prices due to lack of price signals and specialised customer needs. Further, the outcomes cannot be immediately evaluated as the consequences of purchase are evident after some time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2319510X13483513">Durvasula et al., 2006</xref>). Consumers thus have difficulty in developing purchase expectations due to limited understanding of and familiarity with the service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483513">Johnston et al., 1984</xref>). As a result, customers seek long term relationships with their insurance companies and sales agents in order to reduce perceived risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2319510X13483513">Berry, 1995</xref>). An insurance policy is mostly sold by an agent who, in 80 per cent of the cases, is the customer’s only contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2319510X13483513">Crosby et al., 1990</xref>). Consumers therefore rely on the quality of the agent’s advice and her integrity to manage perceived risk in purchasing life insurance products. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2319510X13483513">Toran, 1993</xref>). However, high quality service (defined as exceeding ‘customers’ expectations’) is rare in the life insurance industry Slattery, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2319510X13483513">1989</xref>). Quality is at the core of what the insurance industry does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2319510X13483513">Toran, 1993</xref>) but customer surveys show that customers want more responsive agents with better contact, personalised communications from the insurer and quickly solved problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2319510X13483513">Pointek, 1992</xref>). Though there have been studies in literature on measurement of service quality and its behavioural outcomes in life insurance services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2319510X13483513">Durvasula et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2319510X13483513">Tsoukatos 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2319510X13483513">2008</xref>), there is a need for developing and validating a customised measure of service quality in Indian context especially since it has been established that service quality dimensions are culture and context specific that is, they are not generaliseable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2319510X13483513">Carman, 1990</xref>) and there is a dearth of studies on development and validation of a service quality scale in Indian Life Insurance services context.</p>
<p>Additionally, perceived service quality in Life Insurance services has been mostly measured as a first-order model though there is a debate in literature that the construct of service quality may be better understood as a multi dimensional hierarchical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2319510X13483513">Carman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2319510X13483513">Dabholkar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2319510X13483513">McDougall &amp; Levesque, 1994</xref>). There has been little effort to empirically test such a structure in Life Insurance services using multiple and multi level dimensions. There is theoretical support in literature for a multi dimensional, multi level model of service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2319510X13483513">Carman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2319510X13483513">McDougall &amp; Levesque, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2319510X13483513">Dabholkar et al., 1996</xref>). Since there has been no effort to develop and test a hierarchical second-order model leading to possibility of model bias, this study draws evidence from India to develop and compare a second-order hierarchical model with a first-order model to draw better insight into the determinants and structure of perceived service quality and therefore this study responds to the call for developing and testing a multi level model or hierarchical model of customer perceived service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2319510X13483513">Dabholkar et al., 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Life Insurance Services in India</title>
<p>Prior to 1999, the monopoly service provider was government owned Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) which came into existence on 1st September, 1956 after nationalisation of all the 245 companies engaged in life insurance business. Following the submission of report by Malhotra committee in 1993, the Life Insurance sector was opened up for the private sector in 1999 with the passage of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) Act in 1999 which established IRDA to regulate the insurance business in the country. IRDA allowed foreign participation up to 26 per cent in equity shareholding of private companies. This resulted in expansion of the Industry with private life insurers gaining market share and fast growth rates (over 100 per cent annually for two private insurers). The life insurance industry registering an annualized growth rate of 16.1 per cent between 2002–2003 and 2010–2011 as total new business premium of life increased from ₹ 9707.45 crore in 2000–2001 to ₹ 92988.71 crore in 2007–2008. While LIC’s new business premium increased from ₹ 9700.98 crores in 2000–2001 to ₹ 59182.20 crores in 2007–2008, at an annualised growth rate of 26.7 per cent, the number new business policies of private life insurers increased from 25 lakhs in 2002–2003 to 132.61 lakhs in 2007–2008. The growth rates were driven by launch of new products, development of new distribution channels such as bancassurance and internet and aggressive advertising and selling. However, ratio of life insurance premium to GDP is still 4 per cent compared to 6–9 per cent in developed markets. This is due to under penetration especially in the mass market (65 per cent) and rural areas (40 per cent). Thus, there is still enormous potential for growth in the Indian Life insurance sector for which the drivers are rising income levels, demographic shifts, growth in urban population and this requires need for life insurers to strengthen core product proposition, professionalise the sales agency channel, develop alternate channels of distribution and tap opportunities in health insurance and pension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2319510X13483513">Andrade et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Service Quality and Service Quality Measurement</title>
<p>As per Lewis and Booms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2319510X13483513">1983</xref>), ‘service quality is a measure of how well the service level delivered matches customer expectations.’ The dominant paradigm of conceptualising service quality is the disconfirmation paradigm wherein ‘Delivering quality service means conforming to customer expectations on a consistent basis’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2319510X13483513">Parasuraman et al., 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>The most widely adopted measure of service quality is SERVQUAL by Parasuraman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2319510X13483513">1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2319510X13483513">1988</xref>) who suggested that “service quality could be measured as the gap between perceived and expected service through five dimensions: Reliability—ability to perform the promised service dependably and accurately, Responsiveness—willingness to help customers and provide prompt service, Assurance—ability to inspire trust and confidence, Empathy—the caring, individualised attention provided to customers and Tangibles—the tangible elements of service. They also suggested that the framework can, can be adapted or supplemented to fit the characteristics of specific research needs of a particular organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2319510X13483513">Parasuraman et al., 1988</xref>). Though SERVQUAL has been criticised on conceptual and methodological grounds (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2319510X13483513">Bebko, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2319510X13483513">Buttle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2319510X13483513">Yoon &amp; Ekinci, 2003</xref>), it has been successfully used in various context (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2319510X13483513">Tahir &amp; Wan Ismail, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2319510X13483513">Tsoukatos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2319510X13483513">Ugboma et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-2319510X13483513">
<title>SERVPERF</title>
<p>Cronin and Taylor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2319510X13483513">1992</xref>) developed the SERVPERF scale, a performance-based approach for measuring service quality based on customers’ perceptions of service performance only. They reported that the performance-based approach has a higher degree of model fit and explains more of the variations in an overall measure of service quality than the gap-based SERVQUAL scale. Though Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry (1994) defended measuring customers’ expectations as appropriate in order for marketing practitioners to understand customers’ expectations, they (Zeithaml, Berry and Parasuraman,1996) later conceded that the performance-based approach is more appropriate if the primary purpose of a research is to explain the variance in a dependent construct.</p>

<sec id="section6-2319510X13483513">
<title>The Hierarchical Approach</title>
<p>Though there is lack of consensus on the conceptualisation and measurement of service quality, various academics agree that service quality is a multidimensional, higher order construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2319510X13483513">Brady &amp; Cronin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2319510X13483513">Carman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2319510X13483513">Dabholkar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483513">Gronroos, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2319510X13483513">Parasuraman et al., 1988</xref>). Brady and Cronin‘s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2319510X13483513">2001</xref>) and Dabholkar et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2319510X13483513">1996</xref>) findings revealed that service quality as perceived by customers is a multi dimensional hierarchical construct consisting of customer’s overall perception of service quality; the primary dimensions; and the sub-dimensions. The sub-dimensions are treated as first-order factors of the service quality construct and the primary dimensions are treated as second-order factors of the service quality construct. The hierarchical approach has been adopted by a number of marketing academics for measurement of service quality in various service contexts such as agribusiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2319510X13483513">Gunderson, Gray &amp; Akridge, 2009</xref>), airport services (Fodness &amp; Murray, 2007), education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483513">Clemes, Gan &amp; Kao, 2007</xref>), electronic services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2319510X13483513">Fassnacht &amp; Koese, 2006</xref>), health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2319510X13483513">Dagger, Sweeney &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>), mobile communication services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2319510X13483513">Kang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2319510X13483513">Lu et al., 2009</xref>),recreational sport industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2319510X13483513">Alexandris, Kouthouris &amp; Meligdis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2319510X13483513">Ko &amp; Pastore, 2005</xref>), transport services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2319510X13483513">Martínez &amp; Martínez, 2007</xref>), travel services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2319510X13483513">Martínez &amp; Martínez, 2008</xref>) and a variety of other service businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2319510X13483513">Liu, 2005</xref>). However, no study could be found in literature which construes service quality in retail banking as a hierarchical construct.</p>

<title>Service Quality Measures in Life Insurance Services</title>
<p>Service quality studies have mostly adopted the five dimensional SERVQUAL model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2319510X13483513">Parasuraman et al., 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2319510X13483513">1988</xref>)/SERVPERF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2319510X13483513">Cronin &amp; Taylor, 1992</xref>) approach or some customised version of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2319510X13483513">Tsoukatos &amp; Rand, 2006</xref>). Several measurement instruments have been developed following the debate on disconfirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2319510X13483513">Gro¨nroos, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483513">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2319510X13483513">Parasuraman et al., 1985</xref>) vs performance-only measurement of service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2319510X13483513">Cronin and Taylor, 1992</xref>) with a number of researchers defending the main stream disconfirmation measurement (SERVQUAL) and others disputing it (mostly in favour of SERRVPERF) on theoretical and operational grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2319510X13483513">Buttle, 1996</xref>). However, the research community is unanimous in that service quality is a multidimensional phenomenon that requires multi-item measures. Tsoukatos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2319510X13483513">2008</xref>) applied the IP analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2319510X13483513">Martilla and James, 1977</xref>) that treats service quality as a function of customers’ importance and performance perceptions related to salient service attributes to measure service quality in Greek Life Insurance services. Durvasula et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2319510X13483513">2004</xref>) developed and used a six item scale based on quality of service provided by the Sales agent on dimensions of reliability, helpfulness, responsiveness, empathy, trustworthiness and product knowledge for measurement of service quality with customers of Life Insurance services in Singapore. However, there has been a dearth of customized scales developed for specific service and cultural context in Life Insurance Services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2319510X13483513">
<title>Conceptual Approach</title>
<p>The construct of service quality is defined as consumer’s judgement about an entity’s overall excellence or superiority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2319510X13483513">Zeithaml, 1997</xref>). Though the construct has largely been conceptualized and modeled as a first-order multi dimensional construct, there is still lack of consensus on the structure of the concept especially the dimensionality and the level. Brady and Cronin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2319510X13483513">2001</xref>) developed a third-order factor model of service quality which consisted of three primary dimensions (interaction quality, physical environment and outcome quality) and nine sub dimensions (attitude, behaviour and expertise form the sub dimension of interaction quality; ambient conditions, design and social factors form the second sub dimension of physical environment quality and waiting time, tangibles and valence form the third sub dimension of outcome quality). All variables were tested by factor analysis and the model is similar to Rust and Oliver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2319510X13483513">1994</xref>) three component model of service quality. Dabholkar, Thorpe and Rentz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2319510X13483513">1996</xref>) found that the SERVQUAL model has not been adequately applied to retail stores service quality and they therefore developed a 28 item scale to measure customer perceptions of retail service quality using a hierarchical second-order model. This study aims to develop and test a second-order hierarchical model of service quality as perceived by customers of Life Insurance services in India. The hypothesised construct is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2319510X13483513">Figure 1</xref> below and is adapted from the study by Dabholkar et al.

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section10-2319510X13483513">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data was collected over a period of twelve weeks from customers of branches of two banks (one public sector and one private sector bank), in city of Delhi and the National Capital Region of Delhi (NCR), in India in September–November 2011. The data was collected through personal interview method by getting a questionnaire filled up by customers at various times of the day in branches of the banks. Graduate business school students trained in the mall intercept technique worked as pairs and surveyed a convenience sample of 350 customers of the selected participating banks during business hours (11 am– 3 pm) over a period of twelve weeks. Purposive method of sampling was adopted for selection of respondents in the bank branches. The method of personal interviews is superior to self-administered questionnaires in perceptual or attitudinal surveys (Groves, 1989), while face-to-face administration maximises response rates and field researchers’ availability to answer respondents’ questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2319510X13483513">Ibrahim et al., 2006</xref>). Convenience/Purposive sampling is very common in service-quality/customer-satisfaction research since random sampling requirements for population homogeneity, are very difficult to meet in practice and high costs associated with locating chosen population items (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2319510X13483513">Brady et al., 2002</xref>; Semeijn et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2004). There was no evidence of sampling bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2319510X13483513">Tsoukatos, 2009</xref>) as the demographic attributes of the sample was representative of the population.</p>
<p>In general, most consumers were willing to assist in the project and were eager to express their concerns about the participating banking services. A small gift (a ball point pen worth ₹ 5) was provided as a gesture of appreciation for their time and effort. Exit intercept survey method was used as it has the advantage of immediate retrieval and capturing of customers’ experiences with the participating banks. Given the specific focus of this study, the exit intercept method was thought to be most desirable. Upon approaching the customers, the interviewers identified themselves and explained that the study was an independent project initiated by a local university. After obtaining their consent, the respondents were requested to rate their response to the three sections of the standard questionnaire (to be described later) at the study site. The questionnaire consisted of two sections, that is the first section on personal data and the second section on 31 item service quality measurement scale. Subjects were recruited based on having had at least one-year prior experience with the branch of the sampled bank. A target of 350 questionnaires based on sample size requirements was collected of which 284 were found usable. The demographic characteristics and distribution of the respondents was as follows: 72 per cent of the respondents belonged to the age group less than 35 which are fairly representative of banking population as 70 per cent of the population of India is below 35 years of age. The proportion of males was 73 per cent and females was 27 per cent; 20 per cent of respondents were having family income less than ₹ 150000 per annum; 25 per cent ₹ 150000 to ₹ 300000, 35 per cent above ₹ 300000 and less than ₹ 500000; 81 per cent had savings account and 17 per cent had current account with the bank that they patronised;. The highest educational qualifications of the respondents were 55.9 per cent Graduates and 32.2 per cent Post Graduates.</p>

<title>Sample Size Adequacy Assessment</title>
<p>The sample size for the study was determined based on the proposed method of data estimation and scale reliability and validity. The proposed method of data estimation for structural equation modelling is Maximum likelihood (ML) which is the most commonly used estimation method in SEM. It maximises the probability that the observed co variances are drawn from a population that has its variance-covariance matrix generated by the process implied by the model, assuming multivariate normality. Multivariate normality is not generally met in practice and several estimation methods for overcoming the fit problems arising from its absence have been developed. ML, itself, is fairly robust against violations from multivariate normality. The minimum sample size recommended for ML estimation is at least 200, according to some researchers. Others suggest at least fifteen times the number of observed variables or five times the number of free parameters including error terms or ten times the number of free parameters for strongly kurtotic data (Golob, 2003). Where the proposed SEM is the basis for a research hypothesis, ad hoc rules of thumb require that there are at least 10 observations per indicator (free parameter) in setting a lower bound for the adequacy of sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2319510X13483513">Nunnally, 1967</xref>). Bollen (1989) stated that ‘though I know of no hard and fast rule, a useful suggestion is to have at least several cases per free parameter” and Bentler (1989) suggested a 5:1 ratio of sample size to number of free parameters. Marsh and Bailey (1991) concluded that the ratio of indicators to latent variables rather than just the number of indicators, as suggested by the rule of 10, is a substantially better basis on which to calculate sample size, reiterating conclusions reached by Bonoma (1982).</p>
<p>Yurdugu¨ l (2008) proved that the minimum sample size required for coefficient alpha depends on the largest eigenvalue of Principal Components Analysis (PCA). For a value exceeding 6.00, the sample alpha co efficient is a robust estimator of the population alpha. Regarding factorial analysis, the minimum sample size depends on the extent to which factors are over determined and level of communalities exceeds 0.70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2319510X13483513">Fabrigar et al., 1999</xref>). The target sample size of 350 for this study meets all these requirements.</p>

<title>Sampling Method</title>
<p>Two leading banks, that is, one from the public sector (SBI bank) and the other from the private sector (ICICI bank) were selected for the study as they have over <bold>7</bold>0 per cent of the deposit and loan share of market in NCR of Delhi. The two banks selected for the study are also reflective of the maximum banking population in this region. A list of branches of the two selected banks in Delhi and NCR of Delhi were accessed from their official organisational websites for the study. The sample size of branches for the study was determined based on the target sample size of customers for the study which was 350. Thus a two stage model was adopted. In stage one, for the purpose of data collection, the entire NCR region was divided geographically into territories of Delhi, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad and Noida.</p>
<p>To make the sample representative of the entire population, total of 30 branches were visited to collect data from 300 customers.</p>
<p>The total number of branches in Delhi is almost 9 times that of the other regions. To keep the sample representative of the entire population, total of 30 branches were selected for data collection. The sample size of 30 branches was selected based on the target sample size of 350 respondents assuming 15–16 respondents per branch. The number of branches to be visited in each geographic region was calculated based on their weighted presence in that region. Thus, to determine the total number of branches to be sampled in Delhi, the ratio of 36.4 was obtained by multiplying 0.76 (66/86). Thus, 18 branches of LIC were selected for the study in Delhi. The specific branches selected in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida and Gurgaon for the study were generated randomly from the list of branches in each geographic territory for both LIC and ICICI Prudential.</p>

<sec id="section13-2319510X13483513">
<title>Measurement Instrument</title>
<p>The survey instrument was developed based on literature review. As no standard scale is available in literature which includes all the items of service quality, 38 items were identified from literature primarily from the studies by Tsoukatos and Rand, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2319510X13483513">2006</xref>) and Durvasula et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2319510X13483513">2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2319510X13483513">Table 2</xref>). The initial list was subject to expert review with the help of expert reviews by academicians, branch managers and branch operations managers of select public and private sector Life Insurers in Delhi national capital region (NCR). Two items that is ‘wide range of services to offer’ and ‘adequate information available on products and services’ were added based on expert recommendations. The list of 38 items used for the study were further pilot tested for wording and meaning of the statements. The wordings of the 38 items were modified based on pilot studies with customers from across various socio economic groups.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was undertaken in two steps. In the first stage, exploratory factor analysis using principal component method of analysis with varimax rotation was undertaken to identify the underlying dimensions of service quality for the 38 item service quality scale used for data collection. An orthogonal rotation was chosen for the sake of simplicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2319510X13483513">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>). Attributes and factors were excised from the data set to achieve uni-dimensionality. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a useful preliminary technique for scale construction, but a subsequent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is necessary to evaluate and refine the resulting scale for uni-dimensionality (Churchill, 1976). Reliability tests were then performed on each factor of the multi-item multi dimensional scale and are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2319510X13483513">Table 4</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section15-2319510X13483513">
<title>Exploratory Factor Analysis</title>
<p>A factor analysis was run on the data to establish the uni-dimensionality of the multi-item service quality scale. The data was found appropriate for factor analysis based on KMO measure of sampling adequacy = 0.098 and Bartletts test of sphericity having chi square value of less than 1.0 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.000), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2319510X13483513">Hair et al., 2006</xref>).An exploratory (principal component) factor analysis conducted on the 38-item (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2319510X13483513">Table 2</xref>) performance scales (that is, the SERVPERF approach) resulted in a six-factor solution using principal component method of factor extraction and varimax method of rotation. All the six components were extracted for further analysis as they had eigenvalues greater than 1.0. with cumulative variance explained equal to 69.1 per cent. The factor loadings are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2319510X13483513">Table 3</xref>. Five items (Item Numbers 3, 8, 18, 34 and 36) which did not load on any component (factor loading less than 0.5) were not selected for further analysis. A six factor service quality model was finally selected as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2319510X13483513">Table 3</xref>. The dimensions were named as Service Delivery, Sales agent quality, Tangibles, Value, Empathy and Core Service.</p>

<p>The structure pattern of the six dimensional initially extracted factor structure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2319510X13483513">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2319510X13483513">3</xref>) was further evaluated for construct validity through confirmatory factor analysis using AMOS ver 4.0. The six-factor measurement model was specified and the model parameters were estimated using AMOS ver 4.0. The items were restricted to loading on their respective factors. However, the model was not found acceptable based on indices of fit. An examination of the modification indexes of the specific estimates revealed that several items loaded on different exogenous factors. Model was further modified by deleting the items with cross loading and factors which were affecting model fit based on modification indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2319510X13483513">Byrne, 2001</xref>) which eventually resulted in a model with good fit. The final model with acceptable fit was a six dimensional model with twenty attributes having significant loading on their respective factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2319510X13483513">Figure 3</xref>). The service quality dimensions and the attributes (with standardised regression co-efficients) are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2319510X13483513">Table 4</xref>.The service quality scale model’s overall goodness-of-fit indicators were: GFI = 0.946; CFI = 0.982; NFI = 0.958; RMR = 0.045; RMSEA = 0.048, as given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2319510X13483513">Table 4</xref>. The Chi-square statistic of 179.66 with 107 degrees of freedom, was significant as it was within 2 times the number of degrees of freedom (Bollen, 1989). The t statistics were significant for each path and the critical ratios were more than twice the standard errors (Joreskog &amp; Sorbom, 1989). The model was of suitable fit and its parsimony was supported. All the t-values of the estimated parameters were significant (p &lt; 0.001). The reliability of the dimensions of the scale were measured by Cronbach alpha score for the five dimensions of perceived service quality that is Core Service as 0.806; Service Delivery as 0.844; Tangibles as 0.844; Reliability as 0.794 and Competence as 0.730, respectively. Convergent validity was evaluated according to criteria identified by Fornell and Larcker (1981). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2319510X13483513">Table 5</xref>, the results of the CFA revealed good to strong loadings (ranging from 0.659 to 0.911).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the study was to develop and empirically validate a hierarchical model of service quality for Life Insurance Services and to compare it with a first-order model. The initially hypothesised models were of unacceptable fit and had to be modified. The results of both the finally accepted models are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2319510X13483513">Table 5</xref>. The results show that both the first-order and second-order hierarchical model of Life Insurance Services quality are of acceptable fit based on fit indices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2319510X13483513">Table 5</xref>) that is ratio of chi square to degrees of freedom was less than 2.0 for both the models. Other indices of fit that is Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) was greater than 0.9, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) was greater than 0.95, Standardised Root mean square Residual (RMR) was less than 0.05, Root Mean Square Error of approximation (RMSEA) was less than 0.05 and p test for close fit was greater than 0.5 indicating excellent fit. The standardised factor loadings ‘β’ of all the 18 items on their respective sub dimensions of the construct was above 0.50 (p=0.000) and average variance extracted for all the sub dimensions of the construct were greater than 0.50 indicating convergent and discriminant validity of the construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2319510X13483513">Diamantopoulos &amp; Siguaw, 2000</xref>). Discriminant validity of the sub dimensions was also established by running several CFA’s for each possible pair of constructs (sub-dimensions) and then fixing the correlation between the two constructs at 1. In each case, the correlation between the fixed and free solutions were significant at p &lt; 0.05 or higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483513">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions and Managerial Implications</title>
<p>The study attempted to develop and validate a second-order hierarchical model of service quality for Life Insurance services from Indian consumer’s perspective. The study also aimed to compare a first-order and second-order model of Life Insurance services quality in order to generate better insight into the structure of the construct. The results showed that both the first-order and hierarchical second-order model are of excellent fit after some modification based on fit indices. The second-order model was however accepted for further analysis since it has relatively better fit (significantly lower chi square value and better fit indices values) and is a more parsimonious model. The results thus provide support for structure of service quality as suggested by Brady and Cronin (2001) third in Life Insurance services in India. The results show that perceived service quality of Life insurance services is a multi-dimensional second-order construct consisting of the primary dimensions of Service Delivery, Sales Agent Quality, Tangibles, Value and Core Service. The attributes which comprise the dimensions are as follows: Service delivery dimension: Insurer has best interests of customer at heart, Insurer’s employees are available for assistance, Insurer provides services in timely manner and insurer’s employees are trustworthy; Sales Agent quality dimension: sales agent recommends policy as per customer needs, sales agents have good communication skills and sales agents are trustworthy; Tangibles dimension: Insurers offices are modern, Insurers offices are visually attractive and employees are well dressed; Value dimension: premium rate structure is competitive, location of branches are convenient, working hours for customers are convenient; Empathy dimension: life insurer fulfils promises in a timely manner towards claims settlement, life insurer is sympathetic with customers problem, life insurer’s employees are courteous, employees provide individual attention to customer needs and employees understand customer needs; core service dimension: insurer has wide range of services to offer and insurer has adequate information available on products and services.</p>
<p>However, the most important dimensions of service quality based on the standardised regression coefficient values of primary dimensions on overall service quality are Empathy, Service delivery and Sales agent quality. The study thus provides empirical support for the importance of face to face interaction and relationship building between the Life Insurer’s employees and sales agents with customers. Though core service and Tangibles also influence Overall service quality, their affect is relatively lesser than the other three dimensions. Life Insurance service providers thus need to develop and enhance the relationship building skills of their employees and sales agents in order to provide higher quality of service.</p>

<title>Study Limitations and Future Research Directions</title>
<p>Since the study has been conducted with a sample of customers of Life Insurance services with evidence from Indian context, generalisation of the findings should be made with care. Secondly common method bias was not tested. Thirdly, the model is based on the 38 attributes identified from literature and expert opinion and an expanded list of attributes could lead to development of a better model. Further studies in varied service and cross cultural context could lead to better understanding of the structure of the service quality construct of Life Insurance Services.</p>
