<abstract>
<p>In this study, the behavior of thick magnetorheological elastomers is experimentally investigated. Two types of magnetorheological elastomer specimens of varying concentrations, with circular and rectangular shapes having thicknesses from 6.35 mm to a maximum of 25.4 mm, are prepared. The magnetorheological elastomer samples are studied under quasi-static compression and double lap-shear tests. The shear and the Young’s moduli of the magnetorheological elastomers are obtained under different applied magnetic fields. It is observed that the field-induced change in the modulus is independent of the thickness of the magnetorheological elastomer and is only dependent on the iron particle concentration and the magnetic field strength. With the increase in the applied magnetic field, it is observed that the change in modulus varies from a linear behavior at lower applied magnetic fields to a nonlinear one at higher magnetic fields. It is found that compressive and shear moduli only depend on the applied magnetic fields and are independent of the sample thickness. In addition, the maximum induced change in material modulus under compression is shown to be 99%, whereas in shear it is found to be 68% when compared to its off-state.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) consist of micrometer-sized magnetizable particles with a nonmagnetic elastomeric matrix. MREs are often referred to as the solid-state analogues of magnetorheological (MR) fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12448286">Wang and Gordaninejad, 2007</xref>). However, the basic difference between them is that MR fluids typically operate in the postyield region, whereas MREs operate in preyield regime. Therefore, MREs are characterized by the field-dependent modulus, while MR fluids are characterized by field-dependent yield stress. The dipole interaction between the iron particles within the nonmagnetizable matrix is considered as the prime reason for the field-dependent behavior of MREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12448286">Ginder et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X12448286">Jolly et al., 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X12448286">1996b</xref>). The chain-like structures are in a lower dipole energy state when compared to the host matrix. Any displacement, due to shearing or compression, of these particles within the matrix requires an external work on them to move the particles from their minimum energy state. As a result, MREs have a higher modulus under applied magnetic field. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X12448286">Jolly et al. (1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X12448286">1996b)</xref> carried out double lap-shear tests to measure the shear modulus of different specimens of MREs. This had involved the recording of complex modulus of various specimens at different frequencies, strains, and applied magnetic fields. It was reported that there would be a monotonic increase in the change in the modulus, with the increase in the volume percentage of iron in the MRE specimen. The results indicated that for a specimen that has 30% by volume of iron, the change in modulus would increase to nearly 0.6 MPa. At strains above 1–2%, they also observed a significant drop in MR effect and a corresponding increase in the field-dependent energy dissipation (tan δ), which they had attributed to the magnetic yielding of the particles in the chains.</p>
<p>The unique characteristics of MREs may lead to applications in vibration and noise control. The field-dependent elastic modulus of MRE can be utilized as a variable stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12448286">Deng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12448286">Ginder et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X12448286">Hoang et al., 2009</xref>). In case of the conventional elastomeric materials, their stiffness and damping can only be tailored to specific applications, but cannot be adjusted independently or optimized for all operating conditions. Due to their field-dependent modulus, electromechanical devices can benefit from having a tunable stiffness with the application of MREs.</p>
<p>The structured MREs are orthotropic materials which are composed of elastomeric matrix material filled with aligned magnetizable particles. The requirement of high magnetic field to cure or activate these materials has restricted the use of MREs to small dimensions with thicknesses less than 10 mm. There has not been any study to explore the scale effect of MREs on their material properties; thus, there is no warrant that measurements in MREs are not influenced by the specimen dimensions and shapes. Therefore, investigation of the mechanical behavior of MREs for a wide range of thicknesses, both in material preparations and characterizations, is necessary in practical applications.</p>
<p>The focus of this work is to study the behavior of MREs with different shapes and scales. Two types of MRE specimens with circular, cylinder, and rectangular shapes with thicknesses from 6.35 mm to a maximum of 25.4 mm are prepared. Each size of MRE, made of different iron particles from 30% to 70% by weight, is tested under quasi-static loading conditions, when subjected to various magnetic fields. The effect of dimension on the shear and compressive moduli of MRE materials are studied by evaluating the stress–strain results as a function of the thickness of the MRE samples.</p>

<title>Fabrication of MRE samples</title>
<p>In the present study, carbonyl iron particles, with an average particle size of 2–8 µm, are embedded in a two-part silicone elastomer to make the MRE samples. Iron particle concentrations varying between 30 wt.% and 70 wt.% are used. The two parts of the silicone elastomer are mixed well in the ratio of 10:1. The mixture is degassed and placed under a magnetic flux density of over 1.0 T to cure. During this curing process, the iron particles align along the direction of the magnetic field. For compression tests, circular cross-sectional samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12448286">Figure 1</xref>) and for shear tests, rectangular cross-sectional samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12448286">Figure 2</xref>) are prepared with thicknesses varying from 6.35 to 25.40 mm.</p>

<p>An electromagnetic mold is designed and built to prepare MRE samples with thicknesses ranging from 6.35 to 25.4 mm. Using the three-dimensional ANSOFT electromagnetic analysis, an optimum design for the electromagnet is finalized by considering each size of MRE samples with various iron particle concentrations. The sectional view of the electromagnet with the mold fixtures is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X12448286">Figure 3</xref>. Based on this final optimized design, the generated magnetic field applied on each MRE sample, which is a function of input currents, is obtained. The magnetic field flux density applied on MRE samples with 30 wt.% iron particle concentration during curing process with different thicknesses for different applied currents are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12448286">Figure 4</xref>. It appears that for all thicknesses of MRE samples which are prepared in this study, the curing magnetic flux density can reach up to 1.0 T with applied current of 5 A.</p>

<title>Experimental setup</title>
<p>The lap-shear experimental setup, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12448286">Figure 5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12448286">(b)</xref>, consists of a U-shaped steel structure which houses an electromagnet to generate magnetic field and fixtures to hold the MRE in place. To ensure maximum flow of magnetic flux to the MRE, the samples are glued to the 2.54-mm-thick steel plates which are 12.70 mm wide. A commercially available adhesive is used to connect the samples to the steel plates. Two pieces of MRE are sandwiched between three thin steel bars. Shear force is applied on the MRE samples by pushing the center steel bars. Magnetic field is applied along the direction of particle alignment in the MRE. The MRE test specimen has an area of 285.16 mm<sup>2</sup> (22.45 mm × 12.70 mm) and four different thicknesses ranging from 6.35 to 25.40 mm.</p>

The MRE test specimen rests on a T-shaped steel support base with a steel piston compressing it from the top. To be able to record the stiffness variation at the on-state (i.e. when the magnetic field is applied), an optimized magnetic flow path is designed, such that there is a maximum magnetic flux through the MRE specimen.</p>

<p>The force on the MRE is applied by a 20-kip biaxial Instron system and its magnitude is recorded by a load cell. The corresponding displacement of the moving piston, which represents the sample deformation, is recorded through the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) displacement sensor. Each MRE sample is subjected to quasi-static displacements. The raw data of displacements and the corresponding force responses of the MRE samples under shear are processed to convert the force into stress and the displacement into engineering strain. The measured force divided by the initial cross-sectional area of the sample is the stress. The engineering strain is expressed as the ratio of total displacement to the initial thickness of the MRE samples on which the forces are being applied.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X12448286">Figure 7</xref> presents the typical stress–strain results showing the hysteresis behavior of MREs at different applied electric currents under quasi-static shear tests for a maximum strain of 5%, 10%, and 15%, respectively. At small strains, it is observed that the stress–strain results follow an elliptical path that demonstrates a linear viscoelastic behavior of MREs. At higher strains, it is observed that in the presence of an applied magnetic field, the samples show signs of residual deformation at the time of unloading, in which a steep drop of stress occurs. The higher the applied magnetic field, the higher is the drop in stress value. This phenomenon may be due to the break up of particle chains, when the MRE is under postyield deformation. It is also noticed that this deformation disappears when the magnetic field is not applied. It appears that the applied magnetic field induces a pseudoplastic effect in an MRE in shear.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12448286">Figure 8</xref> presents the typical stress–strain results showing the hysteresis behavior of MREs at different applied currents under compression tests. An offset in stress is observed for the on-state stress–strain results when compared to the off-state stress–strain data. This is due to the fact that there is an additional pull on the load cell when the electromagnet is turned on. This offset, however, does not affect the measurements of Young’s modulus of the MRE samples. It is shown that with the applied magnetic field, the elastic modulus as well as the energy dissipated in the MRE increases.</p>

<p>Initial modulus is obtained for the stress–strain results and it is demonstrated that even in the case of thick MRE, with increase in strain in the MRE, the shear modulus decreases. This explains the highly nonlinear stress–strain behavior at high strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12448286">Abramchuk et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X12448286">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1045389X12448286">10</xref> demonstrate this phenomenon. One can also observe that both the shear and compressive moduli are almost constant when the strain is in the range of 1%. Thus, in this study, the modulus of the MRE samples is determined at strains less than 1% which is taken as a linear elastic deformation. With the increase in the applied magnetic field, a profound increase in shear and compressive moduli is observed for all the MRE samples tested.</p>

<p>An electromagnetic finite element analysis is carried out to determine the imposed magnetic field strength on the MREs. Compressive and shear test setups are modeled and analyzed in three-dimensional electromagnetic analysis, using ANSOFT Maxwell 3D. The magnetic permeability of MRE depends on the iron particle concentration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X12448286">Carlson (2004)</xref> proposed an empirical relation for the induced magnetic flux density, <italic>B</italic>, and applied magnetic field, <italic>H</italic>, for an MR fluid with various iron particle concentrations. This relation is also valid for MREs in estimation of their magnetic permeability. The following equation is used in the electromagnetic analysis.</p>

<p>The compressive Young’s modulus and shear modulus of MREs as a function of applied magnetic field strength are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1045389X12448286">Figure 15</xref>. Both compressive and shear moduli only depend on the applied magnetic fields and are independent of the sample thickness. The maximum induced change in material modulus under compression is shown to be 99%, whereas in shear it is found to be 68% when compared to its off-state.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Both shear and compression tests show that the MR effect of MREs increases with the iron particle concentration. The thickness of testing specimens has no effect on the measurement results at the on-state. The field-induced change in modulus is independent of the thickness and is only dependent on the magnetic field strength and the iron particle concentration in the MRE. The controllability of the MRE is more in compression mode than in shear mode.</p>
