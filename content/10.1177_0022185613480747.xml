<abstract>
<p>This article examines the industrial relations issues that have attracted most time and attention of employers and their associations during 2012, as well as the public, policy-directed rhetoric in which they have engaged. A first element is representative and institutional, in a year of substantial change in senior association personnel. Accordingly, we examine associations’ engagement in the Fair Work Act Review and Modern Awards Review. At the company level, we examine important instances of employers’ own industrial relations activism as well as their responses to labour shortages in the resources sector. We also briefly discuss recent dramatic job cuts in public sector employment. Throughout the year, through their public rhetoric, the heads of some of Australia’s largest companies have led an incessant, vociferous attack on the federal Labor government. Industrial relations have increasingly become a central plank in this attack. Some of this appears to have a policy basis but it is overwhelmed by a backward-looking desire for a more anti-union, anti-collective bargaining legislative regime. Calls for maximising managerial prerogative appear within a loud but misplaced assertion that productivity improvement requires regressive changes to industrial law.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185613480747"><title>Introduction and overview</title>
<p>A number of central concerns continued to dominate employer association thinking and action on behalf of their members. The first was unhappiness with aspects of Labor’s Fair Work Act, 2009 (Cth) (FW Act). Until the August 2010 election, most associations accorded the new Labor government some legitimacy regarding industrial relations (IR) legislation. After that, associations and individual business leaders returned to attack Labor’s law, their attacks intensifying during 2011 and 2012. Central was a spirited espousal of maximising managerial prerogative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022185613480747">Todd, 2011</xref>), increasingly couched as problems with ‘productivity’. This focus on employer prerogatives also appeared in associations’ litigation strategies and in public sector IR.</p>
<p>As ever, differences among associations reflected particular situations facing member companies, whether associated with industry, size, location or vulnerability to international circumstances. Resources sector employers expressed continuing concern over the ready availability of sufficient labour, particularly in Western Australia (WA) and Queensland. The ongoing resources boom kept the Australian dollar at worryingly high levels for many employers in manufacturing, tourism, education and retailing. Building and construction – apart from resources projects – also had a difficult year, while small and medium enterprises (SMEs), as usual, claimed to be having most troubles with labour costs and ‘overly’ employee-protective workplace regulation.</p>
<p>The next section discusses the tenor of hostile public discourse from employers towards Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s minority Labor government and its FW Act. Then follow sections on two major areas of association representational activity: engagement in the 2011–2012 review of the Act, and engagement in the separate review of its modern awards framework. Subsequent sections discuss employers and industrial militancy, significant shifts in state public sector IR, employer responses to labour shortages, minimum and executive pay outcomes, and employer association leadership changes.</p>
<p>Our sources include official reports, transcripts and tribunal decisions, policy documents, and submissions from a number of associations, as well as media reports. We also conducted interviews with senior officials from six associations: one national, the rest state-based. The latter were strongly slanted to the three major eastern states. To balance geographical bias, we scanned the business media for articles on other states, particularly WA. The associations covered firms of all sizes and most industries. We are very grateful to them for their time and goodwill.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185613480747"><title>Rhetorical themes and tone</title>
<p>We encountered a strong IR consensus across associations’ institutional policies and explanations. Central were criticisms of the FW Act for constraining employer flexibility and choice; emboldening unions; increasing labour costs; and fostering payment of ‘go away money’ in unfair dismissal cases. These criticisms were repeated, amplified and given greater public impetus by much more aggressive pronouncements from prominent business people such as current BHP Billiton chair Jac Nasser, his predecessor Don Argus, the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of BHP Billiton (Marius Kloppers) and Rio Tinto (Tom Albanese), and former head of the Future Fund David Murray. Representing very big business, they addressed a broader argument, alleging poor productivity trends and blaming the legislation. For some, hostility to the FW Act seemed an extension of their hostility towards Labor over its mining and carbon taxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185613480747">Maiden, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022185613480747">Verrender, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022185613480747">Yeates, 2012b</xref>). While many company executives may be ideologically opposed to Labor, the consistency and venom of criticism was startling. As one business journalist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022185613480747">Yeates, 2012b</xref>: 8) put it: ‘With an ever-growing list of gripes, executives have unleashed a torrent of abuse on Canberra, questioning Labor’s legitimacy, honesty, and motivation for key policies.’ Given that many were speaking in the context of their own botched decisions, falling share prices and unhappy shareholders, this diversion was perhaps not unexpected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022185613480747">Yeates, 2012b</xref>: 8).</p>
<p>Prominent business people joined federal opposition leader Tony Abbott in talking down Australia’s economy. By infusing public discourse with an overwhelmingly bleak sense of Australia’s policy environment and economic condition, they unleashed what Keynes memorably called an economy’s ‘animal spirits’ on those sectors – retail, hospitality and tourism – most vulnerable to consumer sentiment. Popular media amplified this gloom. In fact, one international survey found that Australians were gloomier about financial and job security than their counterparts in most of Europe, including Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022185613480747">Greenblat, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet Gillard’s government has achieved a raft of significant legislation. Furthermore, during 2012, the Australian economy remained an international high achiever: very low inflation, solid economic growth, low and stable unemployment almost no public debt, very low interest rates, highly favourable terms of trade and a stellar currency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185613480747">Gittins, 2012b</xref>). As for declining productivity performance, there has been no observable relationship between Australia’s recent legislative IR frameworks and productivity performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185613480747">Gittins, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185613480747">Green et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185613480747">Irvine, 2012</xref>; see also Jefferson and Preston, this issue).</p>
<p>Employer circles seemed frustrated that the Coalition, scarred by the 2007 electoral defeat of John Howard's Coalition government, refused to expose itself on IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022185613480747">Yeates, 2012b</xref>). Their rhetoric suggested that they were alternatively trying to force a weakened Labor into a corner over IR or to develop public acceptance of their policies ahead of Abbott winning power in 2013. Employer associations sometimes argued as if employers in Australia face the most hostile IR regime in the developed world; in reality, in many ways, they enjoy one of the most accommodating. Association pronouncements hanker for a return to the repressive regime under the Work Choices Act 2005. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022185613480747">Todd (2012: 345)</xref>, ‘employer groups are rejecting any suggestion that the benchmark for evaluating the current legislation should include a longer history than Work Choices’. This overlooks how much Australians disliked Work Choices and its role in the Coalition's 2007 defeat. Certainly, the New South Wales Business Chamber’s (NSWBC’s) own commissioned research on employer attitudes uncovered a much more nuanced, pragmatic and open set of expectations and perceptions than much of the rhetoric suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185613480747">Australian Business Foundation and NSWBC, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Heather Ridout, as CEO of Australian Industry Group (AI Group), had typically taken a longer and less ideological view, continuing AI Group’s traditionally non-partisan and sometimes visionary contributions to policymaking. However, her discourse abruptly changed during 2011, becoming much more critical of Labor on IR. Several months later, she announced her resignation to join the Reserve Bank of Australia’s board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022185613480747">Todd, 2012: 349</xref>). Gossip from the employer association world said that Ridout had lost the confidence of influential elements within AI Group for being too close to Gillard’s government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185613480747">Skulley, 2011</xref>). Whether this is true is less important than that these views appear common.</p>
<p>How to explain this more hostile atmosphere? Since August 2010, Labor’s minority government has appeared vulnerable within and outside parliament. Its opinion polling results appeared catastrophic. Conservative forces – political, media and corporate – have continued to attack its legitimacy. Confirmation of this phenomenon came when several CEOs, including Gail Kelly (Westpac Bank) and Cameron Clyne (National Australia Bank), very publicly broke ranks. Kelly, calling on big business to work with the government, criticised businesses that ‘run an agenda through third parties or the media’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185613480747">Johnston, 2012</xref>: 1). Clyne pointed out the silliness of business claims linking poor productivity to Labor’s IR law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185613480747">Cornell, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The focus on IR law as a lightning rod for employer hostility had some basis in reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185613480747">Ker, 2012b</xref>). Employers in resources and construction found that the combination of labour shortages and resurgent union bargaining power in a few states created substantial difficulties in getting some jobs started and others completed. Furthermore, union attempts to entrench their position and even some level of militant payback were predictable responses after employers and their associations had strongly supported Howard’s attempts to destroy unionism and collective bargaining via Work Choices.</p>
<p>More generally though, for employers engaged in it, enterprise bargaining retains few of the transformational attractions promised during the 1980s and 1990s; it still involves bargaining – sometimes including gridlock, conflict and concessions – and the other party is mostly a union. Enterprise bargaining can also involve more time and resources than more centralised bargaining and still leave an unhappy organisational legacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022185613480747">Thornthwaite and Sheldon, 2012</xref>). Employer calls for a reinstated Work Choices-like regime reflect a wish to shrink the need to bargain and to provide less powerful counterparts whenever bargaining is unavoidable. Other, less vocal associations are now calling for easier recourse to arbitration of intractable disputes, arguing, for example, that the 2011 Qantas dispute showed that the public interest test threshold is too high.</p>
<p>However, in late 2012, with signs that Labor’s electoral chances appeared less hopeless, Business Council of Australia (BCA) President Tony Shepherd proposed a complete change of rhetoric and approach, one where government, business, unions and community groups would engage in national collaboration during 2013, perhaps in the spirit of the Labor government Accords between 1983 and 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022185613480747">Shepherd, 2012</xref>). This reflected recognition that those Accord processes had tamed previous outbreaks of union militancy, while fostering rising productivity and economic development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0022185613480747"><title>The Fair Work Act Review</title>
<p>In December 2011, the federal government established the Post-implementation Review of the Fair Work legislation with a three-member Review Panel. Most larger associations became involved, dedicating substantial resources to a demanding process. This started with a detailed submission in February, then a supplementary submission in March, plus a detailed response to the Report in August–September. Association submissions often came after extensive consultations with members. For instance, from November 2011, Australian Business Industrial (ABI) and NSWBC held discussions with members in both major cities and regional centres to gauge concerns with the Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185613480747">ABI and NSWBC, 2012</xref>). For its part, the Australian Mines and Metals Association (AMMA) drew on commissioned research of members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185613480747">Kates, 2012</xref>). Subsequently, many associations also composed submissions to the Senate Inquiry into the Fair Work Act Amendment Bill 2012 (Cth), launched to implement some of the Report’s recommendations.</p>
<p>Employer opinion was well represented in the Review process. Associations produced more than a quarter of initial submissions and almost one-third of supplementary submissions. Individual employers and management consulting companies contributed a further 10% of initial submissions. Employer associations and individual employers also attended, by invitation, 13 of the Review Panel’s 26 meetings and roundtables. For instance, AMMA attended with representatives from Chevron Australia Pty Ltd, Farstad Shipping and Woodside Energy Ltd, and the BCA with Qantas, Cochlear and BHP Billiton representatives (Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185613480747">DEEWR), 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Submissions from the employer side proposed changes to most Parts of the Act<italic>.</italic> According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185613480747">AI Group (2012a: 3)</xref>: ‘There is much common ground between the major industry groups on key problem areas and a shared view that the FW Act is hampering productivity growth, workplace flexibility and competitiveness.’ While acknowledging that some parts of it worked well, they framed their submissions in terms of its failure, in its current form, to provide business with sufficient flexibility and adaptability; the damaging consequences of increased union rights of access and bargaining; and the ‘highly collectivist, centralised and one size fits all character of workplace regulation being inimical to best practice workplace-based relations and outcomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185613480747">Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), 2012a</xref>: 2). This type of criticism meshed with employer (association) preferences for individual statutory ‘agreements’ in the vein of Work Choices’ Australian Workplace Agreements. In its submission, AMMA argued that workplaces should have the option of voting for an ‘internal regulation’ model of industrial relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185613480747">AMMA, 2012</xref>: 6) and ACCI called for the introduction of a system for the <italic>registration</italic> of <italic>confidential</italic> individual ‘agreements’ by Fair Work Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185613480747">FWA) (ACCI, 2012a: 17</xref>).</p>
<p>For its part, the Master Builders’ Association (MBA) submission noted that in removing employers’ ability to <italic>initiate</italic> protected industrial action, the protected action provisions effected a ‘further asymmetry in bargaining power [which] dramatically imbalances the intended operation of the Fair Work Act’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185613480747">MBA, 2012</xref>: 65). This reflected widespread opinion among employer associations, despite employers’ greater use of lockouts and other aggressive industrial action during the last two years (see later section on industrial militancy).</p>
<p>Employer associations were, however, disappointed with the Review Panel’s Report – ‘Towards more productive and equitable workplaces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185613480747">DEEWR, 2012</xref>) – released mid-year. They particularly blamed the narrowness of its terms of reference, which, they considered, had confined the Review to considering the extent to which the legislation was operating as intended, and how its operation could be improved consistent with those legislative objects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185613480747">AI Group (2012b)</xref> described the Report as a ‘lost opportunity to make changes to deliver sustained, higher rates of productivity growth’ and observed that ‘in virtually all key areas, its recommendations fell short’. The Chief Executive of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185613480747">ACCI, Peter Anderson</xref>, went further, arguing that the Panel had taken ‘a Pollyanna view of the industrial relations system, especially its hope that union problems experienced by employers will cure themselves’ (Anderson, 2012). For ACCI, the review had been ‘bitterly disappointing’ in displaying ‘an alarming indifference to the economy’s need for better workplace regulation to support productivity, competiveness and a softening labour market’. Some of our interviewees, however, observed that it was clear that the Review was never going to examine underlying principles, nor lead to the legislative amendments that associations wanted.</p>
<p>While different associations focused on the Act’s purported impact on industry sectors and types of businesses they represent, there was a common refrain that the Act failed to promote increased productivity across the board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022185613480747">Knott, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022185613480747">Willox, 2012</xref>). Mostly, critiques focused on how, when compared to Work Choices, the FW Act has weakened employers’ freedom to contract. Central to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185613480747">BCA’s (2012)</xref> submission, therefore, was that the Act reduced managerial prerogatives by enhancing union bargaining power, enabling unions to prolong negotiations, reducing agreement options and increasing the scope of enterprise bargaining. The BCA also complained about encroachments on management autonomy over using contractors, employee rosters and overtime. For the BCA, the overall effect jeopardises development of constructive direct relationships between employers and employees, disrupts workplace relationships, and limits employers’ flexibility and speed in responding to changing circumstances.</p>
<p>Another important element drawing sustained employer criticism was the FW Act’s mechanisms for negotiating Individual Flexibility Agreements (IFAs) in modern awards and agreements. Associations argued that the model award flexibility clause failed to provide for meaningful flexibility arrangements between employers and employees. This criticism has not been sufficiently substantiated in surveys of employer members. For instance, AMMA’s commissioned research among resources sector employers found that 56.5% of respondent human resources (HR) and IR managers were satisfied with the flexibility provided by IFA clauses they had negotiated, and an even higher proportion (60%) were satisfied with the flexibility gained from FWA’s model flexibility clause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185613480747">Kates, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in submissions to the Review Panel, employer voices consistently called for changes to the IFA provisions, including section 203(6), which enables an employer or employee to terminate unilaterally an individual agreement with 28 days’ notice. To create greater certainty, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185613480747">AMMA (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185613480747">AI Group (2012b)</xref>, for example, argued for IFAs that can operate for up to four years. Employers also sought legislative changes to counteract the perceived refusal of unions to agree to include ‘meaningful’ flexibility terms in enterprise agreements. While the Review Panel recommended changes to the Act that would have met some employer concerns, its recommendations were not included in the Amendment Bill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022185613480747">Willox, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Employers had also been unhappy with provisions regarding greenfield agreements in Part 2-4 of the FW Act. In sectors where greenfield sites are most common, such as construction and resources, they had argued that the legislation not only intrudes unjustifiably into their managerial prerogatives, but also restrains investment in new projects. Yet, contrary to employer demands, the Fair Work Review recommended legislative amendments that would have strengthened collective bargaining at greenfield sites: that employers be required to bargain in good faith with <italic>all</italic> unions eligible to represent any employee on a greenfields project; and that <italic>any</italic> party, not only employers as at present, be allowed to seek an arbitrated outcome.</p>
<p>Major employer bodies strongly criticised those recommendations and proposed alternatives. AI Group argued that the proposed changes would be unworkable because potentially, clients, head contractors and employers would have to bargain with many unions before work could commence and tribunals would be able to determine labour costs without their consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185613480747">AI Group, 2012d</xref>: 3). Instead, it argued, an employer – but not unions – negotiating a greenfield agreement should have the right to apply unilaterally to FWA for conciliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185613480747">AI Group, 2012d: 12</xref>). Other associations more fully returned to the misuse of the term ‘agreement’ under Work Choices for inspiration. The Victorian Employers’ Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VECCI) maintained that even where no collective agreement is reached, a greenfield ‘agreement’ nonetheless should be able to commence and operate for 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022185613480747">Stone, 2012</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185613480747">AMMA (2012: 7–8)</xref> argued that for the resources industry, it is crucial that FWA should, on application (only) by an employer, have the power to make greenfield ‘agreements’ for new projects where negotiations fail to conclude in a ‘reasonable timeframe’. Eschewing entirely the need for negotiation, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185613480747">BCA (2012: 12)</xref> argued for employer-only greenfield ‘agreements’.</p>
<p>By November 2012, associations’ general dissatisfaction with the Report had merged with their general discontent with the Amendment Bill<italic>.</italic> In its submission to the Senate Committee Inquiry on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012, ACCI admitted that this first tranche of proposed amendments included welcome changes regarding unfair dismissal applications. However, it complained that the government was delaying introducing more important Panel recommendations ‘to restore much needed balance in the system’ regarding greenfield agreements, IFAs and protected industrial action provisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185613480747">ACCI, 2012b</xref>).</p>
<p>Other leading associations responded similarly, generally supporting Schedules pertaining to modern awards, unfair dismissal, general protections and cost orders, and opposing those concerning enterprise agreements and industrial action. For AI Group, a critical issue remains the need, legislatively, to expand opportunities for employers to negotiate IFAs with employees and prevent third parties ‘blocking meaningful flexibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022185613480747">Willox, 2012</xref>). It indicated that because the Bill’s amendments failed to address the ‘big problems’, associations would seek further legislative changes.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, employer interests enjoyed significant victories in litigation under the FW Act during 2012. There was <italic>Brookfield</italic> regarding subcontractors (see later). Then, employer associations resoundingly welcomed an appeal case, <italic>Barclay</italic>, regarding the Act’s adverse action provisions (see Catanzariti and Kane, this issue). Also, in its August 2012 arbitrated decision pursuant to the 2011 Qantas lockout,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022185613480747">1</xref></sup> FWA’s Full Bench found against union claims that management’s use of contractors and labour hire companies compromised full-time employment at Qantas. It therefore rejected placing any restrictions on management’s rights to use such labour. That determination, in rebuffing some other union claims, also clearly delineated other broad areas for managerial prerogative under the Act. Not surprisingly, employer voices also welcomed the Qantas decision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0022185613480747"><title>The Modern Awards Review</title>
<p>The Modern Award Review began in 2012. It also consumed considerable association time and energy. Leading associations viewed it as an opportunity not only to make some provisions more ‘workable’ for members, but also to campaign for substantial changes to awards. Under the FW Act, the tribunal is required to conduct a two-year review of every modern award. Proceeding in four stages, the Review is due to finish on 31 May 2013. For employers and their associations, this involved appearances before FWA’s Full Bench hearing in June on this Review’s scope,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022185613480747">2</xref></sup> submissions in relation to particular modern award reviews and attending daily FWA Review hearings and a range of Full Bench matters. Following applications largely by employer associations, the tribunal convened Full Bench reviews on particular matters in modern awards, including penalty rates, public holidays and outworkers.</p>
<p>Given the sheer volume of awards involved, larger and better-resourced associations took a leading role. ACCI provided general representation across awards, enabling its state-based Chamber affiliates to adopt more targeted approaches relevant to local employers. Some associations have also prompted members to consider issues to raise in the Review and the change opportunities it provides. Given their criticisms of the FW Act Review, the Modern Award Review has provided employer associations with a pincer-like opportunity to achieve significant regulatory changes. At the same time, they have had to temper members’ expectations of its likely outcomes.</p>
<p>Employers have sought examination of provisions regarding penalty rates, public holidays, annual leave, the model flexibility clause, outworker arrangements and apprentices and trainees. For an association like AI Group, this has meant dealing with around 300 applications to vary modern awards, including several by the organisation itself. Some changes sought are award-specific; others are more general. Thus, penalty rates particularly affect specific industries like cafes and restaurants, tourism, and retail; disappointment with IFA clauses in awards and agreements, however, is more broadly felt, generating claims for a substantial revisiting of the provisions in Part 2 of the Act.</p>
<p>The Modern Awards Review has provided a forum for employers and their associations to escalate their campaign to reduce the significance of penalty rates in industries operating during the traditionally ‘unsociable hours’ of work these rates were designed to compensate. During 2012, employer associations across Australia lobbied heavily on this issue, arguing that given socio-economic changes – like expectations of around-the-clock service provision – a penalty rate system based on nominated hours and days is outdated. Employers want award changes whereby penalty rates are limited to situations where an employee has worked for more than 10 hours in a day or more than 38 hours in seven days. Penalty rates are currently the subject of a Full Bench Review by FWA. (Independent) Senator Nick Xenophon’s Fair Work Amendment (Small Business – Penalty Rates Exemption) Bill 2012 (Cth) provided another opportunity for employers to build debate on this issue through submissions to the Senate Inquiry on the Bill (see ACCI, 2012c).</p>
<p>As noted earlier, there has been sustained employer association criticism of the FW Act’s mechanisms for negotiating IFAs in modern awards. Taking another path, in March 2012, AI Group also sought a review of the Tribunal’s Model Award Flexibility Clause as part of its application to vary a modern award in manufacturing. In particular, the application sought the redrafting of the modern award clause to enable greater flexibility in taking and cashing out of annual leave. This matter has now been referred to an FWA Full Bench for hearing in 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022185613480747">AI Group, 2012c</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec5-0022185613480747"><title>Industrial militancy and managerial prerogative</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, during 2012, outbreaks of union militancy tested employers over issues like greenfield sites and company use of labour contracting. Other union action was more defensive. For their part, some employers also took aggressive industrial action in order to defend or bolster their managerial prerogative. In this, the 2011 Qantas lockout served as something of an inspiration. Financial journalist Alan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185613480747">Kohler (2012)</xref> noted that ‘Australian employers are becoming more militant, demanding that unions stop telling them how to run their businesses’. Throughout 2012, employers continued to make substantial use of lockouts under the FW Act. Significant lockouts included those of Dubai Ports, Sigma’s lockout of 130 Melbourne warehouse employees, Bundaberg Sugar’s lockout of 50 and Schweppes’s lockout of 150 at its Tullamarine plant. By threatening a lockout, Asciano subsidiary Patrick Stevedores persuaded the Workplace Relations Minister, Bill Shorten, to call for formal conciliation between the company and the Maritime Union of Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185613480747">Hannan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185613480747">Kohler, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The Schweppes lockout, initiated in December 2011, was notable for its length. The dispute arose during renegotiation of an enterprise agreement after employees had undertaken protected industrial action over Schweppes’s plan to introduce a new six-day, 24-hour operating schedule based on 12-hour shifts. The lockout ended in mid-February 2012, when the parties agreed to 21 days’ conciliation, with the tribunal to arbitrate in the absence of a solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185613480747">Thornthwaite and Sangkuhl, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185613480747">Thornthwaite and Sangkuhl (2012)</xref> argue that these recent, prominent lockouts have resulted from an employer strategy to escalate disputes and thereby gain access to arbitration – in the form of an industrial action-related workplace determination – on their own terms and with much greater ease than employees can. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185613480747">Kohler (2012)</xref>, law firms such as Freehills have also increasingly moved client companies towards taking industrial action, using the FW Act to fight union demands.</p>
<p>As part of the wider employer push to entrench or extend managerial prerogatives, employers also engaged in other aggressive bargaining strategies during 2012. The Grocon dispute with the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) at the Emporium site, Melbourne, was a prominent example. The dispute erupted over whether the employer or union should choose occupational health and safety representatives on construction sites. After a 16-day picket, Grocon and the CFMEU agreed to mediation talks with FWA in early September. Nonetheless, Grocon has continued to pursue a common law damages claim against the union to recover income lost in the dispute, as well as individual claims against eight union officials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022185613480747">Schneiders, 2012; WorkplaceInfo, 2012b</xref>). This evokes comparisons with the Mudginberri dispute two decades ago.</p>
<p>During 2012, another issue attracting considerable employer attention regarding the ‘right to manage’ concerned the regulation of independent contractors and their employees. The entitlements of those working under a contract for service, as opposed to a contract of service, are often vastly different. Given the substantial growth in the volume of work performed by independent contractors in recent years (particularly in some sectors), it is unsurprising that employers would resist increased regulation of these arrangements under the FW Act. However, with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) Insecure Work campaign in full swing, and unions using enterprise bargaining to attempt to shore up the rights of employees working for contractors, employers have faced substantial potential encroachments on their right to contract. This came to a head in the <italic>ADJ Contracting Case</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022185613480747">3</xref></sup> The appealed decision had approved a union pattern agreement for Victoria’s electrical industry that restricted the engagement of subcontractors and labour hire, granted unions expansive entry rights to workplaces, and required employers to encourage their employees to join unions. The Federal Court decision effectively confirmed the legality of enterprise agreements that regulate the engagement of independent contractors. Employer groups have been vocal in criticism of that decision. It appears clear that this issue will not be resolved easily or soon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185613480747">MBA, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Employers appeared to have been more successful in <italic>Brookfield</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022185613480747">4</xref></sup> a case concerning a union’s ‘Contractors Clause’ that required employers to engage only subcontractors and labour hire firms that provided employees with terms and conditions equivalent to those of the primary company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185613480747">AI Group, 2012e</xref>). However, before the union’s appeal came before the Full Bench, the CFMEU withdrew to focus on winning through an informal, on-the-job campaign.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185613480747"><title>State public sector industrial relations</title>
<p>Recently elected Coalition state governments pursued aggressive public sector management strategies during 2012. The Premiers of Queensland, New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria each used commissioned reviews of state finances as triggers for substantial workforce reductions. Queensland Premier, Campbell Newman, announced he would cut 20,000 employees, initially through voluntary redundancies and non-renewal of temporary contracts. Faced with a shortfall in voluntary redundancies, the government’s Public Service and other Legislation Amendments Act 2012 removed job security for all government workers, except police, thereby permitting involuntary redundancies (see Brace, this issue; McCrystal and Orchiston, this issue).</p>
<p>In NSW, the November 2011 amendments to the Public Sector Employment and Management Act 2002 reflected a low-trust management approach from Barry O’Farrell’s government. A new Public Service Commission was to manage most aspects of the public service, but not its IR, now under the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185613480747">Department of Finance and Services. During 2012</xref>, O’Farrell also extended his 2.5% wage increase limit to employees in state corporations, and applied to the NSW Industrial Commission for further reductions to award conditions. In November 2012, the government released its commissioned <italic>State of the NSW Public Sector Report</italic> (2012), whose rhetoric on public service productivity is rooted in a narrow labour cost-cutting agenda. Indeed, prior to releasing the report, the government announced that it would cut approximately 10,000 public sector jobs to follow the 5000 in 2011.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0022185613480747"><title>Labour shortages</title>
<p>The year began with continuing news from WA and Queensland that existing and imminent resources projects would severely exacerbate shortages of skilled construction workers and mining professionals. Some employers and their associations also argued that domestically available employees were becoming too expensive and proposed large-scale importations of guest workers for specific projects. The government had already substantially increased its skilled migration programme over recent years, but most of those migrants steered clear of remote resources projects, even with fly-in-fly-out (FIFO) arrangements (Yeates, 2012a).</p>
<p>For employers, the question of easier access to project-specific guest workers – rather than skilled migrants – has thus become a major theme, at times tied to complaints about rising wages costs for local blue-collar workers, labour turnover and the cost of the FIFO arrangements mining companies themselves had developed. Responding to employer calls, in May 2011, the government had introduced its Enterprise Migration Agreement (EMA) scheme for very large projects (more than AU$2b). In May 2012, the government panicked when a union backlash against the first EMA approval alleged that the EMA prioritised importing guest workers ahead of hiring – and training – local unemployed. It established a Resources Sector Jobs Board for employers to identify and source local labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022185613480747">WorkplaceInfo, 2012a</xref>). Any sponsor of guest workers must now ‘attest to having a strong record of, or a demonstrated commitment to, employing local labour and non-discriminatory employment practices’. As employers face no requirements to recruit locals ‘where they do not meet the business’s skill requirements or applicable Australian licensing criteria’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185613480747">Department of Immigration and Citizenship, 2012)</xref>, the AMMA and BCA strongly supported the revised EMA scheme and Jobs Board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022185613480747">Metherell, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rio Tinto considerably advanced plans to introduce ‘driverless’ iron ore trains for its Pilbara mines, after making a similar commitment for driverless dump trucks during 2011. The company says the trains will not only cut costs and improve safety, but also contribute to easing skill shortages. Transport vehicle automation has long been a goal for mining companies, mostly to weaken unionism. It was only in 2011 that Rio finally agreed to its Kimberley train drivers bargaining ‘collectively for the first time in decades’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185613480747">Ker, 2012a</xref>: 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0022185613480747"><title>Pay fixation in Australia: The two poles</title>
<p>Overall, the annual minimum wage declaration appeared to cause employers few concerns. A number of associations made submissions and concrete proposals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185613480747">FWA, 2012</xref>). Most suggested a flat increase of around AU$10 per week for adult employees; AI Group suggested up to AU$14. The ACTU asked for AU$26 and FWA granted AU$17.10. On the whole, penalty rates appeared to have had higher priority than basic unit labour costs in the economy’s non-resources sectors.</p>
<p>Treatments of pay fixation in anglophone countries often overlook executive remuneration. Yet the money expended on executive rewards comes from the same source and purportedly has very similar purposes as that spent on the employed workforce generally. However, their decision mechanisms and criteria – as well as the results – have, of course, been increasingly divergent. During 2012, senior executives largely continued to increase their own ever-rising incomes, some while presiding over a litany of costly errors, corporate losses, no dividends and large sackings. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185613480747">Verrender (2012b: 6)</xref> put it: ‘Executive bonuses have become akin to encores at a concert. No matter how bad the performance, it has become an obligatory part of the repertoire.’ During 2012, there were also signs that the new ‘two strikes’ legislative provisions made some company boards more careful to temper these excesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185613480747">Bell, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0022185613480747"><title>Changes to employer association leadership</title>
<p>There have been important changes within leading associations. In January, Stephen Tait, formerly a print media executive, became CEO of Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Queensland (CCIQ). His strategic review of CCIQ led to dramatic changes. After struggling with trying to be both a representative, member-based association and commercially oriented business (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185613480747">Sheldon and Thornthwaite, 2004</xref>), CCIQ has now decided to prioritise its membership. It sold its fee-for-service commercial operations to its larger and wealthier ‘chamber movement’ sibling, NSWBC, and outsourced front-line IR services to the new Brisbane office of NSWBC-owned Australian Business Lawyers and Advisors.</p>
<p>In May, Innes Willox replaced Ridout as Chief Executive of AI Group. An AI Group policy executive since 2008, he had previously held senior public and private sector positions and was Chief of Staff to Howard government Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer. Richard Clancy joined VECCI as Executive Director – Industry Policy &amp; Workplace Relations Services. He came from a senior HR and employee relations role at Coles and had previously worked as a policy advisor for successive Howard government Workplace Relations Ministers Kevin Andrews and Joe Hockey. David Gregory, ACCI’s Director of Workplace Policy – and previously at VECCI – was appointed a Commissioner of FWA. So too was Geoff Bull, Director of Workplace Relations for AMMA. In September, Queensland’s Coalition government appointed Minna Knight to the Queensland Commission. Knight had only recently been promoted as AMMA’s Executive Director, Industry. She too had previously worked as a senior policy advisor for Minister Hockey (and for AI Group).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0022185613480747" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Overall, 2012 was a year in which associations focused intense energies on their representational roles in core IR institutional policy areas. Certainly, the sustained pressure of responding to reviews created substantial IR activity for them, reinforcing their profile and expertise before members. In substance, their endeavours largely reflected the employer world’s strong nostalgia for core elements of Work Choices. Perhaps this is not surprising given that so many association leaders worked for the Howard government in introducing and implementing Work Choices. Yet it was leading figures from big business who seemed to set the direction, demanding that the state expand their own unilateral power over employees. This suggests a misapprehension that employment and industrial regulation in a democracy should, as its <italic>primary</italic> purpose, make life easier for management rather than provide employees with human rights at work.</p>
<p>For employer associations, it is unclear whether in calling, once again, for more radical change, they will also create yet more ‘reform fatigue’ for themselves and their members. They also risk, once again, undermining their own sustainability as organisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185613480747">Sheldon and Thornthwaite, 2004</xref>). On the other hand, the re-emergence of a stronger award system has allowed employer associations to regain a previously long-standing purpose and role, coordinating and leading member companies before tribunals.</p>
