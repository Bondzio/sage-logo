But in the past few decades, two changes occurred. First, political theorists started to pay attention to the sub-national erosion of the nation-state, which resulted in a widespread literature on multicultural citizenship and the rights of national minorities; this flourished in the 1990s. They also began to look at the erosion of the nation-state within the context of supra-national constellations. Since the early 2000s, the supra-national debate is omnipresent: talk of global justice and global democracy (the two main axes of the supra-national debate) is the order of the day, and there is currently no subject that elicits more doctoral dissertations or about which more conferences are organized.</p><p>One of the pressing issues in this supra-national literature is the question what the appropriate boundaries of democracy are. In particular, should we, in times of globalization and supra-nationalization, extend democracy beyond the boundaries of the nation-state? The goal of Raffaele Marchetti’s <italic>Global Democracy: For and Against</italic> is to elaborate a bold affirmative answer, and the book’s forceful opening lines read: ‘Either democracy is global or it is not democracy.’</p><p>The model of global democracy that Marchetti has in mind is radical and far-reaching. He envisions a global state, comprising a central government, a directly elected global parliament, a global constitutional court and a global police force (which is to replace all existing armies). All this is backed up by a global constitution. The model of citizenship which, in Marchetti’s view, is to accompany global democracy is directly cosmopolitan: individuals should be able to directly influence public decisions at the global level, and to do so members of the global parliament ought to be directly elected.</p><p>Cosmopolitan citizenship, however, is not the only legitimate form of citizenship for Marchetti. It is compatible with national citizenship, because the global state Marchetti advocates is not unitary in nature; it is a federal state, comprised of a global alongside three sub-global decision-making levels: a regional level (e.g. the EU), a state level and an individual level. A principle of subsidiarity guides the assignment of competences to each level. This principle stipulates that decision-making should occur at the lowest possible level, unless allocating decisions to higher levels would result in more efficiency. The individual then can decide on individual affairs; the state level on state issues; and the regional level on affairs related to regional identity and autonomy. The global layer has four domains of action in Marchetti’s model: (1) it guarantees the vital interests (to food, housing, etc.) of every individual on earth; (2) it guarantees political representation to every individual; (3) it decides on how to deal with global problems like global warming, terrorism, unstable financial markets, migration flows, etc.; (4) finally, the global constitutional court decides on the jurisdictional boundaries of the different levels of decision-making, and it arbitrates over competence conflicts between those levels.</p><p>This is, in a nutshell, Marchetti’s practical solution to the boundary problem in democratic theory. How does he justify this solution? Why is global democracy normatively desirable?</p><p>It is helpful to see how Marchetti’s justification differs from that of many others in democratic theory. Answering the issue of the boundaries of democracy has been done in different ways (in ways analogous to dealing with the boundaries of <italic>justice</italic>). Nationalists take democracy to require a context united by a national culture. Distinct from that, statists maintain that democracy requires a domestic state. Still others believe that democracy requires a Rawlsian basic structure, or a context of reciprocity. Although one might imagine a global nation, a global state, a global basic structure, or a global reciprocal context, proponents of the mentioned views often do not see the ideal of global democracy as normatively attractive: they tend to argue that the absence of the global pendant of the national instantiations of nationality, statehood, a basic structure or reciprocity makes global democracy undesirable.</p><p>Enthusiasts of the case for transnational or global democracy, in contrast, often articulate a version of the ‘all-affected principle’, which states that whoever is affected by a public decision should be included in the democratic process that makes the decision. This leads to a justification for extending democracy beyond national boundaries, because it is no longer the case in the current world that the decisions of one state affect only citizens from that same state. Many decisions (such as on environmental, terrorism-related, or migration-related issues) affect people living in other states, and the all-affected principle stipulates that those people should be included in the democratic process in which the decision is made. Democracy should therefore be at least partly transnational in scope.</p><p>Now, remarkably, Marchetti does <italic>not </italic>rely on the all-affected principle in justifying his case for global democracy, but explicitly rejects it. His main critique of the principle is that, while it extends democracy beyond nations and thus includes previously excluded people, it still allows for too much exclusion. The all-affected principle is exclusionary because it only gives a democratic voice to the affected: the non-affected are excluded. Marchetti sees the all-affected principle in line with stakeholder or interaction-dependent models of democracy, such as those theories which state that only the people with whom interaction or reciprocity occurs, or with whom we share a basic structure, should be included in our democratic decision-making process. The downfall of all these theories, Marchetti argues, is that they lead to transnational exclusion: they exclude the non-affected, those with whom no relationship of interaction–reciprocity exists, those with whom no basic structure is shared.</p><p>Marchetti uses this exclusion critique against all competitors to his view of global democracy: realists, nationalists, civilizationalists, liberal internationalists (such as Kantian theories of cosmopolitan peace, but also cosmopolitan governance defenders like Held): all these theories support ‘transnational exclusion’ (129): ‘vast parts of the world population remain outside the relevant decision-making mechanisms that decide the transnational fate of the world’ (ibid.).</p><p>In contrast, Marchetti justifies the case for an <italic>all-inclusive </italic>project of global democracy, encompassing every member of the human species. Everyone should be included in the democratic process of making decisions on global affairs. This statement is justified by appeal to a specific understanding of consequentalism, focused on the importance of individual well-being. Marchetti’s version of consequentialism differs from many other consequentialist theories (such as classical utilitarianism), in that it does not assume that a universal interpersonal comparison of utility can be carried out. It is possible, says Marchetti, to compare different (including culturally distinct) persons’ utilities on a very basic level, but only as far as vital interests are concerned. Beyond vital interests, there is no universally valid metric of utility.</p><p>These epistemological limitations to the comparability of interpersonal utility lead Marchetti to argue for freedom of choice. Because of the incomparability, we need to enable individuals themselves to indicate what their well-being amounts to, as individuals are the ‘best judges’ of what their well-being is: the best judge of what is good for a person is always that person himself or herself. If we want individuals to be successful in their pursuit of well-being, we ought, therefore, to grant them freedom of choice in pursuing it. So Marchetti employs an agent-relative, instrumental defence of freedom of choice: granting freedom of choice is the best way of arriving at individual well-being.</p><p>For individuals to enjoy freedom of choice, two (equally instrumentally justified) conditions need to be fulfilled: vital interests and political participation. Individuals need to have their vital interests – health, education and security – fulfilled: without vital interests, they cannot fully exercise freedom of choice. These are universal basic interests. Second, individuals ought to be able to participate politically in the public decision-making process. Rights to political participation are a condition for interest formation and realization and therefore for individual well-being.</p><p>This last argument – the argument for political participation as a condition for the maximization of individual well-being – leads Marchetti to the last step in the justification of global democracy. Marchetti claims that traditional, national democracy is unable adequately and legitimately to deal with the transnational and global challenges we are facing today, because it suffers from a democratic deficit: national democracy excludes individuals from participating in the decisions made to handle these challenges. Marchetti calls this ‘transnational exclusion’, and it forms the cornerstone for his critique of alternative theories of democracy as well as for his own case for global democracy. What, then, is transnational exclusion? In the first chapter, which is entirely devoted to this concept, Marchetti stipulates that it ‘occurs when an actor is deprived of his/her entitlements to influence public decisions at the international and global level’ (17), and, hence, it violates the political participation condition of individual well-being. But are such actors not able to influence such decisions through their national citizenship? Marchetti argues that national citizenship is not satisfactory because an individual who bears the consequences of decisions taken abroad or internationally does not ‘have significant power to register his or her “transborder consent” (or, indeed, dissent)’ (ibid.). This appears to be especially the case for ‘minorities within different states’: these are groups of people who form a minority in state A and also in state B. Marchetti is concerned that such minorities cannot effectuate their democratic power through national elections, while they might more successfully influence decisions through supra-national democracy.</p><p>To show this, he gives the example of a nuclear power station which is to be erected in state A, close to a border with states B and C. A binding referendum is organized over whether or not to go through with the plan in each country (each has a population size of 100 citizens), and the three countries decide that they will settle the issue at stake through an international agreement. Marchetti remarks that there is a possibility that settling the issue through an international agreement will lead to a different result than if the issue were to be decided in a cosmopolitan (or supra-national) setting, which would organize one supra-national election. This results in the possible situation shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0191453712473082">Table 1</xref> (taken from Marchetti, 19).</p><table-wrap id="table1-0191453712473082" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>From Marchetti (2008: 19)</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table1-0191453712473082" xlink:href="10.1177_0191453712473082-table1.tif"/><table><tbody><tr><td>Country A</td><td>55% YES</td><td>45% NO</td></tr><tr><td>Country B</td><td>55% YES</td><td>45% NO</td></tr><tr><td>Country C</td><td>30% YES</td><td>70% NO</td></tr><tr><td>Intergovernmental counting</td><td>2 (winner)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cosmopolitan counting </td><td>140</td><td>160 (winner)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In Marchetti’s view, the minorities in countries A and B suffer from transnational exclusion. This result clearly exhibits a democratic deficit, and it would never be tolerated by democratic theory within a domestic setting (ibid.). Marchetti maintains that a vast majority of the world’s population is currently in a similar situation as the minorities are in the table: a state-based system remains ‘an unsatisfactory framework for the self-determination of transborder interests such as those embodied by non-national or transnational political agents including as [<italic>sic</italic>] migrants, people of transborder religions, minorities and workers’ (17). Marchetti concludes that ‘[i]f the phenomenon of transnational exclusion is to be eluded, current institutional arrangements need to be profoundly reformed’ (30). The only system able to avoid transnational exclusions of the kind discussed is global democracy.</p><p>The account just given is a synopsis of Marchetti’s general argument. In the book, the argument is unfolded in 7 chapters. The first defines transnational exclusion, the second gives the moral case for global democracy. Chapters 3 and 4 embed this moral case within, respectively, an institutional and a social background. Chapters 5 and 6 analyse and rebut the arguments given by the opponents of global democracy (realism, nationalism and civilizationalism in chapter 5; Kantian theories of cosmopolitan peace, and cosmopolitan governance theories <italic>à la</italic> Held in chapter 6). Chapter 7, finally, sketches a more concrete blueprint of the global federal state that Marchetti envisions.</p><p>While this book is not an easy read due to its dense and sometimes nebulous writing with traces of laborious PhD-type arguments, there is much to applaud Marchetti for. He systematically lays out a provocative and original argument, presents it in a bold, enthusing voice, and, in doing so, successfully integrates three different literatures – a moral, an institutional and a sociological one. In what follows, I will mention four worries, the first two related to Marchetti’s justification for global democracy, and two briefer ones regarding the set-up of his global democratic ideal itself.</p><p>First, then, is Marchetti’s justification of the case for global democracy. I see two weaknesses, related to two important parts of the argument: the view on transnational exclusion, and the consequentialist grounding of global democracy. The most outstanding problem relates directly to Marchetti’s understanding of transnational exclusion and of his proposal of how to overcome it. Transnational exclusion is the central concept of the book: ‘the avoidance of transnational exclusion is the single principal aim of this model of global democracy’ (166), and all the rival theories that Marchetti discusses are dismissed on the basis that each of them leads to transnational exclusion and is therefore morally deficient.</p><p>But what exactly <italic>is</italic> transnational exclusion? The key defining passage says:</p><disp-quote><p>Transnational exclusion occurs when an actor is deprived of his/her entitlements to influence public decisions at the international and global level. At the moment, this is nowhere more visible than on the edge between national and international political jurisdictions concerning political participation. Increasingly, decisions taken in one country <italic>affect</italic> people in other countries who do not have the ability to express their consent because of their subaltern status as non-fellow, ergo disenfranchised, citizens. The fracture between socio-economic reality, which is transnational in its effects, and the political system, which is still fundamentally anchored to a community-based model, is widening. Actions and consequences are tightly linked across borders, and yet those who <italic>bear the effects</italic> of decisions taken abroad are not typically entitled to have a political voice in the process. (17; emphases added)</p></disp-quote><p>We appear to learn from this – not immediately transparent – definition that people who are affected by decisions taken abroad but have not been included in the decision-making process are transnationally excluded. They are entitled to influence international decisions but are currently deprived of these entitlements. So far so good. But later in the book, in the critique of rival theories like realism, nationalism <italic>and</italic> ‘all-affected’ theories, Marchetti takes transnational exclusion to refer to much more than ‘affected but not democratically included’. Each of the rival theories according to Marchetti relies on an interaction-dependent theory of justice. The problem with such theories is that no duties of justice or democratic inclusion are thought to be necessary where no interaction exists. As a result, vast numbers of people in the world are excluded from participating. This, says Marchetti, is a clear instance of transnational exclusion (143; but also on 122, 126, 129, 138, 140).</p><p>So we are left wondering: is an individual transnationally excluded when she simply cannot participate in a democratic decision (irrespective of being affected or interacting), or only when she cannot participate in decision-making <italic>that affects her</italic>? This confusion over what exclusion amounts to is replicated on a deeper level: it is unclear to what extent Marchetti believes that it is the ‘democratic congruence between choice-bearers and choice-makers’ which drives the case for global democracy, or whether it is something else, perhaps an appeal to ‘individual interests’ broadly defined. Clearly the general thrust of his proposal is that the all-affected principle is not valid, and that all should be included. But why then does he repeatedly state that the ‘choice-bearers’ should also be the ‘choice-makers’, that it is important that we ‘close the democratic gap between choice-makers and choice-bearers’ (87), that democratic legitimacy is based on the ‘democratic congruence’ between choice-bearers and choice-makers (55), and that the relationship between the two is the ‘pivot of democratic reflexivity’ (150)? Unless there is a way of ‘bearing’ decisions taken abroad without being ‘affected’ by them, it is impossible to appeal to the democratic congruence between choice-makers and choice-bearers as the pivot of a legitimate democratic system, while at the same time dismissing the all-affected principle. If the central drive is to include those who are in no way affected or stand in no relationship of interaction at all – that is, if literally everyone is included, hence the labelling of his alternative as an ‘all-inclusive’ system (55), which includes ‘all individuals among all peoples’ (110) – then that is incompatible with stating that the gap between choice-bearers and choice-makers should be closed: there is no reason in such an all-inclusive system to limit the choice-makers to the choice-bearers: everyone is entitled to participate in making decisions. In short, the problem Marchetti faces is: if we should grant <italic>all </italic>individuals a political voice, how do we avoid ending up in a generalized situation of incongruence between choice-makers and choice-bearers?</p><p>Let us suppose for a moment that Marchetti indeed intends to argue that all should be included, and not only those who are affected by or bear decisions taken abroad. Would that not be overtly over-inclusive? With regard to the example of the nuclear power station, for instance, do we really think that the whole world should have a say on this, including people at the other side of the world who, let us assume, are not affected (although they might want to prevent the potential nuclear-power-consuming country from rising on the economic ladder by voting against the station)? Marchetti has no principled argument to limit membership of decision-making bodies. In response to the all-affected argument, he argues at one point that democracy is ‘a system that allows for the participation of all its members on the ground of the public component of political decisions’ (83). Even if political decisions do not affect me, I should still be entitled to ‘have a say on discussions and decisions that have general consequences that affect the public’ (ibid.). I am entitled to vote on ‘decisions with a public value’ even if I am not affected by them.</p><p>But, while this appears like a third, intermediate position – not everyone is entitled to vote on everything, nor are only the personally affected, but everyone is as far as the decisions to be made have a public component – this view has more problems for Marchetti than he might expect. After all, Marchetti is defending a global <italic>federal</italic> state, that is, a state with a global decision-making level alongside other <italic>sub</italic>-global ones, which, by definition, do <italic>not </italic>contain all individuals. It seems that claims to be included in votes on ‘decisions with a public value’ may end up in all sub-global units effectively becoming global. Surely the decision on whether or not to institutionalize gay marriage can be thought to reflect on the cosmopolitan public, and the same seems to go for whether or not to allow for legal euthanasia, whether or not to invest in research, or whether or not to allow for sub-global political leaders with adulterous lifestyles. All these decisions have a public value. But typically, we do not think that, say, citizens of California should be allowed to vote on whether or not gay marriage is allowed in the Netherlands, or that Canadians should be able to vote on Japan’s education expenditures. So Marchetti’s denunciation of the all-affected principle and support for either a ‘publicly affected’ principle or an all-inclusive form of decision-making which allows for no exclusion whatsoever, may prove to contain challenges to his case for federalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0191453712473082">1</xref></sup></p><p>Marchetti’s notes on exclusion are not only included to make clear that transnational exclusion is unjust, but also to show that a state-based system cannot overcome it. That is the purpose of the example of the nuclear power station. A state-based system is still vulnerable to transnational exclusion because it is unable to grant full democratic participation rights to minorities with ‘transborder interests’ or minorities that will be ‘transnationally affected’, such as a minority that lives close to the place in a foreign country where a nuclear power station will be built. Let us now examine more closely the nuclear station example.</p><p>A first thing to note is that, despite Marchetti’s repeated talk of the protection of transnational minorities as one advantage of his cosmopolitan proposal (vis-à-vis the state-based system), this example makes clear that there is nothing in cosmopolitanism that helps minorities as such: in the table above, it is only because the minorities in countries A and B together with the vote in C constitute a <italic>majority</italic> that the cosmopolitan strategy helps. The system does nothing to protect minorities qua minorities: it only helps minorities who are actually ‘majorities in disguise’, minorities who are dispersed over several countries but in reality are a majority. If cosmopolitanism is the solution to the exclusion of such minorities, then <italic>real</italic> minorities are still ‘excluded’ just as much as (if not more than, as I argue below) in an interstate setting.</p><p>Second, it should be noticed that not every ‘cosmopolitan’ system – understood as a system whereby the issue is not decided inter-governmentally but directly on a supra-national level – will reach the NO decision in the nuclear plant example. Marchetti has shown that a state-based system in this particular example cannot generate a NO decision. That is why, in his view, a cosmopolitan strategy is more just here: it reveals the view of the real majority, which is against the station. But several cosmopolitan strategies are imaginable whereby a YES decision is reached. For in many countries, domestic elections are organized within sub-state electoral districts, and those sub-state votes are then aggregated on a national level. The result may be a domestic analogy of a YES vote, while a majority of individuals in the state may have voted against. Something similar might be the case in a cosmopolitan election, especially a federally organized one. The only cosmopolitan strategy that avoids this conclusion is one that operates with<italic> one </italic>direct electoral district. For if more than one district is used in elections, then it is very well possible that minorities in different districts do not succeed in reaching a majority which might be there if the vote was collected in one direct cosmopolitan electoral district.</p><p>Marchetti suggests with regard to the example that ‘[w]ere this international scenario of multiple disenfranchisements translated into a domestic setting it would not be tolerated by any version of democratic theory’ (19). But many countries do not have a nation-wide electoral district for legislative elections (indeed, if anything, nation-wide districts, which exist in the Netherlands or Italy, appear to be the exception rather than the rule), and it remains to be shown that this absence is ruled out in democratic theory, especially since there are several justifications of, for example, federalism in the literature. Ultimately, what Marchetti’s example shows is that minorities according to one electoral system may not be minorities in a different system. But is the ‘one district’ system to be universally preferred to all other systems? If we are really concerned about protecting minorities, for instance, might one not equally argue that national minorities are better helped if they are provided with a separate electoral district? So Marchetti’s alternative to ‘transnational exclusion’ ultimately hinges on an unprovided argument as to why a unified supra-national electoral district is preferable to other systems which are currently in vogue in domestic and international settings. Perhaps the all-affected principle is believed by Marchetti to do the work here, but not only is that principle rejected by Marchetti, the all-affected principle is not of much use here anyhow, as it is purported only to show <italic>that</italic> the affected are entitled to democratic participation – it is not typically stipulated that the principle also indicates <italic>how</italic> the participation should be organized (such as through a unified or a multiple voting district system).</p><p>Having discussed Marchetti’s unclear articulation of transnational exclusion, let us now turn to the second justificatory worry, regarding his consequentialist defence of cosmopolitanism. Marchetti says that we are fundamentally interested in realizing individual well-being. But, given the impossibility of a universal interpersonal comparison of utility, the best way to get individuals’ well-being realized is to grant them freedom of choice in pursuing well-being. And the best way for individuals to enjoy freedom of choice is to allow them to democratically co-determine their own business – hence the importance of not being excluded from participation. But, since indirect participation in transnational decision-making processes – whereby citizenship is organized nationally and national elected representatives negotiate international decisions – still leads to transnational exclusion, what we need in order to guarantee individual-well-being-through-democratic-self-rule is direct participation in global decision-making processes. It follows that, if we want to realize people’s well-being, we should grant them direct citizenship in global levels of decision-making.</p><p>Here the relationship between global democracy and individual well-being is less clearly articulated than it might be. For instance, is global democracy a sufficient or a necessary condition of well-being? Often Marchetti writes as if global democracy is enough for individual well-being to occur, and, apart from vital interests he does not provide any other conditions for its occurrence. But this cannot be the entire story. For one thing, it is surely true that, apart from its scope, also the quality of democracy is a pre-condition for individual freedom: without a democratic debate in which the interests furthered by individuals and minorities are taken into account when reaching a decision, it is unclear how the individual well-being of those dissenting minorities is to benefit. It is easy to imagine a state, especially a global state, in which minorities are consistently ignored and outvoted in decisions.</p><p>Perhaps, then, the argument is that global democracy is not sufficient but necessary for well-being. Many will agree that democratic participation is a crucial step in realizing well-being. But while this might generally be used as a justification for democracy domestically, it is less clear that the argument holds globally. Surely in an ideal global world, it might be true that real well-being cannot be reached without global democracy. But is that also true of the very imperfect world in which we currently live? Of all the things we can do to further individual well-being, should global democracy be our almost only preoccupation (apart from satisfying basic interests)? Moreover, might this not amount to one instance of an example whereby setting one step in a non-ideal world towards the realization of the ideal world might make the current world not more but less perfect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0191453712473082">Estlund, 2008</xref>: 266)? In particular, it might be the case that the best way to further the well-being of individuals in the short term is not to focus on the realization of their democratic participation but rather to supply them with traditional liberal rights, like freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and so on. If the major institutional framework Marchetti wishes to see erected globally ultimately has as its central aim the realization of individual well-being (through enabling freedom of choice in pursuing it), then this might be furthered better and faster through the global promotion of traditional liberal rights rather than through globally installing democratic contexts which may very well violate those rights.</p><p>Perhaps Marchetti will reply here that his theory is basically one about democracy, not about (liberal or other conceptions of) justice, and that there is no justice prior to democracy: ‘no absolute notion of collective justice is present, but it is rather a matter of public discovery. Individuals do not have a legitimate notion of justice from the beginning. They need to engage in discussion with the other members of the polity in order to understand what is right’ (67). So Marchetti might respond that directly attempting to install liberal rights forgoes the fact that such rights need to be publicly discovered.</p><p>This might be an interesting reply, but it is not one that Marchetti can make. If he indeed thinks there is no justice outside of or prior to democratic politics, then how is it possible for Marchetti to come up with such a comprehensive – and pre-political – cosmopolitan proposal which strives towards implementing ‘a single criterion of justice – the principle of the maximization of world well-being’ (36)?</p><p>I end with two questions about the design of the model itself rather than about its justification. The first is directly related to the fear that a global democratic system may not necessarily turn out to be a just system, and centres on Marchetti’s understanding of citizenship. Remember that Marchetti wants a specific form of global democracy, one that operates with direct citizenship and global representatives who are directly elected. The worry is that Marchetti has a thin and formal understanding of citizenship, which makes it unable for citizenship to do the work he wants it to do. Let me explain this.</p><p>Marchetti argues that ‘no normative obstacles impede the expansion of the traditional notion of <italic>polis</italic> to the entire <italic>cosmos</italic>’ (5). But this is too strong: while there are good arguments supporting the global expansion of democracy, there are also several obstacles and drawbacks. And even if it might be thought that the advantages outweigh the drawbacks, it is at least surprising that Marchetti simply ignores the latter. For one thing, in what language are citizens supposed to deliberate in the global public sphere? The issue of language is crucial to any conception of citizenship: not having a shared language of public communication poses a challenge to realizing any robust understanding of citizenship. The quality of democracy depends on the mutual exchange of authentic reasons given for and against certain policies. To engage in such mutual inter-citizen exchanges, citizens must be able to understand each other. But the world in which we live today is a multilingual world, one where there is no language which is universally shared. This lack of a universal language posits an obstacle to the idea of global democracy. Now, it may very well be that this problem is outweighed by the arguments supporting global citizenship, or that solutions to the problem might be found (such as in support for efforts to create a global lingua franca like English or Esperanto, or perhaps in the idea of a multilingual public sphere), but it is a serious weakness for a theory which is centred on the ability of individuals to participate at each level of decision-making to remain silent on the linguistic conditions of genuine participation.</p><p>The same is true of the importance of trust for citizenship. Democracy rests on the furthering of goals which cannot be achieved without the voluntary cooperation of citizens. But a pre-condition of this voluntary cooperation is trust between citizens: citizens must trust that their contributions to the system will be reciprocated by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0191453712473082">Miller, 1995</xref>: 91). For instance, they must trust that like themselves the other citizens will also pay taxes. Now surely there is a lot more trust of this kind in domestic states internally than in the world as a whole. Again, the importance of trust as a counter-example may be outweighed by other reasons, and perhaps it may be thought to be possible to create sufficient trust of this kind at global levels of democracy, but this is important and the current lack of trust is a serious stumbling block for the realization of global democracy.</p><p>Given his silence on these issues, it is not surprising that Marchetti appears to embrace a rather thin and formal understanding of citizenship, far removed from one where citizens are thought to have responsibilities, and where certain attitudes (such as a willingness to genuinely consider the other’s claims, a willingness to express what is authentically one’s own view rather than presenting strategic instead of authentic views, etc.) are thought to be crucial. Indeed, when Marchetti writes about citizenship, he stresses only its legal dimensions: ‘Citizenship, understood as the set of legitimate entitlements allowing for the acquisition of full membership, represents the core element of democratic political theory’ (12). In such an understanding, there is no room for the idea of a ‘good citizen’ and for concepts like virtues and duties of citizenship: one simply is entitled to full membership and to the right to vote or one is not. Yet, if the purpose of (global) democracy is to enable individual well-being, a purely formal citizenship is not sufficient. Citizens need to understand and trust each other, and take each other’s interests seriously, so that good decisions are reached and minorities are not simply outvoted. This is certainly the case if Marchetti is indeed inclined to see citizens included in the global political structure ‘as members of a <italic>public</italic> constituency, rather than as stakeholders of particular interests’ (65; see also 83).</p><p>This leads to a final point: a worry that minorities will not be treated fairly in Marchetti’s global federal state. Marchetti repeatedly claims that minorities will benefit from his proposal and that his model is ‘sensitive to cultural differences’ (173). But there are reasons to doubt if minorities will indeed fare so well under the proposed system. We have already seen that the minorities whose interests are indeed furthered by the proposal are the minorities who turn out to be majorities once their votes are cast within a cosmopolitan electoral district. Real minorities – those who vote for the nuclear power station in the example discussed – derive no advantage from this system. We have also seen that Marchetti believes one is entitled to vote not on the basis of being directly affected nor on the basis of interests alone but whenever a decision is a public matter and he thinks citizens are members of a global public constituency. As I have argued, this may lead to numerous breaches in the self-determination of small minorities. In addition, we have seen that Marchetti pays little or no attention to the quality of citizenship and democracy. Minorities are thereby bereaved of another safeguard against being outvoted: the protection that a genuine deliberative democracy can give. Nor are, in the absence of ‘deep’ citizenship, traditional liberal rights guaranteed to them. And finally, it turns out that Marchetti allows no place in his global system for a separate decision-making level for national minorities: he repeatedly mentions only the global state, the region (such as the EU), the state and the individual as the only units of decision-making. His proposal for <italic>global</italic> federalism thus surprisingly seems to leave no room for <italic>domestic</italic> federalism where the sub-state decision-making bodies include national minorities. Having a political context of their own is not only a strong desire of many national minorities, but also a realistic solution to the risk of permanently being outvoted. It thus seems that real minorities, as opposed to ‘minorities in disguise’, may have a lot to lose in the global federal proposal, no matter how much they might also win and how desirable the proposal might be.</p></body><back><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0191453712473082"><label>1.</label><p>We should note at this stage that Marchetti’s own solution to the boundary-drawing problem within his global state seems to be twofold. On the one hand he says that determination of decision-making layers ‘is distinguished by its impact on a specific sphere of action’ (79). This comes down to the idea that at the state level, state issues should be discussed, whereas global issues are discussed globally. On the other hand, he says that the jurisdictional boundaries should be authorized by a global all-inclusive system. Only if citizens can discuss where the boundaries are, is their exclusion from decision-making within those boundaries legitimate (81). Note, however, that both legs of the solution may very well work against each other: it is quite imaginable that citizens will favour inclusion over exclusion, even when what is at stake are state affairs of another state. It is also possible that citizens will want international issues to be dealt with at the state level. It seems that Marchetti needs to choose: is a given boundary legitimate when consented to by the public or when it lives up to the proposed boundary-drawing mechanism that tracks the ‘impact on spheres of action’?</p></fn></fn-group></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0191453712473082"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Estlund</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2008</year>) <source>Democratic Authority: A Philosophical Framework</source>. <publisher-loc>Princeton, NJ</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Princeton University Press</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-0191453712473082"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1995</year>) <source>On Nationality</source>. <publisher-loc>Oxford</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Oxford University Press</publisher-name>.</citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
