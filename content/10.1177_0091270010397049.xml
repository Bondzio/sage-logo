<abstract>
<p>AR9281, a potent and selective inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (s-EH), is in clinical development targeting hypertension and type 2 diabetes. The safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AR9281 were evaluated in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, ascending, single oral dose (10-1000 mg) and multiple dose (100-400 mg every 8 hours for 7 days) studies in healthy subjects. AR9281 was well tolerated, and no dose-related adverse events were observed during either study. The drug was rapidly absorbed with a mean terminal half-life ranging from 3 to 5 hours. The area under the plasma concentration–time curve increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner up to the 500-mg dose and exhibited a greater than dose linearity at higher doses. AR9281 directly and dose-dependently inhibited blood s-EH activity with 90% inhibition or greater over an 8-hour period at the 250-mg dose and over a 12-hour period at the 500-mg dose. Multiple doses of AR9281 ranging from 100 to 400 mg every 8 hours resulted in a sustained inhibition of s-EH activity at 90% or greater during the trough. The current studies provide proof of safety and target inhibition of AR9281 in healthy subjects. AR9281 pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics support a twice-daily or thrice-daily dosing regimen in patients.</p>

<body>
<p>Soluble epoxide hydrolase (s-EH: EC 3.3.2.10, encoded in human by <italic>Ephx2</italic>) has been the subject of a number of efforts to identify potent and selective pharmaceutical agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010397049">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270010397049">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The enzyme is ubiquitously distributed in mammalian cells with high expression in many tissues including hepatic, renal, cardiac, endocrine, and lymphoid tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270010397049">5</xref></sup> In addition, s-EH activities can be measured in leukocytes and erythrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010397049">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010397049">7</xref></sup> Mammalian s-EH catalyzes the conversion of multiple lipid epoxides to the corresponding dihydroxy lipids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010397049">8</xref></sup> The epoxylipid substrates include epoxyoctadecamonoeonic acids (EpOMEs) and members of the arachidonic acid family such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs: 5,6; 8,9; 11,12; 14,15 regioisomers). Elevated concentrations of EETs have been proposed to mediate much of the observed pharmacology of s-EH inhibitors, although rarely has this postulate been confirmed experimentally by administration of exogenous EETs.</p>
<p>In preclinical animal disease models, inhibitors of s-EH have resulted in improvements in a number of cardiovascular end points, including lowering blood pressure in hypertension models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270010397049">9</xref></sup> and decreasing hypertension-induced renal damage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010397049">10</xref></sup> pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270010397049">11</xref></sup> myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270010397049">12</xref></sup> cerebral ischemia injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091270010397049">13</xref></sup> and atherosclerosis and aneurysm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270010397049">14</xref></sup> Recent publications also indicate that inhibition of s-EH may affect pain perception and insulin resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091270010397049">15</xref></sup> Mice deficient in <italic>Ephx2</italic> were shown to have antihypertensive effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270010397049">16</xref></sup> reduced ischemia–reperfusion infarct size in heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270010397049">17</xref></sup> and brain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270010397049">18</xref></sup> and anti-inflammatory phenotypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091270010397049">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>AR9281 is a potent and selective inhibitor of human s-EH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270010397049">20</xref></sup> In a rat model of angiotensin II–induced hypertension, AR9281 treatment for 2 weeks lowered blood pressure, improved vascular function, and reduced renal damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091270010397049">21</xref></sup> In a mouse model of diet-induced obesity (DIO), oral administrations of AR9281 dose-dependently improved glucose tolerance, as measured by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, and significantly lowered fasting glucose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091270010397049">22</xref></sup> Under these conditions, plasma insulin is unchanged or decreased, suggesting that s-EH inhibition augments insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. These effects were absent in DIO <italic>Ephx2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, supporting that the apparent effects on glucose homeostasis are s-EH mechanism-based. Improvements in glucose tolerance are evident under conditions where blood s-EH activity is reduced by 90% or more in comparison to vehicle-treated control animals. These pharmacology and gene knockout mouse studies constituted the target validation necessary to support the efforts to develop clinical candidates that selectively inhibit s-EH.</p>
<p>To facilitate an optimal clinical development path for AR9281, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses were performed on the phase 1 single-dose and multiple-dose studies in healthy human volunteers. In addition to measuring the plasma concentrations of the test article, we quantified indices of target engagement including s-EH activity in whole blood and urinary oxylipids to understand the extent and duration of s-EH inhibition evoked by the clinical candidate, AR9281, using these dosing regimens.</p>

<title>Kinetic Assay of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase</title>
<p>AR9281 at concentrations between 0.5 and 10 000 nM was incubated with 0.6 nM recombinant human s-EH for 5 minutes at 30°C in 25 mM Bis–Tris–HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide. Duplicate reactions were initiated by the addition of 14,15-EET at concentrations between 0.5 and 16 µM and were allowed to proceed for 5 minutes. Following a quench step with methanol and extraction via protein precipitation, concentrations of 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DHET) and 14,15-EET were determined by an API-4000 LC/MS/MS system using negative electrospray ionization. The blank-corrected DHET levels versus inhibitor concentrations were analyzed using a nonlinear kinetic model (Log(inhibitor) vs Response) of GraphPad Prism 5 (La Jolla, California). The derived IC<sub>50</sub> values were plotted as a function of substrate concentration. The dissociation constant, K<sub>i</sub>, for a competitive tight-binding inhibitor was determined when the substrate concentration was zero.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091270010397049">23</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section3-0091270010397049">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>A total of 32 healthy subjects were enrolled in the AR9281 first-in-human trial in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, ascending, single-dose study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. A total of 24 subjects were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending, multiple-dose study of AR9281 to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Study protocols were approved by IntegReview Ethical Review Board (Austin, Texas). The studies were conducted by PPD in a single center in Austin, Texas, according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice; all subjects gave written informed consent.</p>

<sec id="section4-0091270010397049">
<title>Single-Dose Study Design</title>
<p>Healthy, nonsmoking volunteers between the age of 18 and 50 and with a body mass index (BMI) of 20 to 32 were enrolled into 4 cohorts receiving ascending dose levels in a crossover fashion. AR9281 and placebo were orally administered to fasting subjects with 2 dose levels per cohort with the exception of cohort 2, which received 1 dose. Each cohort contained 8 subjects with 4 subjects randomly assigned to receive either AR9281 or placebo on day 1. The subjects who received placebo on day 1 were administered the next dose level of AR9281 on day 8, whereas the subject dosed with the study drug on day 1 received placebo. From the starting dose of 10 mg, higher doses were administered only after careful review of safety parameters and pharmacokinetic results. Escalating doses of 30, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 mg were administered using various combinations of 10-, 50-, and 200-mg capsules. Tolerability assessments included adverse event (AE) monitoring, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, continuous cardiac telemetry, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and physical examinations.</p>

<sec id="section5-0091270010397049">
<title>Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Assessments</title>
<p>Blood samples for plasma pharmacokinetics and for pharmacodynamic measurements were collected in tubes containing K<sub>2</sub>EDTA prior to dosing and at 0.17, 0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, and 144 hours after administration of AR9281 and placebo (pharmacodynamics only). Plasma was obtained by centrifugation and stored at −70°C until analysis. Using a validated LC/MS/MS method, we quantified the plasma concentrations of AR9281 by electrospray ionization in positive mode using a deuterated internal standard. The linear range of the assay was 3 to 3130 nmol/L.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic parameters calculated from plasma concentrations of AR9281 using a noncompartmental method included area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to time of last quantifiable concentration (AUC<sub>0-t</sub>), AUC from 0 to time of last quantifiable concentration extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>0-inf</sub>), maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), time when C<sub>max</sub> is reached (T<sub>max</sub>), and terminal half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>).</p>
<p>Evaluation of pharmacodynamics included s-EH activity in whole blood, urinary output of oxylipids, and serum levels of inflammatory markers high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).</p>
<sec id="section6-0091270010397049">
<title>Whole-blood s-EH activity</title>
<p>Samples were collected on wet ice and stored at −70°C within 10 minutes of collection. Prior to assay, blood samples were thawed on ice and diluted 10-fold with 25 mM Bis–Tris, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mg/mL BSA, and equilibrated at 30°C for 5 minutes. To measure non–s-EH–mediated EET hydrolysis, diluted blood samples were incubated with a potent s-EH inhibitor, adamanylureadodeanoic acid,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091270010397049">24</xref></sup> at concentrations well above those required for complete inhibition of the enzyme. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 14,15-EET at 10 µM final concentration and were allowed to proceed for 60 minutes at 30°C. Following quench and solid phase extraction steps, the concentrations of 14,15-DHET and 14,15-EET were determined by LC/MS/MS analysis. The s-EH activity is defined by the rate of 14,15-DHET formation, corrected for non–s-EH–mediated hydrolysis.</p>

<title>Determination of urinary oxylipids</title>
<p>Urine samples were collected for 24-hour periods before and after dosing with either AR9281 or placebo. Aliquots of urine samples were incubated with β-glucuronidase and extracted with solid-phase extraction cartridges. Using calibration standards prepared in 50:50 phosphate-buffered saline/methanol, we determined the concentrations of EETs and DHETs (8,9-; 11,12-; 14,15-regioisomers), EpOMEs and dihydroxyoctadecamonoenoic acids (DiHOMEs; 9,10- and 12,13-regioisomers), and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) by an API-4000 LC/MS/MS system in a single run using negative electrospray ionization. The range of the assay was 0.005 to 0.5 ng/mL for DHETs, 0.0125 to 1.25 ng/mL for EETs and EpOMEs, 0.025 to 2.5 ng/mL for 20-HETE, 1 to 100 ng/mL for 12,13-DiHOME, and 10 to 1000 ng/mL for 9,10-DiHOME.</p>

<title>Multiple-Dose Study Design</title>
<p>Healthy, nonsmoking volunteers between the age of 18 and 50 were enrolled into 3 cohorts. In anticipation of a phase 2 study of AR9281 in overweight or obese patients, the BMI inclusion criteria were between 26 and 35. AR9281 100 mg (two 50-mg capsules), 200 mg (one 200-mg capsule), and 400 mg (two 200-mg capsules) every 8 hours or placebo was administered to each cohort in an ascending fashion under fasting condition. Oral dose administration began with a single dose on day 1, followed by dosing every 8 hours on days 2 through 7 (subjects fasted for 1 hour before and after each dose) and a final dose on day 8. Within each cohort, 6 subjects were randomly assigned to receive AR9281 and 2 subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo.</p>
<p>Safety parameters evaluated included AE monitoring, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, continuous cardiac telemetry, and serial physical examinations.</p>

<sec id="section9-0091270010397049">
<title>Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Assessments</title>
<p>Blood samples for determination of s-EH activity and plasma AR9281 concentration were collected before dosing and at 0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18, and 24 hours after the first and last dose. Additional samples were obtained on days 3 through 7 before dosing and on day 14 (144 hours after the last dose). Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected before dosing as well as after the first and last dose for determination of levels of oxylipids. Pharmacokinetic parameters that were derived from plasma AR9281 concentrations included the accumulation ratio (AR) for day 8, AUC<sub>0-8</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>, trough plasma concentrations prior to first daily dose (Cτ) for days 3 through 8, T<sub>max</sub>, and t<sub>1/2</sub>. Pharmacodynamic parameters included blood s-EH activity, urinary oxylipid levels, and serum hs-CRP levels.</p>

<title>Single- and Multiple-Dose Studies in Human</title>
<sec id="section13-0091270010397049">
<title>Study populations</title>
<p>A total of 32 subjects (27 males and 5 females) were enrolled in the single-dose study; 28 of these subjects received AR9281 treatment. The mean age was 32 years (range, 20-50). The mean body weight was 78 kg (range, 52-101) and mean BMI was 26.1 (range, 20.4-30.8). The multiple-dose study enrolled 24 subjects (18 males and 6 females) with 18 subjects receiving AR9281 treatment. The mean age was 35 years (range, 22-49). The mean body weight was 84 kg (range, 62-116) and mean BMI was 29.0 (range, 25.9-35.0).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0091270010397049">
<title>Tolerability</title>
<p>Single oral doses of AR9281 ranging from 10 to 1000 mg were well tolerated with no dose-related AEs observed. Five of 32 subjects (16%) reported 6 treatment-emergent AEs during the study, and all but 2 AEs were reported after the subjects received placebo. No AEs were reported at the highest doses of AR9281 (750 mg and 1000 mg). There was 1 AE each at the 10-mg (headache) and 500-mg (vasovagal syncope) AR9281 doses. Headache was the only AE reported by more than 1 subject (3/32 subjects, 9%), and 2 of these subjects were in the placebo group.</p>
<p>Multiple oral doses of AR9281 ranging from 100 to 400 mg every 8 hours were safe and well tolerated. A total of 9 of 24 subjects (38%) reported 16 treatment-emergent AEs during the study. Similar numbers of AEs and subjects who reported at least 1 AE were recorded for the 200-mg, 400-mg, and placebo groups. The 100-mg group had the lowest incidence of AEs. The only AEs reported by more than 1 subject were musculoskeletal pain (2 subjects in the 200-mg AR9281 group) and vasovagal syncope (1 subject each in the 200-mg and 400-mg AR9281 treatment groups). There were no changes in laboratory serum creatine kinase levels associated with the AEs of musculoskeletal pain.</p>
<p>In both studies, all AEs were considered mild in intensity. No AE was considered probable or definitely related to the study drug. There were no serious AEs or AEs leading to study discontinuation. Mean hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs, physical examination findings, and ECG results and changes from baseline were similar across all treatment groups, and no apparent treatment or dose-related trends were observed.</p>

The plasma exposure as described by the AUC of AR9281 increased with increasing doses in a dose-proportional manner from 10 to 500 mg but increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner at doses above 500 mg. The variability of AUC parameters as measured by coefficient of variation (CV) was generally less than 40%, with the exception of a higher CV observed at the 250-mg dose. The mean C<sub>max</sub> increased with increasing doses in a dose-proportional manner from 10 to 250 mg. AR9281 was rapidly absorbed, given that the median T<sub>max</sub> ranged from 0.8 to 3.0 hours across dose levels after a single oral administration. There was a trend toward increasing median T<sub>max</sub> with increasing dose. The mean t<sub>1/2</sub> was 3.0 to 4.0 hours except for the 500-mg and 1000-mg doses, in which t<sub>1/2</sub> was approximately 5 hours.</p>

Once-daily dosing at 1000 mg, twice-daily dosing at 500 mg, or thrice-daily dosing at 250 mg is expected to maintain plasma levels in excess of this target.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first report of clinical testing of a selective s-EH inhibitor. The safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AR9281 were evaluated in healthy human volunteers in single- and multiple-dose studies. Orally administered AR9281 up to a 1000-mg single dose or 400 mg every 8 hours for 7 days was well tolerated in both male and female subjects. There were no changes in blood pressure, hs-CRP, IL-6, and plasma glucose of these healthy volunteers. In the multiple-dose study, a sustained inhibition of whole-blood s-EH activity and reduction of urinary oxylipid output were achieved when AR9281 was dosed as low as 100 mg every 8 hours. Under these conditions, where blood s-EH activity was inhibited more than 90% for more than 7 days, AR9281 was well tolerated, supporting the safety of s-EH inhibition. These safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of AR9281 support the conduct of a phase 2 clinical study to test this drug candidate for its potential pharmacological effects in a disease population, essentially serving as a clinical proof-of-concept study for s-EH inhibition as a novel therapeutic target.</p>
<p>In the single-dose study, AR9281 plasma exposure as described by AUC increased in a dose- proportional manner up to the 500-mg dose level, and a greater than dose-proportional increase was observed at higher doses. In the multiple-dose study, there was a dose-proportional relationship for AUC and C<sub>max</sub> between the 100-mg and 400-mg cohorts on day 1, and a slightly more than dose-proportional increase was evident after repeated dose administration on day 8. The urinary excretion data suggest that oxidative metabolism is the dominant pathway for AR9281 elimination with a minority of the parent drug excreted in the unchanged form (data not shown). The deviation from linear pharmacokinetics observed at higher doses may be the result of saturation of the oxidative metabolism of the drug.</p>
<p>AR9281 was a potent inhibitor of s-EH both in vitro and ex vivo, as measured by its hydrolysis activity using 14,15-EET as substrate. In placebo-treated subjects there were no circadian or systematic changes in whole-blood s-EH activity. Although there was considerable intersubject variability of blood s-EH activity derived from baseline data, the percentage inhibition or EC<sub>50</sub> was consistent across individual subjects following oral administration of AR9281. This consistency of s-EH inhibition by AR9281 supported the use of a single combined EC<sub>90</sub> value to calculate the time above 90% inhibition for each subject at each dose level. The time for which the subject’s whole blood showed greater than 90% inhibition increased with increasing dose and was in excess of 8 hours at doses of 250 mg and above. The observed inhibition was consistent with the time above EC<sub>90</sub> determined from 1-compartment modeling. This result, in addition to the pharmacokinetics, supported the choice of an every-8-hour dosing regimen for the multiple-dose study.</p>
<p>In a rat model of hypertension, AR9281 decreased blood pressure, renal injury, and expression of inflammatory genes in the kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091270010397049">21</xref></sup> when administered at a dose level known to result in inhibition of s-EH whole-blood activity comparable to that observed in this clinical evaluation. In addition, when evaluated in a murine DIO model of insulin resistance, AR9281 was efficacious at doses that resulted in greater than 90% inhibition of s-EH whole-blood activity at trough. Thus, the current pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis of the relationship between plasma concentration of AR9281 and the extent of s-EH inhibition indicates that the maintenance of trough concentration of 370 nM would achieve the pharmacological target of 90% or greater inhibition of whole-blood s-EH activity in human subjects.</p>
<p>In addition to whole-blood enzyme activity, urinary oxylipids were evaluated as potential biomarkers of target inhibition. The hydrolysis products of a number of epoxylipid substrates, including 3EET hydrolysis products (8,9; 11,12; and 14,15-DHET) and 2 epoxyoctadecamonoenoic (linoleic) acid hydrolysis products (9,10 and 12,13-DiHOME), were measured in urine samples before and after dosing of AR9281 or placebo. The urinary excretion of these epoxylipid hydrolysis products was decreased following dosing of AR9281 on day 1, and a sustained or further reduction in urinary oxylipids was observed following repeated dosing of AR9281 on day 8. However, the quantitative relationship between AR9281 plasma levels and changes in urinary oxylipids could not be well defined. Although the consistency of AR9281 effect was evident in 14,15-EET hydrolysis activity and in urinary oxylipids, the full complexity of s-EH substrates and products, as well as their multiple clearance mechanisms, was not reflected in the analysis of endogenous oxylipids. For example, substrates for s-EH include nearly all epoxylipids to some extent, including EETs, EpOMEs, epoxydocosapentanoic acids, epoxycannabinoids, and other lipids. The EETs and DHETs are cleared from plasma by several other mechanisms, including β-oxidation and esterification. The endogenous levels of oxylipids also are strongly influenced by the types and amounts of lipids in the diet. These complexities presumably contribute to the observation of a large interindividual variability in baseline urinary oxylipids.</p>
<p>To assess the role of s-EH in human diseases, baseline whole-blood s-EH activity was evaluated in 150 hypertensive and/or diabetic patients together with 50 healthy volunteers in a separate study. The blood s-EH activity was significantly higher in patients with hypertension and with type 2 diabetes compared with healthy volunteers (data not shown). Given that the elevation of whole-blood EET hydrolysis activity may not directly reflect s-EH involvement in disease pathogenesis, these data, in combination with data from preclinical studies in hypertension and diabetes models, are consistent with the concept that s-EH inhibition may be a meaningful pharmacological target for human diabetes and hypertension.</p>
<p>These clinical studies of a selective s-EH inhibitor permitted us to define a dosing regimen to achieve sustained inhibition of 90% or greater of blood s-EH activity in human subjects. Based on the safety and solid pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship in healthy subjects, a phase 2 study was designed to examine the effects of AR9281 on blood pressure and glucose tolerance in patients with mild to moderate hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091270010397049">25</xref></sup> The dosing regimens of 600 mg twice daily and 400 mg 3 times daily for 28 days are anticipated to extensively inhibit the molecular target in a sustained manner in patients. Therefore, this AR9281 phase 2 study will allow us to fully explore the potential effects of s-EH inhibition on blood pressure and glucose control in humans.</p>
