<abstract>
<p>This article provides a critique of the policy response to the closure, in 2005, of the MG Rover factory in Longbridge, Birmingham. To date, the Longbridge ‘narrative’ has been dominated by the work of the Labour Government’s MG Rover Task Force to secure the regional supply chain and support redundant workers. However, this represents a selective interpretation of the Longbridge experience. Important alternative narratives have been neglected, including the local impacts of closure, the role of front-line officials and voluntary and community groups in mitigating these, and future regeneration. The article considers these important issues and, thus, seeks to contribute to a more inclusive narrative of the Longbridge closure, the policy response to it and the lessons arising in light of the present crisis engulfing the European automotive industry. The article concludes that the nature and scope of the public policy response to industrial closure must be multi-level and multi-thematic in outlook and ensure investment in the resilience of local economy and society.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094213483968" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The European automotive industry is currently afflicted by declining sales and profitability precipitated by the Eurozone crisis and chronic over-capacity within the sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094213483968"><italic>Economist</italic>, 2012</xref>). European governments have sought to avert plant closures and redundancies through subsidies and ‘scrappage’ schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094213483968"><italic>Economist</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, the recent closures enacted by Fiat (Sicily) and Opel (Antwerp), and proposed by Opel (Bochum) and Peugeot Citroen (Paris), suggest significant Europe-wide contraction of production and employment is inevitable.</p>
<p>The UK sector remains comparatively stable, although production and sales remain below pre-recession levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094213483968"><italic>Economist</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, a wave of UK automotive closures punctuated the previous decade, including, in April 2005, that of the MG Rover (MGR, formerly Austin), factory in Longbridge, south-west Birmingham, with the loss of 6000 jobs. This article assesses the policy response to the Longbridge crisis and identifies lessons in the context of the threat of further automotive and other manufacturing closures in Europe.</p>
<p>The pre-eminent Longbridge narrative has been that associated with the government Task Force (MGRTF), a temporary, single-purpose, multi-sector, non-statutory partnership charged with assisting the redundant MGR workers and regional supply chain. This dominance is reflected in the existing Longbridge literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094213483968">Bailey and MacNeill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094213483968">Bailey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094213483968">Bentley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094213483968">House of Commons, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094213483968">MGRTF, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094213483968">NAO (National Audit Office), 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094213483968">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>), much of which identifies the task force as ‘best practice’ in responding to industrial failure.</p>
<p>The present article argues, however, that the policy response to the Longbridge crisis was multi-faceted and involved shifting agendas and coalitions, reflecting a marked divide between regional economic stakeholders (including the Task Force), on the one hand, and local social partners at the ‘coalface’ (including local authority neighbourhood offices and the third sector), on the other. The task force narrative represents only a <italic>partial</italic> account of the Longbridge story and the potential lessons arising. Alternative narratives have been sidelined, including the local impacts of closure, the role of neighbourhood officials and voluntary and community sector in mediating these, plus the future development challenge.</p>
<p>This narrative fragmentation is reflected in the extant literature on plant closure, a defining feature of which is a demarcation between research on the nature, scope and impacts of closure, on the one hand, and policy response, on the other. The former focuses on: the origins and process of industrial closure (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094213483968">Pike, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094213483968">Tomaney et al., 1999</xref>); the labour market experience of redundant workers (e.g. Pinch and Mason, 1991); the consequences for regional and local labour markets (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094213483968">Beatty et al., 2007</xref>) and the ‘resilience’ of localities to recover from economic shocks (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094213483968">Dawley et al., 2010</xref>). The latter focuses on: area regeneration to promote economic diversification (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094213483968">Hall and Hubbard, 1998</xref>) or social inclusion (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094213483968">Jones and Edwards, 2009</xref>); personal support to counter the effects of redundancy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094213483968">Coulson, 2009</xref>); and the (commonly deployed in the UK) task force model (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094213483968">Pike, 2000</xref>). In short, notwithstanding arguments for a more holistic assessment of industrial closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094213483968">Pike, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094213483968">Tomaney et al., 1999</xref>), the literature remains segmented, often along disciplinary lines.</p>
<p>The present article seeks to contribute to a more comprehensive history of the Longbridge experience, to evaluate the Task Force in a broader context, and to give due prominence to the neglected alternative narratives cited above.</p>
<p>The article is informed by empirical research, conducted during 2008–2009, updated in 2012, and funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. This comprised a review of academic and policy literature plus approximately 30 semi-structured interviews with local and local policy makers and community activists.</p>
<p>The article comprises four further sections. The second section describes the decline of MGR and the socio-economic context of south-west Birmingham. The third section appraises the work of the Task Force, neighbourhood offices and voluntary and community sector in the immediate aftermath of closure. The fourth section assesses the Longbridge Area Action Plan which provides for long-term regeneration. The concluding section considers the nature and scope of an alternative holistic response to the Longbridge closure and the lessons for European policy makers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094213483968"><title>The Longbridge closure in context</title>
<p>Birmingham has, historically, been one of the pre-eminent centres of automotive production in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094213483968">Gwynne, 1996</xref>). In the past 40 years, the sector has been characterised by unremitting decline in production and employment. In the 1970s, historic marques – Austin (Longbridge), MG, Jaguar, Morris, Rover, and Triumph – were amalgamated into British Leyland, a conspicuously unsuccessful public venture. Successive private owners; British Aerospace (1988), BMW (1994) and management consortium Phoenix Ventures (2000, Longbridge only), were unable to arrest the decline. Phoenix’s failure to secure a strategic alliance with Shanghai Automotive sealed MGR’s fate and (with the closure of Peugeot, Coventry, 2007), ended a century of mass-market vehicle production in the West Midlands. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094213483968">Berkeley et al. (2005)</xref> attribute the collapse of MGR to its inability to compete in a sector dominated by trans-national corporations, due to its failure to achieve economies of scale, inadequate investment in product-led design and workforce skills, poor strategic leadership, and unsupportive state industrial policy.</p>
<p>The Longbridge closure occurred during a period of economic prosperity, with strong employment growth nationally and in south-west Birmingham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094213483968">Bailey et al., 2011</xref>). However, this obscured structural weaknesses in the local economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094213483968">Smith, 1989</xref>). The area is often characterised as a ‘Joe Average, big city, edge of city’ white, working-class locality. It experienced rapid residential development driven by job growth in consumer goods industries until the 1960s, but continued in situ employment decline in the dominant local employers, MGR and Cadbury, thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094213483968">Smith, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094213483968">CURS (Centre for Urban and Regional Studies) (2008)</xref> found that levels of multiple deprivation (defined by a composite index incorporating unemployment, car ownership, social class and housing overcrowding indicators) in the three wards of south-west Birmingham (Longbridge, Northfield, Weoley), were worse than the Birmingham average, that of adjacent suburban areas, and were deteriorating. In 1981, Longbridge was ranked in the most deprived decile of the 760 West Midlands wards, Weoley in the most deprived quintile and Northfield in the second quintile. By 2001, all three were in the most deprived quintile, with Longbridge and Weoley in the most deprived decile. In short, long before the MGR closure, the socio-economic trajectory of south-west Birmingham was problematic. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094213483968">Smith (1989: 265)</xref> noted:<disp-quote>
<p>Improvement had traditionally been perceived as the active response of the individual or community in south-west Birmingham. For decades, since the turn of the century, people have gone there to seek it and have expected the locality to deliver the goods. This was plausible when Herbert Austin lived in the Lickey Hills and the paternalistic regime was alive at Bourneville. It was still plausible during the long boom years of the 1950s and early 1960s. However, for a long time, the major decisions affecting the south-west Birmingham economy, not least the capacity to yield fruits to labour, have been taken far from the Bristol Road.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0269094213483968"><title>The short-term policy response</title>
<p>The Longbridge plant closed during the 2005 UK General Election campaign. The default response of the Labour Government to industrial crisis was to establish a task force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094213483968">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A previous task force had been created in 2000 following the Phoenix takeover of MGR. Its strategy, supported by a £60 m grant, was to promote diversification in the regional automotive cluster and to valorise, through the Regional Spatial Strategy, ‘knowledge economy’ assets located in a ‘Central Technology Belt’ from central Birmingham to Malvern, via Longbridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094213483968">Bailey and MacNeill, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The remit of the new task force, supported by a £176 m grant, was to advise the Government on emergency support to the MGR workers, firms in the supply chain and local communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094213483968">MGRTF, 2006</xref>). The Task Force was led by Advantage West Midlands (the now defunct Regional Development Agency) and its membership was strongly skewed towards other strategic economic stakeholders: Department of Trade and Industry, Learning and Skills Council, Chamber of Commerce, trade unions, plus Members of Parliament and local authority core executive members and officers. The Department for Work and Pensions and Job Centre Plus were peripherally involved but organisations with a socio-spatial remit (e.g. Communities and Local Government) were conspicuously absent. The logic that underpinned the Task Force’s work can be characterised as one of old-fashioned industrial sector policy, as opposed to locally embedded cluster development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094213483968">Bailey and MacNeill, 2008</xref>). The substantive actions of the Task Force reflected this: wage subsidies, diversification grants and a ‘skills hub’ labour exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094213483968">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>). The Task Force, through these actions, defined its primary constituencies as former Longbridge workers and MGR suppliers and sub-contractors, as opposed to the disadvantaged local communities of south-west Birmingham.</p>
<p>The Task Force, within the terms of reference prescribed by government, can be considered a notable success. In its final report (January 2006), it concluded: ‘We have set a benchmark for how a region should respond in the event of a major industrial closure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094213483968">MGRTF, 2006</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>The Task Force noted that some 4000 (two-thirds) of the former MGR workers had secured new, mostly full-time, employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094213483968">MGRTF, 2006</xref>: 2). Moreover, the intervention of the first task force had averted some 12,000 additional supply chain redundancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094213483968">MGRTF, 2006</xref>: 2). These outcomes are corroborated by independent research, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094213483968">Bailey et al. (2011)</xref> observed that many redundant workers (especially non-skilled staff) had found less remunerative and more casualised employment than at Longbridge.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of the present article to challenge this assessment per se, merely to note that to evaluate the Task Force exclusively according to its own terms of reference, plus the neglect of alternative histories, inhibits the development of a more comprehensive narrative of change and lesson learning.</p>
<p>Local social partners expressed reservations about the nature and scope of the Task Force’s work, especially the extent to which these deflected attention from the impacts on an already disadvantaged locality. These included increasing levels of long-term unemployment (especially among non-MGR workers crowded out of labour market opportunities following closure) in south-west Birmingham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094213483968">CURS, 2008</xref>), plus declining retail turnover, loss of commercial viability of local centres (hitherto sustained by the expenditure of MGR workers) and increased rates of anti-social behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094213483968">BCC (Birmingham City Council), 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the Task Force, given its membership, its terms of reference, its short life and its ‘programme management’ mentality, failed to embed itself in the governance of south-west Birmingham and, thus, contribute to building a more resilient local economy and society. As one local official noted:<disp-quote>
<p>The Task Force was directed by central government. They had a very clear idea of what their responsibilities were and, to a large extent, stuck to these. It’s very much the powers allocated, what powers they have to spend their money, what targets and responsibilities they have to deliver against and then report back on their performance. It’s quite a straight line process for central government agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094213483968">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The challenge of alleviating the neighbourhood impacts of closure and promoting community regeneration was borne by Birmingham City Council’s local staff and neighbourhood partners. This role is marginalised by the pre-eminent task force narrative.</p>
<p>The Longbridge closure was preceded by a decade of devolution of service delivery and responsibility for public engagement to 10 Constituency Offices through the Council’s ‘localisation’ project. Local ‘partnership capital’ was, fortuitously, already well developed by spring 2005. However, the economic development function of the local authority had, during the same period, been reduced to supporting ‘difficult to reach’ groups and capital investment was focused on Birmingham city centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094213483968">Barber and Hall, 2008</xref>). Fundamentally, the Council’s response was constrained by the <italic>ultra vires</italic> doctrine. As one local official noted:<disp-quote>
<p>You have got government agencies and bits of Birmingham City Council moving into areas that are untried and uncharted, where they have to set their own accountability or ask for that accountability. There’s an approval and procedural issues. Officers can’t just say ‘well, we’ll do that then’ because they need to ensure that they’re acting within their powers and get political approval.</p></disp-quote>The neighbourhood staff were, thus, obliged to respond to closure as best they could given the highly circumscribed legal competences at their disposal. The redundant workers were duly advised, initially via an emergency telephone hotline, on debt and benefit entitlements (e.g. Housing and Council Tax Benefit, free school meals) but these measures were not commensurate with the profundity of the crisis or the sheer level of demand arising. A local official observed:<disp-quote>
<p>We had no experience in counselling, as in how to appreciate the feelings that people were obviously going through; the anger, the upset, everything like that. It was horrendous. It was a case of, when we get the phone call, what can we do first? It was all hands to the deck. Benefits needed to be put into payment, Council Tax needed to be sorted out, but in the first instance, people just wanted to talk. It was shock. There were people that were confused and scared. They didn’t even have milk, coffee or whatever.</p></disp-quote>Birmingham City Council had, in tandem with ‘localisation’, sought to promote community regeneration by building capacity in the third sector in south-west Birmingham. This strategy was consistent with the orthodoxy of the time, influenced by communitarianism and social capital theory, that improving the breadth and depth of associational activity were a prerequisite for positive social and economic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094213483968">Kearns, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the development of social capital in south-west Birmingham had, historically, been stymied by the dominance of the two large and paternalistic employers, MGR and Cadbury. Local social capital was strong but internalised within the firm and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094213483968">Smith, 1989</xref>). Audits demonstrated that the quantity and quality of local community infrastructure was poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094213483968">BCC, 2008a</xref>). A local official observed:<disp-quote>
<p>Some areas are quite bleak in terms of what activities are out there, and there isn’t really the physical infrastructure to enable groups to get premises, to meet, to run activities, because big municipal estates want tenants’ halls or whatever, and a church is perhaps struggling, and that’s about it.</p></disp-quote>The few local groups involved in social enterprise in spring 2005 were funded by time-limited projects or endured a precarious grant dependent existence. These included a single credit union and only the Longbridge Area Resource Centre (LARC) engaged in job search and training support activity. The Task Force funded MGR Community Support Board was established to develop leisure, vocational training and outreach work and, evolving from this, Community Network south-west, a European Union part-funded project (2006 to 2008), offered capacity building support to local groups through its Equip and Enable scheme.</p>
<p>The closure of MGR witnessed a dramatic surge of government investment into south-west Birmingham. However, local community and voluntary sector groups were disadvantaged in competition for these funds, compared to large national suppliers, by the rules, regulations and timescales of the Task Force, Learning and Skills Council and Job Centre Plus. Indeed, the Task Force partners were criticised by many local activists for their ‘programme management’ mentality. This favoured economies of scale, with thresholds of management capacity, accountability and probity that effectively excluded local groups from bidding, plus a prescriptive set of processes that emphasised expenditure to achieve measurable outcomes within a constrained timescale. The result, it was claimed, was a failure to encourage grass-roots innovation, leakage of resources to external private suppliers and a failure to invest in community capacity building within the locality. As one local activist put it:<disp-quote>
<p>The community was never, ever on the Task Force agenda … it was just so stupid, the way they did all those targets … short, sharp pots of money are not any use to anybody.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The Longbridge closure gave rise to a wholly new organisation, the Rover Community Action Trust (RCAT), established by the MGR Wives Group. It was funded, initially, by charitable donations, including from Birmingham City FC. RCAT’s first official function was to dispatch a coach delegation, circumventing regional gatekeepers, to petition 10 Downing Street directly. It secured £2.6 m for local projects through the custom-made Step Forward programme, although even this was compromised by the ‘project management’ mentality of the accountable bodies. The high political profile and campaigning success of RCAT led it to eclipse the pre-existing voluntary and community sector actors in the Longbridge narrative. Much political capital was invested by the Task Force partners in this highly committed, but new and inexperienced, group. A local official observed:<disp-quote>
<p>RCAT suffers from it being just so easy to think ‘well, that’s the community, that’s RCAT’. It’s always going to be more complex than that, but the reality of trying to embrace that complexity, channel it to what it wants to do, and influence policy, it’s just a nightmare, of resource as much as anything else.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094213483968"><title>Long-term regeneration</title>
<p>The completion of the Task Force’s work in early 2006 does not constitute the ‘closure’ of the Longbridge story as the pre-eminent narrative might imply. The policy focus in south-west Birmingham shifted to the regeneration of the 145 hectare brownfield site, advantageously located in the centre of England, on which the 100-year-old MGR works were built.</p>
<p>The Longbridge Area Action Plan (LAAP) provides the statutory basis for the long-term redevelopment of the site. The preparation of the LAAP followed, from April 2006, a highly prescriptive process required by the <italic>Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004</italic>. The plan was co-produced by the three local planning authorities across whose jurisdictions the vast site lay (Birmingham City Council, Bromsgrove District Council and Worcestershire County Council) in consultation with the monopoly landowner and developer, St Modwen PLC (who acquired the site for £60 m prior to the closure of MGR and leased it back to the ailing firm). The process also required the periodic consultation of 25,000 residents in south-west Birmingham, and the scrutiny and approval of the Planning Inspectorate (PINS).</p>
<p>The LAAP is branded as an employment-led mixed-use scheme that provides a land-use planning framework for the period 2008 to 2023. Its objective is to: ‘not only deliver tomorrow’s jobs today through a major high technology focused Regional Investment Site (RIS), but also help Birmingham prepare for climate change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094213483968">BCC, 2008b</xref>: 1). Substantively, the LAAP represents an orthodox (if huge) mixed-use scheme that seeks to balance regional economic development, community aspirations, commercial viability and housing need. Its housing-led funding formula, typical of the period and conceived at a time of market buoyancy, relied on returns on market-led residential sites to cross-subsidise less financially attractive uses such as affordable housing, community facilities and employment sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094213483968">Gibb and Sullivan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094213483968">Parkinson et al., 2009</xref>). The success of the development was dependent on: sufficient market interest in the proposed mix of uses; adequate development resources to ensure completion; and, sufficient planning gain (S.106, Community Infrastructure Levy) to pay for public goods and environmental enhancement.</p>
<p>Four future development options for Longbridge were mooted; the existing local planning policy framework, premised on resisting the loss of employment land, which was dismissed as unrealistic given limited market demand for such uses, and three mixed-use schemes that combined employment, town centre uses and residential development in different proportions. The final LAAP scheme, approved by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094213483968">PINS in February 2009</xref>, a variant of the ‘employment-led’ scenario, comprised: a mixed-use local centre including retail space (<grant-sponsor>13,000 m<sup>2</sup></grant-sponsor>), community facilities (the Austin heritage centre), and a new campus for Bournville College; a 25 hectare Regional Innovation Site or ‘RIS’ (part of the Central Technology Belt), enhancements to Longbridge railway station (including park and ride facilities), and (crucially) 1400 dwellings.</p>
<p>The most notable outcome of the planning process was the diminution of the importance of high value-added economic development uses relative to uses designed to provide a commercial return for St Modwen (housing, retail). Indeed, this trend was noted by key regional stakeholders. The West Midlands Regional Assembly, in its submission to the Planning Inspectorate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094213483968">PINS, 2009</xref>), argued that: ‘Given the size of the site, there are potential opportunities for other uses to be included in order to promote regeneration and create sustainable communities. These should not detract, however, from the delivery of the high technology strategy’.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these concerns, only 25 hectares of land were allocated to the RIS in the approved scheme, compared to the 50 hectares proposed in the original ‘employment-led’ development scenario and West Midlands Regional Spatial Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094213483968">GOWM, 2008</xref>). This is in spite of the paucity of substantial employment sites in Birmingham, generally, and the Central Technology Belt, in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094213483968">BCC, 2008c</xref>). In complete contrast, some 1400 dwellings were planned as part of the approved scheme, compared to only 700 proposed by the original ‘employment-led’ development option.</p>
<p>The shifting balance of land uses within the LAAP, the projected outcomes of which were only just acceptable to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094213483968">PINS (2009)</xref>, can be attributed to a number of mutually reinforcing issues. The original objective was to create 10,000 new jobs. The planning process concluded that, with higher development densities, this goal could be attained with a more modest RIS. There was concern within Birmingham City Council and the local community that the over-provision of high value-added job opportunities would disproportionately benefit skilled commuters rather than the unskilled and semi-skilled residential workforce of south-west Birmingham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094213483968">Burfitt and Ferrari, 2008</xref>). There was, in any case, limited commercial demand for employment development within the locality and resisting the loss of employment land could easily be challenged at planning appeal, whereas maximising the number of housing units could, simultaneously, underwrite less profitable uses and enable the city to realise its 10-year house building targets of 50,000 units. Finally, the highly consultative planning process resulted in the rejection, by local people, of employment uses in favour of better local facilities: Longbridge residents having, perhaps, tired of living in the shadow of an industrial monolith.</p>
<p>The funding formula of the LAAP, housing led and underpinned by assumptions based on the strong property value growth that prevailed at the time of its preparation, was of a type potentially acutely sensitive to macroeconomic and property market contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094213483968">Gibb and Sullivan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094213483968">Parkinson et al., 2009</xref>). In the context of the on-going recession and credit crunch, market interest in residential development at Longbridge has proved more modest than anticipated and this has, in turn, precipitated a problem of inadequate capital receipts to finance planning gain commitments. St Modwen has struggled to honour its S.106 agreements and it has sought a substantial (50%) reduction and deferral of these crucial payments. This threatens the very integrity of the scheme with a plethora of public goods and environmental enhancements (affordable housing and workspace, library, neighbourhood plan design statement, river works, town centre management scheme, Austin Heritage Centre) all dependent on these development gains.</p>
<p>The most elementary challenge, however, is the time required to effect positive change in south-west Birmingham. The LAAP assumes a 15-year development. In light of the changed economic circumstances, this is considered unrealistic by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094213483968">PINS (2009)</xref>. It also presents a formidable challenge of managing public expectations for local planners and politicians. A local official observed:<disp-quote>
<p>The issue (time) is very difficult for communities to face. Basically, it’s saying that nothing is going to happen for years. It can’t. You can’t provide different employment tomorrow. It’s not going to happen. That truth, that reality is hard to take. To stand up in front of a public meeting and to say what’s going to happen on the site (a huge site in this case) is impossible for any officer or politician to say. That vacuum of knowledge is there. Measures to assist are precisely that; measures to assist. It is not within the gift of anybody.</p></disp-quote>The potential development gains of the LAAP, if realised, could endow the local voluntary and community sector in south-west Birmingham with substantial and sustainable assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094213483968">BCC, 2008b</xref>). However, as noted above, the sector’s lack of vision, voice and, crucially, institutional capacity has hindered the response to this unprecedented opportunity. The Development Trust Association (DTA), engaged to advise on the possibility of establishing a local community development trust, noted that the continuing lack of neighbourhood leadership, vision and capacity continues to be a fundamental problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094213483968">DTA, 2008</xref>). A local official observed:<disp-quote>
<p>It is a situation where you have a resource, but no community organisation to run it. It does feel like an opportunity and we’re looking for, trying to create a community of interest to run it which is very difficult because community initiative comes from a drive, and it will go whichever way the drive takes it. There is a limit to how you can pick on an asset and say ‘who wants it, come on community’.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>RCAT, however, has, become a victim of its own early campaigning success and high political profile. The process of adapting from its original lobbying mission to an implementation role that reflects current needs has proved problematic. A local official noted:<disp-quote>
<p>This is a characteristic of much voluntary sector activity that started with a strong campaign against something, that starts to be successful in helping support a response to that and then becomes part of the response that you were originally campaigning against. There is a time when you are outside the tent pissing in, and when you are inside the tent pissing out, with everyone else.</p></disp-quote></p>

<p>This article has sought to contribute to a comprehensive history of the policy response to the closure of MG Rover, Longbridge, in spring 2005, to evaluate the well-documented Task Force in context, to reclaim neglected narratives (the local authority neighbourhood office and voluntary and community sector roles, and the long-term regeneration challenge), and to highlight lessons in the context of potential further Europe-wide automotive and other manufacturing closures.</p>
<p>The different elements of the Longbridge policy response are typical of approaches to industrial closure, regional development, local planning and community regeneration pursued in Britain during the past decade. Longbridge has, for example, provided the paradigmatic example of the peculiarly British task force model. A rapid mobilisation of expertise and resources of national and regional economic stakeholders was realised and facilitated the adjustment to the crisis of supply chain companies and redundant workers. However, the Longbridge experience exemplifies the restricted membership and short termism inherent to the task force model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094213483968">Pike 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094213483968">2002</xref>). Birmingham City Council’s localisation programme provided a platform for rapid mobilisation of local partnership capital at the ‘coalface’. However, the deficiencies of British local authorities as a vehicle for responding to acute industrial crisis are well illustrated by the Longbridge closure. The lack of tax-raising and investment powers, compared to European local government, to effect long-term change is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094213483968">Parkinson et al., 2004</xref>). However, the absence of a local power of general competence (the <italic>ultra vires</italic> doctrine), also atypical in a European context, prohibited a more flexible short-term response in south-west Birmingham. The cultivation of social capital and resident participation, conversely, represents a Europe-wide orthodoxy in which the UK has played a leading role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094213483968">Atkinson and Eckardt, 2004</xref>). The Longbridge experience highlights the difficulties of overcoming path dependency in a locality historically dominated by large paternalistic employers and public service provision. Finally, the funding formula of the Longbridge Action Area Plan exemplifies the limitations of the traditional British approach to property development, based on public regulation of private initiative through indicative development plans. The integrity of the LAAP, especially its capacity to fund public goods and environmental improvements, is contingent upon the developer’s ability to extract sufficient value from the site and a continued advantageous market context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094213483968">Gibb and O’Sullivan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094213483968">Parkinson et al., 2009</xref>). This contrasts with the interventionist tradition in continental Europe premised on public strategic leadership and land acquisition, detailed and binding development plans, and a private sector executive role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094213483968">Galey and Booth, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The elements of an alternative holistic approach were, surprisingly, in place in spring 2005. The response was not constrained fundamentally by a lack of finance or institutional capacity. However, a comprehensive policy response would more effectively deploy these resources between and within the different spheres and tiers of governance. A genuine model of multi-level governance would articulate more effectively – through the political leadership of the democratically elected, multi-purpose local authority, not the unelected, single-purpose Regional Development Agency – the links between the national and regional Task Force stakeholders, on the one hand, and the local social partners and their sponsor ministries (e.g. Communities and Local Government), on the other. A broader coalition would inevitably (and desirably) ensure a multi-thematic response, acknowledging that the impacts of industrial closure are not reducible to the supply chain and redundant workers but also set in train enduring changes in local demography, labour and housing markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094213483968">CURS, 2008</xref>). An alternative strategy would combine the industrial policy of the Task Force with a parallel strengthening of the resilience of the local community, not seeking a return to an unfeasible pre-crisis ‘equilibrium’, but permitting local residents to adapt to the process of long-term change to an indeterminate future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094213483968">Dawley et al., 2010</xref>), taking advantage of opportunities that arise locally, but also elsewhere. An alternative strategy would be predicated on a funding model requiring a dilution of the programme management mentality’s slavish adherence to procedure, outputs and timescales in favour of (admittedly higher risk) local innovation and building the permanent capacity of local civic society to ensure the retention and productive use of investment locally (cf. Davies, 2008).</p>
<p>There seems limited potential to pursue such an approach in the regime of localism and austerity introduced by the Coalition Government elected in spring 2010. The <italic>Localism Act 2011</italic> provides for a rescaling of English governance, abolishing Labour’s regional policy infrastructure, providing a new local government general power of competence, and rights for local communities to build amenities, manage public assets, set up neighbourhood forums and formulate neighbourhood plans. This all takes place in the context of an average cash reduction in local government expenditure of some 27% between 2010 and 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094213483968">Lowndes and Pratchett, 2012</xref>). The Coalition Government has presided over a massive diminution of financial investment and institutional capacity that characterised the previous regime. Key Task Force partners (e.g. Advantage West Midlands) have been replaced by the Greater Birmingham and Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP), a non-statutory partnership with limited budgets and no executive powers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094213483968">Pugalis, 2011</xref>). To date, the LEP’s development priorities have focused on the Birmingham City Centre Enterprise Zone and the M42 ‘Economic Gateway’ in Solihull. Longbridge is designated as an ‘Economic Zone’, permitting access to finance and a simplified planning regime. However, thus far, the (much reduced) resources available through the Regional Growth Fund and Growing Places have not been deployed in support of the LAAP. Birmingham City Council has embarked on a further round of localisation, proposing to devolve 80% of total expenditure to the Constituencies. However, it has struggled to reconcile soaring costs, precipitated by increasing demand for social care, equal pay claims brought by female staff, borrowing requirements, plus costs associated with Private Finance Initiative and ICT contracts, on the one hand, and plummeting government grants, on the other. This necessitates a budget reduction of some £600 m for the period 2010 to 2015, equivalent to 50% of the Council’s controllable expenditure. The local authority may, thus, be obliged to prioritise statutory services (adult and child care) and ‘decommission’ discretionary activity. In this context of ‘crisis management’, the new general power of competence has been little discussed, let alone enacted, by the Council. The <italic>Localism Act</italic> provides opportunities to review whether direct municipal service provision is fit for purpose or, indeed, affordable and if the voluntary and community sector is an appropriate substitute. However, the third sector in Birmingham has experienced an increased level of demand for services in response to adverse socio-economic circumstances, on the one hand, while subject to reduced income from grants and contracts, on the other. The local response to the community empowerment provisions within the <italic>Localism Act</italic> have, unsurprisingly, proved uneven, with greatest demand coming from those neighbourhoods of Birmingham where social capital is most developed (e.g. inner city Balsall Heath). There has been limited demand for asset transfer, community self-build, or neighbourhood planning powers (except for a single community centre, Deelands Hall) from groups in the south-west.</p>
<p>The MGR experience, especially the work of the Task Force, has attracted the attention of European automotive stakeholders such as those associated with the defunct SAAB plant in Trollhättan, Sweden. If there is an over-riding lesson arising from the Longbridge crisis for them, it is the fallacy of reducing industrial failure and policy response to a single dominant narrative.</p>
