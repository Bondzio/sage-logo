<abstract>
<p>This article seeks to understand the meanings associated with HIV/AIDS in China’s media and examine how the “distance” many urban Chinese people feel toward HIV/AIDS is sustained, despite major changes in public health campaigns that indicate otherwise. It draws on evidence from China’s press and public health media, which remain overlooked in studies on attitudes toward HIV even though 90 percent of urban Chinese learn about HIV from the media, making it supremely important in informing urban understandings of the virus. In particular, the article examines how susceptibility to infection has become associated with racial and gender characteristics through the early portrayal of Africans in China’s media reports on HIV/AIDS. It suggests that the geographical and corporeal signification of Africa and Africans establishes an understanding that connects the “dark” consequences of HIV with skin color and a supposed lack of sociomoral and economic development, thus enabling Chinese audiences to perceive themselves as distant from or even immune to the virus. Finally, the article suggests that if attitudes toward HIV/AIDS are to be addressed, then the racialized attitudes in media toward HIV need to be analyzed, challenged, and changed.</p>

<title>Introduction: Distancing Disease</title>
<p>Social understandings of contagion, risk, and prevention are inseparable from the moral economies and historical, ideological, cultural, and political milieus in which constructions of disease and health are formed. In China, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has captured the imagination and attention of international and local politicians, big business, pharmaceutical companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and development agencies like no other disease or disorder ever before. This has happened at the same time as doctors, activists, members of the reading public, and the HIV positive in China have begun to organize around common concerns such as disease and health, discrimination, gay rights, civil society, democratic values, patient rights, and donor funding and its distribution. The formation of interest groups in unprecedented and complex ways also has been greatly assisted by the availability of new virtual and mobile technologies (two author interviews of individuals working in Beijing-based HIV/AIDS organizations, June 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0097700413483275">Yu, 2007</xref>). As a consequence of this activism and technological engagement, HIV now receives the lion’s share of China’s health-related research, publicity, funding, and concern, both local and international. It overshadows other high-prevalence diseases and disorders such as tuberculosis and hepatitis, even though these pose significantly greater public health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0097700413483275">China CDC, 2007a</xref>). Although HIV continues to spread in China and has been called an epidemic in public and medical discourse, statistics from China’s Ministry of Health (MOH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that there are approximately ten times fewer HIV positive per capita in China than the United States, for example (0.05–0.07 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0097700413483275">Berry, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0097700413483275">China CDC, 2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0097700413483275">2007d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0097700413483275">WHO, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0097700413483275">2006b</xref>: 414, 2007). The official estimated number of HIV-positive Chinese citizens at the time of publication (2013) has recently been reevaluated to approximately 500,000, down from approximately 700,000 in 2012. This number has fluctuated greatly since 2002-2003, with the current estimate decreasing almost 400,000 the past decade.</p>
<p>Despite the attention that HIV in China receives across economic, social, and political spheres, those working and publishing in the HIV/AIDS field are concerned that HIV awareness levels among target populations are low and fail to reflect efforts to cultivate correct understandings of HIV transmission risk and appropriate behavior to prevent it. Investigations of urban Chinese people’s attitudes toward HIV ascribe the current and widespread “misunderstandings” of HIV transmission, and the consequent perceptions of HIV-positive sufferers, to “lack of awareness” or “ignorance” (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0097700413483275">“Aizibing diaocha,” 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0097700413483275">China CDC, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0097700413483275">Holtzman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0097700413483275">Kurlantzick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0097700413483275">Li Songbai, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0097700413483275">Wang Guihong, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0097700413483275">“Woguo da chengshi,” 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0097700413483275">Xinhua, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0097700413483275">“Zhongguo tongxinglian qunti,” 2005</xref>). Indeed, during my fieldwork in Beijing, Shanghai, and Xiamen between 2002 and 2008, almost all of the Chinese city-dwellers and university students with whom I discussed HIV/AIDS saw it as a problem of other people. They often indicated they felt “distanced” from HIV, all too frequently making statements such as “AIDS is really far from me” (<italic>aizibing li wo hen yuan</italic>). When I returned to Beijing in 2007, similar trends emerged in both everyday conversations and public lectures delivered by civil society organizations and intellectuals. At the latter, audiences are almost always polled regarding who they understand to get HIV/AIDS and why. Their answers tend to be shaped by the notion that only immoral behavior puts one at risk of contracting HIV, by the fear that HIV sufferers will use the virus to take revenge on society, and by the belief that HIV is not something they themselves could catch. Thus, although HIV’s public profile has risen tremendously since China’s experience of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003, and despite the insistence of public health media on HIV’s potential proximity to urban Chinese media consumers, the complex public understandings of the virus clearly need to be engaged with. As Paula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0097700413483275">Treichler (1999</xref>: 11) reminds us, if “the AIDS epidemic is simultaneously an epidemic of a transmissible lethal disease and an epidemic of meanings or signification,” then how have knowledge and understandings of HIV/AIDS in China spread in ways that have resulted in feelings of “distance” affecting so many people?</p>

<title>Race, Place, and Gender in China’s Health Media: Narrating Difference and Disease</title>
<p>Narratives and language—both text and other visual and auditory mediums used in communication—reflect the epistemic cultures in which they are authored and interpreted. A large body of scholarship<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0097700413483275">1</xref></sup> has helped to elucidate the processes through which scientific and lay narratives about health and disease are absorbed into public imaginations and translated over time into both political responses and individual beliefs about susceptibility, or a lack thereof. Elsewhere I have described this process as one of “imagined immunity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0097700413483275">Hood, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0097700413483275">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The ways in which perceptions of “others” (be they people of lower classes or from other countries or ethnic groups) are influenced by perceptions of the othered group’s habits, hygiene, and health, reflect national insecurities and self-perceptions that are often consequences of historical events. Beliefs about the “dangerous” habits of others are also frequently tied to moral panics underlying concerns about national and racial degeneracy, both in China and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0097700413483275">Gilman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0097700413483275">Rodriquez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0097700413483275">Stoler, 1995</xref>). Conceptions of otherness also may impact the shape and outcomes of public health interventions, alter practices of social inclusion and exclusion, and legitimize biopolitical governance strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0097700413483275">Foucault, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0097700413483275">1978</xref>). Although scientific research is indispensable to the treatment and curing of disease, it does little to explain or engage the processes and impacts of health and illness communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0097700413483275">Treichler, 1999</xref>). It is these communication processes that both reflect and influence people’s imagination of illness and susceptibility and affect choices to engage in behavior that is safe or risky as far as STI transmission is concerned. Disciplines across the social sciences and humanities can be drawn upon to investigate the varying social impacts of health communication, but a failure to detect problems and misunderstandings can result in detrimental public health behavior and serious stigmatization, as China’s case clearly demonstrates (R. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0097700413483275">Zhou, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There are numerous organizations working on improving health communication in China, and although public misunderstandings of HIV/AIDS have been discussed, polled, and quantified for several decades now, the language and statistics in question have remained immune to challenge. Materials used within China’s HIV narrative include sources and ideas derived both from local and international experiences. Those authoring the narrative—journalists, editors, scientists, bloggers, and NGO staff—typically include Euro-American health and photojournalism material (which is also problematic for the way it uses race, sexuality, and disease), together with local material on Chinese medical aid to Africa and coverage of clinical trials and disasters there. These are frequently incorporated without reference to the original source and/or the research context from which the texts and images are taken or which they are describing. Within the media and public health literature, these sources take on their own newly racialized messages, which Larissa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0097700413483275">Heinrich (2007)</xref> calls their “afterlife.”</p>
<p>Existing analyses of attitudes toward HIV in China frequently construe the misunderstandings of HIV transmission and distance felt toward the virus as an audience failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0097700413483275">Piot, 2007</xref>: 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0097700413483275">Tan et al., 2007</xref>: 253; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0097700413483275">UNAIDS et al., 2008</xref>: 6). In this article I undertake an analysis of China’s HIV media and its racialization of Africa and Africans, and especially its use of back women, to explain some of the “distance” that many Chinese people continue to feel toward HIV despite widespread public health campaigns. I examine the Chinese populace’s key source of HIV/AIDS information: the educational and media narrative. In particular, I focus on the way otherness has been characterized in the media through locally conceived categories of race, place, and gender. The materials I analyze include stories in urban newspapers and educational media and videos recommended to me by local residents and experts. They provide a small glimpse of a larger picture made up of scientific and lay reports, educational campaigns, songs, soap operas, and public events and programs. Together, they produce a narrative that reflects and influences individual understandings of health, disease, and HIV transmission risk.</p>
<p>The article contains four main sections. In the first, I provide an overview of the use of otherness in China’s HIV narrative. The second explores the construction of blackness (<italic>hei</italic>) as a key concept associated with Africa and Africans and illustrates how differences between Chinese and non-Chinese are embodied in the media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0097700413483275">2</xref></sup> I show how longstanding and powerful Chinese understandings of otherness are present in the ideology and the signification processes of China’s HIV/AIDS narrative during the period analyzed. I then illustrate how Africa and Africans are portrayed as the original site for the development and transmission of HIV. I examine how their corporealities, habits, and habitats are firmly connected through evolutionary metaphors to the animal species in which the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) first developed and how their bodies are portrayed as mediums in which HIV spreads quickly and with devastating consequences. I go on to show how the capacities of both the virus and African bodies to reproduce uncontrollably are connected and naturalized in the narrative, notably through recourse to longstanding Han Chinese understandings of sexuality and reproduction. As I demonstrate, uncontrolled and uncontrollable sexual activity is portrayed as facilitating the spread of the virus both within and between species, but is also suggested as a cause of what the Chinese media portrays as Africa’s willful rejection of modernity. Again, this seems to reflect early twentieth-century Chinese theorizing of racial hierarchies in which Africans were seen as being less capable than other races. As far as HIV is concerned, I suggest that the geographical and corporeal signification of Africa and Africans establishes an understanding of HIV as a disease with “dark” consequences that affects cultures unevenly—that is, it has worse effects on the less developed. The consequence of this is to convert HIV susceptibility and transmission into not simply a moral or a behavioral problem, but a racial one. As a consequence, HIV is “distanced” from the presumably more advanced and sophisticated urban Chinese media consumer.</p>
<p>In the third section, I address the role women play within China’s HIV/AIDS narrative and show how the historically informed symbolic power of the female body continues to serve specific political purposes in campaigns and cultural media, including HIV media. I focus in particular on the ways in which ideological fear of female sexuality and corporeality figures into China’s HIV/AIDS narrative. As has been well documented, the female body, its fertility, and its sexuality became highly regulated by a powerful nationalistic discourse over the course of the twentieth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700413483275">Edwards, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0097700413483275">Evans, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0097700413483275">Hershatter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0097700413483275">Robinson, 1985</xref>). I then illustrate how this dominant Han Chinese gender ideology informs the representational politics connecting women and the nation, specifically the way healthy urban women have been used to embody the state of the nation and personify a bright, healthy, and well-governed future for the Chinese population and state. Linking back to the previous section, I also suggest that racialized representations of an othered femininity contribute to feelings of distance from HIV and reflect contemporary concerns about modern citizenship and its relationship to health.</p>
<p>In the fourth section, I explore the broad political, economic, and sociocultural implications of portraying non-Han women within HIV media intended for Han Chinese consumers. The gender and racial ideologies briefly described above give specific meaning to the black women and children within China’s HIV narrative. These representations have become tied up with local understandings of disease, especially when contrasted with how HIV is represented in connection to urban Han Chinese women. In this sense, HIV is shown as a disease that spreads within the family through mother–child transmission and as a sign of inadequate mothering. In China’s narrative, the containment of HIV thus appears to depend on a strict regulation of the body to restrain its sexuality and ensure its quality (<italic>suzhi</italic>). By placing such discourses within narratives focusing on the importance of stable and sustained economic growth and development, and by contrasting portrayals of African and Chinese motherhood (notably through reference to the one-child policy), the Chinese body and readership is reaffirmed as disciplined and healthy in comparison to the excesses attributed to Africans. In this way, women are shown to play a central role in successful family planning and in creating a modern and healthy self-policing population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0097700413483275">China CDC, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0097700413483275">Zhang Ruofan, 2006</xref>. For discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700413483275">Edwards, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0097700413483275">Greenhalgh and Winkler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0097700413483275">Handwerker, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>As such, while stressing how questions of health and disease are of increasing importance for understanding contemporary citizenship in China, this article highlights the local role of gender and race in defining notions of “us” and “others” in the health of individual bodies and the body politic (for discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0097700413483275">Lock and Scheper-Hughes, 1987</xref>: 7–8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0097700413483275">Jolly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0097700413483275">McClintock, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0097700413483275">Stoler, 1995</xref>). Contrasting representations of local and non-local women in China’s HIV/AIDS narrative are an important discursive means through which disease is distanced from the local population and notions of belonging are imagined and maintained. These portrayals help to account not only for the propagation of alternative truths about HIV, transmission myths, and the “distance” of HIV/AIDS, but also for the othering and racialization of disease and the social exclusion of local Chinese HIV positive over time.</p>
<p>In examining how China’s HIV/AIDS narrative is assembled and acquires meaning, I avoid interpreting public “lack of awareness” or misunderstandings as the product of media consumers’ failure to understand or absorb HIV-related messages. Regardless of the origin of the sources used in China’s HIV narrative, it is the messages themselves, notably their construction of otherness, that need further attention. On the contrary, media consumers are indeed receiving and reproducing the racialization of difference apparent in China’s health media.</p>
<p>My aim in carrying out this analysis is to draw attention to health communication strategies as productive sites for the engagement of racism in China and to encourage re-evaluation and redesign of China’s health media in ways that will help HIV educators to destigmatize and bring the virus “closer” to their target audiences. I conclude the article by suggesting that if public health campaigns and HIV/AIDS media are to achieve a more accurate and clinical awareness of HIV and the plight of HIV sufferers and the virus’s ability to infect across all racial, gender, and class boundaries, then China’s health media would be a key place to initiate this change.</p>

<title>HIV/AIDS in China: Otherness and the HIV/AIDS Narrative</title>
<p>In 2003, China’s largest state news agency, Xinhua, released a poll indicating that over 90 percent of urban individuals with an awareness of HIV received their information about the virus from China’s media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0097700413483275">“Guanzhu aizibing,” 2003</xref>). That percentage has been maintained since, and given that NGOs, the Ministry of Health, and the China CDC have all identified the media as a readily available resource for shaping public understandings of HIV and transmission risk, it will no doubt continue to fill this important role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0097700413483275">China CDC, 2007c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0097700413483275">2007d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0097700413483275">Li Xiguang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0097700413483275">Li and Zhou, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0097700413483275">MOH, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0097700413483275">Qing’ai gongcheng, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Historically, HIV reportage in China has been shaped by the widespread sociocultural, economic, and political change brought by the development policies China adopted in the late 1970s. This period of economic reform encouraged real and imagined contact between Chinese people and increasingly mobile forms of capital, culture, and information, in addition to bodies and disease. Despite the later efforts of public health campaigns to teach their targeted audiences about the four biomedical transmission paths and the ABCs of HIV prevention (“Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms”), reportage in China (or elsewhere, for that matter) has very little to do with biomedical understanding and symptomatology. Instead, since it was first detected in China in 1985, HIV has become known through more easily accessible and popular metaphors of backwardness, reproduction, uncontrolled passions, greed, and a host of moral claims, such as its association with a lack of spiritual civilization (<italic>jingshen wenming</italic>) or quality (<italic>suzhi</italic>).</p>
<p>The social understandings and sociopolitical sensitivity of HIV cannot be isolated from historical and contemporary issues. First, there is China’s painful memory of its semi-colonial past, specifically the deliberate strategy of encouraging drug dependency among the Chinese on the part of foreign powers. Related to this is the state’s official narrative and the pride it takes in its claims to have wiped out the sex and drug trades (both of which are identified as the main channels for HIV transmission today) and to have reformed those previously involved in these activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0097700413483275">Hershatter, 1997</xref>). There are also key contemporary issues that help explain the complexity of and sensitivity about HIV, as well as the ease with which it has become known as a non-local problem. One major factor is the injustice of China’s blood scandals, and the inability to publish full details about this. In the 1990s, millions of marginalized agriculturalists were encouraged by local and provincial leaders to sell their blood to meet China’s increasing demand for blood and plasma products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0097700413483275">Zhou Shengping, 2007</xref>). Although the actual numbers of resulting deaths are unrecorded, estimates are over one million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0097700413483275">Wu Chenguang, 2002</xref>), and the scandal implicates CCP top brass, while compensation, medical treatment, and access to medication are an ongoing fight for the victims and their advocates. Very few reports in China engage these historical factors or the global and local structural inequalities crucial to the spread of HIV today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0097700413483275">Hood, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0097700413483275">2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0097700413483275">Hyde 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0097700413483275">Yu, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Since stories of non-local HIV-positive subjects have been frequently included in the Chinese media since HIV research and reporting in China began (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0097700413483275">Hood, 2011b</xref>), otherness and difference have played a central role in the gradual shaping of conceptions of HIV within the urban Han audience. When I began the research for this project in 2002, I initially was intrigued by the presence of images of HIV-positive “Africans” in the Chinese media. Over half of the foreign subjects used in HIV media in Beijing were black, and emaciated black Africans dominated China’s public HIV exhibition at the China Science and Technology Museum in December 2002. My archival research, which began with materials from the 1980s, showed that, especially in the 1990s, the large majority of subjects that told and showed HIV/AIDS to viewers, listeners, and readers were non-Han Chinese living outside China. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0097700413483275">Li Xiguang (2004)</xref>, by World AIDS Day 2004, ninety percent of media about HIV in China reported on the virus in foreign or minority contexts. In such reportage, HIV is typically embodied by white male homosexuals, black Africans, or Haitians, and, less frequently, members of poor minority groups and the socially disenfranchised in China and neighboring countries. Regardless of where they are from, these sufferers are typically portrayed as “Africans” living in extreme poverty, practicing non-local, non-urban traditions, and upholding non-local values. Furthermore, they often are shown to have become infected through deviant or unsanctioned sexual or social activity. This has encouraged the perception in China of HIV as a non-local disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0097700413483275">Li Bijian, 2004</xref>: foreword, 2–3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0097700413483275">Li and Bi, 1995</xref>: 237). In other words, the construction of the virus itself as a non-local scourge shares the characteristics of those first shown to suffer from it. Both the virus and its sufferers are typically described as threatening, incurable, and uncontrollable, in addition to frequently being shown as non-Chinese.</p>
<p>There is little variation in media explanations of the spread of HIV in China. At present, when HIV is associated with Chinese bodies, these are typically non-urban and/or non-heteronormative. This is in part explained by the sensitivity of HIV, by the non-local paradigms working to construct knowledge of HIV, and also by the ways in which local knowledge mixed with these. In the earliest stages of the narrative, when a Chinese term for HIV was first introduced into the Chinese language and society, the term used (<italic>mianyi quexian bingdu</italic>) was a translation of the virus’s initial Euro-American biomedical classification as an immunodeficiency virus, whereas the Chinese term for AIDS was translated phonetically from English as <italic>aizibing</italic>. HIV was initially described as a venereal disease (<italic>hualiubing</italic>) and is now commonly referred to as a sexually transmitted disease or infection (STD or STI, <italic>xingbing</italic>). This transmission path is given generous coverage in media and public health literature, and the term STD itself “tells of” the transmission of the virus as taking place through sexual intercourse (<italic>xingjiao</italic>), itself a translated term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0097700413483275">Pan, 2006</xref>: 24–25). In China, as elsewhere, HIV is only rarely described through the more value-neutral language of bodily fluid exchange (<italic>tiye jiaohuan</italic>). HIV media in China today also portrays the virus as being the result of extreme poverty, in that it became epidemic among the rural blood-sellers described above whose participation in the once-lucrative plasma economy was the only way they could hope to be part of China’s modernization process (for discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0097700413483275">Erwin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0097700413483275">Anagnost, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0097700413483275">Jing, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0097700413483275">Shao, 2006</xref>). The destitution HIV-positive blood-sellers are shown to experience is strikingly similar to the hardships HIV-positive Africans are shown to endure.</p>
<p>The image of HIV as a foreign disease was further reinforced by blaming changing local sexual mores and increasing drug use and addiction among marginalized populations on non-local, or “Western,” influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0097700413483275">Liu Zhiren, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0097700413483275">Yang Wenyi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0097700413483275">Wu Xin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0097700413483275">Wu Chenguang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0097700413483275">Gao, Shang, and Guo, 2003</xref>). HIV has also become inextricable from China’s official stance on homosexuals (<italic>tongxinglian</italic>) and the social discourse on <italic>tongzhi</italic> or gay identity (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0097700413483275">Wang Nan, 2004</xref>). Homosexuality remains highly stigmatized in China and “coming out” (<italic>chugui</italic>) is also widely perceived as a product of “opening up” to non-local practices. The belated inclusion of HIV-positive urban Chinese subjects into the narrative has done little to challenge social understandings of HIV as a disease of immorality and misfortune (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0097700413483275">Liu Jun, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0097700413483275">R. Zhou, 2007</xref>). Despite initial attempts by social scientists, NGOs, GONGOs (government-organized NGOs), and corporate social responsibility projects to intervene in China’s media so as to improve health communication techniques, at the time of writing, conceptions of HIV in China remain inseparable from dangerous and uncontrolled sexual activity and non-urban marginality and practices.</p>

<title>Language and Signifying Otherness: Narrating and Naturalizing HIV in Africa and Africans</title>
<sec id="section5-0097700413483275">
<title>Racial Hierarchies, Evolutionary Difference, and the Blackness of Africa and Africans</title>
<p>The language through which Africans have become known in China over the last century is useful to understanding how HIV has become naturalized as a condition belonging to what the Chinese media refer to as “black Africa” (<italic>hei Feizhou</italic>) and “black Africans” (<italic>hei Feizhouren</italic>). The Chinese term used to refer to African people translates literally as “black people” (<italic>heiren</italic>). The Chinese terms for Africa, meanwhile, include “the continent of nothingness” (<italic>Feizhou</italic>), “the black continent of nothingness” (<italic>hei Feizhou</italic>), or even, though more rarely, “the dark continent” (<italic>hei’an dalu</italic>).</p>
<p>In his research on racial hierarchies in Chinese thought and language, Frank Dikötter writes that blackness denotes both the “negative pole of humanity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0097700413483275">1992</xref>: 12) and “the lowest scale in the social hierarchy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0097700413483275">1992</xref>: 15). The meanings associated with black, blackness, and Africa in the Chinese language inform local conceptions of what kind of people and places Africa and Africans are. These meanings and the differences assumed to separate Chinese people from Africans are reaffirmed through current portrayals of race, place, and gendered behavior, which I discuss later in the article. These popular understandings of blackness and their application to Africa may be traced to the late Qing (1644–1911) and the Republican period (1912–1949), when ideas of Africa and Africans became firmly entrenched within newly adopted understandings of race, racial evolution, eugenics, and national progress that were popular at the time. This was also the case with regard to discussions of sexuality, wherein overarching discourses of race reveal what Tani Barlow describes as a “eugenic truth of evolutionary sexuality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0097700413483275">2004</xref>: 9; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0097700413483275">Anagnost, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0097700413483275">Dikötter, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0097700413483275">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0097700413483275">Pusey, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0097700413483275">Sigley, 2001</xref>). In the late Qing and Republican periods, local conceptions of African sexuality and social progress in turn shaped concepts of who Africans and Chinese were and how they had evolved. Dominant Chinese understandings of Africa and Africans as backward and less evolved served as a convenient standard by which to compare conditions in China and the Han Chinese character and social progress, which always emerged as superior. I also discuss this in further detail later.</p>
<p>Descriptions of Africa and Africans in China’s contemporary print media reveal that these historical understandings and prejudices continue into the present, as is also evident by the widespread discrimination that Africans living in China today experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0097700413483275">3</xref></sup> In contemporary Chinese texts, Africa remains a “backward” (<italic>luohou</italic>) place of darkness, chaos, devastating natural disasters, widespread epidemics, and untapped resources. The experiences of African people are sculpted by excessive poverty, sexual promiscuity, and endemic disease, and they are described as lacking skills, expertise, and morals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0097700413483275">Cheng, 2000</xref>: 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0097700413483275">Li Baoping, 1998</xref>: 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0097700413483275">Wu Xin, 2002</xref>: 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0097700413483275">Xiuluobixia, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0097700413483275">Zhang Tiankan, 2002</xref>: 21). China’s media frequently features texts and images that comment on the relationship between the plight of African children, Africa’s leaders, the continent’s seemingly uncertain future, and disease (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0097700413483275">Ke, 2003b</xref>: C20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0097700413483275">“Kenniya de aizibing,” 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0097700413483275">Li Hongyu, 2004</xref>: D25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0097700413483275">“Malawei jihuang,” 2002</xref>: 13; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0097700413483275">Wang and Xu, 1999</xref>: 80; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0097700413483275">Zhuang, 1998</xref>: 3). The fact that reporting on Africa and Africans is racist and discriminatory in China is becoming more widely recognized. In December 2006, the influential state-run Xinhua News Agency prohibited the use of the term <italic>hei Feizhou</italic> (black Africa), in its publications, along with other racialized, derogatory, and/or politically sensitive expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0097700413483275">Xinhua, 2007</xref>). It can be expected that with Internet filtering, this particular way of describing and racializing Africans will diminish over time, even as its use continues on television and in books and blogs today (Xiuluobixia, 2009).</p>

<sec id="section6-0097700413483275">
<title>HIV and the Blackness of Africa and Africans</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, many of the photographic images used in China are taken from non-local material, a trend that led to HIV/AIDS first appearing in the Chinese media in connection with white (Caucasian) homosexuals and largely as a reflection of what was happening in EuroAmerican media and society (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0097700413483275">Gilman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0097700413483275">Treichler, 1999</xref>). Local reports came to associate the virus with Africa, and existing widespread perceptions of the continent and its inhabitants facilitated a parallel between the understandings of blackness described above and the corporeal manifestations of HIV. Both the virus and its impact on black people were portrayed as devastating. Black African HIV/AIDS sufferers are typically pictured exposing a maximum of infected flesh and genitalia, including skin lesions and rashes. AIDS-related books, guides, and articles display page after page of images of unclothed, ailing black bodies paired with discussions of HIV- and AIDS-related conditions of ill health. The materials use a broad demographic ranging from young boys and girls to elderly women and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0097700413483275">Gao, Shang, and Guo, 2003</xref>: 16; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0097700413483275">Wang and Xu, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0097700413483275"><italic>Weixie Zhongguoren de aizibing</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0097700413483275">Zhongguo Oumeng xingbing/aizibing peixun xiangmu, 1997</xref>). Although these sources are published for a Chinese audience, almost all the bodies used to present the symptoms of AIDS-related illnesses are those of black Africans. The bodies and genitalia shown in the images are often so ravaged by disease as to be unrecognizable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0097700413483275">Wang Jian and Xu, 1999</xref>: 39–41; 72–77; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0097700413483275">Zhongguo Oumeng xingbing/aizibing peixun xiangmu, 1997</xref>: 99, 106, 132, 146). These images seem to emphasize the terrifying nature of the virus and demonstrate how widespread the reach of HIV/AIDS is across the African continent, especially given that in the Chinese media individuals are not often identified by their nationality, but simply as residents of the African continent.</p>
<p>These sufferers stand in particularly stark contrast to the (admittedly rare) presentations of urban, heteronormative, Han Chinese HIV positive. China’s media typically displays the latter only within “modern” scientific settings, such as hospitals and laboratories. In contrast to representations of rural Chinese HIV positive, who are often portrayed suffering in dilapidated rural hospitals and environments, both city-dwelling HIV-positive Chinese and rural HIV positive seeking treatment in urban areas are always clothed in the images, looking well-groomed and thankful for the medical attention the state provides. Similar to other images of HIV sufferers in urban China, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0097700413483275">Figure 1</xref> documents a now-famous handshake between HIV sufferers being treated at Beijing’s Ditan Hospital and two now-retired senior politicians, Premier Wen Jiabao and the Vice Premier of the State Council Wu Yi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0097700413483275">Xinhua, 2003</xref>). The HIV-positive sufferer is smiling, wearing clean clothing, and is clearly well cared for. Although the clothing worn by those in the image is unremarkable in itself, when compared to the suffering, naked Africans, it becomes significant.</p>

<p>In this context, images of the noble savage come to mind.

These naked subjects who appear so frequently embody not only the supposedly primitive and backward nature of Africa, a deficit in the diversity and quality of its people, but also the extreme “blackness” of HIV/AIDS. Their bodies, black in color and suffering from advanced secondary illnesses of HIV infection, are shown to produce and manifest disease uncontrollably, in a way that is different to other populations, such as the one to which the reader belongs.</p>

<sec id="section7-0097700413483275">
<title><italic>Yuanshi</italic>: Origin and Primitivity</title>
<p>Another term used frequently in China’s HIV narrative is <italic>yuanshi</italic>, meaning “origin,” “ancient,” or “primitive.” Understandings of <italic>yuanshi</italic> and its relationship to reproduction, disease, and health are constituted in various ways in China’s HIV media through references to Africa and Africans. As with blackness, there are historical undertones to these understandings. During the late Qing and Republican periods, Chinese-language texts suggested through writings on evolution that black Africans were closely related to primates and nature in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0097700413483275">Dikötter, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0097700413483275">Pusey, 1983</xref>. See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0097700413483275">Huo, 1998</xref>: 19; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0097700413483275">Li Hujun, 2003</xref>: 20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0097700413483275"><italic>Weixie Zhongguoren de aizibing</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0097700413483275">Zhu Wei, 2004</xref>: 44–46).</p>
<p>The contexts in which <italic>yuanshi</italic> is used in connection with HIV and Africa help to reveal the term’s significance and also its place in the “distance” that urban Han feel from HIV. As stated above, the term can be translated as both “origin” and “primitive.” In its use three patterns stand out, which are often at play at the same time. The first usage of <italic>yuanshi</italic> describes Africa as the “origin” of HIV, in the primitive environment of the African jungle and its primates. The second and third characterize African societies as having “primitive” lifestyles and “primitive” reproductive practices. The mention of <italic>yuanshi</italic> helps to create a misperception of HIV/AIDS as a condition of people with a close relationship to the natural environment. Such people are portrayed as having non-modern habits conducive to the spread of disease as well as to the reproduction of large populations and social disorder in general.</p>
<p>Through their employment of the term <italic>yuanshi</italic>, China’s HIV media emphasize a supposed evolutionary and sociocultural closeness between the African people, flora, and fauna, while suggesting that transmission of the virus is facilitated through the types of relationships Africans maintain. For example, Leng Nan’s <italic>After Opening Pandora’s Box</italic> presents Africans as being dependent on primates, which are used in ritual and are raised for domestic consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0097700413483275">2004</xref>: 3–6). Further, the African people are often presented as lacking education and scientific know-how, both of which are critical given that the search for a cure for HIV has become inextricably linked with the mastery of technoscientific knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0097700413483275">Hood, 2005</xref>). In China’s media, the only expertise Africa is shown to have is courtesy of Chinese development projects, aid, and, more recently, economic investment (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0097700413483275">Cui, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0097700413483275">Li Hujun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0097700413483275">Chen Yinping, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The third use of <italic>yuanshi</italic>, in association with reproductive practice, explains the virus’s ability to pass fluidly between species. In such media, the black body is sexualized and ascribed undisciplined habits that spread disease and, as I explore in the next section, reproduce human life in excessive quantities. In other words, Africa and Africans are linked not just to the origin of SIV and HIV, but to the reproduction and transmission of these viruses. However, just as the spread of HIV is said to be encouraged by the lack of modern, scientific civilization within Africa’s primitive environment, Africans’ reproductive capacity is also shown to be primitive, in that they reproduce both disease and life in an unregulated, uncontrolled, and uncontrollable way.</p>
<p>By linking HIV to undisciplined, decadent, and primitive sexual practice, contemporary media shoehorn the debilitating effects of the virus into the pattern through which Africa and Africans previously have been understood in Chinese cultural ideology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0097700413483275">Chen and Xu, 1998</xref>: 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0097700413483275">Ke, 2003a</xref>: C20, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0097700413483275">2003b</xref>: C20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0097700413483275">Zhuang, 1998</xref>: 3). Articles detail the constitution of the virus, its virulent nature, its transfer to primates in the form of SIV, and the unexplained “jump” across the species barrier through the practices of black bodies. In this fashion, urban media connects the virulent nature and reproductive capabilities of the virus and the reproductive capacity of simians with the primitive, sexualized African body, characterized by its ability to suffer and reproduce. For example:
<disp-quote>
<p>AIDS first originated in the green monkeys in African countries such as Ghana and Zaire. It spread in communities of African green monkeys, and later was passed onto humans. . . . Because of the very strange habits of African natives, who take the hot blood of monkeys and inject it into their thighs to increase sexual desire, the AIDS virus escaped out of its magic lamp and was passed on to humans. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0097700413483275">Jiaoyubu tiyu weisheng yu yishu jiaoyusi, 2006</xref>: 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Liu Zhiren’s publication makes similar use of black sexuality to explain the rise of HIV/AIDS in Africa. Liu suggests that if Africans were aware of their dangerous sexuality and undisciplined reproductive practices, then the story of HIV/AIDS in Africa and internationally would have followed a very different plot:
<disp-quote>
<p>[M]iddle Africa has unwittingly become the cradle of AIDS production; because the men and women there practice undisciplined sex and homosexual activities to a frightening degree. These [phenomena] can be seen everywhere, in the light of day and in the dark of night. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0097700413483275">1998</xref>: 371)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Leng Nan’s publication follows this trend and details a “scientifically proven” origin myth heavily reliant on understandings of <italic>yuanshi</italic>. Again, emphasis is placed on African sexuality and the evolutionary closeness of Africans and primates, the boundaries between which are shown to be flexible:
<disp-quote>
<p>The traditions of native Africans possibly added to the speed of transmission of the human form of the AIDS virus. For example, they [scientists] believe that the blood of monkeys was injected into the human body to increase sexual desire, and that monkey blood was also applied to genitalia to remedy impotence and barrenness. They [Africans] even applied animal blood directly to wounds. . . . and through other practices like these they unwittingly opened a convenient entrance for the invasion of the human body. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0097700413483275">2004</xref>: 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Publications by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0097700413483275">Jing Hua and Li Qian (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0097700413483275">Shen Chirui (1989)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0097700413483275">Yang Wenyi (1990)</xref> also use racialized understandings to explain HIV and AIDS. For example, Jing Hua and Li Qian state that “[s]everal places in Africa have traditions whereby they drink monkey blood and inject themselves with it to increase sexual desire. It is said that this caused Africans to become infected with the AIDS virus” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0097700413483275">2002</xref>: 7). The authors also indicate that such practices are part of the “unwitting” (<italic>wuyi</italic>) African way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0097700413483275">2002</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>These texts and others like them use blackness and <italic>yuanshi</italic> to explain the spread of HIV in Africa. Their contents include descriptions of lifestyles reliant on the hunting of primates, traditional healing using primates, premarital sexual activity with primates, and rituals using primate blood to remedy infertility and impotence, all of which are explained by Africans’ lack of scientific know-how and control over their primitive, uncivilized desires. Because of these activities and their portrayed lack of rationality, Africans somehow are responsible for the transmission and reproduction of HIV. As such, a discursive connection develops between the reproductive capacities of the HIV virus, primates, and (African) humans. In the context of disease, Africans become sources of danger as potentially devastating as the virus itself.</p>

<title>Gendering HIV/AIDS: The Primitive Reproduction of Life and Disease</title>
<p>Portrayals of the black body as a porous conduit for the transmission of disease cast it as the nexus through which HIV entered humans from primates. This focus on the black body’s reproductive capacity and its particular vulnerability to HIV infection and transmission draws not only on conceptions of race, but also of gender. In the narrative, ideas about promiscuous primates, promiscuous black Africans, and a virus caught through promiscuous sexual practices are connected through the female body.</p>
<p>When an understanding of HIV/AIDS as an STD is connected to local perceptions of Africans, popular perceptions of gender and reproduction become critical elements to consider in the reading and synthesis of media portrayals. In HIV media involving Africa, the sexuality of black African women emerges as a central theme that is illustrated through references to African mothers, sex workers, and young, reproductive women. African women are the key sites for the reproduction of an uncontrollable and incurable virus and are key conduits for its transmission into the large families and societies that are the fruit of their corporeal labor. By embodying individual, family, and national illness, African women tell of a sociomoral chaos that could hinder the nation’s growth, progress, and development (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0097700413483275">Brookesmith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0097700413483275">Huang Jinshu, 2000</xref>: 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0097700413483275">“Jijin,” 2000</xref>: 30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0097700413483275">Liu Jian, 2001</xref>: 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0097700413483275">Yang Wenyi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0097700413483275">“Yi huan aizibing,” 2002</xref>: 20; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0097700413483275">Zhang Tiankang, 2002</xref>: C21). As introduced earlier, female sexuality has long been considered dangerous in China, and this emerges as a clear theme in China’s HIV narrative. As Louise Edwards points out, “Chinese women were traditionally credited with responsibility for saving or destroying the nation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700413483275">2000</xref>: 125). In the HIV narrative, this danger takes the specific form of supposedly uncontrolled women who function as vectors for the reproduction of large families and for the transmission of disease into the family and nation, which would have a devastating effect on economic development and social stability if it were to occur in China.</p>
<p>Examples in China’s media of the supposed detrimental impact black African women have on their societies are widespread. The popular <italic>Sanlian Lifestyle Weekly</italic> carried a two-page article highlighting the black body’s propensity to bear large diseased families, which in turn gives rise to large diseased societies. The article presents various descriptions and images of areas in the world where HIV/AIDS is prevalent. Although illness is a thematic element not specifically associated with any one place in the article’s title, seven of the eight images in the story show groups actively working against the spread of HIV/AIDS. The sole image of people not working toward controlling HIV is the image of black Africans. It shows a large group of unkempt young children and females of reproductive ages suffering from the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0097700413483275">“AIDS fengmian gushi,” 2003</xref>: 30–31). The image is notable for its dissimilarity to the themes present in the seven other images. It is the only representation of black subjects.</p>
<p>Another illustration of the association between black African women, reproduction, and disease is an HIV/AIDS public health poster from Yunnan province from the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0097700413483275">Shi, Zhi, and Li, n. d.</xref>). The poster contains four images of non-local people, described only as “AIDS sufferers” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0097700413483275">Figure 2</xref>). The use of Japanese kanji and katakana script, which reads “AIDS virus,” further emphasizes the non-Chinese nature of the poster’s subjects—and thus of the virus. Two black women dominate the poster, one of whom gazes blankly at the camera while the other carries two unhealthy “AIDS sufferer” children in her arms. The blackness of HIV/AIDS is communicated in a number of ways, through the juxtaposition of the suffering caused by HIV, the rapid transmission and reproduction of the virus by the women and their children, and the marbled flesh of the emaciated white man, whose body is covered in Kaposi sarcoma and is clearly in the late stages of full-blown AIDS. In the poster, women are vectors of disease transmission to their children and families.</p>

<p>Another vivid example of the HIV media’s use of African women to illustrate the dangers of female reproduction to societies where HIV is prevalent is the 1999 Chinese translation of Peter Brookesmith’s <italic>Future Plagues</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0097700413483275">1997</xref>). At the front of the translation are images contained in the original but which have been reorganized. While the sensational, however more balanced content of the original also focused on disease control, the reduced selection of images in the translation predominantly displays disease among black populations, especially women. Two adjacent pages in this supplement juxtapose images of a sex worker, impoverished mothers, and children with those of a female primate and its young and with magnified images of mutating viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0097700413483275">Figure 3</xref>). The primate—the original carrier of the disease—is connected to the black African body, which is thus suggested to be a vehicle for the reproduction of human life and deadly diseases, such as HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0097700413483275">Brookesmith, 1999</xref>: supplement, 12). The accompanying text in the Chinese translation warns of the dire consequences of HIV transmission. The human mothers and children, the sex worker, and the female primate and her young are defined by their relationship to the reproduction of life and disease, and all are shown as existing in primitive circumstances far from the modern environment inhabited by the reader. In this way, black women and their reproductive practices are positioned in the text and images as key to the spread of HIV and to the failure of various state, social, and medical interventions to control its spread.</p>

<p>In the HIV narrative, descriptions of African women focus on them as vectors of disease with extremely high rates of infection and contagion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0097700413483275">Yang Wenyi, 1990</xref>: 49, 93). The contrast between China’s lower rates of female infection emphasizes the supposed differences between black Africans and urban Han Chinese. For example, in Yang Wenyi’s book <italic>AIDS: The Global Danger</italic>, African women’s propensity for catching and transmitting HIV are both said to be extremely high in comparison to that of women elsewhere. At the time of the book’s publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0097700413483275">1990</xref>), “[in China] the male:female infection rate of HIV is a ratio from 10:1 to 15:1, but in Africa it is approximately 1:1” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0097700413483275">1990</xref>: 51). Similarly, in <italic>Young Friends, Can You Know AIDS?</italic>, the reader is told that in comparison to China’s low female transmission rates, the African infection ratio is 9:1 (male:female) and that
<disp-quote>
<p>[i]n Africa, where AIDS is spreading rampantly on this earth, STDs and AIDS among youth already are a serious problem. But what really makes things unsafe [in Africa] is that the infection rate for women significantly exceeds that for men of the same age. For example, in Zambia, female youth AIDS infection is 16 percent, but for male youth of the same age it is only one percent. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0097700413483275">Jiaoyubu tiyu weisheng yu yishu jiaoyusi, 2006</xref>: 78. Also see p. 52]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These statements and statistics, accurate or not, reaffirm a connection between African women and disease and reproduction, namely their supposed ability to reproduce and spread disease effectively and differently from others. This frequent pairing contributes to the naturalization of disease—especially HIV—as an inherent characteristic of African societies. It is one never associated with representations or discussions of Chinese urban areas or people.</p>

<title>Gendered Responsibility and Mother-to-Child Transmission: Naturalizing “Bad Black Motherhood”</title>
<p>In addition to the three HIV transmission paths that affect both men and women, women carry the extra burden of mother-to-child transmission. HIV can be passed to infants during pregnancy, or through delivery and/or breast-feeding. Without behavioral or medicinal interventions, approximately one third of babies will become infected with HIV if their mother carries the virus. With medication, however, that rate is lowered dramatically to five percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0097700413483275">WHO, 2012</xref>). Analysis of this transmission path, often overlooked in existing health communication research, opens up an area of gender-specific media coverage and health messaging that highlights the social expectations of women and their potentially dangerous nature when they operate outside state influence or the social contract of their local moral worlds.</p>
<p>The use of African women to portray mother–child HIV transmission in China’s media and the ideologies of motherhood invoked in the reading process help to construct differences between the reader, the subject, and the virus. The inability of African mothers to measure up to what are portrayed as the superior reproductive and mothering practices of China becomes another mechanism through which distance from African women and HIV is constructed. Meanwhile, their reproductive habits, which appear excessive in comparison to one-child families, serve as a warning to China’s media consumers.</p>
<p>One way in which these differences are constructed is through the use of statistics, which are widely cited in Chinese language sources. For example, an article on HIV prevention points out that “although Africa represents only 1/10th of the world’s population, it represents 9/10ths of all global cases of children infected by the AIDS virus through mother-child transmission” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0097700413483275">Li Ying, 2002</xref>: 1). In contrast, another article points out, “China’s mother-child transmission is almost nil” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0097700413483275">Li Bijian, 2004</xref>: foreword, 2).</p>
<p>Another way of constructing difference is that in sources on China, mothers are typically portrayed as wise figures who know how to protect themselves and their unborn and are frequently shown as working in conjunction with medical authorities to prevent HIV transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0097700413483275">“Shengzhi jiankang xilie guatu,” 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0097700413483275">“Yufang aizibing jing muying tujing chuanbo,” 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0097700413483275">“Yufang aizibing jing xing tujing chuanbo,” 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0097700413483275">“Yufang aizibing jing xueye tujing chuanbo,” 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0097700413483275">“Jianchi zhengque shiyong anquantao,” 2004</xref>). These materials show how successful Chinese women are at preventing HIV while also reflecting the expectation that civilized, urban Han Chinese women deliver a high level of care to their families and are aware of the dangers of HIV and behave appropriately to avoid it. Furthermore, these representations reveal Chinese women and mothers who embody a disciplined and healthy modern order—exactly the qualities their African counterparts are thought and shown to lack.</p>
<p>In HIV/AIDS media, the subject of black African motherhood is frequently detailed through stories of “irresponsible” mothers who transmit the virus to their children. In these, children are usually portrayed as abandoned and/or in terrible health. Two works in particular exemplify the way African mothers are used in China’s HIV narrative: a short book on HIV called <italic>Yowling Alarm</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0097700413483275">Zheng Shougui et al., 2003</xref>) and a series of 24 online images titled <italic>Pictorial Collection: Shaking the Spirits of People in Africa with AIDS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0097700413483275">Li Yan, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0097700413483275">2004b</xref>).</p>
<p>The table of contents of <italic>Yowling Alarm</italic> suggests that the work will discuss the state of HIV/AIDS in China, including modes of transmission, diagnosis and treatment, public education and awareness, and legal regulations regarding HIV-positive people and access to treatment. However, in Chapter One, “Basic AIDS Information” (<italic>Aizibing jiben changshi</italic>), there is a short but eye-catching component on Africa that seems out of place in a publication claiming to focus on China. Although the chapter provides a simple history of HIV as well as information on its biomedical nosology, it includes a three-page section on “The Global State of AIDS Infection.” Aside from microscope images of the AIDS virus, there are only two other photographs in the entire publication, both of human subjects. Located in this section, they present the physical manifestations of HIV/AIDS through images of black African families, mothers, and their children. These images are Gideon Mendel originals, and used without credit. One of the captions derives from the internationally acclaimed World Press Photo Awards, where the photo was part of a series that won first prize for general news story in 1997. Its caption describes an AIDS patient dying of renal failure in the company of family in a mission hospital in South Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0097700413483275">4</xref></sup> The same image is also in a section of Mendel’s book, <italic>A Broken Landscape</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0097700413483275">2001</xref>: 32–45). There, it does not carry the caption used by the Yowling Alarm or the Press Awards but includes a description of the setting. The confusion over the place (the original book refers to Zimbabwe and the World Press and Chinese versions to South Africa) may be due to the ambiguous transition between two sections of Mendel’s book, from “Mission hospital. Matibi, Zimbabwe” to “Hospitals. KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.”</p>
<p>The second Mendel image used in <italic>Yowling Alarm</italic> shows a deathly ill infant over the caption “Longing for Life” (<italic>shengming de kewang</italic>). Mendel’s book, however, tells that the picture is taken in a “Children’s Ward, Ngwelezane, South Africa, [where] half of the children’s ward admissions at Ngwelezane Hospital are for HIV-related illnesses.” On the World Press site the same image does not have a caption. The unclear origin and translation of the images and captions bring their “afterlife” into clear relief and highlight how meanings and understanding change. When used within Chinese sources, the images and their divergent translations are forced or re-written to adopt new local meanings.</p>
<p>These same two Mendel photographs are among the 24 images included in Li Yan’s online <italic>Pictorial Collection</italic> and are also used without copyright. Many of the images selected for the collection show large families and groups, and although male subjects are included among the 24 images, no reference is made to fathers or fatherhood in Li Yan’s captions. In contrast, the captions for pictures of women frequently refer to them as grandmothers and mothers. In these, the women are presented as outliving their children, proof that they have failed miserably in their duties as caretakers and nurturers. Meanwhile, the new captions tell of the inability of mothers to protect their children—the most defenseless yet most important members of society—from harm, and of their “helplessness,” their “desire” (to be good mothers), and their “duty” to suffer for transmitting disease to family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0097700413483275">Li Yan, 2004a</xref>: nos. 1–24) (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0097700413483275">Li Yan, 2004c</xref>, no. 2 with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0097700413483275">Mendel, 2001</xref>: 14.

<p>The mother–child relationship plays a key role in communicating not simply the extent of HIV/AIDS but also that of African social, moral, medical, economic, and cultural decline and the dire consequences this may have on African nations and African children’s futures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0097700413483275">5</xref></sup> The embodiment of HIV through these specific kinds of sufferers demonstrates the rich ideological capital of mothers and their sick children within this narrative. As mothers are to provide care and ensure the health of their children, the construction of black African women as fertile, ungovernable beings with sick children they cannot keep alive serves as an indictment of African parents, particularly mothers, and their societies. These mothers have broken the family line, which, to a Chinese audience, would be unforgivable.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in China, the one-child policy justifies the regulation of female sexuality and reproductive capacity in order to improve family planning and population control. The consequence of China’s one-child policy has made women’s roles in preventing HIV and maintaining the health of their one child and family—and thus of the nation—even more vital. Since HIV is portrayed as a lethal virus capable of penetrating the family unit (and thus the nation) through women in general and mothers (of one child) in particular, women are portrayed as the site of potential risk and must behave dutifully and responsibly. There is considerable public support for this type of governance of female sexuality and reproductive capacity, which is described as being capable of reproducing human life and disease to epidemic proportions if left to its own devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0097700413483275">Weishengbu weisheng fangyisi, 1988</xref>). African reproduction therefore serves as a warning to China’s media consumers. Standing as a marked contrast to the African images, this focus on “appropriate sexuality” is seen as essential to the nation’s continued social and economic development and to the prevention and control of HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0097700413483275">Li and Bi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0097700413483275">Liu and Yin, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>However, a closer look at HIV media and health promotional material shows that compliance with HIV prevention measures is not due to the “superior” behavior of Chinese women but is actually an additional outcome of family-planning strategies that often promote condoms to limit the size of families. Therefore, although there are no explicitly HIV-related coercive measures in place, its prevention is assisted by Chinese women largely as a side effect of family planning practices through condom use.</p>

<title>Producing the Un-black Moral Politic: Embodied Difference and Distancing Disease</title>
<p>The prevalence of images and text on Africa and Africans in HIV-related publications facilitates the idea that black subjects are involved in only the reproduction of HIV and <italic>not</italic> defense against it. Given Chinese cultural understandings of blackness and Africans examined earlier, these media further the notion of HIV as an affliction that only affects black people. This is critical to the production of feelings of distance in the media consumer, who comes to understand the virus as something that resides elsewhere.</p>
<p>The ways in which these black African subjects are assembled in China’s media mean that they come to embody not just HIV but a breakdown in social relations and responsibilities that are often gendered. In particular, they point to governments that do little to control the reproductive habits—and hence the quality and size—of their populations. This lack of action casts China’s government, and Chinese women who adhere to family planning practices, in a favorable light, explicitly or implicitly. In those rare instances in which HIV/AIDS is embodied by Chinese women, the particular types of women used for this serve to uphold the distance from HIV for urban Han audiences. Specifically, being HIV positive is shown in connection with Chinese mothers who have more than one child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0097700413483275"><italic>Sanlian shenghuo zhoukan</italic>, 2003</xref>: cover); impoverished rural women who are forced to sell their blood to supplement their meager farming incomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0097700413483275">“Zhengshi aizibing,” 2001</xref>: 1); urban poor and migrant women workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0097700413483275"><italic>Xingdong qilai</italic>, 2004</xref>: 16, 24); minority women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0097700413483275">Yunnan sheng, 1991</xref>), women who are portrayed as being tricked into relationships with HIV-positive foreign men who fail to disclose their seropositivity status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0097700413483275">Zhu Liya, 2006</xref>); and professional escorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0097700413483275">“Jizhe anfang sanpeinü,” 2005</xref>). All these groups are generally associated with negative qualities such as unruliness, backwardness, promiscuity, low quality, and immorality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0097700413483275">Jacka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0097700413483275">Schein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0097700413483275">Xiuluobixia, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0097700413483275">Zheng, 2007</xref>). In other words, it is women who traditionally do not hold positions of power or those who lie outside sociocultural, educational, and economic hierarchies of belonging that present what HIV/AIDS looks like within Chinese bodies, thus maintaining the “distance” between the majority of ordinary urban media consumers and HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>These mechanisms are thrown into exceptionally sharp relief when contrasted with the way modern, urban Han female corporealities occur, albeit rarely, in China’s HIV media. These modern, civilized women—in particular Han mothers—are shown to participate in a rational, orderly social contract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0097700413483275">Figure 4</xref>), completely distancing them and differentiating their experiences from the everyday suffering of the African women portrayed. The championing of HIV by prominent Chinese women, such as Peng Liyuan, China’s first lady or <italic>guomu</italic>, and other female political and celebrity figures, such as Li Danyang, Xu Fan, Zhou Tao, Jiang Wenli, and Zhang Ziyi, is a clear example of this distancing. HIV-negative Chinese women are presented as being governed by an entirely different ethic that places them above and apart from their non-urban Chinese counterparts, who are shown as more naive and disease-prone. The moral economy and representational politics operative in contemporary urban China mean that HIV in Chinese sufferers is known only through stories of those who fail to become middle-class (<italic>xiaokang</italic>), modern (<italic>qianjin</italic>), hygienic (<italic>weisheng</italic>), cultured (<italic>you wenhua</italic>), and high-quality (<italic>suzhi gao</italic>) citizens. In other words, only those who do not measure up to urban ideals of what it takes to be Chinese are portrayed as being likely or even capable of contracting HIV (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0097700413483275">Anagnost, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0097700413483275">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0097700413483275">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0097700413483275">Greenhalgh and Winkler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0097700413483275">Sigley, 2001</xref>). It is only women who will never assume the representational privilege of the proverbial woman-as-nation who can be presented as being HIV positive, such as the women described above. Only these particular women can be shown to share the experience of suffering from a virus that infects the supposedly primitive African women and who, like them, frequently lack mothering skills, education, discipline, quality, and power.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, I have examined the way HIV/AIDS is expressed in China’s media through reference to Africans, particularly African women. I have considered the differences imputed to them by the media, and how Chinese language use and understandings of racial evolution, gender, and sexuality produce black subjects that are consistently portrayed as uncivilized, unruly, unhygienic, and of low quality. The language and representations in China’s media cast the black and often female subject as being closer to nature and lower on the moral and sociocultural evolutionary scale than the urban Chinese reader, in ways that echo the racial theorizing popular in the late Qing and Republican eras. These perceptions of Africans have been key to the process by which HIV/AIDS is presented to the Chinese reader as an affliction affecting a primitive, ungovernable, less evolved, hyper-reproductive, and sexualized subject who is removed from modernity and development. These understandings of racial difference in the context of disease transmission help to explain some of the distance many Chinese urbanites feel toward HIV.</p>
<p>As far as gender is concerned, the media presentation of African women reveals much about how perceived distance from HIV is produced through cultural and place-specific gender and racial ideologies. First, Chinese people were and are portrayed as not sharing characteristics with black Africans, whom they have long considered inferior. Second, the images and texts discussed in this article illustrate how, in the context of HIV, women are perceived as a potential danger to the national body politic and its modernizing project. As I demonstrated, the identification of HIV/AIDS with Africa and Africans, and the powerful outcomes this linkage creates, become particularly obvious when the role of gendered expectations for women’s behavior is considered. The control of the female body in terms of disease prevention and population control are central to China’s modernization and development goals. The communication of racialized difference between Chinese and African women is didactic for the viewing audience. As far as black women are portrayed, their “ungovernable” female urges and reproductive abilities are key to the rampant spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa. In the context of weak states and communicable diseases, their feminine, <italic>yin</italic> nature reproduces chaos on a scale that threatens both the family and nation. The propagation of African contagion, alongside images and discourses about healthy (that is, controlled) Chinese woman-as-nation models, is one mechanism that this ideology uses to achieve its dominance. As such, the representational space for Chinese subjects who break this mold—for example, by being female, urban, and diseased—is extremely limited. In addition to this, the implication the narrative has on HIV stigma and the acceptance of HIV-positive Chinese is troubling. The narrative establishes discursive mechanisms barring Chinese who do become HIV positive from belonging to the nation. Contracting a disease that is largely connected with poverty, immorality, and other supposed qualities of Africans is shown to be incompatible within China’s new urban modernity. Placing concepts of race at the intersection of health and contemporary citizenship (where those who are ill are excluded because of the social understandings of the virus and its relationship to the immorality and backwardness associated with black Africans and other socially, economically, and/or morally marginalized subjects in the narrative such as gays and blood sellers) helps to flag health communication as an area that media planners and journalists need to consider more carefully.</p>
<p>Although reportage about HIV-positive Chinese in China is on the increase, campaigns directed at urban Han HIV-positive women are practically non-existent, as they would require the portrayal of a subject who violates the hegemonic discourse and image of woman-as-nation and the woman-as-next-generation-nurturer. The fact that infection rates among urban Han women are on the rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0097700413483275">Jiang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0097700413483275">Liu Mofei, 2006</xref>; Interview with Zhang Konglai in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0097700413483275">Hui Chun, 2004</xref>) suggests that the simplistic historical dicta and gender ideology (that women must remain healthy, monogamous, educated, and aware) are insufficient to protect them from HIV. These increases are due to changes in sexual mores among young adults, the detection of hospital-based HIV transmission (caused by unscreened blood transfusions received in the late 1990s to early 2000s), and the sex trade, which has become an alternative source of income in conditions of poorly remunerated intellectual and manual labor. HIV is also transmitted by husbands who maintain concurrent sexual relationships with their wives and other gay men.</p>
<p>Through the othering techniques I have discussed, the imputed physical and intellectual difference between those who are shown to be capable of contracting HIV and those who apparently are not reinforces the imagined distance between Africa and urban China. The black bodies portrayed as carrying HIV are a threat to the stability, modernization, and development of any nation and are thus effectively incompatible with the world the urban reader knows and the behavior of urbanites within it. The limited number and nature of China’s HIV awareness campaigns and the propagation of racialized transmission myths described in this article make it unsurprising that so many urban Han Chinese feel “distanced” from HIV. HIV thus becomes a key site through which black subjects have little control over the ways in which they are used to present disease. The representational techniques involved in HIV media also help to safeguard, on an imagined level, the health of China’s body politic and the health of the women who bear the next generation. Through the differences that separate African subjects from the urban Chinese audience, the disease Africans are shown to have may be kept at bay.</p>
<p>The public health consequences of these widespread transmission myths and representational trends need to be taken seriously. Until specifically targeted campaigns and techniques that break down prevalent ideas about HIV emerge, the vulnerability of urban women is likely to grow and HIV stigma will remain. Meanwhile, the pejorative portrayal of Africans in association with HIV and the lack of space to represent urban Chinese HIV positive facilitate a dangerous conceptual removal of HIV from the putatively healthy, hygienic, and civilized Han politic as well as serious discrimination against those who do carry the virus.</p>

<p>These devastating stories contrast with the media coverage of China’s AIDS orphans, children who contracted HIV during the blood scandals in the late 1980s to 1990s when their parents, who were often rural and marginalized peasants, sold their blood for profit. The conditions at the blood stands were unsanitary and there was little public education about proper protocols. Many blood-sellers later contracted HIV and were diagnosed belatedly or not at all. Rather than addressing questions of responsibility and rural economic and social marginalization, reportage on China’s AIDS orphans often focus on state and social philanthropy involving AIDS orphans and the delivery of new forms of urban care to China’s disadvantaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0097700413483275"><italic>Fenghuang da shiye</italic>, 2004</xref>: nos. 1-5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0097700413483275">Gao, Shang, and Guo, 2003</xref>).</p>
