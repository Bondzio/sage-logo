<p>“You can’t be thin-skinned and make it in the [post office].” Benbow takes us into a place the public is not allowed: the massive mail-processing facility that employs 3,000 employees operates 24 hr a day in a large northeast metro area. She offers a revealing account of a militaristic, authoritarian “work environment which functions in a perpetual state of code orange” (p. 209). Replete with accounts of supervisors’ demeaning behavior toward employees, “functional dysfunctionality,” sexual forays gone awry, alienation, mistrust, and violence, a picture of a highly bureaucractic, rules-driven organization, marked by a rigid class structure overlapped by race/ethnicity divisions emerged and left me amazed that our mail reaches our homes.</p>
<p>This study of diversity in an urban facility in the U.S. post office, one of the largest, most diverse employers in the country, examines race, gender, class relationships in the workplace, and the organizational structure with regard to race/ethnicity and gender. She finds that the opportunity structure of the organization is racialized, and to a lesser extent gendered, with marked race and gender occupational segregation. Racial/ethnic minorities dominate (85%) the worst jobs in the facility (concentrated on the shop-floor), and their advancement is largely restricted to low-level supervisory and administrative positions. There are very few White employees and supervisors who work on the shop-floor, creating a spatially segregated facility.</p>
<p>The primary contribution of this work is that it details a different kind of diversity than many accounts—where minorities are the majority and the workforce is multiethnic in contrast to the more common Black–White divide. Even though racist graffiti, jokes, and cartoons show up throughout the facility from time to time, even occasionally in company literature, racial inequality and conflict are both minimized and taken for granted.</p>
<p>The work environment is divided in two major spheres: dirty, machine-oriented work on the floor, and the administrative offices above. The militaristic culture is maintained by subordination (managers are referred to as superiors and employees subordinates). During orientation, employees are told to do what they are told and not to question supervisors. Some supervisors use fear and intimidation to get employees to work. “Keep it up and you will be out of here in a minute!” Throughout the facility, there are television monitors broadcasting directives from officials giving it a postapocalyptic underworld feel. Employees describe it as humiliating and some report using drinking and drugs to self-medicate; many more exhibited a powerless numbness since exiting is not an option for most given the near impossibility of finding similar-paying jobs in the private sector.</p>
<p>Benbow argues that people’s perceptions are shaped by how they experience diversity in their workplace, thus the main data chapters look at race, gender, and class relationships in three different types of work areas: integrated, resegregated, and token. Most of the work environments in the facility were largely homogeneous, but in those that were integrated race relationships were characterized by aversion and social distance. Minority participants reported White employees would avoid interacting with minority employees. Stereotypes and perceptions of different groups are common and inform interpersonal interactions.</p>
<p>Women are relegated to machine-work (lowest-level clerical), other clerical jobs, and low-level supervisory. Even women in offices (primarily White women) are required to perform “domesticity at work.” Benbow observes the sexual objectification of women in general, but Black and Latina are more likely to experience the most negative forms of symbolic violence, demeaned as “easy,” “low-lives” and “seductresses.” Women often do not report harassment and even sexual and physical assault (touching, sexually explicit talk, and beatings) because they fear retaliation, primarily loss of their jobs.</p>
<p>In segregated areas, which are largely minority, there are tensions between Blacks and Asians and Hispanics as these groups compete for resources and ever-shrinking advancement opportunities. Social distance is a chief means of navigating diverse space, even in these multiethnic areas like the shop floor where groups jockey to work on machines in groups with workers from their same ethnic group.</p>
<p>The chapter on tokens was the other strong contribution of the book to the literature on diversity in organizations. Given a workplace that is primarily minority in contrast to most other workplaces, she expands the theories on tokens, by identifying three different types of tokens: (a) Power tokens—These are White men and women in managerial positions because they are numerical minorities in the facility and thus highly visible. Because of their high status in both society and the organization, they do not experience negative consequences typically associated with tokens but a great deal of prestige and power. Many of these tokens viewed racial majority as less competent and excluded them from networks and activities that may have helped minorities’ careers. (b) Symbolic tokens—Latino and Asian men and women, Black men in supervisory positions. These tokens are similar to the conventional tokens in the literature (ala Kanter) in that they experience negative consequences of high visibility, but are used as symbolic representations of the postal service’s commitment to diversity. (c) Invisible tokens—She defines Black women supervisors as invisible tokens because they experience the most negative consequences of tokenism, powerlessness, stereotyping, and invisibility as a result of their low status in society, the organization, and their relatively large numbers in the facility. Black women supervisors serve as intermediaries between the largely minority workforce and White management and bear the brunt of demands and often hostilities of both groups.</p>
<p>This book offered an in-depth treatment of both race and the race/gender intersection, rare in studies of diversity. However, in trying to treat race, class, <italic>and</italic> gender, many of the intersections got muddled, sacrificing a clearer and sharper analysis and argument. The book is highly descriptive, with a sometimes-daunting amount of detail. However, the description is revealing, providing a rich portrait of a complex organization.</p>
