<abstract>
<p>Perinatal lethal hypophosphatasia (PLH) [OMIM 241500] is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, with a significant risk of recurrence for further offspring following the birth of an affected baby. The study was aimed at documentation of the ultrasonographical manifestations of PLH at the 13th week of gestation, confirming that these appearances are consistent with those in later pregnancy (20 weeks) and demonstrating that they correlate with the radiographical and histological features. In clinical practice, these observations facilitate the early ultrasonic diagnosis of PLH in a potentially affected foetus. The ultrasonographical appearances in siblings at 13 and 20 weeks’ gestations were documented and compared. Post-mortem studies including babygram and histology were undertaken in these foetuses. Autopsy details of a third foetus were available from the pathology archives. The results showed that the ultrasonographical, clinical, radiological and histological appearances correlated in each instance. Thus, it was concluded that ultrasonographical diagnosis of PLH is possible as early as the 13th week of gestation.</p>

<p>The hypophosphatasias are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders, in which reduced levels of serum alkaline phosphatase are associated with defective mineralisation of bone. These conditions are classified in terms of severity and age of presentation, the most severe form being lethal in the foetus or in the perinatal period. In the strict sense, the hypophosphatasias represent a spectrum of disorders with indistinct phenotypic boundaries, rather than a set of separate entities.</p>
<p>Treatment with enzyme replacement has shown some initial benefit in survivors, but the long-term outlook is unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742271X13488888">1</xref></sup> Antenatal ultrasonographic diagnostic surveillance is a well-established approach to this problem, while autopsy and histological studies provide valuable diagnostic confirmation.</p>
<p>We have reviewed and discussed the role of ultrasonography and autopsy in perinatal lethal hypophosphatasia (PLH) on the basis of our own experience with three affected pregnancies, with emphasis upon ultrasonic diagnosis of an affected foetus at 13 weeks’ gestation. The clinical, radiological, ultrasonographical and histological appearances at various stages of development are depicted in this article and their diagnostic significance is discussed.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1742271X13488888"><title>Case histories</title>
<p>The three affected foetuses, which form the subject of this study, were the only examples of PLH amongst more than 2000 foetal and neonatal autopsies performed by HW during the past 25 years.</p>
<p>Two of the Foetuses, designated ‘A’ and ‘B’, were siblings born to a mother aged 30 years. The third, Foetus C was from a first pregnancy of a woman from a different family, at the maternal age of 33 years. The parents were all Caucasian; there was no mention of consanguinity and no illness, medical therapy or untoward environmental exposure during these pregnancies. In particular, neither of the mothers had coeliac disease or any evidence of dietary insufficiency.</p>
<p>In the pregnancy, which produced Foetus A, routine ultrasonographic screening at 18 weeks’ gestation revealed calvarial underossification and shortening and bowing of the limb bones. No precise diagnosis was made, but in view of the severity of the changes, the pregnancy was terminated. At autopsy, clinical manifestations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742271X13488888">Figure 1</xref>), radiological features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1742271X13488888">Figure 2</xref>) and histological changes led to a diagnosis of PLH. Protuberant spurs on the surfaces of the limbs were important in the diagnostic process.

</fig></p>
<p>In the mother’s second pregnancy, an ultrasonographic scan at 13 weeks’ gestation revealed the characteristic soft tissue protrusion or spur on the left tibial region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1742271X13488888">Figure 3</xref>), thereby confirming that Foetus B had the same genetic disorder as the first sibling, Foetus A. At autopsy, the clinical appearances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1742271X13488888">Figure 4</xref>) and histological features correlated with the initial ultrasonographic diagnosis. Blood specimens obtained from Foetus B, following termination of the pregnancy, showed a serum alkaline phosphatase of 3 U/L and an inorganic pyrophosphate level of 4.74 mmol/L, in keeping with the diagnosis of PLH.

</fig></p>
<p>Following the establishment of the diagnosis of PLH in the siblings A and B, images and autopsy details of Foetus C were found in HW’s archives. The affected pregnancy had predated ultrasonography but the clinical manifestations, notably spurs on the lower limbs, were identical to those of Foetuses A and B. Conversely, a babygram of Foetus C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1742271X13488888">Figure 5</xref>) revealed that the tubular bones of the limbs lacked the gross shortening, which was present in the Foetuses A and B. Nevertheless, the characteristic spurs were present over the tibiae and the histological changes in Foetus C in the regions of the spurs were also identical to those of the other affected foetuses.

<sec id="sec4-1742271X13488888"><title>Autopsy details</title>
<p>Babygrams contributed significantly to the diagnosis by virtue of demonstration of absent ossification of the skull, small thoracic cavities due to abnormal ribs and symmetric micromelia with distinctive bony spurs at the knees and elbows. Metaphyseal cupping of the humeri and femora with shortening, with or without bowing, was a striking feature. Two foetuses, A and C were of the same gestation of 20 weeks and the babygrams were therefore comparable; one had absent ossification of the radius, ulna, tibia and fibula; the other had acute angle bowing of the radius, a straight ulna with cupping, and sharp angulations of the tibia and fibula with metaphyseal cupping. This latter foetus had 11 pairs of ribs with fractures in the fourth and fifth ribs while the other foetus had 12 pairs of ribs with no fractures.</p>
<p>Autopsy revealed striking disorganisation of the physeal growth plates, with persistent cartilage in the metaphyses in all three foetuses, despite a five-week difference in gestational age. Histologically, broad columns of vacuolated chondrocytes were present within cartilage, which was covered by poorly mineralised osteoid seams. These microscopic features were typical of a rickety process.</p>
<p>Other minor post-mortem findings were microcystic renal dysplasia in all three foetuses and a unilateral pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction in one foetus. The latter foetus also had a long philtrum and 11 pairs of ribs. Another had an aberrant origin of the right subclavian artery with a retro-oesophageal course and focal adrenal cytomegaly. Measurement of the lung/body weight ratios in the three foetuses did not show evidence of pulmonary hypoplasia at this early stage of gestation. Recognition of these anomalies could be helpful in ultrasonic antenatal diagnosis.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1742271X13488888" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>At the clinical level, several forms of hypophosphatasia are currently recognised. These range in severity from PLH to a mild condition, in which premature loss of the secondary dentition is the major manifestation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742271X13488888">2</xref></sup> These conditions are all the consequence of mutations in the <italic>ALPL</italic> gene, situated at the chromosomal locus 1p36 and coding for tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase.</p>
<p>The severe perinatal lethal, benign infantile and childhood types of hypophosphatasia result from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity of the <italic>ALPL</italic> gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742271X13488888">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742271X13488888">4</xref></sup> In this way, the mode of genetic transmission is autosomal recessive, with a 25% recurrence risk following an affected pregnancy. The adult and dental forms of hypophosphatasia represent heterozygosity of this gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742271X13488888">5</xref></sup> with an autosomal dominant generation to generation mode of inheritance. There is considerable intragenic heterogeneity, and different mutations could influence the severity or mildness of the clinical features. The discrepancies in the length of the limb bones between Foetuses A and C could be explained on a basis of this genetic situation.</p>
<p>Stillbirth is frequent in PLH and the survivors usually demise in the early weeks of life from pulmonary insufficiency. Clinically, affected foetuses and neonates have short bowed limbs, while spurs or projections on the lateral and medial aspects of the knees and elbows are often present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742271X13488888">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742271X13488888">7</xref></sup> Histology reveals that these skin-covered structures are formed by acute angled bowing of the limbs, loss of cortical bone and replacement by rachitic bone.</p>
<p>Radiologically, the skeleton shows hypomineralisation, with deficient ossification maximal in the calvarium and spine. The tubular bones of the limbs are bowed and shortened, with cupping and longitudinal spikes in the proximal and distal ends of these bones. There has been considerable semantic confusion concerning these radiologically apparent bony spikes and the aforementioned external spurs over the elbows and knees. It must be emphasised that these structures are different anomalies, which are distinct from each other.</p>
<p>In live neonates, the diagnosis is clinched by the demonstration of low levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and elevation of serum calcium. In stillbirths or foetuses, antenatal suspicion of the diagnosis can be confirmed by radiographic imaging and by histological investigations during autopsy. It is relevant that the pathological appearances evolve with the maturation of the foetus.</p>
<p>The PLH may be detected by ultrasonography during antenatal screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742271X13488888">8</xref></sup> The differential diagnosis includes osteogenesis imperfecta Type II, by virtue of the skeletal undermineralisation. In Southern Africa, the severe autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta Type III is relatively common in the indigenous Black population, and features strongly in the diagnostic process. A variety of skeletal dysplasias and rickety conditions also warrant diagnostic consideration because of the limb bowing. If the tubular bone mid-shafts show cupping or longitudinal spikes, Achondrogenesis Type IA enters into the differential diagnosis. With ongoing development of the foetal skeleton, the evolution of the characteristic ultrasonographical appearances is a helpful discriminant. In our experience, the spurs, which are evident on the limbs as early as the 13th week of gestation in PLH, are highly significant. In the last analysis, autopsy and histological investigations provide a definitive diagnosis.</p>
<p>In view of the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance of PLH, there is a significant risk of recurrence of the disorder in siblings after the diagnosis has been reached in a foetus or neonate. For this reason, any further pregnancies with the same parents warrant ultrasonic surveillance for this condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742271X13488888">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742271X13488888">10</xref></sup> In this way, in our own experience, an ultrasonic diagnosis of PLH was made at 13 weeks’ gestation and following termination of the pregnancy, the diagnosis was confirmed at autopsy. To the best of our knowledge, ultrasonic diagnosis of PLH at this early stage has not previously been documented.</p>
<p>Molecular technology has been used for antenatal diagnosis of PLH and it is now possible to identify a specific mutation in an affected foetus or neonate. With this information, any further pregnancy of the parents in question could be monitored by early amniocentesis or chorionic villus biopsy, followed by targeted molecular investigations to determine the presence or absence of the causative mutation. In order to facilitate this approach, mutation analysis or sequence analysis is warranted as part of the autopsy process, if appropriate laboratory facilities are available. In South Africa, as in other countries at a similar stage of socioeconomic development, molecular investigations of this nature are not yet available on a routine basis. Despite the foregoing, the majority of foetuses with PLH will not have had previous affected siblings and routine antenatal ultrasonic monitoring, or the ultrasonic investigation of pregnancy complications such as hydramnios, will generate most of the positive diagnoses.</p>
<p>It is possible to make a firm diagnosis of PLH as early as the 13th week of gestation. The presence of external protuberances or spurs is an important diagnostic feature of PLH. In this context, the ultrasonographical appearances correlate with the clinical, radiological and histological manifestations. The consistency of these correlations continues until at least 20 weeks’ gestation. As with any abnormal foetus or stillbirth, autopsy is crucial for accurate diagnostic confirmation and appropriate genetic counselling.</p>
