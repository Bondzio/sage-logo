      <abstract>
        <p>Rational and cost-effective prescription of drugs requires up-to-date and readily
          accessible drug information (DI). Availability of and access to DI resources are major
          factors that affect quality of prescription. The aim of the study was to assess
          prescribers’ DI needs and access to DI resources in Ethiopia. A facility-based,
          cross-sectional, quantitative study was conducted from February to April 2011 in 4
          selected public health facilities in southwest Ethiopia. Data on areas of DI needs, access
          to DI resources, and attitudes of prescribers toward DI services were collected using a
          structured, self-administered questionnaire. The study population consisted of 410 of 447
          initially contacted prescribers. The majority of the prescribers (93.4%) explained their
          needs for DI services. About 32.4% of the participants do not frequently refer to DI
          resources mainly due to the difficulty of acquiring the required information promptly
          and/or because they do not have access to DI resources. Compared with participants from a
          health center, participants from specialized referral, zonal, and district hospitals were
          found to be 6 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 5.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.77-12.20),
          5 (AOR, 4.77; 95% CI, 2.43-9.38), and 4 (AOR, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.50-10.66) times more likely
          to consult DI resources, respectively. Lack of access to DI resources and difficulty in
          acquiring the required information on time were the main reasons that prescribers gave for
          not frequently referring to DI resources. DI services should be established and expanded
          in health facilities.</p>

    <p>Drug information (DI) services include the activities of specially trained individuals to
      provide unbiased, up-to-date, evidence-based information on drugs in response to
      patient-oriented problems submitted by various members of the health care team.<sup>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512460758">1</xref>
      </sup> In developing countries, many health care workers have little or no access to basic and
      practical information. Indeed, many rely on observing other practitioners, obtaining advice
      from colleagues, and building experience empirically through their own treatment successes and
      failures. In the last decade, some important steps have been made toward meeting the
      information needs of the upper levels of health professions (research and tertiary care), but
      remarkably little progress has been achieved in meeting the information needs of primary and
      district health care providers in the developing world.<sup>

    <p>The explosive growth of medical knowledge necessitates that physicians seek knowledge from
      diverse information sources.<sup>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512460758">3</xref>
      </sup> To understand and improve the services that provide access to relevant professional
      information, several studies<sup>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512460758">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512460758"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512460758">6</xref>
      </sup> have investigated health care providers’ information needs and information-seeking
      behavior. These studies have shown that there are identifiable classes of information needs
      and patterns of information-seeking behaviors among health care practitioners.</p>
    <p>The biggest barrier to initiating DI services is a lack of awareness of the necessity for
      these services. There is also resistance from prescribers who believe they have sufficient
      information and do not make mistakes, despite overwhelming evidence of common errors in
      medication and poor choice of drugs based on incomplete and biased information.<sup>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512460758">4</xref>
      </sup>
    </p>
    <p>Gaps in knowledge related to drug prescribing are among the most common causes of serious
      medication errors. Internet searching presents difficulties for physicians, given the
      extensive amount of information to scan and lack of specificity of available information.<sup>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512460758">7</xref>
      </sup> In an era of unparalleled, explicit knowledge about the causes and effective treatments
      of disease and outstanding electronic resources to access such knowledge, physicians continue
      to have difficulty in answering clinical questions that arise when caring for patients,
      largely because of lack of time and insufficient training in the use of electronic databases.<sup>

    </p>
    <p>Given the enormous number of drug products available worldwide and the complexity of the
      current drug literature, selection and use of appropriate drugs are challenging and difficult.
      This motivates health care practitioners and providers to seek new types of services from
      pharmacists in the field of rational therapeutics.<sup>

    <p>Providing good DI is potentially one of the most cost-effective interventions that agencies
      can use. Often, agencies spend considerable amounts of money to supply medicines without
      providing information on how to use the medicines. Information has a much more important
      function in the use medicines compared with most other goods. Without appropriate information,
      medicines could produce, at best, an acceptable outcome and, at worst, a disastrous outcome in
      terms of morbidity or mortality. Therefore, providing appropriate information for the rational
      use of medicines is a key component to achieving their full potential. Thus, the aim of the
      study was to assess DI needs of prescribers in selected public health facilities in southwest
      Ethiopia.</p>

        <title>Study Setting</title>
        <p>The study was conducted in 4 public health facilities in southwest Ethiopia. The study
          included prescribers from 1 health center (Jimma Town Health Center), 1 district hospital
          (Limu Genet Hospital), 1 zonal hospital (Mettu Karl Hospital), and 1 specialized referral
          hospital (Jimma University Specialized Hospital). Jimma University Specialized Hospital is
          located in Jimma town and is the only teaching and referral hospital in the southwestern
          part of Ethiopia. It provides specialized health services through its 9 medical and other
          clinical and diagnostic departments for approximately 9,000 inpatients and 80,000
          outpatients each year and has a bed capacity of 450. Jimma Town Health Center, located at
          the center of Jimma town, aims to serve a total of 25,000 people from the town. Limu Genet
          Hospital is also located in Limu Genet town in Jimma zone. It provides comprehensive
          health services to 500,000 people from the surrounding area and has a bed capacity of 150.
          Mettu Karl Hospital is located in Mettu town in Ilu Abba Bora Zone in southwest Ethiopia.
          It is a zonal hospital that provides comprehensive health services to over 1,000,000
          people and has a bed capacity of 250.</p>

      <sec id="section3-0092861512460758">
        <title>Study Design</title>
        <p>This facility-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from February to April 2011.
          Four health facilities were selected from all available health facilities in southwest
          Ethiopia as follows: The specialized referral hospital was selected because this is the
          only specialized hospital in the area; for the zonal and regional hospitals, 1 hospital
          was selected from each category using simple random sampling technique (lottery method),
          and the health center was selected purposefully. The gross number of prescribers in the
          selected health facilities was 447. Considering that the study population is small in
          number when divided among these 4 health facilities, we enrolled all prescribers available
          during the study period.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section4-0092861512460758">
        <title>Data Collection and Management</title>
        <p>A structured, self-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Before the
          data collection process began, the questionnaires were pretested on 45 prescribers in
          other health facilities. Registered pharmacists were recruited from each facility for the
          purpose of data collection, and 1 day of training and orientation was given by the
          principal investigator. After consent was obtained from the participants, the
          questionnaire was given to individual prescribers. Their response was collected on the
          next day.</p>
        <p>The need for DI services was measured on a Likert scale (1 = not important, 2 =
          important, 3 = essential). The results were summed to produce a score that ranges from 3
          to 9. Based on the mean score, the need for DI service was dichotomized as “not important”
          when the score was less than the mean value and “important” when the score was greater
          than or equal to the mean value. The importance of areas of DI was measured by 18 items on
          a 3-point scale (1 = not important, 2 = important, 3 = very important). These items were
          summed to produce scores that ranged from 18 to 54. Based on the mean score, the
          importance of areas of DI was dichotomized as “not important” when the score was less than
          the mean value and “important” when the score was greater than or equal to the mean value.
          In the same manner, the difficulty of accessing information was measured by 18 items on a
          3-point scale (1 = accessible, 2 = difficult to access, 3 = very difficult to access).
          These items were summed to produce a score that ranges from 18 to 54. Based on the mean
          score, information was dichotomized as “accessible” when the score was less than the mean
          value and “difficult to access” when the score was greater than or equal to the mean
          value.</p>

        <title>Data Analysis</title>
        <p>The collected data were categorized, edited, cleaned, and analyzed using the Statistical
          Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows version 16 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois).
          Means, standard deviations (SDs), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated,
          and a <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was considered to be statistically
          significant. Categorical data were analyzed using binary logistic analysis. A multivariate
          logistic regression was performed to analyze the relationship between accessibility to
          various DI resources and practice settings. The results are presented in tables, graphs,
          and percentages.</p>

          and cooperation was also obtained from Jimma Zonal Health Bureaus. Participation in the
          study was entirely voluntarily, and written consent was taken before administering the

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Of the 447 questionnaires distributed, 410 were returned, for a response rate of 91.72%.
        Respondents were predominantly males: 320 (78%). Their age ranged from 20 to 65 years, with
        a median of 26 years. Their experience ranged from 6 months to 44 years, with a mean of 4
        years. The majority of respondents were medical interns (34.38%), followed by nurses
        (21.7%). Others included residents (14.88%), dental interns (7.32%), specialists (6.83%),
        health officers (4.15%), general practitioners (3.18%), and others (7.56%).</p>
      <p>Almost all of the respondents, 402 (98%), are aware that provision of DI is the
        professional responsibility of pharmacists. The remaining 8 respondents (2%) believe that DI
        should be provided by all health professionals as a team or obtained from reference books,
        that other health professionals should provide the service (because pharmacists are not
        communicative), or that the physician and pharmacist in collaboration should provide the
        service. The majority of the prescribers, 381 (92.9%), had requested information about drugs
        during their previous clinical practice.</p>

      <p>A total of 232 (79.2%) respondents from the specialized referral hospital, 21 (39.6%) from
        the regional hospital, 15 (35.7%) from the district hospital, and 9 (40.9%) from the health
        center frequently consulted DI resources. The results showed that 133 (32.4%) of the
        respondents didn’t frequently consult DI resources, mainly due to lack of time; other
        reasons included inability to obtain the required information promptly, difficulty in
        accessing DI resources, difficulty in determining reliable resources, and the belief that
        the available resources are outdated and the information is vast and difficult to filter.
        Multivariate analysis showed an association between practice setting and the pattern of
        consultation of DI resources. Accordingly, compared with participants from the health
        center, participants from the specialized referral (AOR, 5.81; 95% CI, 2.77-12.20), zonal
        (AOR, 4.77; 95% CI, 2.43-9.38), and district hospitals (AOR, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.50-10.66) were
        found to be 6, 5, and 4 times more likely, respectively, to frequently consult DI
        resources.</p>
      <p>The top 3 areas of DI considered very important by the majority of the respondents were
        dosing in renal failure, use in pregnancy and lactation, and contraindications. The areas
        that need DI and the areas of DI that respondents considered very difficult to access are
        described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861512460758">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092861512460758">2</xref>.</p>

      <p>The majority of the respondents (75.4%) rated the importance of DI services as essential
          (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512460758">Table 3</xref>). The usefulness of
        establishing DI services in health facilities was strongly supported by the majority of
        respondents (78.5%). Most of the participants said that they need DI most importantly while
        rounding patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0092861512460758">Table 4</xref>).
        Accordingly, compared with prescribers from the health center, prescribers from the
        specialized referral hospital were 32 times more likely to demand DI while rounding patients
        (AOR, 32.53; 95% CI, 11.07-95.55). Compared with prescribers from the health center,
        participants from the specialized referral (AOR, 8.02; 95% CI, 1.67-38.50) and district
        hospitals (AOR, 6.10; 95% CI, 1.56-23.87) were found to be 8 and 6 times more likely,
        respectively, to demand DI while treating critical cases in intensive care units, unlike
        prescribers from the zonal hospital (AOR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02-0.42), who were less likely to
        demand DI.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The results of this study show that a majority of the prescribers (93.4%) demonstrated a
        need for DI services. This is comparable to findings from studies done in India (97%),<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512460758">11</xref>
        </sup> Estonia (88%),<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512460758">12</xref>
        </sup> and Uganda (80%).<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861512460758">13</xref>
        </sup> This finding reflects the lack of proper DI services in public health facilities,
        which is experienced by almost all of the respondents; it might be the case that prescribers
        know that current available resources do not satisfy their DI needs and, therefore, hope
        that the public health center will be a better source for information, especially regarding
        patient-specific queries. The study showed no association between practice settings and need
        for DI; thus, the need for DI was established regardless of the level of health
        facility.</p>
      <p>The purpose of establishing DI services in health facilities is to improve treatment
        outcomes and quality of care. Participants in the study also believe that establishing DI
        services in health facilities minimizes medication errors, improves prescription practices,
        and reduces cost of treatment. These could be considered as indicators of what prescribers
        expect from DI services.</p>
      <p>Even though textbooks are good sources of basic DI, they do not provide the most advanced
        or latest information, given that standards of medicine may change during the time it takes
        to publish a book. In our study, about one-third of Internet users complained that the
        information available online is vast and difficult to filter. One study done in the US<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861512460758">14</xref>
        </sup> indicated the continued lack of quality control for Internet documents and the lack
        of literature regarding potential harm from advice retrieved from the Internet. National
        guidelines usually provide limited information on drugs and may not provide patient-specific
        information. Drug package inserts and leaflets supplied by pharmaceutical companies mainly
        contain basic information on the product. The findings of a study done in India<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512460758">11</xref>
        </sup> indicated that 79% of clinicians felt that information provided by pharmaceutical
        companies is biased and inadequate. The results of the current study also showed a lack of
        access to DI resources such as newsletters, journals, and drug indexes that provide
        up-to-date and patient-specific information; this, in turn, may affect quality of
        prescription. The scarcities of these resources were significant at the zonal and district
        hospitals and the health center.</p>
      <p>In the present study, a significant number of prescribers did not frequently consult DI
        resources, mainly because it was difficult to acquire information promptly and/or because
        they did not have access to DI resources. This investigation thus reveals that lack of
        access to DI resources in general and lack of DI resources that can be accessed quickly to
        meet the immediate needs of prescribers in particular are possible reasons why prescribers
        do not consult DI resources, especially in resource-limited settings. This finding is
        different from the findings of a study done in Uganda,<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861512460758">13</xref>
        </sup> where lack of time was the major reason for not frequently consulting DI resources.
        The difference could be due to differences in working environments as well as availability
        of DI resources in health facilities. Moreover, multivariate analysis showed an association
        between practice settings and the pattern of consultation of DI resources: Prescribers from
        specialized referral, zonal, and district hospitals were more likely to consult DI resources
        compared with prescribers from the health center. This might be due to an increase in
        complexity of cases handled and relatively better accessibility to DI resources as the level
        of health facilities increases.</p>
      <p>Dosing in renal failure, use in pregnancy and lactation, contraindications, adverse drug
        reactions, and availability and cost were the 5 top areas of DI considered as very important
        by two-third of the respondents. The study showed no association between practice settings
        and areas of DI. In another study,<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512460758">12</xref>
        </sup> availability and price of medicines, use in the elderly, drug interactions, and use
        during pregnancy and lactation were considered as important areas that need DI.</p>
      <p>A majority of the prescribers indicated that they need more DI during patient rounding.
        Treating patients in the emergency department and treating critical cases in the intensive
        care unit were other situations in which prescribers indicated more need for DI.
        Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed an association between practice settings and
        specific conditions in which prescribers indicated more need for DI. Accordingly,
        prescribers from the specialized referral hospital are more likely to need DI during patient
        rounding and when treating critical cases in the intensive care unit compared with
        prescribers from the health center. This might be because patient rounding as a health care
        team is a day-to-day practice in the specialized referral teaching hospital and critical
        cases are usually referred to a specialized referral hospital. These results indicate that
        DI is urgently needed in some situations, and providers may require quickly accessible DI
        resources like personal digital assistants (PDAs) or palmtops that can be used to access DI
        at the point of patient care.</p>
      <p>Personal contact was the most preferred channel for drug information exchange in these
        health facilities. This method of information exchange could be time-consuming and
        inconvenient in situations where information is urgently needed.</p>
      <p>We believe that this study addresses an important issue regarding DI needs of prescribers
        in southwest Ethiopia. However, the findings of this study have some limitations and should
        be interpreted with care. As this was a cross-sectional study, it is susceptible to recall
        bias including the probability that the prescribers’ patterns of consultation of DI
        resources had been forgotten. It is assumed that the selected health facilities are
        representative of other centers in southwest Ethiopia. However, the pattern of DI needs of
        prescribers at specialized hospitals might be different from other health centers, given
        professional educational levels and other factors. Because the study was conducted only in
        the southwest area of the country, the findings may not be generalizable to the whole
        country.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>There is a high need for DI services from prescribers; lack of access to DI resources was
        identified as a problem that may affect prescribers’ clinical practice, especially at
        regional and district hospitals and at health centers. Lack of access to DI resources and
        difficulty in acquiring the required information promptly were the 2 major reasons that
        prescribers did not frequently consult DI resources. DI services should be established
        and/or expanded in health facilities; federal health officials and policy makers should give
        special attention to this issue, as the service is critical for efficient patient care and
        management.</p>
