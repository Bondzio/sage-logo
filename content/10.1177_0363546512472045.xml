<title>Background:</title>
<p>Differences in injury patterns among alpine skiers and snowboarders have previously been recognized, and controversy remains about the safety implications that snowboarding may pose to a ski resort. A change of policy at Taos Ski Valley provides a unique and modern perspective on the effect that snowboarders have on ski resort injuries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512472045">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>The addition of snowboarders to a large ski resort may result in a significant change in both the rate and pattern of injuries treated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512472045">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Descriptive epidemiology study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512472045">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Patient records from the Mogul Medical Clinic at Taos Ski Valley were reviewed from the 2006-2007 ski season through the 2009-2010 season (approximately 2 years before and after snowboarding was allowed) and recorded for age, sex, diagnosis, body region, anatomic location, injury type, and sport (skiing, snowboarding). The total numbers of mountain visits for the time periods with and without snowboarding were used to determine injury rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512472045">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The overall rate of persons injured increased from 206.7 per 100,000 mountain visits without snowboarders to 233.8 with snowboarders. The relative risk ratio was 1.131, also represented as a 13.1% increased risk of injury (IRI) (statistically significant; 95% CI, 3.5%-23.6%). Increases were seen in the rate of upper extremity injuries (IRI, 39.1%; 95% CI, 14.3-69.4) and head/neck injuries (IRI 30.8%; not significant), while lower extremity and trunk/pelvis injuries remained relatively constant. Distal radius fractures, closed head injuries, and acromioclavicular separations showed statistically significant increases with the addition of snowboarding. The most frequent injuries among snowboarders were distal radius fractures, wrist sprains, closed head injuries, and acromioclavicular separations. The most frequent injuries among skiers were anterior cruciate ligament tears, knee sprains, closed head injuries, and gastrocnemius tears. The median age of injured persons decreased from 39 years (range, 4-100 years) without snowboarders to 31 years (range, 4-99 years) with snowboarders, and this was significant. Approximately 45% of injured persons were female, and this did not change with the addition of snowboarders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512472045">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>In this study, there was a small but statistically significant increase in the likelihood of injury with the addition of snowboarding to a large ski resort. It is likely that factors such as younger demographic, elevated risk-taking behavior, or increased mountain crowding are involved. The difference in injuries is largely because of a significant increase in distal radius fractures, closed head injuries, and acromioclavicular separations. On mountain safety precautions such as widening of runs and streamlining of high traffic areas, training medical providers to recognize and treat sport-specific injuries, and promoting the use of wrist guards and helmets may be useful in reducing the effect that snowboarders have on ski resort injuries.</p>

<body>
<p>There are an estimated 7.6 million snowboarders in the United States (US), up more than 50% since the late 1990s according to a 2012 report from SnowSports Industries America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512472045">22</xref></sup> Pino and Colville<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512472045">17</xref></sup> first reported injury patterns among snowboarders in 1989, and further studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512472045">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512472045">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512472045">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512472045">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512472045">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512472045">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512472045">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512472045">19</xref></sup> have since attempted to characterize differences in skiing and snowboarding injuries. As expected, the incidence of snowboarding trauma has grown over time. Hayes and Groner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512472045">8</xref></sup> showed an increase in the ratio of snowboard- to ski-related trauma from 1999 to 2006. Schoffl et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472045">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512472045">21</xref></sup> recently compiled injury data from various sports and found that both skiing and snowboarding had injury rates that were similar to one another and lower than traditional sports such as soccer, rugby, football, and basketball.</p>
<p>Despite the growth in popularity of snowboarding, controversy remains whether allowing snowboarding at ski areas has a negative overall effect on mountain safety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472045">15</xref></sup> Currently, 3 major ski resorts in the US continue to have policies that ban snowboarding from their ski resort. They are Alta Ski Area and Deer Valley Ski Resort in Utah and Mad River Glen in Vermont.</p>
<p>Taos Ski Valley in New Mexico was the most recent resort to remove its snowboarding ban. The change in policy occurred on March 19, 2008. This change provides a unique opportunity to study injury patterns with and without snowboarding. To our knowledge, no previous study has looked at injury patterns before and after snowboarding was allowed at a ski resort.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546512472045" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Approval for this study involving human research participants was obtained through the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Institutional Review Board. The Mogul Medical Clinic at Taos Ski Valley is an on-mountain medical clinic that provides services 7 days a week during the ski season. Patient records from the clinic were reviewed retrospectively and recorded for injury date, age and sex, diagnosis (multiple diagnoses were listed as primary, secondary, and tertiary), and sport (skier, snowboarder, or unknown if not specified). Patients seen included all injured athletes who required ski patrol evacuation from the mountain as well as ambulatory injuries for which the patient arrived to the clinic as a walk-in. Given the geographic isolation of the ski area and the close proximity of the clinic, we assume that only a small percentage of injured athletes would choose to receive medical care at another facility and that this would not significantly alter our results.</p>
<p>Diagnoses were made by experienced emergency medicine physicians based on history, examinations, and plain radiographs. Advanced imaging with magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography was not available on site but in some cases was used to follow-up or confirm suspected diagnoses. Injuries were classified based on body region, anatomic location, and injury type.</p>
<p>Only musculoskeletal injuries related to alpine winter sports activities were included in the study and only if they occurred during the operational days of the ski resort. Altitude-related symptoms and illnesses such as headache, dehydration, pulmonary distress, and dizziness were not included unless there was a clear association with a traumatic event. Other clinic encounters such as routine health maintenance visits, motor vehicle collisions, and pedestrian falls while not engaging in an alpine sports activity were also excluded.</p>
<p>We elected to review data from the 2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009, and 2009-2010 seasons. This gave us approximately 2 years of data before and after the change in policy that allowed snowboarders. Data from before and after March 19, 2008 were split into 2 data sets for analysis: without snowboarding and with snowboarding. To account for differences in the total number of skiers (and snowboarders) for the 2 study periods, the total number of mountain visits (each athlete has a ticket that is electronically scanned at the base of each lift, and this is recorded as a single day of skiing/snowboarding regardless of the number of lift rides taken on a single day) and operational days were recorded for each study period. This allowed us to compare rates of injury per mountain visit for each study period as well as calculate the average number of mountain visits per operational day.</p>
<p>Biostatistical analysis was performed in conjunction with the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Clinical and Translational Science Center and supported by the National Center for Research Resources and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health through grant number 8UL1TR000041. Sex distribution among the groups was analyzed using a χ<sup>2</sup> test. Age distribution was analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p>
<p>The number of persons injured was calculated as a rate per 100,000 mountain visits. The difference in rate with and without snowboarding was calculated as the absolute risk increase and analyzed using the test of equality and proportions (<italic>P</italic> value). The relative risk ratio for the change in injury rate was calculated and reported as a percentage of increased risk of injury along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</p>
<p>Total injuries, including primary, secondary, and tertiary, were analyzed with respect to body region, injury type, and diagnosis. <italic>P</italic> values were calculated for the absolute risk increase using the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons, and 95% CIs were calculated for the percentage of increased risk of injury.</p>
<p>The most frequent diagnoses with and without snowboarding were compared to demonstrate the difference in injury patterns after snowboarding was allowed. The most frequent diagnoses by sport were compared to demonstrate the difference in injury patterns among skiers and snowboarders.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>From the beginning of the 2006-2007 season until March 18, 2008 (without snowboarding), 779 persons sustained 811 injuries (3.9% multiply injured). There were 376,817 mountain visits over 234 operational days during this period for an average 1610.3 visits per day (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512472045">Table 1</xref>). From March 19, 2008 until the end of the 2009-2010 season (with snowboarding), 1282 persons sustained 1355 injuries (5.7% multiply injured). There were 548,366 mountain visits over 278 operational days during this period for an average 1972.5 visits per day. Approximately 45% of injured persons were female during both study periods, and there was no change in sex distribution using the χ<sup>2</sup> test (<italic>P</italic> = .49). The median age of injured persons dropped from 39 to 31 years, and this change was significant using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512472045">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Examining all injuries by diagnosis, the most frequent injuries for the entire study period were anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears and knee sprains, followed by closed head injuries, distal radius fractures, and wrist sprains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546512472045">Table 4</xref>). However, certain trends stood out when the periods with and without snowboarding were compared. Distal radius fractures rose from the 10th most frequent injury without snowboarding to the 2nd most frequent with snowboarding. Acromioclavicular (AC) separations went from 15th to 6th most frequent, and clavicle fractures went from 14th to 7th. The diagnoses that showed the greatest absolute risk increase with snowboarding were distal radius fractures (16.9/100,000 visits; &gt;300% increased risk), closed head injuries (10.2/100,000 visits; &gt;100% increased risk), and AC separations (5.9/100,000 visits; &gt;150% increased risk).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results indicate a significant increase (13.1%) in the overall rate of on-mountain injuries with the addition of snowboarding to a large ski resort. We believe it is important that readers understand that our conclusion does not identify snowboarding specifically as a more dangerous sport, nor do we suggest that skiers are placing themselves at increased risk by sharing the mountain with snowboarders. Instead, we recognize that a small but statistically significant increase in injury rate was observed after the addition of snowboarding to this mountain but that factors other than type of sport may play a role in the differences that were identified.</p>
<p>During the period with snowboarding, 21.9% of injured persons were identified as snowboarders, 64% were skiers, and 14.1% were unknown. Taos Ski Valley estimates that 18% of all mountain visits are snowboarders; however, this statistic is not accurate enough to draw any real conclusions or to calculate whether the injury rate among skiers specifically went up in the presence of snowboarders.</p>
<p>Although these numbers suggest that snowboarders may be injured more frequently than skiers, it does not take into account injury severity, nor does it take into account inherent differences between the 2 groups. Bergstrøm et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512472045">3</xref></sup> recently reported that alpine skiing injuries had a higher Injury Severity Score (ISS) than snowboarding or telemarking but also found that the mean ISS was higher among adolescents. Wasden et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512472045">24</xref></sup> reported that injured snowboarders were younger and less likely to sustain a fatal accident compared with skiers. Interestingly, they reported a significantly higher male population, whereas in our study, the ratio of men to women remained constant.</p>
<p>In our study, the median age dropped from 39 to 31 years after snowboarders were allowed. We believe that the shift to a younger population on the ski area increases the number of risk-taking athletes. Risk-taking behavior has been shown to correlate with an increased rate and severity of injury. Moffat et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512472045">14</xref></sup> observed this when they described the differences in terrain park versus nonterrain park injuries. Also, Wakahara et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512472045">23</xref></sup> reported from Japan that 83% of spinal cord injuries from snowboarding occurred from an intentional jump.</p>
<p>After the addition of snowboarding, the number of visits per day rose from 1610.3 to 1972.5, a 22% increase on average. We believe that this increased crowding, particularly in high traffic areas, may have led to an increased rate of injury.</p>
<p>Other potential risk factors for injury are recognized but could not be accounted for in our study. Hasler et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472045">7</xref></sup> reported low readiness for speed, bad weather/visibility, and old or icy snow as risk factors. Aschauer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512472045">2</xref></sup> also reported that unfavorable weather conditions were a leading risk factor in alpine sports injuries and theorized that parabolic ski design and advances in carving technique have led to higher cornering speeds and higher injury forces.</p>
<p>In our study, there was a statistically significant increase in upper extremity trauma and a trend toward increased head/neck trauma, differences largely attributable to an increased rate of distal radius fractures, closed head injuries, AC separations, clavicle fractures, and wrist sprains. Despite these changes, injuries to the lower extremities, particularly ACL tears and other injuries about the knee, remained the most frequent injuries treated.</p>
<p>Our findings are in agreement with Kim et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512472045">10</xref></sup> who reported higher rates of upper extremity trauma and head injuries among snowboarders and higher rates of lower extremity trauma among skiers. Recent reviews by Cusimano and Kwok<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472045">5</xref></sup> and Russell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472045">18</xref></sup> have shown sufficient evidence that helmets and wrist guards reduce injury rates in alpine sports. Despite this evidence, Kroncke et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472045">11</xref></sup> found that a large proportion of adolescents do not regularly wear personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides a unique and modern perspective on the effect that snowboarding has on injuries at a major ski resort. We propose that this information can be used to enhance on-mountain safety measures such as widening of runs and streamlining of high traffic areas, assist with medical training in the recognition and treatment of sport-specific injuries, help guide appropriate on-mountain staffing, and promote the protective benefits of wrist guards and helmets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472045">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512472045">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512472045">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472045">18</xref></sup>
