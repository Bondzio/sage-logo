<p>Patient decision aids (DAs) facilitate patient-physician discussions by providing information on treatment options for a health condition. DAs are available in many formats (e.g., video, audio recording, brochure) and levels of complexity (e.g., simple 1-page sheets; combinations of booklets, videos, and online material). The use of DAs is intended to promote shared decision making (SDM) between patients and providers to ensure the ultimate goal of providing patients with care that is aligned with their personal values. In randomized controlled trials, DAs have improved patient knowledge, patient satisfaction with the decision-making process, and concordance between patient values and their treatment choices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12468615">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12468615"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12468615"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12468615"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12468615">5</xref></sup> Notably, research also suggests that using DAs for preference-sensitive decisions often results in patients choosing less invasive treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12468615">5</xref></sup> Studies in real-world settings are also needed, but research trial results so far suggest that implementation of DAs with a focus on SDM could increase appropriate health care use and health care affordability.</p>
<p>Despite this evidence, integration of patient DAs into everyday clinical practice is proceeding slowly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12468615">6</xref></sup> In the United States, a few medical centers have developed programs for delivering DAs for a limited set of health conditions, such as cancer screening or breast cancer treatment in primary and specialty care settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12468615">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12468615"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12468615">9</xref></sup> Although single-site models for implementing DAs are becoming more common, models for widespread distribution of DAs for multiple health conditions across large health care delivery systems are rare, perhaps because there are no published models for engaging numerous service lines to optimize DA distribution and follow-up. To facilitate broader translation of DAs and SDM into routine clinical practice, Washington state passed legislation in 2007 to promote public-private SDM demonstration projects statewide and identified the use of SDM with DAs as a higher standard of informed consent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12468615">10</xref></sup> The goal of this report is to describe how Group Health Cooperative—an integrated health plan and care delivery system in Washington state—undertook a systemwide implementation of DAs related to elective surgical procedures. We provide insights about challenges and facilitators in this health care delivery setting that we believe are broadly applicable in promoting the effective and efficient distribution and use of DAs.</p>

<title>Setting and Population</title>
<p>Beginning in January 2009, Group Health undertook a systemwide implementation of video-based patient DAs for 12 preference-sensitive health conditions related to elective surgical procedures. The implementation project sought primarily to incorporate DAs into standard clinical practice for 6 specialty service lines within Group Health’s Western Washington Group Practice Division (serving approximately 366,000 members). This report describes the qualitative data collected to document the implementation of this project that was part of a larger evaluation and research effort exploring both process and outcomes. This evaluation was conducted by researchers at Group Health Research Institute, the nonproprietary, public interest research arm of Group Health that has approximately 90% external funding (federal and foundation grants). This report focuses on the first 2 years of implementation that engaged Group Health Orthopedics, Cardiology, Urology, Women’s Health, General Surgery, and Neurosurgery. We provide a broad, systemwide overview of the implementation and then report on each service line.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0272989X12468615">
<title>Decision Aid Interventions</title>
<p>The content of the 12 video-based DAs implemented by Group Health was jointly developed by the Informed Medical Decisions Foundation and Health Dialog through a standardized process that included a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of each treatment option; input from experts in surgery, medical specialties, primary care, and nursing; and information from a series of focus groups and interviews with patients, some of whom had elected not to have treatment. The DAs were provided to Group Health free of charge during the first 2 years of this demonstration and research project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0272989X12468615">
<title>Qualitative Research Methods</title>
<p>The qualitative evaluation team used a case study methodology to collect, organize, and analyze data on the implementation project.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12468615">11</xref></sup> Case study data were taken from interview transcripts, meeting observation notes, and video distribution statistics. We conducted interviews with several stakeholders in the DA project, including project managers in charge of implementation, specialty care service line leaders, and frontline providers. Project managers and specialty service line leaders in all 6 service lines were asked to participate in the interviews, and all who were asked agreed. The frontline providers interviewed were from orthopedics and cardiology. These service lines were chosen for in-depth evaluation primarily because specialty leadership observed clear differences early in the implementation process, both in providers’ receptivity to the DAs and logistical ease of DA integration into clinical practice. All providers (including physician assistants) in the 2 service lines who saw patients with the conditions addressed in the DAs were invited to be interviewed; 10 Cardiology providers (50% of invited) and 9 Orthopedics providers (34% of invited) participated. In-person interviews were conducted in the first year of DA implementation, with in-person or phone follow-up interviews approximately 1 year later. Two Cardiology and 3 Orthopedics providers did not participate in follow-up. One had left Group Health, and the others were either unavailable or did not respond.</p>
<p>Semi-structured interview guides (see appendix for example interview guide available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mdm.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://mdm.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>) were used for all interviews (with slight modifications for different roles and for follow-up). For providers and service line leaders, questions focused on provider views on the patient decision-making role, approaches to patient decision making before the DA implementation project, reactions to the DA, descriptions of DA workflow/processes in their clinic, and DA effect on care. For project managers and specialty care leaders, interviews focused on recent interactions with the service lines and their assessment of progress, facilitators, and barriers. All interviews were conducted by the qualitative evaluation lead (CH) and a research assistant and were audio recorded and transcribed. We also conducted ethnographic observations of key implementation meetings, documented with detailed notes. The observer typed meeting observation notes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X12468615">Table 1</xref> summarizes the data collection points for each service line.</p>

<p>Data collection efforts yielded 67 transcripts and field note documents that included approximately 550 pages of text. We analyzed these data using a modified grounded theory approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12468615">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X12468615">13</xref></sup> Major themes were identified, followed by development of more specific codes within the major theme codes. The code list was developed iteratively. Two study team members (CH and DLT) read and coded provider interview transcripts and then compared coding. After several coding and reconciliation rounds, a master code list was developed and an additional round of coding and comparison performed to check for code definition agreement. One team member (DLT) coded the remaining data with input from the second coder (CH). Field notes and leadership interviews were coded by CH with support from a research assistant. The final analysis was completed by CH, with additional consolidation and code refinement. During this process, a standardized case study template was created and a separate case study written for each service line, including key codes and quotes for each line. The case studies were then analyzed for commonalities and differences.</p>

<title>Planning the distribution process</title>
<p>Following the passage of SDM legislation in Washington state, Group Health senior clinical leaders fully supported a SDM demonstration project, promoting it in verbal and written communications to providers and staff. These communications emphasized the importance of improving clinical outcomes and controlling costs by reducing unwarranted variations in care. Specialty care leaders presented DA implementation as a mandate to frontline providers and staff, maintaining that DAs would result in positive outcomes, including better informed patients, greater liability protection under the new legislation, and improved quality of care. Leaders hoped that using DAs for elective surgery might also decrease the rates of some procedures and lower care costs, but this point was usually not emphasized with frontline providers. Another important leadership decision was to engage specialty service lines first, ensuring their familiarity with the DAs before moving DA use to primary care (primary care use was not achieved during this report period).</p>
<p>In the first step of Group Health’s DA implementation, senior leaders in Group Health’s Quality Improvement and Informatics Department determined the scope. Initial discussions focused on which specialty service lines to include (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272989X12468615">Table 2</xref>) and appropriate DA distribution targets, given the prevalence of particular conditions. Group Health chose to implement all DAs related to elective surgery that were available from the foundation that generated the DAs (except the bariatric surgery DA, which was already used at Group Health for other research projects). Video-based DAs were chosen because of their high quality (based on international patient decision aid standards)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X12468615">14</xref></sup> and because they were free for the first 2 years of implementation and research. DA options from other sources were considered and rejected in favor of the selected DAs, which leaders felt were the most comprehensive and evidence based.</p>

<p>Since each specialty service line and clinical location had unique patient needs and workflow, 2 senior Group Health project management consultants who had successfully led other major change projects planned and guided implementation (approximately 1.15 full-time equivalent [FTE] for 2 years). The consultants worked with service line leaders to develop implementation agreements and process flow diagrams for each service line. Once a draft distribution process was generated, the project managers met with frontline providers and staff to introduce the DAs, the distribution process and answer questions. Process revisions were based on provider reactions and suggestions. In some cases, several provider and staff meetings were needed to satisfactorily address concerns, but usually only 1 meeting was necessary. Negotiation periods varied considerably, from 6 weeks to 3 or 4 months. Once an implementation process was agreed upon, a “go-live” date was set, after which the project managers visited each clinic site at least once to monitor implementation processes and progress. Sites experiencing challenges received additional visits and calls as necessary.</p>
<p>DAs were primarily distributed in DVD and booklet format using an existing Group Health service that supplies educational materials to patients via US mail. The DVD versions of the DAs could be ordered for patients by clinical staff using Group Health’s electronic health record (EHR; EpicCare, Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, WI). Patients could also view the DA online via the MyGroupHealth patient portal, and providers could embed a link to the video DA in the patient’s after-visit summary. DAs could also be distributed in the office; however, early in the project, the consultants found challenges to tracking DAs distributed in the clinic. Since tracking was critical for project evaluation, in-office distribution was strongly discouraged. Exceptions were made for Cardiology and Breast Cancer treatment options for which the time between a patient’s initial appointment and the procedure was very short, making the mailed option unfeasible.</p>
<p>DA video length was 35 to 55 minutes, making them difficult to integrate into a routine office visit. Although clinical leaders promoted the delivery of DAs before the patient’s first specialty consult, some specialty providers reported that problems with the accuracy of referral diagnoses made them reluctant to implement previsit DA delivery. For example, Women’s Health was concerned about distributing DAs to women referred for abnormal uterine bleeding until they had been thoroughly evaluated for cancerous causes of bleeding. In these cases, the provider was responsible for ordering the DA at the point of care; for these DAs, a desired component for the DA workflow process was scheduling a follow-up conversation after the patient had viewed the DA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0272989X12468615">
<title>Implementation timeline</title>
<p>Orthopedics and Women’s Health began distributing DAs in January 2009, followed closely by Cardiology and Urology. Implementation in General Surgery was delayed until spring 2009 to coordinate with existing Group Health programs that distributed educational materials to women diagnosed with breast cancer. For Neurosurgery, creation of DA distribution protocols was delayed until March 2010 because of administrative challenges and leadership changes. In the 16th month of implementation, all specialty services lines took part in a major process improvement effort aimed at streamlining and standardizing clinic flow. This effort, called “Pre, During, Post” (PDP) work, was part of Group Health’s adoption of lean management principles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X12468615">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X12468615"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12468615"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12468615">18</xref></sup> As part of the PDP process, major revisions were made to DA workflows in several service lines. One key change involved giving patient visit schedulers a list of words and phrases that, if mentioned by the patient during appointment scheduling, would prompt the scheduler to e-mail the specialty service provider’s team that the patient might be a candidate for a DA. A cover letter was added to the mailed DAs emphasizing that not all treatment options featured in the DA might be appropriate for a specific patient, depending on his or her medical history, and that the DA did not replace the consultation with a specialist. The PDP changes coincided with increased DA distribution in some lines, most notably for health conditions that could be easily identified before a specialist visit (e.g., knee and hip osteoarthritis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272989X12468615">Figure 1</xref>). However, we also observed a gradual decrease in DA distribution following the post-PDP rise. Finally, to encourage DA orders, in fall 2010, Group Health consultative specialty leadership modified the electronic medical record’s referral process to give primary care providers a choice between referral with or without a DA; however, this process change did not emphasize SDM conversations in the primary care setting.</p>

<sec id="section9-0272989X12468615">
<title>Monitoring progress</title>
<p>Twice-monthly DA distribution reports were circulated to clinical leaders for use in process improvement. These spreadsheets showed distribution over time by several variables, including individual provider, service line, and DA. Reports were used by leadership, project managers, and the evaluation team to assess DA implementation progress. Initially, no numerical targets were set for DA distribution; instead, clinical leadership encouraged individual providers to use their judgment to maximize DA distribution levels in their patient panels. In the second year of implementation, a new process metric was developed to identify missed opportunities for the most prevalent conditions (hip osteoarthritis, knee osteoarthritis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, uterine fibroids, abnormal uterine bleeding, lumbar herniated disk, and spinal stenosis). The denominator for this metric was the number of patients undergoing elective surgical procedures related to the condition; the numerator was the number of those patients for whom a DA had been ordered before surgery. This metric provided a more actionable target for process improvement because patients who did not receive a DA before surgery could be examined post hoc to determine the source of process gaps. The missed opportunities metric, although not implemented for all DAs, showed a decrease over 1 year in Orthopedics but not Urology.</p>

<title>Orthopedics</title>
<p>Orthopedics was one of the first to implement the DAs, and implementation occurred with limited debate or controversy. Because knee and hip osteoarthritis are relatively easy to identify accurately at the time of referral, a previsit model of delivery was favored by Orthopedics leadership. At all sites, if a patient had not seen the DA before the initial visit, the provider was encouraged to order it at the point of care. However, when DAs were ordered at the point of care, providers rarely scheduled follow-up visits specifically to talk about the DA and/or treatment preferences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0272989X12468615">
<title>Cardiology</title>
<p>In March 2009, Cardiology began distributing a DA on treatment options for chronic stable angina and quickly encountered logistical challenges to distribution. The first difficulty was identifying appropriate patients. Providers noted that chronic stable angina—for which treatment with medications, stents, or bypass is equally effective—is infrequently encountered in routine cardiology practice.</p>
<p>Cardiology providers also reported challenges in finding an appropriate time to distribute the DA. Typically, little time occurred between the decision to schedule an angiogram and the actual procedure. This short timeframe caused difficulties in mail distribution, so Cardiology providers were given permission to distribute DAs directly to patients. Further issues arose about the timing of the SDM conversation. Providers reported that patients who need an angiogram often prefer to combine diagnosis and treatment in one procedure (i.e., angiogram with stenting), rather than having the procedures at different dates, which would require a second exposure to an invasive procedure. As a result, diagnosis and treatment often occurred during the same intervention, and preangiogram SDM conversations occurred without important diagnostic information. Most providers did not have a process to ensure that follow-up conversations routinely took place after patients had viewed the DA. Several providers (working at the same clinic) reported that they occasionally followed up with patients by phone or office visit before the angiogram.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, almost all Cardiology providers were supportive of the concept of the DAs and valued them as an educational tool (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X12468615">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s full of information. It saves me a fair amount of time in explaining what the procedure is. It’s visual, so I find it very useful for extending the amount of information beyond the time that I would have to describe it nearly as well.</p>
<p>The parts I liked were the things that had nothing to do about shared decision making. The parts that had to do with “here’s what a stent looks like” and “this is how we jam it in your heart” and the nice little cartoons and diagrams.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, almost all providers expressed concern or frustration that, for this particular condition, treatment decisions were often made while the patient was sedated and undergoing an invasive diagnostic procedure.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>For this particular issue, it’s complicated, because you don’t have all the clinical data that you need to make a decision until you’ve taken the angiogram. And there is a strong incentive to deal with it right after you’ve done the angiogram. The incentives being: it’s more efficient, it’s more comfortable for the patient, and by and large . . . if you ask them the question, “Do you want us to just do what we think is best or do you want us to stop and then we can have plenty of time to talk it over later,” they nearly always will tell you, “No, just do what you think is best.” That’s the clear majority view in this. So you’re stuck talking about contingencies without the most critical piece of information that you need in order to be able to have a coherent discussion.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some providers were concerned that the DA would deter patients from getting an angiogram, which they viewed as a necessary diagnostic test. Four providers reported encountering or hearing about patients who refused the angiogram after viewing the DA. Providers also expressed concern about some of the statistics in the DA, especially the figures on the risks of angiography. They worried that the risks were overstated and would discourage patients from getting an angiogram. In addition, concerns were expressed about promoting the DAs as a SDM tool when the logistics of diagnosis and treatment were not conducive to having a fully informed conversation before the angiogram. Finally, they felt that the DA was appropriate only for a small group of patients in their outpatient cardiology practice with stable coronary disease. In July 2009, they ultimately decided to limit DA distribution to outpatients with stable angina who were being referred for elective diagnostic angiography. Providers or the nurse scheduling and preparing the patient for the angiogram ordered the DA. However, some providers continued to be concerned that some patients who had clinical conditions other than chronic stable angina might receive the DA.</p>
<p>Although providers in both Orthopedics and Cardiology expressed concerns about DAs, we observed notable differences between these 2 service lines. Several Cardiology providers reported condition-specific barriers, such as the fact that treatment decisions are best made during or after angiograms. These logistical difficulties, in conjunction with providers’ misgivings about DA content, negatively affected implementation of DAs in Cardiology. Conversely, treatment decisions in Orthopedics are largely driven by the patients, based on pain and function, and can be made within or outside the office visit setting. These condition-specific characteristics of Osteoarthritis facilitated a smoother implementation in Orthopedics and resulted in increased provider uptake for the distribution of DAs to patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0272989X12468615">
<title>Women’s Health</title>
<p>Women’s Health implemented 2 DAs, one for abnormal uterine bleeding and another for uterine fibroids. All clinic sites in the Women’s Health service line relied on providers to identify patients appropriate for DAs during the first office visit. They did not initially institute previsit ordering because of challenges in identifying appropriate patients before the first visit. Patients often self-refer to Women’s Health or do not accurately identify the issues for which they are seeking care when making their appointments. At one clinic, a nurse or midwife reviewed primary care referrals to see if any information triggered DA ordering and, when appropriate, flagged patient records. The provider, however, was ultimately responsible for ordering DAs at the point of care.</p>
<p>Follow-up processes varied by clinic. One provider reported that follow-up telephone calls were scheduled if the flow staff saw from the EHR that the DA had been ordered. However, another provider reported challenges scheduling phone visits due to time constraints, making follow-up difficult.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0272989X12468615">
<title>Urology</title>
<p>Urology distributed a DA for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and another for prostate cancer. When the DAs were introduced, providers worried that implementation would require changes in systemwide treatment policies or would confuse patients faced with multiple, equally effective treatment options.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>With prostate cancer, particularly . . . because of the lack of good data out there, you can go a number of different ways with the treatment options. So consequently, it’s difficult, I think, to use . . . sometimes there’s no good answer. There’s no clear answer. . . . So if you just present information out there and don’t give them any suggestions on what they should do, you just end up with a patient that’s that much more confused.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Providers also felt that certain treatments, some of which they did not offer or endorse, were overemphasized. For example, one provider had concerns about how radiation was presented in the DA: “If you look at this—if the patient just looks at the side effects, he would choose radiation. I don’t agree with this. No urologist would choose radiation. And it actually costs more money.”</p>
<p>However, after an initial meeting of all Urology providers with the implementation project manager and the evaluation team, concerns about the 2 Urology DAs seemed to dissipate. At a follow-up meeting, one provider assured the implementation consultant, “The tone at the [other] meeting doesn’t reflect our view.” Another provider praised the DAs with the caveat that he felt they overemphasized surgical options. Project consultants reported few issues with the Urology service line after initial concerns and questions had been discussed.</p>
<p>Each Urology clinic had slightly different distribution processes. In one, a nurse reviewed referrals and ordered the DA before the first appointment. Another had schedulers flag possible patients and forward their names to the clinic flow staff to determine whether a DA was appropriate. The third relied on providers to order the DA at the first visit. In this service line, we observed that the clinic that implemented a system for previsit review of all new patient referrals by a nurse and DA ordering had significantly higher distribution overall. An early problem encountered with the previsit distribution was that patients who had elevated prostate serum antigen levels but no cancer diagnosis were mistakenly sent a prostate cancer DA. This error led to rapid modification of the criteria for sending the DA. A unique process component in Urology was the inclusion of a letter explaining that some treatment options presented in the DA might not be recommended based on an individual’s medical history. Similar letters were eventually integrated into other service lines during the PDP improvement work. The Urology service line leader stated that patients commonly have multiple consultations with the specialist before a surgical intervention, so no specialized process was needed to ensure follow-up conversations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0272989X12468615">
<title>General Surgery</title>
<p>Three breast cancer DAs were implemented (at Group Health, breast cancer surgery falls under the General Surgery service line). The distribution processes for the 3 DAs were unique because Group Health has a well-organized Breast Cancer Screening Program (BCSP). The BCSP already had a system to notify women of breast cancer diagnoses and give them instructions, information, and educational materials. Service line leadership therefore integrated breast cancer DA distribution into the existing workflow through several meetings with BCSP staff. BCSP staff coordinated DA distribution, but the surgeons to whom patients were referred were never fully engaged in understanding the operational and clinical implications of DA implementation. Meetings were not held with providers to educate them on the purpose of the DA implementation before beginning distribution. After DA implementation, visits to staff and provider meetings revealed that many providers did not know about the DA project or the DAs. Those who knew about them reported that they talked about the DAs only when patients mentioned viewing them, which rarely occurred. Unlike other service lines, General Surgery providers did not proactively engage with patients about the DAs or order them if the patients had not received them.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite strong service line leadership support for the DAs, after more than 12 months of implementation, only 1 of the 6 providers we talked with had watched the DAs. Although General Surgery providers acknowledged that the DAs might contain some helpful information, they reported very little interaction with patients regarding the DAs and said these limited interactions were often negative because the DAs alarmed or caused concern among patients. Several providers reported that the breast reconstruction DA had images that patients found frightening.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well, I haven’t watched the DAs, but I see quite a few patients, people with breast cancer, and what I hear from patients who have seen them is that some patients seem to really appreciate them. Some patients seem really scared after watching the DA and some of the material on there. . . . It really does increase the time I’m spending with them, almost uniformly. . . . It doesn’t save any time at all. And it’s making me run late having to address all the issues the patient has after watching the DA.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Providers reported difficulty having SDM conversations with patients who had recently been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. General Surgery providers said patients were more interested in understanding why they had cancer and how it would affect their life, rather than discussing their treatment options. Providers also said they already had access to materials that supported SDM, and the DA did not significantly add to these. Finally, they reported that having SDM conversations with patients recently diagnosed with a life-threatening illness was difficult because the patients were often concerned about whether they were going to die and other existential questions (e.g., why me?).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0272989X12468615">
<title>Neurosurgery</title>
<p>Neurosurgery providers were broadly supportive of SDM and reported that decisions to have surgery for spinal stenosis or a herniated disk were based exclusively on patient preferences and were not time sensitive.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think they’re very informative and my opinion is I wish our primary care doctors would actually use them and send them to their patients when they place the referral for them to come see us. Because it makes our visit a lot more informative rather than trying to repeat a lot of the stuff that they get on the video. We can get to more nitty-gritty in terms of specifics and stuff like that of what their expectations are and if surgery is ultimately what they want to do. . . it gives the patients a sense of where to go in terms of non-operative treatment options versus surgical decompression and just makes the discussion that we have with the patient a lot more effective and more worthwhile.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, Neurosurgery had several administrative and leadership changes during the course of DA implementation and did not institute a formal DA distribution process until March 2010, when a new clinic manager was hired. Once the clinic manager integrated DA ordering into the PDP process and trained clinic support staff to order the DA for providers, uptake of Neurosurgery DAs was relatively strong despite very limited early provider engagement in the process. The Neurosurgery providers we spoke with said they often scheduled follow-up conversations with patients if they had not watched the DA before their first visit with the neurosurgeon.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Growing evidence suggests that using DAs improves the quality of patient decision-making processes and potentially reduces unwarranted variations in care, thereby mitigating unnecessary health care expenditures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12468615">5</xref></sup> However, little published evidence addresses the feasibility of implementing patient DAs on a large scale in specialty clinical practice settings. This report describes Group Health’s mixed results in implementing video-based DAs for 12 preference-sensitive health conditions related to elective surgical procedures in 6 specialty service lines. Group Health’s implementation established both systemwide and clinic-specific processes and distributed just under 10,000 DAs in 2 years. However, distribution of DAs alone did not necessarily guarantee an increase in the number or quality of SDM conversations, and further research is required to understand the impact of DA delivery on decision quality.</p>
<p>During the project, we learned several critical lessons about the facilitators and barriers to implementation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272989X12468615">Table 4</xref>) that may be of use to others considering DA implementation. We highlight a few of the more prominent lessons here. First, we had a high level of leadership support. This support ensured that clinical staff received strong and consistent messages about the importance of the project and experienced changes in organizational systems and procedures that reinforced the expectation that the DAs would be distributed and that providers would engage patients in SDM conversations.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Second, developing a system for previsit ordering of DAs, when possible, appeared to improve overall distribution and create natural opportunities for patient follow-up. However, since providing the DA before consultation with a specialist was not always possible, better methods for postvisit follow-up after DA delivery are needed to ensure that providers “close the loop” with patients before a final decision is made. Our evaluation findings suggested that clinics that relied heavily on providers ordering DAs at the point of care had many missed opportunities, with patients either not receiving DAs at all or not having follow-up conversations with providers after receiving a DA. Other distribution methods—such as in-office viewing—might be effective for ensuring follow-up, although these would require significant investments in infrastructure, staff time, and patient willingness to spend more than an hour in the clinic.</p>
<p>We provided monthly feedback on DA distribution. These regular data updates allowed service lines, clinics, and individual providers to see how many DAs were being distributed and to compare those figures to other providers and clinics. The “missed opportunities” measure was an important addition to the feedback provided.</p>
<p>We found that engaging providers in planning the distribution process is important. In almost all service lines, even those that were supportive and had high distribution rates, providers often had concerns about specific aspects of the DA content or distribution process. These concerns usually could be addressed and diffused by actively engaging providers in developing the distribution process. Service lines that engaged providers in the preparations and planning for DA implementation showed increased provider understanding and acceptance of the DAs over time. Our experience with General Surgery suggested that when providers were not engaged, they were less likely to adopt a positive attitude toward the DA. Thus, DA distribution alone, without provider engagement, is not sufficient. To change the types of conversations they are having with patients, providers must participate in conversations about the purpose of the DAs and the types of changes expected. Also, training and peer support around SDM are needed to ensure that providers understand what constitutes SDM and how to incorporate patient values in treatment decisions.</p>
<p>In more than one instance, we found that implementing DAs for conditions perceived as life-threatening by patients and providers is challenging. Providers reported difficulty having SDM conversations with patients who had recently been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness (e.g., cancer or cardiac disease). On the other hand, providers strongly supported DAs for health conditions for which the treatment options were perceived to be truly preference sensitive, and the harmful effects of delayed treatment were rare (e.g., osteoarthritis or herniated disk). These findings suggest that different types of engagement around the DAs are needed for providers dealing with life-threatening and time-sensitive conditions. The goal should be to increase their comfort in using the DAs and engaging in SDM conversations with their patients.</p>
<p>Study limitations to note include that some interview findings were based primarily on the perspectives of 1 or 2 service line leaders and might not represent all providers’ views and experiences. This limitation was addressed, in part, by observing meetings and interviewing project managers. Second, we did not obtain data on patient perspectives or patient-provider encounters, which might provide information on viewing rates or patient perceptions of the DAs. For this evaluation, we relied on provider, leadership, and project manager perspectives. Third, this project was conducted at a large integrated health care organization that has many factors that facilitated DA implementation, including salaried providers, an expectation that providers will follow clinical guidelines and standard work procedures, and an overall practice culture that favors conservative treatment and an active patient role in health care. The organization also had substantial infrastructure to support DA distribution, including a mechanism for distributing health education materials to patients through US mail, and a well-developed EHR. These features could make our distribution model difficult to replicate in other settings. However, we still believe that many of the barriers, facilitators, and lessons learned have broad applicability.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The use of patient DAs and the promotion of SDM between providers and patients could positively influence several aspects of the US health care system. Possible contributions include improving patient-centered care, controlling health care costs, improving the quality of care delivery, and reducing unwarranted variations in care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12468615">2</xref></sup> This article describes an integrated health care organization’s experience implementing 12 DAs in multiple specialty lines and across many clinic sites. We found the most effective integration of DAs into clinical care occurred when conditions were non–life-threatening, the patient received DA material before visiting the clinic, and providers were involved in the design of the implementation process. We hope that by highlighting key facilitators and barriers to implementation, we can help other organizations to use DAs effectively and promote widespread adoption of SDM in patient care.</p>
