<p>Sociologists of work have been drawn into a conversation over work’s significance as a source of identity and social affiliation – ‘needs’ which, according to late modern theorists, are increasingly fulfilled in multiple other realms. This article enters this exchange by foregrounding the epistemological puzzle of how we can ‘know’ identity and social affiliation in narratives. As a provisional solution, Jenkins’s concepts of identification and categorization are brought into contact with Marks and Thompson’s emphasis on interests and identities and operationalized through Somers’s concepts of narrative identity, emplotment and categorization in an analysis of qualitative interviews with 52 working people and former workers in Canada.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ‘end of work’ thesis has pulled disparate studies in and outside the sociology of work into conversation with one another over theories of late modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012458024">Atkinson, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012458024">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012458024">Bauman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012458024">Beck, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012458024">Giddens, 1991</xref>) in relation to work and employment. A key debate is over the importance of work as a source of identity and social affiliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">Doherty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458024">Marks and Thompson, 2010</xref>: 327) – ‘needs’ which, according to late modern theorists, are increasingly fulfilled in other realms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012458024">Bauman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012458024">Beck, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012458024">Giddens, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012458024">Sennett, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012458024">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, the case is made that while sociologists of work are often technically correct in their critiques, those who dispute the ‘end of work’ thesis tend to use narrow and/or under-theorized definitions of identity and social affiliation, resulting in a limited engagement with this important debate. Accordingly, this article explores what happens when identity and social affiliation are explicitly defined through clear statements of epistemology and methodology, combining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012458024">Jenkins’s (2000)</xref> concepts of <italic>identification</italic> and <italic>categorization</italic> with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458024">Marks and Thompson’s (2010)</xref> emphasis on <italic>interests</italic> and <italic>identities</italic> and operationalizing this combination through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012458024">Somers’s (1994)</xref> concepts of <italic>narrative identity, emplotment</italic> and <italic>categorization.</italic> Applying this framework to the working life stories of 52 interviewees in Ontario and Nova Scotia, Canada, it is argued that work’s ‘place’, with ‘work’ defined as ‘making a living’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0950017012458024">Watson, 2009</xref>), depends on how identity and social affiliation are understood. This has crucial implications for how findings are received, and to which ends.</p>

<title>The end of work?</title>
<p>For many theorists, the 21st century’s late modern world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012458024">Beck et al., 1994</xref>: 39, 100) is more individualistic than the modern world was. The people in it are ‘<italic>disembedded</italic> from “historically prescribed social forms and commitments”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">Doherty, 2009</xref>: 85). Their lives and biographies are increasingly driven by choices, contingency and risk, and oriented toward the normative goal of ‘responsibility for the self by the self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012458024">Riach and Loretto, 2009</xref>: 114). They are pressed to be reflexive about choices and identit<italic>ies</italic> in light of their newly increased self-responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012458024">Giddens, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Sociologists of work are interested in the implications of these propositions, but many have questioned the magnitude of shifts from past conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012458024">Strangleman, 2007</xref>: 81). The late modern ‘end of work’ thesis in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012458024">Strangleman, 2007</xref>; from here on referring to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012458024">Bauman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012458024">Beck, 1992</xref>, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012458024">Rifkin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012458024">Sennett, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012458024">2005</xref>) – and not to be confused with the ‘death of class’ thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012458024">Atkinson, 2007</xref>) – is a key area of contestation.</p>
<p>In brief, the thesis is that work has ‘lost its position as an axis around which all other attempts at identity-building rotate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">Doherty, 2009</xref>: 85). Underpinning this claim are several smaller hypotheses: that work is increasingly insecure; that it is no longer a way of ‘identifying one’s place in the world’; and that it has lost significance as a ‘locus of social relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">2009</xref>: 86). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">Doherty (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458024">Marks and Baldry (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458024">Parry (2003)</xref> are among the relatively few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0950017012458024">Walkerdine, 2005</xref>: 49–50) who have tested this thesis in micro-level studies of workers and workplaces. But while valuable and insightful, the three advance (at best) very particular or (at worst) axiomatic understandings of identity and social affiliation. Building from these studies, this article starts a conversation about how to explore work, identity and social affiliation with the rigour and depth necessary to arrive at a defensible, if contingent, judgment on the ‘end of work’ thesis and the place of work in contemporary life.</p>

<title>Identity</title>
<p>Many studies of work explore issues of identity and social affiliation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012458024">Ashforth and Kreiner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012458024">Brown et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012458024">Collinson, 2003</xref>) and not all of them can be charged with under-theorizing identity (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012458024">MacDowell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0950017012458024">Walkerdine, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, the focus here is on three recent articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">Doherty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458024">Marks and Baldry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458024">Parry, 2003</xref>) published in this journal which illustrate how epistemological questions about identity are left in a black box in empirical studies of the ‘end of work’ thesis’s claims.</p>
<p>Across separate case studies of four ‘large, unionized organizations’ in Ireland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">Doherty (2009)</xref> interviewed 42 working people about their ‘satisfaction’ with characteristics of their work, ‘perceptions of work intensification and job security’, ‘perceptions of employee voice and involvement in their organizations’ and issues of balance between work, family and leisure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">2009</xref>: 89). Finding that workers were largely ‘satisfied’ with their workplaces, employers and work tasks, ‘committed’ to their jobs and connected to coworkers through networks that ‘spill over’ into non-work time, he concludes that work ‘remains an important source of identity, meaning and social affiliation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">2009</xref>: 84).</p>
<p>The study’s use of qualitative, ‘workplace level’ data to ‘subject to empirical scrutiny the core theoretical propositions of the end of work prophets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">2009</xref>: 89) is laudable, but it attends mainly to work’s ‘meaning’ to research participants, and even this is marginal and underdeveloped. ‘Identity’ is never defined, nor are we told how identities are formed, constructed or ‘found’ in reality. While allotted a space in the article’s title and abstract, ‘identity’ is oddly relegated to two direct references to Beck’s terminology and one early statement about the findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">2009</xref>: 84, 85). It is unclear what either Doherty or Beck mean by ‘identity’, given Doherty’s emphasis on whether or not workers are demonstrably ‘attached’ to their jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">2009</xref>: 95). Finding that workers do not ‘define themselves’ by their work, he maintains that work matters to their identity because they are ‘committed’ to it, insofar as they stay at their jobs willingly for extended periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">2009</xref>: 95). The closest Doherty gets to identity is conflating it with commitment to an employer and enjoyment of a job.</p>
<p>In her study of work restructuring in Welsh coalmining communities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458024">Parry (2003)</xref> comes to the opposite conclusion: paid work is ‘no longer […] a constant and primary factor in identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458024">2003</xref>: 242). She claims to have developed ‘a more relational approach to social identity’, capable of capturing ‘the temporally dynamic, diverse and complicated patterns of lived experience’ in the context of ‘working practices where hierarchical progression within a single workplace is less common’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458024">2003</xref>: 242). Parry does not cite the ‘end of work’ literature defined earlier, but her approach and conclusions are a part of the conversation. The article is littered with the words ‘identity’, ‘social identity’, ‘occupational identity’ and ‘identity formation’, but nowhere are they defined. Nor does Parry explain how identity is formed or accessed in interview data. Although her larger project may have answered these questions, one is left with the nebulous notion that identity is a matter of ‘meaning’, ‘political and community attachments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458024">2003</xref>: 230) and ‘self-understandings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458024">2003</xref>: 240).</p>
<p>In their study of Scottish IT workers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458024">Marks and Baldry (2009)</xref> cite the ‘end of work’ literature, but their primary focus is the ‘death of class’. Unlike Doherty and Parry, the authors define ‘identity’ and relate it to their methods, examining interview data for ‘self-identification’ and asking interviewees to ‘self-locate’ in class structures as perceived by them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458024">2009</xref>: 55). Thus, they offer a specific and theoretically grounded concept of identity, but it is intentionally narrowed to <italic>class</italic> identity. Accordingly, their findings speak to the role of ‘class as a way of self-identification and as an explanatory framework for relative positions in society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458024">2009</xref>: 60), pointing to interesting discrepancies between the class position the workers identified with as individuals and the one they ascribed to their occupation.</p>
<p>None of the three studies, meanwhile, devotes much attention to how identity is defined in late modern theory. There, it emerges as the individual’s ephemeral, multiple and dynamic understanding of his or her ‘place in the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012458024">Bauman, 1998</xref>: 35). In Giddens’s terms, self-identity is ‘the self as reflexively understood by the person in terms of her or his biography’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012458024">1991</xref>: 33), something they seek to make ‘continuous’ through the telling and retelling of biographical narratives. It is the answer to the quotidian late-modern question ‘Who am I?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012458024">1991</xref>: 53). The connection between these theoretical perspectives on identity and the perspectives adopted in the three studies is unclear.</p>

<title>Social affiliation</title>
<p>The concept of social affiliation (or collectivism/cohesion) that <italic>appears</italic> to be at work in these studies is also unconnected to the sense in which the ‘end of work’ literature uses it. Doherty writes ‘social affiliation’ but means social <italic>interaction</italic>: the ‘meeting different people’ at work, ‘social contact with customers’, ‘relationships’ and ‘informal socializ[ation]’ with colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458024">2009</xref>: 91–2) that he argues are still part of the work experience. This claim’s veracity aside, socializing, interacting and just being around people does not capture the wider meaning of ‘social affiliation’ implied in the ‘end of work’ literature. Just as ‘individualization’ does not mean that people become literally <italic>alone</italic>, ‘social affiliation’ is not reducible to the co-presence of individuals.</p>
<p>Parry views social affiliation (‘cohesion’) as <italic>collective</italic> action, identity and interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458024">2003</xref>: 235), but this is grounded in contemporary literature around ‘coalmining communities’, where social affiliation is thinly operationalized as ‘social networks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458024">2003</xref>: 230). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458024">Marks and Baldry (2009)</xref> offer a nuanced concept of ‘collectivism’, including ‘instrumental collectivism’ via professional membership and unions, <italic>perceived</italic> collective interests and statuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458024">2009</xref>: 61) and the ‘collectivism of everyday life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458024">2009</xref>: 53; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0950017012458024">Stephenson and Stewart, 2001</xref>). But these perspectives neglect an important aspect of the ‘end of work’ literature’s engagement with social affiliation. More than a decline in collective bargaining, camaraderie at work or mutual support at the macro level, it is about a weakening or increasingly <italic>obfuscated</italic> connection between the work we do and the relationships of interdependence that structure the world. It warns of the creation of people who are unlikely or unable to see themselves as social beings. Beck makes this clear, arguing that in a late modern ‘Individualized Society of Employees’,
<disp-quote>
<p>social problems are increasingly perceived in terms of psychological dispositions: as personal inadequacies, guilt feelings, anxieties, conflicts, and neuroses. […] Social crises appear as individual crises, which are no longer (or are only very indirectly) perceived in terms of their rootedness in the social realm. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012458024">1992</xref>: 99–100)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The worry here is that if social problems are defined as personal (or ‘indirectly’ social, i.e. interpersonal) and if people internalize the late modern ‘responsibility for the self by the self’, then social relationships are increasingly divested of mutual responsibility and obligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012458024">Bauman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012458024">Giddens, 1991</xref>: 33). This concern is markedly different from those tested by the studies discussed here. Thankfully, there is a wealth of available theory from which to develop a different approach, some of it emerging from the sociology of work.</p>

<title>Theoretical resources</title>
<p>Reviewing decades of literature on identity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017012458024">Tajfel, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017012458024">1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0950017012458024">Turner, 1985</xref>) and work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458024">Marks and Thompson (2010)</xref> argue for attention to identities <italic>and</italic> interests, and a framework that holds both in focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458024">2010</xref>: 322). Their rationale is that ‘interests are a hidden script in identity explanations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458024">2010</xref>: 332), ‘are fundamental’ to explanations of work-related behaviours and along with identity are essential components of subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458024">2010</xref>: 332–3). They draw in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012458024">Jenkins’s (2000)</xref> concepts of <italic>categorization</italic> and <italic>identification</italic>, which are presented here as helpful conceptual scaffolding for researchers interested in exploring identity and interests at work.</p>
<p>For Jenkins, identification is the process whereby people locate and understand themselves as parts of larger groups. Categorization is the external process whereby people see and categorize others and are in turn seen and categorized. The two are mutually influencing and referential, but social theorists sometimes neglect one or the other. Jenkins’s distinction speaks to the divergences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458024">Marks and Baldry (2009)</xref> found between individual and occupational class identity, because it captures how categorization into class shapes ‘latent’ interests, but identification is necessary for those interests to be recognized and class status internalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458024">Marks and Thompson, 2010</xref>: 324). This distinction acknowledges class as a driver of identity but allows that work might shape and be shaped by identity in ways that are not recognizably classed or class-based.</p>
<p>Turning again to social affiliation, a well documented decline in trade unionism in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012458024">Jackson, 2010</xref>: 225), beginning in the 1980s in Canada, means that old tools and concepts for capturing collective action and interests around work are no longer entirely accurate. Sociologists faced with the task of identifying collectivism’s new form(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012458024">McBride, 2006</xref>) have acknowledged that contemporary collectivism <italic>can</italic> be union-based, but other forms proliferate – for example, ‘workplace collectivism’ involving simple supportive relationships between workers at work, or the ‘collectivism of everyday life’ where those supportive relationships extend beyond the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012458024">Ackroyd and Thompson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012458024">McBride, 2006</xref>: 584). But even these multi-faceted conceptualizations of worker collectivism focus attention on the workplace as the collectivity that matters most, when people, by virtue of living in the world, belong to bigger, supra-workplace collectivities, social groups and social categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012458024">Jenkins, 2000</xref>), in ways that are nonetheless connected to how they ‘make a living’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0950017012458024">Watson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As argued above, the ‘end of work’ literature is concerned with these wider forms of social affiliation and the erosion of ‘commitment and loyalty’ giving way to enforced non-dependence and temporality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012458024">Sennett, 2005</xref>). The worry, again, is that contemporary ‘explanations of our social problems […] have in common […] the notion that our problems are individual or in only a narrow sense social (that is, involving family and local community), rather than economic, political and cultural’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012458024">Bellah et al., 2006</xref>: xxxi). Doherty has found this ‘narrow sense’ of the social in contemporary workplaces, and others have ‘mapped’ the contours of workplace collectivism involving mutual support between workers in and out of unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012458024">McBride, 2006</xref>), but not much empirical research has scrutinized work as a locus of the wider ‘economic, political and cultural’ social affiliation Bellah and Sennett lament. While care must be taken to resist romanticizing a past that never was (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012458024">Strangleman, 2007</xref>), it is urgent that we explore the possibility that this wider sense of social affiliation – peoples’ sense of their interdependence in a ‘bigger picture’ – is under threat in contemporary work arrangements and experiences.</p>
<p>Yet, we are left with the question of how to ‘get at’ an individual’s identity and sense of social affiliation empirically – a question demonstrably under-scrutinized in extant studies of work. The identification question ‘Who to be?’ and the categorization question ‘Where do I belong?’ may well be ‘daily’ ones for late modern people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012458024">Giddens, 1991</xref>: 70), but they do not <italic>literally</italic> go around asking themselves who they are and where they fit. The researcher interested in these questions must find them articulated in other ways. One possible approach to doing so is in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012458024">Somers’s (1994)</xref> work on ‘narrative identity’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0950017012458024" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodological resources</title>
<p>‘Narrative identity’ rests on the argument that narrative, more than just a mode of representation, is an ‘<italic>ontological condition of social life</italic>’: through it, we come to know our social worlds and our <italic>selves</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012458024">Somers, 1994</xref>: 614). As Somers explains, ‘all of us come to be who we are (however ephemeral, multiple and changing) by being located or locating ourselves (usually unconsciously) in social narratives rarely of our own making’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012458024">1994</xref>: 614), a process she calls emplotment. As an ‘ontological condition’, narrative identity is an internal, daily, ongoing process connected to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458024">Archer’s (2009)</xref> ‘internal conversations’, but it is arguably made visible, albeit imperfectly and ‘unnaturally’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0950017012458024">Speer, 2002</xref>), in the narratives constructed in research interview settings. Somers hints at how to see emplotment in narrative in the course of distinguishing it from its sibling concept, the now familiar term of ‘categorization’. Drawing an example from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0950017012458024">Polkinghorne (1988)</xref>, she writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Polkinghorne implicitly addresses the difference between emplotment and categorization when he notes that social actions should not be viewed as a result of categorizing oneself (‘I am 40 years old; I should buy life insurance’) but should be seen to emerge in the context of a life-story with episodes (‘I felt out of breath last week, I really should start thinking about life insurance’). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012458024">Somers, 1994</xref>: 614)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This emplotment/categorization binary is strikingly similar to the identification/categorization distinction in Jenkins’s work, and the analysis below takes this similarity and runs with it. It ‘sees’ narrative identity construction in statements of categorization (‘I am’/‘I was’) as well as in emplotment (plots constructing and conveying the self without explicitly existential language). Emplotment is taken as the narrative manifestation of identification, and is assumed to work with categorization in the construction and articulation of identity. Social affiliation is operationalized as overlapping with identity, again ‘visible’ in emplotment and categorization, but with an added sensitivity to statements about belonging, reciprocity, contributions and rewards at the workplace level and beyond.</p>

<title>Working life stories</title>
<p>Beginning in November 2009, 52 people in Ontario (Ottawa and Toronto) and Nova Scotia (Halifax), Canada, were interviewed for a sociological study of work: 30 women and 22 men, aged 25 to 86, with a roughly even distribution of age groups in each gender. The majority of respondents (N=39) were white, Canadian-born and anglophone. There were manual labourers, trades people, business people, artists, writers, professionals, students, stay-at-home parents, unemployed job-seekers and retail workers, working and retired, full- and part-time. Over the course of their lives, they had been (among many other things) models, cashiers, ranch-hands, high-profile marketing consultants, CEOs, motel maids and lifeguards. The aim was to achieve a sample with maximum variability of age and occupation, the broader objective being to construct a sample diverse enough to support a search for commonalities (in experiences and stories) that extended across other differences and divisions.</p>
<p>There are many important ways in which the intersections of occupational categories with gender, ethnicity, locale and age matter. There is also much to be gleaned from setting these narratives in the context of Canada in 2009, given political shifts toward neo-liberalism at the Federal level and the demonstrated relative ‘stability’ of the Canadian economy during the global financial recession of 2008. For the purposes of making this article’s argument, these details do not get the attention they deserve.</p>
<p>Interviewees were found through posters in community centres, social networks, direct contact and a community newspaper ad and article. Recruitment targeted the intentionally broad population of people who work(ed) for a living and wanted to talk about the role work played in their lives. Most interviews took just over one hour, and revolved around the participant’s ‘working life story’, elicited through an unstructured interview approach with minimal prompting. All were transcribed, coded and analysed using the analytical software <italic>Atlas.ti</italic> and half were also fed into the oral data analysis program <italic>Stories Matter</italic>, which allows researchers to analyse and code data without losing its orality through transcription (only half, because of the otherwise helpful software’s analytical limitations).</p>

<title>Work and identity</title>
<sec id="section9-0950017012458024">
<title>Emplotment and categorization</title>
<p>The narrative interview method meant that every participant was engaged in emplotment – locating himself or herself in narrative(s) – and every plot conveyed a particular identity. Given that participants knew that the study’s focus was work, the fact that all plots revolved around work is not surprising or particularly meaningful. However, the way work and identity came together in these plots is telling.</p>
<p>In a large proportion (N=15) plots centred on a contrast between how ‘other people’ approach work and how ‘I’ approach it. These narratives were clearly meant to persuade the listener that the narrator was/is a different kind of person, out of step with most others. The example of 41-year-old Jake supports this point well. Telling about his entrance into the working world, he said:
<disp-quote>
<p>I went – studied illustration. I was told – everyone told me you can’t make a living as an artist. I grew up outside of Windsor. And um, my high school teachers, my art teachers, friends and family – nobody knew an artist. It wasn’t even a possibility. I actually got accepted for business in university and I – I ripped it up before I showed anybody including my parents. I just realized, after high school I realized I can’t – this is just not for me.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Right away, Jake advanced a version of his working life story that highlights its divergence with ‘everyone’ else. Several similar subplots were woven in: the time he refused on the basis of artistic integrity to paint an art collector’s name on a painting, thereby risking a $9600 sale; the friends who worked desk jobs ‘they hate’ to afford houses and cars. These stories, many of them rooted in work, depicted Jake as a ‘black sheep’ whose approach to making a living challenged convention.</p>
<p>Raymond, a 42-year-old lawyer, also drew attention to the ‘acts of heresy’ scattered throughout his otherwise straightforward career, constructing his narrative around instances where he went against the grain. For example, he was accepted to a prestigious law programme and an inferior one and he accepted the inferior offer. Later, while working at one firm, he was offered a higher paying job at a higher-profile firm, but he refused the offer. ‘It was kind of one of those, one of those odd moments’, he explained, but ‘the prospect of a little bit more money just wasn’t that [important] in the grand scheme of things.’ He recalled that ‘the other firm was dumbfounded’ by his response – a common theme among ‘black sheep’ narratives: irreverence for money and other conventional markers of career success.</p>
<p>While this narrative was never explicitly connected to class, its users were undeniably among the most educated, mobile participants – people who resembled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012458024">Calhoun’s (2003)</xref> ‘cosmopolitan elite’. They all felt secure enough, financially and psychologically, to withstand the uncertainty of freelance work or turn down higher paying but less fulfilling jobs. Bettina, for example, was 31 and piecing together contracts as a photographer and technical writer. She fit the profile of ‘precariously employed’, lacking the benefits or stability associated with ‘standard’ employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0950017012458024">Vosko, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0950017012458024">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0950017012458024">2010</xref>), but she was also highly mobile, had post-secondary education and was eking out a comfortable living. Like Jake and Raymond, she contrasted her approach to working and earning with others, but she pointed specifically to her parents, Korean immigrants to Canada. ‘This will have relevance’, she said, describing how she watched her parents work almost around the clock as a young girl and was brought in to their store (as ‘child labour’, she joked) to work at an early age. Reflecting on her varied career up to the present, she surmised that her trajectory was shaped by her ‘minimalist approach’ to ‘kind of a day-to-day sort of existence and making sure that I’m enjoying what I do when I wake up in the morning’ – something she ‘didn’t see’ with her parents, whom she thought were ‘more concerned about money and making sure you’re settled in the end.’</p>
<p>In other (N=12) narratives, the pursuit of conventional success was at the centre of the plot and the narrator was located therein as driven, agential and rational. For example, 56-year-old Phoebe, retired from the Canadian Navy, laid the narrative foundation for her steady career advancement to the major ‘storyline’ (her word) running through her childhood house:
<disp-quote>
<p>My grandmother on my mother’s side was the only one of my grandparents who did not go to university. She apparently went to a finishing school. When she was in her mid to late 30s, her husband died of appendicitis. She had no marketable skills. He had an insurance policy, and that’s what they lived on. And basically it was running out just about the time she died … She had two daughters and a son, in that order – she was adamant – <italic>adamant</italic> – that the girls would go to university and that they would be able to support themselves, whether they needed to or not.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Phoebe’s drive to ‘keep moving up’ in the ranks and her narrative identity as a purposeful, stubborn and ‘hardworking’ person was thus established in a narrative running back to the stories she heard as a child. Olive, a 30-year-old art restorer, told a similarly deterministic narrative. She had more or less the career she expected to have after taking a high school aptitude test. ‘On the list that I got back … there was art restorer’, she recalled. ‘And I – I had never heard of such a thing so I looked it up and thought, “Yeah, you know, I might actually want to do that.”’ The rest of her story was a linear one, proceeding from co-op placements to post-secondary training to an apprenticeship and through to her present job. She had what other researchers call a strong ‘professional identity’, taking a personal stake in the goals and future of the profession. Other examples of this type of emplotment abound, but space is limited. The point is established, however, that there is value in examining work and identity through the lens of emplotment and narrative identity.</p>
<p>Identity also appeared in accounts of conscious, in-the-moment categorizations. In some cases, the reference category was age. For example, Lila, 25 and starting a second degree in environmental conservation, recalled a point where she thought of becoming a naturopathic doctor. Once she realized it would mean starting her own practice, she changed her mind. ‘I decided I was too young to get my head in that far’, she explained, ‘so I went back to [university] and finished my BSc, and then I went with that for a couple years and took some different jobs.’ Lila’s ‘self-categorization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0950017012458024">Turner, 1985</xref>) as a young person guided her away from a work choice that would get her ‘head in’ further than a young person should.</p>
<p>But more commonly, categorization in statements of ‘who I am’ revolved not around hard ontological categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012458024">Somers, 1994</xref>) such as age, race, class and gender, but around idiosyncratic facets of personalities, abilities, interests and character. For example, 58-year-old Nicole remembered how, before becoming a librarian, she ‘sabotaged’ a job interview with a large bank, because she was and is ‘a very political person’, and she ‘felt like I would be entering the evil empire’. As a librarian she turned down later promotions to administrative positions because, as a ‘political person’, she ‘wouldn’t have lasted a day in that regime’. Helen, a 69-year-old bed and breakfast owner, chalked her unconventional career, and the lack of any high-status jobs or real career progression therein, up to being a ‘down to earth’ person who would rather ‘have a good meal, have people over, have a few laughs, listen to nice music’ instead of having an ‘intellectual’ conversation with ‘the Prime Minister’. Sixty-year-old William made sense of his commitment to his job (and the fact that he had no children) by categorizing himself as a ‘workaholic’, 86-year-old Corbin attributed his business success to being a ‘man of his word’ and Mary, 35, felt she was a good worker, but also susceptible to burnouts, because she had always been ‘a perfectionist’.</p>
<p>Stacey, who was nearing retirement from her government job at 54, felt she had never been able to ‘be who she is’ at work. ‘My first desire would be to be home, and that’s where I wanna be’, she admitted, adding: ‘not because I don’t like the workplace because the workplace offers something different but I’m very domestic.’ Like several others, she felt like a ‘fraud’ at work, which points to the importance people place on categorizations rooted in personality and idiosyncrasy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0950017012458024">Walkerdine, 2005</xref>). Identity-as-personality either fits with a job or not, and the degree of fit <italic>matters</italic> to people day-to-day and in the grand scheme of lives and careers. For example, Maia, a 36-year-old bookstore owner, described how she tried to ‘fit’ into a conventional, ‘nine to five’ job:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’d wished that I could be like that – that I had, you know that I could just find that nine to five job and be happy with it already? But it just, it wasn’t in me. I couldn’t find it. My family was wishing for it, everyone was you know ‘come on already’ and I thought it’s just not who I am but I don’t know how to resolve that, ’cause the world’s not really designed for people like me. But I - but strangely enough I think there’s a few people out there like that and they don’t, you know, I’ve had a few conversations, you know like, ‘What do you do?’</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Maia’s ‘black sheep’ narrative shows how identity comes into sharp relief when work makes people feel <italic>inauthentic</italic>, and it is clear that interviewees sought to avoid this feeling. Ginger, a 34-year-old office manager, found a way to make a living in a conventional job without sacrificing who she was. She said her fixed schedule allowed her to commit more fully to her extra-work interests – gardening, canning food and reading – all of which fed into the identity she constructed in her narrative. ‘My role as office manager doesn’t define me as who I am’, she explained. ‘That’s just one little part. I have all of this stuff that I don’t get paid for, and that’s where my vocation is – what my call is.’ For Ginger and others (N=8), fit or ‘authenticity’ revolved around who participants thought they were, not as women or middle-class or Lebanese people, for example, but as individuals with unique personalities, interests and, as will be discussed next, values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0950017012458024">
<title>Work to believe in</title>
<p>The issue of authenticity at work brings to light an important aspect of identity through emplotment and categorization: the conspicuous absence of articulated <italic>interests.</italic> Instead, when speaking about the fit between their work and their identity, interviewees tended to bring up values. And like other aspects of identity, values were narrativized through both emplotment and categorization. When 53-year-old carpenter Bob said he would have gone to university if he could have, he was asked if he thought he would ‘be a different person’ if he had gone. ‘Not in the sense of what I value’, Bob said, ‘but the expression would be different.’ In other words, Bob felt a basic, consistent sense of who he was, and the stabilizing, continuous thread was ‘what I value’. The latter was linked to his self-categorization as ‘Christian’, but also constructed through a particular narrative plot, wherein Bob was ‘called’ to be a carpenter, his life was oriented toward ‘giving back’ and the health and well-being of his family guided his career decisions.</p>
<p>In telling the story about refusing to alter a painting for a high-paying customer, Jake also linked values and identity, describing how he confronted, at that moment, troubling and overwhelming questions about ‘who he was’ and what he valued, asking himself:
<disp-quote>
<p>What – who are you? Are you just – and this was going through my mind like a roller coaster – are you doing this just to sell it? Is it just all about money? Which you’ve always prided yourself on not painting to sell? And it was a real test, and it was a real, it was like, OK, here you go buddy – what are you gonna do?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0950017012458024">
<title>Find yourself, find your career</title>
<p>This conscious reflection on identity-and-work questions, revolving primarily around individualized values and personality, appears to be socially and culturally encouraged. Many participants said that ‘knowing oneself’ was a prerequisite to finding ‘the right’ career, but knowing the self always came down to ‘looking inside’ rather than coming to understand oneself as a part of something larger. Reflecting on the work patterns of her same-age friends, graphic artist Alice, 29, said, ‘I think there’s a lot in the sort of society and our parents’ generation saying to us, you know, “You should go to school, and find out who you are and what you really want to do.”’ Jake corroborated this when asked what advice he would give to young people today, answering: ‘Figure out what’s inside.’ This theme emerged in at least 10 interviews and the message from it is clear: identity is seen as something discovered and found through introspection and the sheer experience of living a life, a process that is highly individualized and seemingly devoid of considerations of ascribed, ‘hard’ social categorizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012458024">Jenkins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012458024">Somers, 1994</xref>) like gender, ethnicity and class.</p>

<title>Work and social affiliation</title>
<sec id="section13-0950017012458024">
<title>The bigger picture</title>
<p>Identifying with a ‘bigger picture’ (organizational or beyond), through identification, belonging and reciprocity, was important and central to people’s working life stories. Terms like ‘contribution’, ‘the greater good’ and ‘big picture’ appeared frequently in participants’ working life stories without any prodding. For example, 60-year-old William concluded his working life story by saying, ‘I am satisfied with my contribution, over all.’ The 25-year-old Lila touched on a similar theme, admitting, ‘I kind of went through this self-indulgent period where I needed to do things just for me. Now I’ve come to a place where I want to contribute to society in a positive way.’ The 30-year-old Emmett said he was looking for a career that would put him in service of ‘a bigger picture’. However, participants who reflected social affiliation beyond the organization (N=12) also worried about having a negative impact on society through their work. Some, like Ken, confronted the difficult truth that their work could harm distant others. About his job as a civilian engineer in the defence industry, he said,
<disp-quote>
<p>What my work does for the rest of the world? … At times, I mean uh … I think about uh, I think about the end result if the weapons were ever fired in anger. Yeah. Or, you know, if we were ever doing something other than just trials – tests and trials. Yeah it would have a serious impact on a number of people … But I don’t think about it – whether I’m contributing to the greater good … I mean, that’s my work, I work in a war-mongering field, I mean that’s it. But it’s not offensive or defensive. It’s to protect people like you, in the big scheme overall. I’m still supporting that ideal; I’m helping that in some way. But if you want to follow the missile to where it ends up … it’s not a pretty picture.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Ken was conflicted, seeing the potential for his job to make the world better and safer, but recognizing that it made the world more dangerous too. Alice, the 29-year-old graphic artist, literally stumbled upon a similar paradox in the street:
<disp-quote>
<p>When you’re in school that’s sort of what you talk about [your impact on the world]. Then when you get in the world, you sort of put that a little bit behind you, not that it’s um, I mean it’s almost more internalized than something you think about consciously. But you do think about it … I remember the first time I ever did a cover on [magazine] and I would start to see it like, as garbage, and that was like a weird sort of like ‘Oh, I just created a whole bunch of garbage’ … all these sort of throw-away things … but it’s also exciting when you see your stuff.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Seeing her designs littered on the ground meant confronting ambivalent feelings: excitement, having created something people looked at and consumed, and guilt, having created ‘garbage’. Ken and Alice openly described the rationalizing they did in order to feel comfortable with their work, or admitted ‘not thinking about’ difficult questions. Other interviewees (N=6) sought to <italic>balance</italic> their potentially negative impacts – or their non-impacts – by ‘giving back’ outside work, presenting those contributions prominently in their narratives.</p>
<p>For example, 51-year-old Penny said she would ‘sometimes wonder’ about ‘the value for society’ of her administrative job at a software developer. Her solution was to look for ways to ‘give back’ <italic>at</italic> work, but not really <italic>through</italic> her work. ‘I go back to my – to my company and say, “What could we do to give back?”’ she explained. ‘There are very small things we can do’, she continued, describing how she had collected money for charities or tweaked the company’s recycling system. She maintained that ‘individually it’s really up to me to give back because I’ve really got so much’.</p>
<p>Other interviewees highlighted contributions to a ‘greater good’ which mainly served people who already had wealth and power. The business people interviewed (N=3) provide the best examples of this, because they equated ‘good for business’ with ‘good for society’ so that business goals of competitiveness, profit and efficiency were treated in their narratives as social goals too (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012458024">Ezzy, 2001</xref>). Considering his impact on the world, Corbin, an 86-year-old retired businessman, stood up from his chair and walked around his grand living room. ‘Do you know who this is?’ he asked, pointing to a picture of himself with the King of Spain. His impact was measured in his documented involvement in the cadre of people who rule the world. Marsha, the 55-year-old businesswoman, described how in her spare time she sat on ‘a number of not-for-profit boards’ and was the president of an exclusive, invitation-only country club for wealthy people. Asked if she thought about the value of her work to society, she responded,
<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah, I guess I’ve always felt a sense of responsibility to Canadian retail, in that I wanted to see them do better, be more efficient, and more competitive … I really would like to see excellence prevail.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>She described using ‘[business] skills to bring profit and benefit to the not-for-profit sector as well’, listing instances where she threw her weight as a known commodity in the business world to secure financing for non-profits. Pointing to her work at the country club, she described using her ‘marketing skills to improve the benefits of the club and the members and make it more profitable so that our fees don’t go up!’</p>
<p>Among those who lacked this access to wealth, prestige and luxury, there was no corresponding, alternative notion of the greater good oriented toward <italic>their</italic> collective interests (a stronger welfare state, lower cost of living, workers’ rights, or a better redistribution of wealth). Rather, people who worked at manual labour jobs – like 50-year-old pipe-fitter Roy or 86-year-old Victor, retired from working the lines with a power company – or in low-level administrative and service jobs – like 57-year-old office assistant Angela or 28-year-old hotel clerk Marcus – seemed to share a ‘job’s a job’ mentality. Very little consideration was given to work as a social contribution (as Angela said, ‘I do it as a contribution to myself’). The obligation to work was framed as the individual supporting him or herself so no one else had to, a cultural discourse that has been identified by other scholars as quintessentially late modern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012458024">Riach and Loretto, 2009</xref>: 114) and, importantly, neoliberal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0950017012458024">Walkerdine, 2005</xref>; for conflicting findings, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012458024">Ashforth and Kreiner, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>These participants were inclined to see their struggles in individualistic or fatalistic terms or as ‘only in a narrow sense social’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012458024">Bellah et al., 2006</xref>: xxxi). Those who had experienced a layoff (N=4) each accepted it as ‘just business’. They said they understood their employer’s need to meet financial targets, took their severance if it was offered and looked for work elsewhere. Among all interviewees, mistreatment at work – such as bullying on the part of bosses – was understood in personality-conflict terms, and interviewees who experienced it reacted by looking for another job. Dan, a 41-year-old public servant who was on the verge of ‘burnout’ from increasing demands and the challenge of raising young children in a dual-earner family, was also planning to find a different job. The near-impossibility of balancing two careers was framed as a personal problem, solved by a personal decision to ‘take a step backwards’ on the career ladder.</p>
<p>Only Andriy, a 40-year-old former welder and now a Buddhist monk, placed his own work struggles (an illegal firing, missing pay cheques) in the structural context that made them possible: ‘the capitalist system’, a ‘mechanism’ with ‘no heart and no abstract thinking’. But although he saw his struggle in cultural/economic terms, Andriy ultimately resorted to an individualistic solution: having done the ‘experiment’ of ’10 years in Canada’, he returned to his monk’s life. ‘I love working, for my friends, as a trade’, he said.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am energetic enough, I fill every extra minute I have, I do something with my hands … But it’s so unfair, it’s criminal and illegal, the labour market reality in Toronto that I cannot allow to spend any more time of my life to be involved in that … I try to be a kind person and I try to care about other people and be somewhat charitable but not this way.</p>

<title>Reflections on the ‘end of work’</title>
<p>The analysis above highlights the importance of how identity and social affiliation are conceptualized, a tricky matter in empirical research. While the researcher cannot wait for participants to say, explicitly, ‘This is who I am’, or ‘This is where I fit’, they also cannot presume that everything participants say about work’s ‘meaning’ or ‘significance’ or their ‘commitment’ to it is relevant to the question of identity or social affiliation – not without a serious conceptual thread holding it all together. Here, the concepts of narrative identity, emplotment, identification and categorization were offered as a way to ‘get at’ identity and social affiliation without overstretching or limiting either concept too much.</p>
<p>Viewing identity as constituted through categorization and emplotment, we see that identity was understood in the individualistic language of personality and introspection over and above the socially conscious language of the sociological imagination. This is despite evidence that class, gender and ethnicity had bearing on participants’ working lives – a finding that supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012458024">Goffman’s (1961)</xref> elegant insight that ‘Our status is backed up by the solid buildings of the world, while our sense of personal identity often resides in the cracks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012458024">1961</xref>: 320). The persistent, pseudo-psychological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0950017012458024">Walkerdine, 2005</xref>) view of identity as originating ‘inside’ suggests that people lack an alternative vocabulary capable of articulating the unequal distribution of jobs that ‘fit’. These discursive blind spots have political-economic consequences, propping up a dominant culture of individualism where class, gender and ethnicity matter, but go unacknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0950017012458024">Walkerdine, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As for social affiliation, the concepts of belonging, contributions and rewards revealed how many interviewees framed work as a responsibility to themselves and their dependents only. But it is possible to see support of the self by the self as a twisted, yet understandable, interpretation of ‘social contribution’ for people for whom ‘a job’s a job’. That is, not being a burden to a larger group might seem like the best thing a person can do if they feel they lack the resources or skills to contribute something positive. Unfortunately, this is the very same individualistic view of work and earning used by governments and elites to advocate dismantling the welfare state. Indeed, the ‘freedom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0950017012458024">Walkerdine, 2005</xref>) with which people could locate themselves in personal and social narratives meant that ‘the greater good’ and ‘social contributions’ were adaptable to the individual’s interests and possibilities, even if the latter went unacknowledged (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012458024">Bellah et al., 2006</xref>: 6). This may be liberating to the individual, but it can also reinforce structural inequality.</p>
<p>These social and political-economic consequences of the complicated intersections of identity, work and social affiliation are brought to light through epistemological clarity and theoretically informed methods. Approaching these questions through the concepts of narrative emplotment and categorization, and attending to the way social affiliation is understood by those who lament its decline, it can be seen how the vocabulary of individualism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012458024">Bellah et al., 2006</xref>) can obscure the social in sociologists’ own work as much as it does in the narratives of their research participants.</p>
