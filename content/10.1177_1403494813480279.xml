<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Changes in population patterns, lifestyle, and length of life have led to changed patterns of disease and an increase of chronic diseases. The treatment philosophy has changed accordingly, from patients as passive recipients of care to a more active and responsible patient role. A strong focus on medication governed by health professionals has also changed towards a combination of medication, dialogue, user participation and mobilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813480279">1</xref>]. This development towards user participation and patient responsibility has strengthened the focus on and interest for patient education. Education programmes have been pointed out as important to improve patients’ health and strengthen their self-management skills to handle chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813480279">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Together with a stronger focus on the informed and active patient, many different concepts and theories have been used to describe this activation of the patients, including coping, self-management, self-efficacy and self-care. One of these concepts is patient activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813480279">3</xref>]. Hibbard and colleagues have argued that patient activation encompasses the complexity of the active patient, and thus includes various behaviours related to self-efficacy, self-management and behavioural change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813480279">4</xref>]. They have developed a questionnaire to measure patient activation across multiple diagnoses that covers a broad range of elements that are important for activation: knowledge, skills, beliefs and actual behaviour. Low patient activation describes the patient as a passive recipient of health care, while high activation describes a proactive and engaged patient who acts according to recommended health-behaviour advice. The degree of activation thus encompasses how well patients cope with their health problems. Cross-sectional studies using the Patient Activation questionnaire (PAM) have added to the empirical evidence of patient activation and coping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813480279">3</xref>]. High patient activation has been found to be connected to many health outcomes and positive health behaviours, such as appropriate use of health services and improved self-management of chronic diseases. Patient activation is thus a useful tool to evaluate patients’ benefit from participating in education programme.</p>
<p>A substantial amount of research has been done on patient education programmes. Studies have previously shown that patient education programmes have effects on physical outcomes such as pain and blood sugar measurements, on patients’ knowledge and on some psychological aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813480279">2</xref>]. Programmes have also been shown to lead to behavioural changes such as life style changes and improved treatment adherence. Research has generally focused on physical outcomes, and less on psychological outcomes and the processes of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813480279">2</xref>]. The total effect from patient education programmes is therefore multifaceted and complex, and studies investigating the effect usually focus on the totality of the programme and not the different elements or components. In addition, many effect studies have inadequately descriptions of form and content of the education programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813480279">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Very few studies have investigated which elements in an education programme lead to positive outcomes. This makes it difficult to evaluate the different elements in educational programmes in order to conduct more targeted and effective patient education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813480279">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813480279">5</xref>]. There is some evidence that certain aspects of educational programmes might lead to improved outcomes, that is, social learning techniques and various therapeutic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813480279">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, the possible link between different educational approaches and patient outcomes is unclear and warrants further research. Investigations of the relationship between specific components of education programmes and the degree of patient activation after the programme would provide more knowledge on which programme elements might lead to better coping overall. The aim of this study was therefore to describe the content of several educational programmes, and to investigate the connection between specific components of the programmes and the effect on the participants’ coping skills.</p>

<sec id="section2-1403494813480279" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study is based on two surveys, one on the effect of patient education and one on the content of educational programmes. The first part was a prospective observational study, where adults participating in educational programmes filled out questionnaires before and 4 months after the programme. In the second part, the leaders of the educational programmes completed questionnaires about the content of the programmes. The data collection was conducted from September 2006 to September 2010. The regional committee for medical ethics in Central Norway approved the study.</p>
<sec id="section3-1403494813480279">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The participants included the group leaders of 35 education programmes for 24 different diagnoses/problems and a total of 443 patients participating in the programmes. The different programmes are described more in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813480279">Table I</xref>. The study included locally developed education programmes which were conducted in a naturalistic setting according to each hospital’s local policy. All programmes were included in this study regardless of diagnosis group, organization, educational methods or programme content.</p>

<title>Questionnaires</title>
<p>To measure the participants’ coping skills, the instrument Patient Activation Measure (PAM) was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813480279">6</xref>]. The questionnaire measures knowledge, ability and skills to cope with health and health service use. The PAM questionnaire has good psychometric properties, and is a highly reliable, valid, unidimentional scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813480279">4</xref>]. The scale involves the development of activation which includes four steps: believing that the patient role is important, having the necessary confidence and knowledge, taking action to maintain and improve health, and keeping up this work during stress. The validated Norwegian version of PAM was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813480279">7</xref>]. The changes in PAM score from before the programme to 4 months afterwards was recalculated to effect size (calculated as the change in score from baseline to follow-up divided by the average of the standard deviation for the two measurement times) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813480279">8</xref>]. The reason for doing this was that there exists no cut-off value for the clinical relevant change in PAM score. The effect size was dichotomized and good coping was classified as an effect size &gt; 0.5 which equals a moderate effect.</p>
<p>A questionnaire for describing the content of educational programmes was developed by a comprehensive work group which used Deming’s circle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813480279">9</xref>], The Didactical Relationship Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813480279">10</xref>], and the quality assurance system in one of the participating hospitals. Deming’s circle is a tool for continuous quality control and improvement of processes and products. The Didactical Relationship Model is often used when planning education programmes. The model encompasses a dynamic view of the education process where several factors (learners’ previous qualifications, resources and limitations, goals, content, work approach and evaluation) are considered. The work group consisted of researchers on patient education and professionals who had extensive experience of working in patient education programmes. This group met several times to evaluate and develop the questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed further after evaluation by a group of researchers and after being tested by both experienced and inexperienced programme leaders. The final questionnaire included questions about the participants in the programme (diagnosis group, number of participants), how the programme was organized (number of hours, number of meetings, number of days between first and last meeting, funding, referral routines), educational methods (user participation, lectures and/or group discussions, focus on theory, teaching personnel), goals, themes, the programme leader’s evaluation of the programme as a whole, and the programme leader’s evaluation of the participants’ activity level during the programme. The final questions had predefined alternatives for answers. In addition it was possible to write extra comments to some of the questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494813480279">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Programme content was analyzed using descriptive statistics and analysis of frequencies and results are reported as median, range, interquartile range (IQR) and proportions (%). The associations between programme content and effect on coping was analysed using bivariate (Pearson’s chi quadrate) and multivariate (logistic regression) analyses. Dependent variable was the degree of improved coping skills (changes in PAM score equivalent to effect size &gt; 0.5). Independent variables with a <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.2 in the bivariate analyses were included in the multivariate analyses. All continuous variables were recoded into groups and analysed as categorical variables. A significance level of 0.05 was chosen and a <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.1 was considered a trend. Data was analysed using SPSS for Windows, version 18 (SPSS INC., Chicago, IL).</p>

<title>The content of locally developed educational programmes</title>
<p>The content of 35 different educational programmes provided for 24 different patient groups is described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813480279">Table I</xref>. Out of these 35 programmes, six (17.1 %) had only female participants, two (5.7 %) had participants with multicultural backgrounds, and 25 (71.4 %) included both patients and next of kin.</p>
<p>The average number of participants per programme was median 9 (range 4–28, IQR 7–12). The average programme lasted median 12 hours (range 7–48, IQR 11–15), had median 2 meetings (range 1–12, IQR 2–3) and maximum median 5 days between first and last meeting (range 0–400, IQR 1.25–40.25). The educational programme was provided in groups only (67.6%) or as a combination of group and individual education (32.3 %). Most programmes used lectures (97.1%), exchange of experience, and group discussions (94.3%), while group work (34.3%) and skills training (31.4%) were less used. Service users participated in planning (82.9%), implementation (77.1%), and evaluation (68.6%) of the programmes.</p>
<p>Participants were mainly referred to the programmes by their general practitioners (74.3%), three quarters of the education was documented in interdisciplinary medical records (71.4%) and epicrisis was sent to the referring doctor in six out of 10 programmes (57.1%). Ten (28.6%) of the programmes was described in the hospital’s quality system.</p>
<p>Improved coping with disease (94.3%) and improved disease knowledge (85.7%) were the most common goal of the educational programmes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813480279">Table II</xref>). Educators were mainly health personnel. Medical doctors taught in 80% of the programmes and were present on average 2 hours per programme, while medical nurses taught in 60% and were present on average 16 hours. Other health personnel groups participating were physiotherapists, dieticians, social workers, occupational therapy and welfare case workers. Several programmes used specialized personnel chosen for the specific patient group, such as urotherapists in programmes for patients with urine incontinence and audiometrists for programmes for patients with hearing problems.</p>

<p>One hundred and thirteen (25.5%) participants had clinically relevant improved patient activation 4 months after the programme (effect size &gt; 0.5). The results from the comparison of some of the variables and the effect on activation in the bivariate analyses are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813480279">Table II</xref>. Programmes that lasted less than 12 hours in total had a statistically significant better effect on activation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.020). Programmes with 5 or fewer days between the meetings had significantly better effect on activation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.052). Having pauses during the programme also influenced the effect (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003). There were no significant relationships between the effect on patient activation and the participants’ age, gender, education, or time since diagnosis.</p>
<p>The results from the multivariate analyses of the relationship between the effect on patient activation and the independent variables with <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.2 in the bivariate analyses are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813480279">Table III</xref>. The only statistically significant relationship between content and effect on activation given the other variables was where the programme leaders’ rated the participants’ activity during the programme as 8 (adjOR = 4.1; 95% CI 1.5–11.2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007). A trend for improved patient activation was found in programmes where the leaders rated the participants’ activity as 9–10 (adjOR = 3.2; 95% CI 0.9–11.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.072). A trend for a lower proportion of participants with improved activation was found in programmes where a medical nurse taught (adjOR = 0.3; CI 0.2–1.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.056).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results showed that programme leaders’ rating of participants’ activity level during the programmes was the main predictor for participants’ improved activation or coping skills.</p>
<p>The strength of this study was that it included many different educational programmes and patients with many different diagnoses, and that it focused on which components of locally developed programmes which were related to improvement of coping skills. Such studies have not been conducted previously. The weakness of the study is that the research design does not make it possible to control the actual relationship between the intervention and the result. The most motivated patients would probably participate in such programmes, and this could create bias. In addition, when investigating the programmes’ content, only programme leaders using the PAM questionnaire in their work were included.</p>
<p>The main finding was that educational programmes where the participants’ activity level was rated highly by programme leaders led to improved coping 4 months after the programme. An obvious explanation for this is that the most engaged participants are those who are motivated and interested, and therefore those who gain most from the programmes. This explanation is supported by the study design where the relationship between activation and group activity level is not controlled. Another study using the PAM questionnaire also found relationships between high patient-activation scores and demographic variables such as income, as well as various health behaviour factors such as less smoking, less obesity, and receiving preventive care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813480279">3</xref>]. These results indicate that a high level of patient activation is connected to positive health behaviour and other positive health factors. That a higher activity level in the education programme group is connected to more improvement of patient activation after participation is nevertheless a clear indicator to group leaders to focus on and support the participants’ participation and activation during the programme. Active participation in the education programme might also be highlighted by the group leaders during the programme as an important way for the participants to improve their personal benefit from participating.</p>
<p>The finding in the present study resembles the results from a newly published study where the group dynamic was found to be the essential element of educational programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813480279">11</xref>]. The authors argue that more thorough investigations of group processes are warranted, for example with qualitative research methods. Similar results are also reported in a study including patients with diabetes where a feeling of belonging, the experience of being with peers, and to learn from other patients’ experiences were described as the key to success in patient education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813480279">12</xref>]. Education in groups was thus emphasized by the participants as an important factor. The dynamics and processes in groups would therefore be important aspects of further studies on education programmes.</p>
<p>The finding of a trend for less improvement of patient activation where medical nurses were teachers is surprising. We have not been able to find a satisfactory explanation to this. The relationship between the subjects taught and teaching personnel were not investigated in this study. Neither were communicative abilities, competence in teaching, nor personal suitability investigated. Other studies focusing on health personnel’s influence on educational programmes have shown that communication skills are more important than professional background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813480279">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Further studies are necessary to identify a relationship between programme content and improved patient activation and coping skills. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods would probably be helpful to improve this knowledge.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study shows that locally developed educational programmes which are tailored specifically for the patient group in close collaboration between patients and health personnel lead to improved coping skills. The most important predictor for improved coping skills is when the programme leaders rate the participants’ activity level during the programme as high. This finding might imply that group processes and the activation of participants during the programme are more important than the educational content. Future patient education programmes should focus on group processes and on improving participants’ activity in the programme.</p>
