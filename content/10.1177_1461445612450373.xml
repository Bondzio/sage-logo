<abstract>
<p>Interactional metadiscourse resources in various contexts have gained increasing attention recently. However, little work has ever been done in investigating the use of interactional metadiscourse in job postings. Based on Hyland’s (2005a, 2005b) model, I propose the taxonomy of interactional metadiscourse which consists of two broad categories: stance features and engagement features, and seven sub-categories: hedges, boosters, attitude markers, self-mentions, reader-inclusive pronouns, questions and directives. Drawing on a detailed analysis of 220 job postings totaling about 77,100 words, together with 30 informants’ feedback of the attitude toward the use of interactional metadiscourse, the article explores the ways in which the writer interacts with the reader via interactional metadiscourse in this genre. The study has yielded some interesting results: in job postings, the occurrences of stance markers and engagement markers are close in frequency; within the genre, two sub-corpora of job postings (one is oriented to college students and the other is not) have demonstrated remarkable differences in terms of interactional metadiscourse use. Moreover, a distinction is made between macro-interactional metadiscourse and micro-interactional metadiscourse, which is useful in evaluating the interactionality of the text.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article examines the use of interactional metadiscourse in job postings. Job postings (henceforth JPs), sometimes labeled as ‘job announcements’ or ‘job ads’, are documents acknowledged through public media for the company or the organization to find the right talents to fill in vacant positions. JPs have promotional purposes as well as informational goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445612450373">Fairclough, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461445612450373">Hyland, 2004</xref>). They provide relevant information about the employer and the specific vacancy in question and rouse the reader’s interest to take action. JPs work on both informational and interactional planes in terms of text construction and comprehension.</p>
<p>It has been accepted that JPs are ads. However, we must bear in mind that JPs differ from other kinds of ads at least in two aspects. First, unlike other kinds of ads that are aimed at selling products or services to the public, JPs are not selling anything and only targeted at job seekers. Second, in JPs there is not only the solidarity relation between the writer and the reader which prevails in other kinds of ads, but also the power relation. In JPs, the writer and the reader define each other as an employer–employee constellation. They fit into the ‘internal interaction’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445612450373">Marková et al., 2007</xref>), which presupposes that a constellation of interdependent constituents enter into some kind of contact. In JPs, the power relation between the writer and the reader is overtly marked. The complex interpersonal relationship between the writer and the reader in JPs will demonstrate some considerable variations in linguistic devices.</p>
<p>However, previous studies on the interaction between the writer and the reader in advertising discourse (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612450373">Cook, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445612450373">Ewald and Vann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445612450373">Fu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461445612450373">Marsh, 2007</xref>) have not focused on JPs. More recently, the use of interactional metadiscourse that overtly marks the interaction between the writer and the reader in text has gained much attention in various contexts. The presence and function of interactional metadiscourse resources has been examined in a number of genres, including science popularizations, opinion articles, advertisements and so on (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445612450373">Crismore, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461445612450373">Dafouz-Milne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445612450373">Fuertes-Olivera et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445612450373">Le, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461445612450373">Mauranen, 1993</xref>). Surprisingly, little attention has been paid to JPs.</p>
<p>JPs are primarily informative because usually the reader of JPs is concerned with the salary, benefits, working hours and so on. JPs are believed mainly to appeal to the reader’s reason and it is the content of JPs rather than the way in which they are presented that really counts in determining the reader to take action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1461445612450373">Walker et al., 2008</xref>). In other words, the non-propositional plane of JPs has long been overlooked and the interpersonality of JPs has not received sufficient attention up to now. In fact, there are some occurrences of metadiscourse in JPs that mainly deal with the non-propositional content in the text. More notably, there are many occurrences of interactional metadiscourse in JPs with which the writer promotes rapport with the reader. By employing interactional metadiscourse, the writer’s intentionality in the text is explicitly conveyed and the manipulation of the reader is overtly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445612450373">Fu, 2010</xref>). So far, it is unclear how these interactional resources are actually used in JPs. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the ways the writer interacts with the reader via interactional metadiscourse. It is hoped that the examination of interactional metadiscourse in JPs will enrich our understanding of the genre and shed some useful light on genre analysis. The next section gives a description of the taxonomy used in this analysis, and is followed by a corpus and methodology description. Then the findings regarding the uses of interactional metadiscourse markers are presented, and conclusions are drawn following a discussion of the results.</p>

<title>The role of interactional metadiscourse in JPs: A stance and engagement taxonomy</title>
<p>The notion of interactional metadiscourse was first proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445612450373">Hyland (2005b)</xref> in the interpersonal model of metadiscourse. Interactional metadiscourse as an umbrella concept covers a wide range of linguistic resources such as self-mentions, reader-mentions, hedges and so on that are used to facilitate the interaction between the writer and the reader in the text. Interactional metadiscourse is an effective tool to explore the interaction in writing. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445612450373">Hyland (2005a)</xref> outlines another model which consists of stance and engagement to analyze the interaction between the writer and the reader in academic discourse. In this article, I integrate Hyland’s two models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445612450373">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445612450373">2005b</xref>) and propose a taxonomy of interactional metadiscourse which includes two broad categories: stance features and engagement features. Stance resources concern writer-oriented features and their prominent role is to convey the writer’s attitudes and evaluations. Stance features have four sub-categories: hedges, boosters, attitude markers and self-mentions. Engagement resources deal with reader-oriented features and their major function is to address the reader directly. Engagement features have three sub-categories: reader- inclusive pronouns, questions and directives. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1461445612450373">Figure 1</xref> shows the detail.</p>

</fig>
<p>It should be pointed out that the term ‘reader-inclusive pronouns’ derives from ‘reader pronoun’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445612450373">Hyland, 2005a</xref>) but has been revised somewhat. I consider that the term ‘reader pronoun’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445612450373">Hyland, 2005a</xref>), or ‘reader mention’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461445612450373">Hyland, 2008</xref>), is narrow in denotation because it is only associated with the addressee of the text and is almost equivalent to the second-person pronoun <italic>you</italic>. However, sometimes the first-person plural form <italic>we</italic> in text can refer to the reader as well as the writer, which is used to elicit the feeling of solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461445612450373">Wales, 1996</xref>). Actually, English does not differentiate formally between exclusive-<italic>we</italic> and inclusive-<italic>we</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445612450373">Harwood, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461445612450373">Quirk et al., 1985</xref>). Therefore, I use the term ‘reader-inclusive pronouns’ to broaden the uses of reader-mention pronouns. In the article, reader-inclusive pronouns include not only the second-person pronoun <italic>you</italic> and its corresponding cases, but the first-person plural forms <italic>we</italic> and its corresponding cases.</p>
<sec id="section3-1461445612450373">
<title>Stance features</title>
<p>Stance features mainly operate in the evaluative dimension of interactional metadiscourse resources and concern the ways the writer presents himself or herself and conveys his or her judgments and commitments toward the propositions in text. Hedges, boosters and attitude markers could be collectively labeled as ‘evaluatives’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461445612450373">Nash, 1992</xref>). The overall pattern of stance features is the writer’s self-mention plus his or her evaluation of the content in text.</p>
<p>Hedges are those resources used to reduce the writer’s complete commitment to a proposition, which indicates the subjectivity of a position to safeguard the writer’s point of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445612450373">Hyland, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445612450373">2005b</xref>). Hedges can definitely serve as an interactional strategy in text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461445612450373">Hyland, 1996</xref>). Hedges help the writer to present his or her view in a way to minimize the risk of being open to attack. The writer usually lowers the degree of his or her confidence in propositions, which allows the reader some room for counterargument. Boosters indicate the writer’s certainty toward the propositions in text and the writer explicitly makes his or her arguments with a confident voice. Boosters may help establish rapport by marking involvement with the text and solidarity with an audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445612450373">Hyland, 2005b</xref>). Attitude markers are used to show the writer’s affective attitude to propositions, which usually convey surprise, agreement, importance, obligation, frustration and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445612450373">Hyland, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445612450373">2005b</xref>). Self-mentions are associated with the degree of explicit writer presence in the text measured by the frequency of first-person pronouns and their corresponding adjective forms such as <italic>I, me</italic>, exclusive <italic>we</italic> and <italic>our</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1461445612450373">
<title>Engagement features</title>
<p>Engagement features are a constellation of discourse strategies that the writer adopts to recognize the presence of the reader and overtly bring him or her into texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445612450373">Hyland, 2005a</xref>). Engagement features represent the writer’s efforts to actively pull readers along with the argument: focusing their attention, anticipating their objections, recognizing their uncertainties, including them as discourse participants and guiding them to interpretations.</p>
<p>In this study, engagement features include three categories: reader-inclusive pronouns, questions and directives. Reader-inclusive pronouns include first-person plural forms (<italic>we</italic> and its corresponding cases) and second-person pronouns (<italic>you</italic> and its corresponding cases). Questions refer to the strategy of dialogic involvement par excellence, inviting the reader’s engagement and bringing the reader into an arena where he or she can be led to the writer’s viewpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461445612450373">Hyland, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445612450373">2005a</xref>). Questions have a more direct appeal in bringing the audience into a kind of dialogue with the writer than other rhetorical devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461445612450373">Nash, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461445612450373">Webber, 1994</xref>). One of the ways a writer can enhance the interactive quality of the text is by formulating questions which might be posed by an imaginary readership. Directives, in general, are used to stimulate the reader’s participation in text. As a discourse strategy, the major function that directives perform is to instruct the reader to do something in a way arranged by the writer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445612450373">Hyland, 2005a</xref>).</p>
<p>It may be argued that the three engaging devices have different force in terms of persuasion. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461445612450373">Hyland (2005c)</xref>, reader pronouns along with other linguistic resources tend more towards a solidarity end of this cline, while directives along with questions are more explicitly persuasive and are employed to maneuver the reader into accepting the writer’s viewpoint. In my view, solidarity is a form of manipulation in terms of rhetorical intent, as the underlying reason for the writer to establish solidarity with the reader is to influence or change the reader’s views and attitudes. In other words, solidarity helps to elicit the reader’s agreement and acceptance of the writer’s stance. In this sense, the three categories (i.e. reader-inclusive pronouns, questions and directives) all indicate the writer’s manipulation of the reader. Given the differences in terms of persuasive appeal, reader-inclusive pronouns may be treated as kind of ‘soft manipulation’ and questions and directives as ‘hard manipulation’. Moreover, it should be noted that although both questions and directives are used to motivate the reader, they differ in the extent to which the reader is involved in the text. Compared with questions whose primary role in the text is to arouse the reader’s interest in the unfolding text, directives are more forceful devices of engaging the reader in some kind of activity. Therefore, directives are more explicit markers of engaging resources than questions.</p>

<sec id="section5-1461445612450373">
<title>Macro-interactional metadiscourse and micro-interactional metadiscourse</title>
<p>Depending on the rhetorical intent they convey, interactional metadiscourse resources may be classified into two types: macro-interactional metadiscourse and micro-interactional metadiscourse. Macro-interactional metadiscourse refers to those resources that the writer uses in relation to a text or large section of a text. Given that text is viewed as the interaction between the writer and reader, the personal pronouns (self-mentions and reader-inclusive pronouns combined together) that contribute to the macrostructure of the text are seen as macro-interactional metadiscourse resources. In contrast, micro-interactional metadiscourse refers to those resources that the writer uses in relation to a particular clause or sentence, a set of meanings that reflects his or her priority for that particular clause. In this study, micro-interactional metadiscourse resources are typically realized by hedges and boosters.</p>

<title>Corpus description and methodology</title>
<p>The present corpus includes 220 JPs of various kinds, totaling about 77,100 tokens. All texts were retrieved online from the Job column of two well-known English-language newspapers, <italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic> and <italic>The Guardian</italic>, and three trustworthy websites, which guarantees authenticity and validity of the data. There are five sub-corpora indicating the sources where the JPs were retrieved respectively: 30 JPs from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jobs.telegraph.co.uk">http://www.jobs.telegraph.co.uk</ext-link>; 60 JPs from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jobs.guardian.co.uk">http://www.jobs.guardian.co.uk</ext-link>; 30 JPs from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.careerbuilder.com">http://www.careerbuilder.com</ext-link>; 50 JPs from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.careerbuildercollege.com">http://www.careerbuildercollege.com</ext-link>; 50 JPs from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.prospects.ac.uk/">http://www.prospects.ac.uk/</ext-link>. All texts were stored electronically. The analysis of interactional metadiscourse uses was carried out manually to ensure its validity. Interactional metadiscourse resources in JPs were examined one by one and tagged for computational analysis.</p>
<p>Although it has been accepted that metadiscourse is linked to non-propositional contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445612450373">Crismore et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461445612450373">Vande Kopple, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1461445612450373">Xu, 2006</xref>), it is still problematic to identify the metadiscourse items in JPs. Recent study reveals that there is actually no clear dividing line between propositional meaning and metadiscoursal meaning, for metadiscourse might work on both semantic and pragmatic planes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461445612450373">Ifantidou, 2005</xref>). Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445612450373">Hyland’s (2005a)</xref> arguments, this article highlights the role of metadiscourse as a means to achieve the interaction between the writer and the reader in text. Linguistic items demonstrating the writer’s stance and the engagement of the reader are dealt with in this study.</p>
<p>The overarching concern of the study is to achieve a detailed description of the distributional patterns of the target feature, namely, the linguistic form or construction being investigated. The study is both quantitatively and qualitatively oriented and quantitative approach prevails. The software <italic>PowerGREP</italic> 3v. 3.2.2 was used to search the frequency of occurrence. All frequency counts were normalized to a common basis, per 10,000 words of text (based on ‘orthographic words’ and ‘literal texts’, separated by spaces), which allows a direct comparison of results for different functional features. To supplement the quantitative findings, a questionnaire was used to elicit the reader’s attitude toward the persuasive effect of interactional metadiscourse. Thirty senior students who were about to graduate from the School of Foreign Languages and Literatures, Beijing Normal University were randomly chosen. The selection of the informants accords with the principle of ‘personal relevance’, which states that in advertising practice, it is often the case that the information bearing some link with the target audience could do more to the persuasive effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461445612450373">Petty and Cacioppo, 1986</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1461445612450373">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Data show that there are lots of occurrences of interactional metadiscourse in JPs. More importantly, interactional metadiscourse resources tend to occur in some particular sections of JPs. In fact, JPs as a distinct genre have clear generic structures. On the basis of ‘generic structure potential’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445612450373">Halliday and Hasan, 1989</xref>), I tentatively identify three obligatory elements of JPs: job description, job requirements and contact information. In the Job Description section, the writer usually presents a brief profile of the employer and states the major responsibilities of the job, detailed or sketched. In the Job Requirements section, the writer often lists requirements regarding educational degree and working experience for the prospective employee. In the Contact Information section, the writer provides contact information for people interested in the vacancy. It is worth noting that the distribution of interactional metadiscourse resources is not even in the three sections. Interactional metadiscourse is more likely to occur in the Job Description section and the Contact Information section than in the Job Requirements section. The following sections present the overall patterns of interactional metadiscourse and the detailed analysis of these resources.</p>

<p>Remarkably, stance features and engagement features share similar frequency of occurrence, which indicates that the writer pays equal attention to conveying his or her stance and bringing in the reader in JPs. Another notable feature in JPs is the frequent use of macro-interactional metadiscourse resources (i.e. reader-inclusive pronouns and self-mentions). Personalization is a striking feature of JPs, which aims at setting up a personal relationship between interactants in discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445612450373">Fairclough, 1993</xref>). In JPs, the writer personalizes the reader through the use of the second-person pronoun <italic>you</italic> and personalizes the institution through the use of inclusive-<italic>we</italic>. Given that the frequent uses of first-person pronoun are common features in casual conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461445612450373">Young and Fitzgerald, 2006</xref>), and second-person pronoun <italic>you</italic> uses overtly indicate the reader orientation in text, the overwhelming uses of exclusive-<italic>we</italic> and reader mention pronoun <italic>you</italic> in JPs indicate a high level of interactionality of the text. The following deals with the detailed analysis of interactional metadiscourse resources under the heading of stance features and engagement features respectively.</p>

<sec id="section9-1461445612450373">
<title>Stance features in JPs</title>
<p>Stance markers in JPs abound in number. However, not all sub-categories enjoy frequent uses. Data show that self-mentions are most frequently used. The writer employs self-mentions in JPs to explicitly refer to the employer and conveys his or her attitude and evaluation toward the company or the organization in question. Attitude markers are the second in frequency of occurrence in stance features. Hedges come third and boosters fourth.</p>
<sec id="section10-1461445612450373">
<title>Self-mentions in JPs</title>
<p>Self-mentions occur frequently in JPs. The frequent uses of first-person plural forms in JPs are effective discourse strategies as it is a frequent device in recent advertising to portray traders and manufacturers as a team by the use of <italic>we</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461445612450373">Mühlhäusler and Harré, 1990</xref>). By using first-person plural forms, the writer may mix his or her private intentions with socially recognized communicative purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612450373">Bhatia, 1993</xref>). Data further show that most of the self-mentions are realized by the first-person plural form <italic>we</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 1121). In contrast, first-person singular form <italic>I</italic> occurs only 24 times. It is seldom the case in which the first-person singular form <italic>I</italic> is used in JPs unless the writer of JP is the narrator. Below is an example:
<disp-quote>
<p>(1) As <italic>I</italic> sat alone in <italic>my</italic> office <italic>I</italic> felt really disillusioned and totally downhearted – the worst recession since the 1930’s was truly taking its toll. The great wealth of experience <italic>I</italic> have built up over the years, the contacts, the sales knowledge the drive and ambition – all of these qualities <italic>I</italic> could see completely disappearing before <italic>my</italic> very eyes. Then a light came on and <italic>I</italic> thought if <italic>I</italic> was in this position then there must be many more people like <italic>me</italic>. (<italic>Telegraph</italic> 9)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In (1), the writer uses <italic>I</italic> frequently to express his or her own personal feelings to appeal to the reader’s empathy.</p>
<p>It has been found that sometimes in JPs the divide between the first-person singular form <italic>I</italic> and plural form <italic>we</italic> is blurred. Despite the fact that the first-person singular form <italic>I</italic> and plural form <italic>we</italic> have distinct grammatical reference, in real context the dividing-line between the two pronouns is not as clear as expected. Below are two examples:
<disp-quote>
<p>(2) If you are interested, please forward your CV so that <italic>I</italic> can discuss the role with you in more detail. (<italic>Guardian</italic> 2)</p>
<p>(3) <italic>We</italic> take that dream, mixed with your dedication and hard work, Farmers Training, District support, and make it a reality! <italic>I</italic> will be with you to mentor, to train, to help finance your business. <italic>I</italic> will introduce to you the joy, and financial peace of owning your own business. (Careerbuilder 15)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Obviously, in (2), <italic>I</italic> has the close meaning with <italic>we</italic>. In (3), the writer uses <italic>I</italic> and <italic>we</italic> interchangeably. It may be argued that in JPs the first-person singular form <italic>I</italic> could be interpreted as the plural form <italic>we</italic> to some extent.</p>
<p>It has also been found that the first-person pronoun <italic>we</italic> and its corresponding adjective forms are largely exclusive uses. Most informants (25 out of 30) express their positive attitude toward exclusive-<italic>we</italic> use in JPs. The writer uses <italic>we</italic> as the representative of the company or the organization in various contexts. Sometimes, <italic>we</italic> is used to self-introduce the company and organization. This is an illustrative example:
<disp-quote>
<p>(4) <italic>We</italic> are a successful Foundation Trust providing mental health services across four London boroughs. Our 2007/08 ratings are good/excellent in use of resources and quality of care. (<italic>Guardian</italic> 27)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Sometimes, <italic>we</italic> is used to announce the job vacancies. Below is an example:
<disp-quote>
<p>(5) Currently <italic>we</italic> are looking for a business development manager to help <italic>us</italic> bring the company into the American market opening offices in the US. (Careerbuilder 1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In some cases, <italic>we</italic> is used to state the salary and benefits that the employer will offer, as we see here:
<disp-quote>
<p>(6) <italic>We</italic> also provide the following . . . (Careerbuilder 18)</p>

<sec id="section11-1461445612450373">
<title>Attitude markers in JPs</title>
<p>In JPs, adjectival items that are used to modify the ‘macro discourse entity’, which refers to the integral units of discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445612450373">Gosden, 1993</xref>) such as <italic>position</italic> and <italic>opportunity</italic> in JPs, are treated as attitude markers. That is to say, when the semantic property of an adjective remarkably echoes with the ‘macro-proposition’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461445612450373">Van Dijk, 1980</xref>) of the text, the adjective will be regarded as an instance of interactional metadiscourse. In other words, adjectives are counted as interactional metadiscourse if they are used to contribute to the theme of the text. For example, adjectives such as <italic>excellent, leading</italic> and <italic>exciting</italic> that are used to describe the company or job opportunity in JPs are seen as instances of attitude markers because the writer uses these items to stress the motif of the text.</p>
<p>Attitude markers are realized in different forms. Data show that adjective attitude markers are commonly used (29 per 10,000 words), followed by adverbial attitude markers (6 per 10,000 words). Main verb attitude markers are used lest frequently (2 per 10,000 words). Notably, adjective attitude markers exhibit a great diversity of lexical options. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1461445612450373">Table 2</xref> shows the realizations and occurrences in more detail.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>As can be seen, there are 27 lexical items serving as adjective attitude markers in JPs, most of which clearly contribute to the theme of the text. These markers could be tentatively classified into three semantic categories: excellence of the company or the organization, novelty or challenge brought about by doing the job, and importance of the job advertised. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1461445612450373">Table 2</xref> indicates that attitude markers are more likely to be used to indicate the excellence and novelty appeal. The writer uses words like <italic>excellent, best, key, largest, leading</italic> to describe the quality and status of the company or the organization and the financial reward, namely, salary, benefits and so on. Below is an example:
<disp-quote>
<p>(7) WellPoint is the nation’s <italic>leading</italic> health benefits company serving the needs of approximately 28 million medical members nationwide. (Careerbuilder 4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Sometimes, the writer uses words like <italic>challenging, exciting, interesting</italic> and so on to appeal to the reader, as here:
<disp-quote>
<p>(8) . . . have you already graduated? If so, there may be an <italic>exciting</italic> future for you with A.P. Moller - Maersk. (Prospects 29)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In (8), the writer uses <italic>exciting</italic> to describe the future in front of the reader. By doing so, a blueprint is drawn for the reader which stimulates him or her to take action.</p>
<p>Compared with adjective attitude markers, adverbial attitude markers do not occur very often in JPs, with two items <italic>ideally</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 25) and <italic>preferably</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 8) enjoying relatively frequent use. Adverbial attitude markers are mostly used to indicate the desired job qualifications on the part of the employee. By stating some qualifications that are not essential but preferred, the writer expresses his or her best wishes to those interested in the vacancy. Below is an example:
<disp-quote>
<p>(9) <italic>Ideally</italic> you will have a mix of in-house and consultancy (<italic>preferably</italic> small/independent) experience but happy to consider individuals with a pure client-side background. (<italic>Guardian</italic> 35)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>With the attitude marker <italic>ideally</italic>, the writer may achieve two purposes: i) to convey the information that the type of person the company is looking for can best suit the qualification, and ii) to evoke the reader’s high expectations of himself or herself. Moreover, both <italic>ideally</italic> and <italic>preferably</italic> are ‘strictly future-projecting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461445612450373">Givón, 1993</xref>: 172). In (9), the writer uses the two attitude markers to clearly depict a splendid picture for the reader to gain the applicant attraction. Notably, nearly all informants consider that the use of <italic>ideally</italic> is an effective device for the writer <italic>‘to express his or her idea mildly</italic>’ and ‘<italic>to show how considerate</italic> <italic>the company is</italic>’. Thanks to the occurrence of <italic>ideally</italic>, the job posting does not look ‘<italic>rigid</italic>’ or ‘<italic>dominating</italic>’, but ‘<italic>encourages people to have a try</italic>’ instead.</p>

<sec id="section12-1461445612450373">
<title>Hedges in JPs</title>
<p>Hedges do not occur very often in JPs. However, hedging markers help to make the text more reader-friendly. This study mainly examines the hedges that represent four central word-classes: modal auxiliaries, main verbs, adverbs and adjectives. Data show that modal verb hedges are used much more than other types of hedges, and modal verb <italic>may</italic> enjoys the most frequent use (<italic>n</italic> = 49). Modal hedges in JPs usually relate to job responsibilities. This is a typical example:
<disp-quote>
<p>(10) The role is varied and multifaceted: on the one hand you <italic>may</italic> be preparing a case for court, or you <italic>may</italic> be conducting research and comparative studies and on the other you <italic>may</italic> be advising a large corporation on procedural improvements. (<italic>Guardian</italic> 48)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Adverbial hedges are relatively rare in JPs, with <italic>approximately</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 10) enjoying prominence in terms of frequency of occurrence. Usually <italic>approximately</italic> is used to modify the numbers of staff or customers. Below is an example:
<disp-quote>
<p>(11) CitiFinancial Branch network provides community-based lending services such as bill consolidation, debt refinancing, sales financing, home equity, home improvement, and other personal loans primarily through a branch network of <italic>approximately</italic> 2,300 offices in the US and Canada. We employ nearly 12,000 people and serve <italic>approximately</italic> 10 million customers. (Careerbuilder 22)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Interestingly, the informants’ views on the discourse function of modal hedges are split: half of them (15 out of 30) report that hedging items are used to ‘<italic>indicate the writer’s uncertainty and thus soften the tone of the authority</italic>’, while nearly the other half (14 out of 30) report that hedges in JPs are aimed to ‘<italic>minimize the cost of the reader and express the writer’s politeness</italic>’. I assume that the two apparently contradictory views are not against each other. In my view, softening the tone of the authority represents the politeness strategy in discourse. In other words, to hold back full commitment of the statements in text is an effective way of realizing politeness for the writer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1461445612450373">
<title>Boosters in JPs</title>
<p>Boosters are not commonly used in JPs. Data show that adverbial boosters (<italic>n</italic> = 52) are used the most frequently. There is a variety of lexical markers used as adverbial boosters, with <italic>always</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 13) being used many times. It is often the case that adverbial boosters co-occur with personal pronouns in JPs. It seems that boosters play a supportive role in enhancing the interactionality of the text. Below are two examples:
<disp-quote>
<p>(12) Since ORC International was founded in 1938 we have <italic>always</italic> been at the forefront of developing new research approaches, and today we have a clear vision of how the latest technological tools can be utilised by tomorrow’s researcher. (Prospects 27)</p>
<p>(13) Your style of leadership will be crucial to your success – you’ll <italic>certainly</italic> be no stranger to inspiring, developing and empowering people to take ownership within a large, diverse organization. (<italic>Guardian</italic> 29)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In (12), <italic>always</italic> co-occurs with <italic>we</italic>, which is used to indicate the situation of the employer and it is writer-centered. In (13), <italic>certainly</italic> is clearly addressee-oriented because it follows the reader pronoun <italic>you</italic>.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section14-1461445612450373">
<title>Engagement features in JPs</title>
<p>Engagement features in JPs demonstrate some remarkable results. Reader-inclusive pronouns are the most commonly used category (194 per 10,000 words). Directives average 19 per 10,000 words, closely followed by questions (15 per 10,000 words). Engaging devices demonstrate overt strengths in upgrading the interactionality of JPs since they may explicitly build a relationship with the reader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445612450373">Hyland, 2005b</xref>). Engaging markers are used to establish an informal and friendly atmosphere between the writer and the reader in text. Moreover, sometimes engaging devices, questions in particular, are used to contribute to the development of the text, which play an important organizational role in unfolding the text. The following section deals with the realizations of engaging resources in more detail.</p>
<sec id="section15-1461445612450373">
<title>Reader-inclusive pronouns in JPs</title>
<p>The reader-inclusive pronouns include the first-person plural form inclusive-<italic>we</italic> use and the second-person reader mention <italic>you</italic> and their corresponding adjective forms. Data show that reader mention pronoun <italic>you</italic> occurs the most frequently (193 per 10,000 words). In contrast, the first-person singular form inclusive-<italic>we</italic> and its possessive cases are rare (1 per 10,000 words).</p>
<p>With regard to <italic>you</italic> uses, data further show that more than half <italic>you</italic> uses are of accusative case (105 per 10,000 words), which suggests that <italic>you</italic> is often grammatically used as the object of the clause. Next to <italic>you</italic>-object use is its possessive case use <italic>your</italic> (57 per 10,000 words). It is relatively rare that <italic>you</italic> serves as the subject of the clause (31 per 10,000 words) in the text. The distribution of <italic>you</italic> in JPs clearly indicates the addressee-oriented character of the text. Most of the informants (25 out of 30) express their positive attitude toward <italic>you</italic> uses and believe that addressing the reader with <italic>you</italic> makes them ‘<italic>feel good</italic>’.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when the writer addresses the reader by using <italic>you</italic> at the very beginning of the posting, <italic>you</italic> serves as an interlocutor. It seems that there is already a harmonious interpersonal relationship between the writer and the reader. Below is an extract:
<disp-quote>
<p>(14) Tired of the same thing everyday? Are <italic>you</italic> looking for a great opportunity with a great company??</p> <p>NOW is <italic>your</italic> chance to make a change!? (Careerbuilder 25)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When <italic>you</italic> occurs in the Job Responsibility or Job Requirement section, it is used as the subject of the clause. Given that the role of subject is to shoulder the responsibility of the clause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445612450373">Halliday, 1994</xref>), it is natural that the writer uses <italic>you</italic> to unfold the job responsibilities or job requirements. Below is an example:
<disp-quote>
<p>(15) <italic>You</italic> should hold a PhD in economics or be close to completion. <italic>You</italic> are also expected to have an active research profile and publications record, or be able to demonstrate research potential following the completion of a PhD. (<italic>Guardian</italic> 59)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It has also been found that <italic>you</italic> always occurs at the initial position of the clauses in JPs. It is accepted that the syntactic position really bears some relationship with the meaning that the lexical items intend to convey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461445612450373">Gómez-González, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461445612450373">Paradis, 2003</xref>). By placing the reader pronoun <italic>you</italic> at the initial position, the writer highlights his or her concern with the addressee and thus obtains a <italic>you-attitude</italic> in the text, which is an effective means of persuasion as is illustrated in (15).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1461445612450373">
<title>Questions in JPs</title>
<p>Questions are essential means to achieve the interaction between the reader and the writer. In the present study, simple questions, complex questions and elliptical questions are investigated. All questions explored are rhetorical questions because the answer is implied in the text. In JPs, total occurrences of questions are 119. Data further show that simple questions occur the most frequently (8 per 10,000 words), followed by complex questions (4 per 10,000 words) and elliptical questions (3 per 10,000 words). Despite the limited number of occurrences of questions, most of the informants (21 out of 30) who believe that the interrogative forms are ‘<italic>appealing</italic>’, ‘<italic>persuasive</italic>’ and ‘<italic>tricky</italic>’ express their positive attitude toward the engaging effect brought about by questions.</p>
<p>Questions in JPs are used to establish a dialogic atmosphere with the reader. The writer often begins with some <italic>yes–no</italic> questions concerning the reader-in-text <italic>you</italic> in JPs. Definitely, the default answer of the question is <italic>yes</italic> and the question is performing phatic function in the text. Below is an example:
<disp-quote>
<p>(16) Are you a motivated person with a competitive spirit, a willingness to learn new skills, and a desire to help people? (Careerbuilder 15)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Sometimes, the writer uses a question as an anchor to unfold the following text. Usually, the writer uses complex questions or elliptical questions as an engine to unfold the following text, which aims to introduce the major information concerning job responsibilities and requirements. In some cases, the question is immediately followed by the answer, which clearly reveals the question’s organizational role in the text. Below is an example:
<disp-quote>
<p>(17) <italic>Why do we say managing at Corner Bakery Cafe is better?</italic> Because our culture and unique set up allows you to focus on what you do best – manage. With no liquor, steam tables, deep fryers or late nights, our managers get more out of life. We offer more growth, better hours, greater potential and a culture that understands you have a life and want to enjoy it! (Careerbuildercollege 28)</p>

<sec id="section17-1461445612450373">
<title>Directives in JPs</title>
<p>In JPs, directives mostly occur at the Contact Information section where the writer motivates the reader to apply for the job vacancy. The persuasive effect of directives in JPs is overt, for most of the informants (23 out of 30) feel ‘<italic>stimulated</italic>’ when they read JPs where there are some directive markers. Data show that the commonly used directives are <italic>apply, email, send, take</italic> and so on. Clearly, the activities involved in these main verbs mainly operate in the physical dimension. Directives in JPs may be divided into two groups according to their rhetorical intent: real instructions and suggestions. Directives serve as real instructions for the reader as how to get the right information. Below is an example:
<disp-quote>
<p>(18) <italic>See</italic> website for details. (Prospects 47)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>More importantly, directives are used to gain solidarity with the reader as the directives in advertising are never negative or onerous, but are designed to appear like suggestions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461445612450373">Young and Fitzgerald, 2006</xref>). In other words, the deployment of directives is a disguised politeness strategy in that most of the directives in JPs are oriented to the reader’s benefits. The writer is assured that issuing such directives will not incur the reader’s aversion. Rather, it will bring about intimacy between the writer and the reader as the writer identifies himself or herself as the reader’s friend who provides some personal suggestions. This example is typical:
<disp-quote>
<p>(19) <italic>Consider</italic> a career as a Financial Adviser. (<italic>Telegraph</italic> 1)</p>

<title>Interactional metadiscourse uses across sub-corpora in JPs</title>
<p>The corpus is grouped into two different sub-corpora depending on the audience of JPs, with one being specifically oriented to college students and the other targeted to people in general. The College Student (CS for short) corpus consists of 100 JPs that are oriented to college students (50 JPs were retrieved from the website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.careerbuildercollege.com">http://www.careerbuildercollege.com</ext-link> and 50 JPs from the website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.prospects.ac.uk/">http://www.prospects.ac.uk/</ext-link>).

<p>As can be seen, interactional features as a whole are used more frequently in CS than in NCS and both stance and engagement features in CS enjoy a relatively higher frequency than those in NCS. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1461445612450373">Table 3</xref> suggests that macro-interactional metadiscourse markers (i.e. self-mentions and reader-inclusive pronouns) in CS outnumber those in NCS. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that globally the interactionality of JPs in CS is higher than that of JPs in NCS. Additionally, directives are used more frequently in CS than in NCS. As has been discussed in section 2, directives are powerful engaging devices for the writer to interact the reader in the text. The far more frequent use of directives in CS further proves the high interactionality of JPs that are oriented to college students. Moreover, there are more occurrences of attitude markers, hedges and questions in CS than in NCS. With regard to boosters, which are rare in JPs, it is amazing that the frequency of occurrence does not make any difference between CS and NCS.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that JPs oriented to college students demonstrate a higher level of interaction between the writer and the reader. There are two possible explanations for this phenomenon. First, college students who have not gained much knowledge about the company or the organization and job requirements are supposed to be fresh. Therefore it is necessary for the writer to do some introduction work to self-promote the institution, which might be an underlying reason for frequent uses of self-mentions in CS. Second, the jobs oriented to college students are largely entry-level ones which usually do not demand much previous experience and do not offer a high salary in return either. Naturally, the texts are more reader-friendly to attract the reader to apply. The eagerness of obtaining applicant attraction on the part of the employer is explicitly shown by overwhelming occurrences of reader-inclusive pronouns in CS. Besides, the relatively high rate of attitude markers in CS reflects the writer’s efforts to exert positive influence upon college students by appealing to their emotions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, the findings suggest that in JPs interactional metadiscourse markers are highly regular phenomena in terms of linguistic forms. It has been found that more interactional features are employed in JPs than in some other genres such as science popularization articles and opinion articles (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445612450373">Fu, 2010</xref>). The uses of interactional metadiscourse resources in JPs could be explained from the two perspectives: i) communicative purpose of text, and ii) writer–reader relations.</p>
<p>The most prominent feature of JPs is the frequent use of macro-interactional metadiscourse (i.e. self-mentions and reader-inclusive pronouns). In contrast, micro-interactional metadiscourse resources (i.e. hedges and boosters) do not enjoy a high frequency of occurrence. The uneven distribution of macro-interactional metadiscourse resources and micro-interactional metadiscourse is in accordance with the overall communicative purpose that the writer wants to achieve. On the one hand, JPs are supposed to accurately disclose the relevant information to enable the reader to get to know the company or the organization. On the other hand, JPs are persuasive in nature, and aim to influence not just thinking but also behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445612450373">Crusius and Channell, 2003</xref>). In other words, JPs are appellative as well as informative, and are characterized by not only the content orientation but by the reader orientation. Naturally, the overwhelming uses of self-mentions and reader-inclusive pronouns in JPs reflect the promoting traits of the text. Self-mentions are frequently used by the writer to self-promote the company or organization and reader-inclusive pronouns are often used to appeal to the reader’s emotions. The promoting strategy and the appealing strategy are combined together in JPs to help establish and maintain the rapport between the writer and the reader. In contrast, the rare occurrences of boosters and hedges are probably due to the accuracy required of the information disclosed in JPs. In fact, hedges and boosters are close in use (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445612450373">Halliday, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461445612450373">Lyons, 1977</xref>) in that both types are used to modify the truth value of the propositional contents in the text, with boosters upgrading the commitment of the truth value of the propositions and hedges downgrading it. The rare occurrences of hedges and boosters reflect the character of JPs that are supposed to be objective and to provide accurate information regarding salary, working hours, job responsibilities and so on.</p>
<p>Apart from the communicative purpose of the text that influences the uses of interactional metadiscourse in JPs, writer–reader relations contribute to interactional metadiscourse variations. It has been accepted that any text can be generally seen as a record of a dialogue between the writer and the reader in which ‘the writer has to conduct his interaction by enacting the roles of both participants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1461445612450373">Widdowson, 1984</xref>: 59). Metadiscourse highlights the dialogic role of discourse, and the interactional features that the writer selects are always relative to a particular audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612450373">Hyland, 2001</xref>). In a broad sense, the purpose of audience analysis is to help the writer in understanding a social situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461445612450373">Park, 1986</xref>). It is a common practice that the writer exploits his or her linguistic repertoire to maximize audience awareness to achieve maximum communicative reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461445612450373">Ochola, 2001</xref>). In JPs, the power relation between the writer and the reader is overtly marked. Usually, the writer represents the employer and thus enjoys a higher social status than the reader, who is treated as the prospective employee. More notably, the writer of JPs oriented to college students seems to have more power over the reader because college students are usually lacking work experience and are therefore in a professionally disadvantaged position. The fact that there are more interactional metadiscourse resources in CS than in NCS clearly reveals the impact of reader consideration. It seems that social distance between the writer and the reader has some link to the employment of interactional metadiscourse resources. When the gap is big, the writer is prone to use more interactional metadiscourse in the text.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the findings that JPs oriented to college students are more interactive than those oriented to people in general, echo the conclusion of a previous study in social psychology, which shows that the content of job advertisements influence the organizational attitudes of experienced job seekers more than their inexperienced counterparts. Additionally, the presence of peripheral cues (i.e. physical attractiveness of those persons shown in recruitment material) appears to have a greater effect on the organizational attractiveness perceptions of job seekers having less work and job search experience versus those having more experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1461445612450373">Walker et al., 2008</xref>). Compared with the propositional content in the text, metadiscourse is a rather peripheral route to convince the reader. The appeal to the reader’s emotions rather than reason is clearly reflected in the use of interactional metadiscourse in JPs. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand the frequent use of interactional metadiscourse in JPs oriented to inexperienced job seekers (college students).</p>
<p>In fact, the affective appeals of interactional metadiscourse resources have been noticed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445612450373">Hyland (1998)</xref> when exploring the metadiscourse in CEOs’ letters. Interactional metadiscourse is used to promote pathos. When the writer adds the affective element to the reader, he or she will look at the text from the reader’s perspective, empathizing with the reader’s values and goals, and directly encouraging the reader to respond, which is overtly demonstrated by more uses of attitude markers and directives in CS than in NCS.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The article has presented quantitative research on the presence of interactional metadiscourse in JPs. The study reveals that there are plenty of interactional metadiscourse resources in JPs, and the abundant occurrences of interactional metadiscourse in JPs provide evidence that metadiscourse is ‘discourse universal’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461445612450373">Mauranen, 2010</xref>). The study indicates that macro-interactional metadiscourse resources are frequently used and stance features and engagement features are equally prominent in this genre. The findings also suggest that reader consideration plays an important role in relation to interactional metadiscourse use.</p>
<p>Despite the detailed analyses focusing on the realizations of interactional metadiscourse, the study has some weaknesses concerning discourse functions of interactional metadiscourse in JPs. As far as the questionnaire is concerned, it seems that there is much room to improve.</p>
<p>This study extends the scope of discourse analysis, enriching our knowledge about JPs as a sub-genre of ads in business settings. With regard to transferring these findings to pedagogical grounds, I think there is an evident need to include interactional metadiscourse resources in L1 and L2 writing courses. I hope the detailed analyses and discussion of interactional metadiscourse in JPs may enable teachers and students to examine the text from an interpersonal perspective rather than merely focusing on its ideational content.</p>
<p>However, much work should be done to further explore the use of interactional metadiscourse in JPs and it remains important to study the factors that influence the writer’s choice of interactional metadiscourse in JPs of different types. Are JPs targeted at qualified professors different from those addressed to people of humble educational background in terms of interactional metadiscourse use? Is there any difference between the high-paying jobs and the low-paying jobs in terms of interactionality of JPs? Is there any difference between the JPs of prestigious institutions (e.g. Oxford University) and the JPs of obscure institutions (e.g. a small company opened by an unknown person)? More work needs to be done to explore the use of interactional metadiscourse in the genre of JPs. Given that genre serves as a link between text and context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461445612450373">Van Dijk, 2008</xref>), more interesting findings may be obtained by presenting the analysis in a broader social context.</p>
