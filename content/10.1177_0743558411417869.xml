<abstract>
<p>Identity research has focused primarily on outcomes associated with identity formation. Far less attention, however, has been given to understanding the facilitating contextual elements of this process. This qualitative study examined a context, a 2-week adventure recreation program for youth, quantitatively shown in previous research to have promoted identity development. The program took place in Idaho’s Salmon-Challis National Forest and involved rafting, backpacking, mountain biking, and a variety of other outdoor activities. Data were gathered from 23 female and 22 male participants, ages 11 to 15 (<italic>M</italic> = 13.2, <italic>SD</italic> = .89). Seven distinct categories emerged from the analysis related to participants’ perceptions of the program experience including: (a) new experiences, (b) challenge, (c) supportive relationships, (d) acquisition of new skills and knowledge, (e) increased self-confidence, (f) fun, and (g) new self-perceptions. A preliminary framework incorporating the identified elements is proposed. The findings add to the understanding of identity formation antecedents and provide guidance regarding the intentional design of contexts to promote identity development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Identity researchers have investigated both the outcomes and to a lesser degree the antecedents of identity development. Adolescents who experience successful identity development exhibit a variety of positive outcomes, whereas youth who struggle with this process tend to display more deviant behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0743558411417869">Adams et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0743558411417869">Hernandez &amp; DiClemente, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0743558411417869">Jones &amp; Hartmann, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0743558411417869">Klaczynski, Fauth, &amp; Swanger, 1998</xref>). In terms of antecedal contributors of identity development, some research has examined intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental elements. For example, findings suggest family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0743558411417869">Grotevant &amp; Cooper, 1985</xref>), peer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0743558411417869">Sugimura &amp; Shimizu, 2010</xref>), school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0743558411417869">Roeser &amp; Lau, 2002</xref>), and leisure contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0743558411417869">Haggard &amp; Williams, 1991</xref>) can influence identity development. For example, the context of youth sports has received a fair amount of attention from identity researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0743558411417869">Groff &amp; Kleiber, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0743558411417869">Kleiber &amp; Kirshnit, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0743558411417869">Shaw, Kleiber, &amp; Caldwell, 1995</xref>) and in some populations sports participation is linked to positive identity development.</p>
<p>Despite these findings, little is known about the influence of structural and social elements within these contexts on identity formation. Increased understanding about contextual influences on identity formation would allow practitioners to more effectively design contexts and experiences to intentionally promote adolescent identity development. Investigating the characteristics of effective identity promoting contexts may address this gap in the literature. Therefore, this study employed qualitative methods to examine characteristics of a 2-week adventure recreation program, a context shown to effectively promote adolescent identity development. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0743558411417869">Duerden, Widmer, Taniguchi, &amp; McCoy, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Identity formation is a complex process of interrelationships between intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental factors. Although this perspective of identity formation is in harmony with developmental perspectives such as ecological systems theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0743558411417869">Bronfenbrenner, 1979</xref>), the majority of identity research conceptualizes this process as an individualized affair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0743558411417869">Schachter &amp; Ventura, 2008</xref>). Bronfenbrenner proposed individuals’ inhabit and are influenced by a variety of settings (e.g., home, school, work, peers, etc.). Therefore, development can best be understood by expanding the scope of inquiry beyond the individual as a lone agent. Identity research could greatly benefit from such an approach and some research has already occurred that meets this call. The following sections review the literature investigating the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual factors associated with identity formation.</p>
<sec id="section2-0743558411417869">
<title>Intrapersonal Antecedents</title>
<p>Most individuals settle into a somewhat stable identity during their early 20s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0743558411417869">Archer &amp; Waterman, 1994</xref>), however, the process of identity development begins during early adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0743558411417869">Adams &amp; Archer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0743558411417869">Lavoie, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0743558411417869">Wires, Barocas, &amp; Hollenbeck, 1994</xref>). Individuals transition from childhood to early adolescence as a result of the physical, emotional, and mental changes associated with puberty and exposure to new environments and opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0743558411417869">Brinthaupt &amp; Lipka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0743558411417869">Roeser &amp; Lau, 2002</xref>). These changes appear to serve as a genesis for identity formation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0743558411417869">Harter (1999)</xref> suggested early, middle, and late adolescents construct personal identities very differently because of varied cognitive abilities. Early adolescents are able to develop personal abstractions (e.g., I’m friendly, I’m a loner, etc.), but these abstractions are often context specific. Social feedback, particularly from peers, takes on increased importance during middle adolescence. The cognitive ability to internalize beliefs and values rather than relying on outside validation begins to appear in the later stages of adolescence. Thus the cognitive and emotional development associated with puberty facilitates increasing engagement with the identity formation process. A host of other intrapersonal characteristics (e.g., moral reasoning, reflective decision making, self-esteem, socially constructive behavior) have been linked with successful identity development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0743558411417869">Waterman, 1992</xref>), however, most of this literature is cross-sectional, making causal attributions to any of these skill sets tenuous.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0743558411417869">
<title>Interpersonal Antecedents</title>
<p>As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0743558411417869">Harter (1999)</xref>, adolescents highly value perceptions and feedback from peers and significant others. The impact of significant others (e.g., peers, parents, siblings, mentors, etc.) has long been viewed as a catalyst of identity development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0743558411417869">Waterman, 1982</xref>). For example, research findings have suggested both family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0743558411417869">Grotevant &amp; Cooper, 1985</xref>) and peer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0743558411417869">Sugimura &amp; Shimizu, 2010</xref>) interactions influence identity development. More recently, the concept of “identity agents” has been proposed to describe “individuals who actively interact with youth in order to participate in their formation of an identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0743558411417869">Schachter &amp; Ventura, 2008</xref>, p. 454). This focus marks an important shift in the literature from the individual as the lone actor in the identity formation process to a more holistic perspective of identity arising through bidirectional interactions between the individual and the surrounding social and environmental contexts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0743558411417869">
<title>Contextual Antecedents</title>
<p>A paucity of research exists specifically targeting the impact of nonfamilial contexts on adolescent identity development. This lack of attention is in contrast to an increased emphasis on the role of out of school time settings in positive youth development scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0743558411417869">Eccles &amp; Gootman, 2003</xref>) and funding (e.g., W. T. Grant Foundation). Some recent attempts have sought to investigate the impact of intentional interventions to promote identity development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0743558411417869">Schwartz, Kurtines, &amp; Montgomery, 2005</xref>), however, such efforts are rare.</p>
<p>Structured recreation activities represent one area receiving at least some focus. For example, research findings suggest sports involvement positively affects adolescent females’ identity development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0743558411417869">Shaw et al., 1995</xref>) and adaptive sports programs can lead to positive shifts in youth participants’ self-perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0743558411417869">Groff &amp; Kleiber, 2001</xref>). Yet, these findings are based either on cross-sectional or qualitative data, making causal inferences regarding identity formation somewhat tenuous. Although the aforementioned sports study did not specifically investigate qualities of the sports context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0743558411417869">Groff and Kleiber (2001)</xref> qualitatively assessed participants’ perception of the adapted sports program. Their findings suggested the development of skill and competence, opportunities for emotional expression, decreased awareness of disabilities, and opportunities to interact with others with disabilities were processes associated with participants’ identity development. This work presented some initial insights into the impact of intentional settings on identity development, but further research is needed to build upon these findings.</p>
<p>The authors of this study collected qualitative data from participants in an adventure recreation program that was quantitatively linked to identity formation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0743558411417869">Duerden et al., 2009</xref>). Longitudinal data from this quasi-experimental study indicated participants experienced significant growth across <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0743558411417869">Erickson’s (1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0743558411417869">1968</xref>) industry, identity, and intimacy stages as well as in their use of identity processing styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0743558411417869">Berzonsky, 1989</xref>) in contrast to the comparison group. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to employ qualitative methods to identify potential structural and social elements of the adventure recreation program associated with participants’ observed identity gains.</p>

<title>Program Description</title>
<p>Youth in the study were participants in a 2-week adventure recreation program, Camp WILD (Wilderness Instruction and Leadership Development). The program was a collaborative venture between university researchers and the W.I.L.D. Foundation explicitly designed to serve as a research laboratory. The W.I.L.D. Foundation seeks to provide low or no cost wilderness adventure experiences for youth who otherwise could not afford to participate. Funds to implement the program were provided by anonymous private donors and internal university grants. The base camp was located in Idaho’s Salmon-Challis National Forest. Backpacking trips took place within the national forest and rafting trips occurred on the Main Salmon River.</p>
<p>Camp WILD participants were assigned to teams of 4 youth, for a total of six teams per session each under the supervision of one male and one female staff member. The program consisted of three different activity rotations: (a) backpacking, (b) white-water rafting, and (c) exploration. Each 3-day rotation included two teams. The exploration rotation occurred at camp. The backpacking and rafting rotations consisted of multiday trips in the wilderness area. During the backpacking rotation, the youth received instruction and opportunities to apply a variety of outdoor skills including backcountry cooking, first aid, and fly-fishing while on a self-supported wilderness trip. The rafting rotation involved navigating a 30-mile stretch of the Main Salmon River. Youth learned about river safety, equipment, and guiding. Each participant had opportunities to guide his or her team’s raft down the river and through rapids. The exploration rotation involved mountain biking, team building activities, and environmental education. Rotations concluded on the afternoon of the 3rd day and started again the following day after lunch. Between each rotation, participants took part in service projects (e.g., stream restoration, painting building, and brush removal) at camp and a variety of group activities (e.g., kickball, campfire programs, talent shows, etc.).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0743558411417869">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants included 22 males and 23 females, ages 11 to 15 (<italic>M</italic> = 13.2, <italic>SD</italic> = .89), from three western states. Eighty-four percent were White, 13% were Hispanic, and the remaining 2% represented other ethnicities. Program participants were recruited, interviewed, and selected by the researchers and employees of the program’s sponsoring nonprofit agency with a focus on identifying youth who would not be financially able to attend a similar program on their own. Females and males attended separate sessions of the program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0743558411417869">
<title>Qualitative Methodology</title>
<sec id="section9-0743558411417869">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The PI and two research assistants conducted focus groups and one-on-one interviews with youth participating in the program. Participants took part in focus-group discussions after completing each activity area. On average, focus group discussions lasted between 30 and 45 minutes. These discussions examined the groups’ experiences during their most recently completed activity rotation. Prompt questions such as “What was the funniest thing that happened during the activity?” “What did you learn about yourself during the activity?” and “What did you learn about your group during the activity?” were asked to initiate group discussions. Facilitators used probing question to investigate pertinent topics, such as program content and identity development that arose during the sessions.</p>
<p>One-on-one interviews were also conducted with approximately 80% of participants from each session in order to provide youth an opportunity to also share their thoughts in a nongroup setting. Both the focus groups and individual interviews were audio-recorded and later transcribed. The majority of the interviews were conducted toward the end of each camp session and usually lasted between 5 and 15 minutes. Interviewees were asked about their overall impression of the program, what their favorite activities were, and if they had learned anything about themselves. In total, 24 focus groups (3 to 4 participants each) and 40 one-on-one interviews were conducted. Some individuals were interviewed more than once to gain further insights on their comments during initial interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0743558411417869">
<title>Analysis procedures</title>
<p>The focus group and interviews were transcribed and names and other identifiers were replaced with pseudonyms to insure the anonymity of research participants. Data was coded and organized with QSR NVivo, a qualitative data analysis program. The analysis process included open, axial, and selective coding as prescribed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0743558411417869">Strauss and Corbin (1998)</xref>. Open coding involved reading pertinent portions of the transcripts in order to identify repeated words, phrases, and themes. Axial coding consisted of identifying common links between emergent codes and the development of more abstract categories under which related subcategories were grouped. Finally, selective coding involved identifying core categories and determining interrelationships among categories in order to begin the development of a preliminary theoretical framework grounded in the data.</p>
<p>Member checking and independent evaluations of the data analysis process were employed to examine the “trustworthiness,” of the analysis and the identified emergent categories. Trustworthiness is similar to gathering evidence of the reliability and validity of inferences of psychometric measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0743558411417869">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). Member checking establishes credibility (i.e., validity) and involves research participants reviewing the completed analysis to ascertain if it correctly reflects their personal perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0743558411417869">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). Dependability and confirmability of the codes, categories, and overall data analysis process was substantiated by feedback provided from external reviewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0743558411417869">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0743558411417869">
<title>Quantitative Methodology</title>
<p>While this was a primarily a qualitative study, some quantitative data was drawn from the program’s participant registration forms. Specifically, questions were asked related to frequency of prior participation in certain forms of outdoor recreation activities (e.g., rafting, backpacking, etc.).</p>
<sec id="section12-0743558411417869">
<title>Researcher’s relationship to the data</title>
<p>The PI also served as the director of the program under observation and therefore spent extended amounts of time with youth. While the high degree of contact most likely influenced the youths’ experience in the program and more specifically the qualitative data collection process, it also allowed the PI to develop relationships with participants that appear to have fostered open sharing of information. As director, the PI filled primarily an administrative role and rarely was involved in the direct delivery of program services. The PI’s primary duty was to ensure program quality. The collection of qualitative data in this role was a natural extension of other director responsibilities.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0743558411417869">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Analysis of the qualitative data identified seven emergent categories related to participants’ perceptions of the key aspects of the program experience. For organizational purposes, the categories were divided into two core categories, <italic>contextual elements</italic> and <italic>associated processes</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section14-0743558411417869">
<title>Contextual Elements</title>
<p>The adventure recreation program offered participants a wide variety of experiences ranging from the challenging (e.g., white-water rafting) to the mundane (e.g., cleaning the mess hall). Participants reported that opportunities to have new experiences, the challenging nature of these experiences, and the supportive relationships with staff and other participants they experienced were the most important aspects of the program.</p>
<sec id="section15-0743558411417869">
<title>New experiences</title>
<p>Many of the youth made comments regarding their new experiences at camp. For some, it was the setting, (e.g., “I haven’t [ever] been like in a place like this”) for others, it was the activities (e.g., “I liked rafting too, because it was fun, and I had never tried it before”), and for some, simply being away from home was a new experience (e.g., “I have never been away from home for more than five days”). Participants made frequent reference to the novelty of their experiences. These comments appear to match data drawn from participants’ registration forms related to their previous participation in different types of outdoor recreation. For example, 78% of the females and 55% of the males reported they had never been white-water rafting. Sixty-one percent of the females identified backpacking as a new experience, and 64% of the males reported having been backpacking only five times or less. When asked about what made the experience memorable, participants made comments such as “trying new things” and “because I’ve never done it before, so it was all new”.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0743558411417869">
<title>Challenge</title>
<p>Participants commented that they experienced challenge during their two weeks in the program. One male participant made the following comment regarding backpacking, “it was really hard and it was kind of a challenge to get there and to not like stop and ask for a million breaks.” Another female youth recounting her mountain biking experience said, “it was really challenging . . . it was really kind of hard to go up hill.” One female participant stated, “I don’t know, at first I was kinda like, I don’t know if I could go mountain biking and all this stuff, because I didn’t think I was an outdoorsy person.” These comments are typical of those shared by other participants who also perceived challenge in the program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0743558411417869">
<title>Supportive relationships</title>
<p>Youth made frequent comments regarding the important role the staff played during the program. The subject of making friends with peers and the staff appeared throughout the focus group and interview data. One male participant made the following comment regarding these relationships, “you come up here and make more new friends and everything, and hang out with counselors and just have fun.” One female noted, “yeah, I only have a few friends, but here I have a whole billion of them.” Another male said, “I learned I can make a lot of new friends.” A friendly environment was a hallmark of the program. One male participant commented about the kindness of the staff, “they’re just so like loving and like they’re so supportive of us and tell us to keep going.” Another female participant said, “I really like how everybody tried to make everybody feel important, like all the counselors and everybody.” It was apparent to the researchers that the friendships formed with staff were an important aspect of the experience. The majority of all participants made positive comments about the staff. No negative comments about the staff were expressed in the focus group discussions or individual interviews.</p>
<p>Remarks about the staff dealt with topics ranging from positive staff attributes to how the staff helped facilitate meaningful experiences for the youth. Participants’ comments suggest a number of staff qualities that the youth perceived as important. Youth commented that the staff members were “nice.” Other words such as “friendly,” “loving,” and “caring” were also used to describe the staff. For example, one male participant said, “they’re [the staff] just so like loving and like they’re so supportive of us and tell us to keep going.” Other youth noticed that staff members were laid back yet still effective. One male youth shared the following observation, “the staff is really cool . . . everyone’s laid back and easy but they all still get everything done, they still follow the rules.”</p>
<p>As they reflected on their experiences in the program, a number of the youth mentioned different ways the staff helped make their experience positive. For example, youth made comments about the caring nature of the staff and staff’s ability to increase motivation and provide encouragement. One female participant stated, “[the staff] care more about us than them[selves].” In summing up his feelings about the staff, one male youth said, “they’re just so friendly . . . they’re always there for you when you need their help . . . they’ll do whatever it takes to get you happy.” Participants also noted that the staff respected their opinions and insights. One male participant said, “you can [share] your ideas and if they [the staff] think it is okay they’ll go along with it.” Although youth took part in challenging recreation activities, they rarely felt forced or prodded into participation. One female stated, “[the staff] just let us go at our own pace, ’cause at other camps like girls camp they like sort of make, they tell you get up and go out and they make you feel like you have to.”</p>
<p>Staff and peers also provided the extra encouragement and support needed in order to persevere and successfully complete the activities. A female participant recounted the following experience:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When [we] were biking today, I was like I’m not going down it it’s too scary and steep and I’ll fall over or something. And then Brittney was like here I’ll go first, and she showed a good example and stuff, and like even though she didn’t make it all the way over she still made it and she didn’t fall over and so it gave me more confidence to do it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some participants commented specifically that without the help of peers and staff the more challenging activities would have been difficult to successfully complete. Although challenges can result in success or failure, the supportive nature of the staff appears to have promoted success more often than failure. Rather than take steps to moderate challenges, staff worked to help youth persist in the face of adversity and eventually succeeded. For example, on a mountain bike ride, one female participant experienced a particularly nasty fall and was not able to continue. The next day, a staff member and the girl returned to the area of the crash. The staff member helped the girl ride the difficult section and then provided support and encouragement while the girl completed the entire ride. The experience turned the discouragement of initial failure into a meaningful and memorable success. Similar comments from participants suggest including both challenging experiences and supportive relationships facilitates positive outcomes.</p>

<title>Associated Processes</title>
<p>Participants’ comments related to processes associated with the program’s activities are grouped into four areas: acquisition of new skills and knowledge; increased self-confidence; fun; and new self-perceptions.</p>
<sec id="section19-0743558411417869">
<title>Acquisition of new skills and knowledge</title>
<p>Many participants had little or no previous outdoor adventure experience and, consequently, lacked confidence as they approached the outdoor adventures. At the end of the program, many participants developed strong feelings of competence in their abilities to both participate in and lead a variety of adventure recreation activities. One male stated, “I came up here knowing like nothing about the wilderness, and I know like a ton of stuff about it now.” Participants valued the new skills and knowledge they gained from the program and commented that such skills could prove useful later on in life. Another male said, “yeah, it’s knowledgeable, you learn a lot and most of the stuff you probably will have to use later on at one point, [and] you can teach others how to do it.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0743558411417869">
<title>Increased self-confidence</title>
<p>As a result of their participation in the program, many participants expressed a newfound sense of confidence. One male noted, “I feel like a lot more confident about like myself and the things that I can do.” Another participant recounted, “we went biking and it was really hard for me but I came through and ended out leading us and I learned for myself that I can, even though I’ve never tried things I can do really good at them.” For some youth, increased confidence appears to have generalized beyond the program’s activities to other life domains.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0743558411417869">
<title>Fun</title>
<p>In addition to skill, knowledge, and confidence development, participants also had fun during the program. “Fun” is a word used repeatedly by the participants when describing their experiences. Some comments also link fun to the challenging adventure recreation activities. One female participant shared the following insight:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think the things that make an activity fun are just kind of more experience at things, like if, the harder things are . . . the more fun that they can be, after you look back on things sometimes they can get really scary, but you look back at them and realize that they are scary but at the same time they give you experience and memories and that, I think that’s what makes things fun.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another male participant said, “I always thought biking was really fun but now I know that it could get a lot harder and could be more fun.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0743558411417869">
<title>New self-perceptions</title>
<p>The experience also led to the reevaluation of self-perceptions as illustrated by the following statement made by a male participant, “I feel that I am a lot stronger than I thought I was, a lot braver.” In the focus groups and individual interviews, participants were asked if they had learned anything or recognized changes about themselves during the adventure recreation program. Almost all participants affirmed that they had discovered or developed new personal attributes and abilities. As one youth said, “I’ve learned if I put my mind to something I can pretty much do it, if not do it then get pretty much close to doing it, closer than I thought.” For example, some youth commented that they successfully accomplished activities that they did not believe they were capable of completing. The following statement from one of the females illustrates this point:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes . . . because I’m heavier, some of the things that I think that other people can do, like sometimes I feel like I can’t do it and I can’t complete it. But today and the past few days I felt like that I can do what other people do if I just keep on trying on hard and taking risk[s] and even though you think you can’t do it you really can and you just keep on trying.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similar comments, linking new self-perceptions and challenge, were made by over one third of the participants.</p>
<p>New self-perceptions led some youth to contemplate future behavioral changes as well. For example, one male commented, “I used to just mess around and not really do anything at home and stuff, but now I’m thinking of all these things that I should go and do instead.” Another male resolved to “help my mom out a lot more after this camp.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Emerging from the participants’ comments about their perceptions of the program were seven main themes: (a) new experiences, (b) challenge, (c) supportive relationships, (d) acquisition of new skills and knowledge, (e) increased self-confidence, (f) fun, and (g) new self-perceptions. The empirical evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0743558411417869">Duerden et al., 2009</xref>) demonstrates this outdoor adventure was an effective context to promote identity formation. It is likely that the components and processes identified in this qualitative analysis played a role in the observed identity growth.</p>
<p>Some of the seven themes identified in the analysis were represented more often in the data than others. For example, <italic>supportive relationships</italic> was one of the most common themes throughout the data. While this does highlight the salience of <italic>supportive relationships</italic> as a theme, it does not necessarily indicate a hierarchy of importance for the identified themes. In fact, the data seem to suggest a high degree of interconnectivity across themes. This co-occurrence of themes is mentioned in the results section with links appearing between fun and challenge, and challenge and supportive relationships. Accordingly, it seemed appropriate to attempt to place the identified themes into a conceptual map in order to highlight their interconnectivity.</p>
<p>In order to conceptualize potential relationships between the identified qualitative categories, the authors developed the <italic>structured recreation identity formation framework</italic> (SRIFF; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0743558411417869">Figure 1</xref>). Although the data does not directly support causal relationships, a preliminary framework may help guide future research. The SRIFF also helps better translate the study’s findings into a more practitioner accessible format. The following paragraphs contain an overview of the SRIFF and suggest possible theoretical connections between the model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0743558411417869">Marcia’s (1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0743558411417869">1980</xref>) identity status theory, and self-determination theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0743558411417869">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Proposed Model</title>
<p>The qualitative data suggest the program provided participants with new experiences, challenges, and a supportive environment of staff and peers. The novelty and challenge of the experience led some participants to doubt their ability to successfully complete certain activities. Additionally, previous research suggests that perceptions of challenge may be heightened by participants’ lack of adventure recreation experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0743558411417869">Wells, Widmer, &amp; McCoy, 2004</xref>). This lack of experience led some of the youth to doubt their ability to complete certain activities during the program. For example, youth reported a perceived lack of the skills necessary to complete some of the program’s activities. Such instances suggest that the novelty of the experience increased participants’ perceptions of challenge.</p>
<p>Challenge appeared to play a key role in the experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0743558411417869">Taniguchi (2005)</xref> argues that challenge forces individuals out of their comfort zones and can lead to a lowering of social facades. Failing to overcome challenges can lead to developmental setbacks, whereas, overcoming challenges can result in developmental progress. The supportive and caring nature of the staff appears to have increased participants’ likelihood of successfully engaging in challenging activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0743558411417869">Schachter and Ventura’s (2008)</xref> concept of identity agents could be applied to the programs staff who intentionally involved themselves in the participants’ experience and thereby assume a central role in the SRIFF. Additionally, as youth reflected on their participation, many specifically mentioned the acquisition of new skills and knowledge, increased confidence levels, and simply having fun. Overcoming challenges and gaining new skills, knowledge, and confidence, in a fun environment appears to have led some youth to develop new, positive self-perceptions. From a theoretical perspective, the process of identifying, exploring, and potentially committing to these new self-perceptions aligns with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0743558411417869">Marcia’s (1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0743558411417869">1980</xref>) conceptualization of identity formation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0743558411417869">
<title>Theoretical Connections</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0743558411417869">Marcia’s (1980)</xref> work focuses on the dual processes of exploration and commitment that drive identity development. Exploration and commitment are integral aspects of the SRIFF. The adventure recreation program provided abundant opportunities (e.g., new experiences, challenges, relationships, and activities) for exploration. For example, during the 24-hour a day, 14-day experience, participants engage in prolonged direct observation (i.e., exploration) of staff members’ positive character strengths (e.g., kindness, fairness, persistence, love of learning, etc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0743558411417869">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>). One of the unique strengths of this type of program, is the fact that the prolonged experience occurred under stress associated with intense physical challenge, cooking, eating, and hygiene required in backpacking and camping, and the resulting group dynamics. Exploration of identity elements necessary to successfully complete challenging activities (e.g., the bravery and teamwork skills needed to be a successful white-water rafting guide) was fundamental to promoting identity development. As participants experienced success, they gained new self-perceptions and set new resolutions, a process characteristic of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0743558411417869">Marcia’s (1980)</xref> concept of commitment.</p>
<p>The principles of self-determination theory (SDT) provide additional understanding of the adventure recreation program’s ability to promote identity formation. SDT resulted from extensive research regarding the contexts and conditions that facilitate motivation and healthy psychological development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0743558411417869">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>). According to SDT, autonomy, relatedness (i.e., feelings of social connectedness), and competence are the basic needs required for healthy psychological growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0743558411417869">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>). The theory additionally suggests these basic needs must be met for positive development to occur. All three of these basic needs are addressed in the SRIFF.</p>
<p>The respect between and among staff and participants created an environment where youth felt their opinions mattered and where their need for autonomy appears to have been met. The development of positive relationships was one of the most cited, perhaps because it met the need for relatedness. With the needs of autonomy and relatedness met, participants had the support necessary to develop competence as they engaged in the program’s activities. As noted earlier, participants engaged as both team members and team leaders in the adventure activities. This added level of responsibility appears to have positively impacted perceptions of personal competence. The salient role of challenge in the overall experience came up frequently in the comments. These findings suggest challenge may play an important, and as yet unaddressed, role in the SDT model. It appears the amount of perceived challenge faced and successfully overcome was positively related to the perceived strength of the acquired competence. Research on this potential relationship may provide greater explanatory power to the model. If this assumption holds true, the role of surmountable challenges in recreation interventions becomes even more important.</p>
<p>Qualitative findings support the theoretical relationship between basic needs of autonomy, relatedness, competence in SDT, and the identity development process. This connection further validates previous research regarding the positive relationship between SDT and identity development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0743558411417869">Soenens, Berzonsky, Vansteenkiste, Beyers, &amp; Goossens, 2005</xref>). Accordingly, the SRIFF suggests positive identity development occurred because the program met participants’ basic psychological needs and provided opportunities for exploration and commitment.</p>

<title>Placing the Study’s Findings in a Cultural Context</title>
<p>This study focused on a structured leisure setting situated in an outdoor context. The relationship between culture and the natural environment is complex. Although Western European perspectives dominate traditional conceptualizations of nature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0743558411417869">Nash, 2001</xref>), the outdoors is viewed and used quite differently across cultures and even between genders. For example, activity patterns for many outdoor activities vary across cultures and are often skewed toward higher participation among Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0743558411417869">Sasidharan, 2002</xref>). Differences even appear in preferences for types of natural environments across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0743558411417869">Buijs, Elands, &amp; Langers, 2009</xref>). In terms of gender, some research suggests differences in activity norms between adolescent boys and girls as well as body image issues affect adolescent female participation rates in outdoor activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0743558411417869">Culp, 1998</xref>). Among youth, a variety of factors including opportunities for exposure and preconceptions about the outdoors may influence perceptions and preferences related to natural spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0743558411417869">Bixler &amp; Floyd, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Although this study’s sample was fairly uniform in terms of cultural backgrounds, data from the intake questionnaires indicated most of the youth had very limited exposure to wilderness settings and activities. Accordingly, the outdoor setting and the adventure recreation activities represented a new context for these youth, a context far removed from technology, media, the halls of school and their homes. From the authors’ observations, the program setting served as an equalizer that diminished the relevance of stereotypical adolescent cliques. Every participant was placed in a new and different environment, a completely new system. In essence, a new cultural context was allowed to naturally emerge in the program setting at least partially unencumbered by standard youth context norms. It is this new cultural context, one that appears to have facilitated positive identity development, the SRIFF attempts to organize and explain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0743558411417869">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The fact that no follow-up data collection occurred with the participants is an inherent weakness of this study. Although the experience appeared to positively impact participants, this affect may have dissipated once they returned home. The focus of the study, however, was to gain a rich understanding of the program context as perceived by the youth. The data collected and analyzed for this study appeared adequate for this purpose. It should also be reemphasized that the SRIFF is a preliminary model that requires quantitative validation before appropriate causal attributions are made. What the SRIFF does represent is an initial attempt, based upon the data, to identify relationships between the emergent categories. This process lays a foundation for future quantitative application of the model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0743558411417869">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The findings of this study support previous findings suggesting the general efficacy of adventure recreation programs in promoting positive growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0743558411417869">Cason &amp; Gillis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0743558411417869">Hattie, Marsh, Neill, &amp; Richards, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0743558411417869">Wells et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0743558411417869">Widmer, Taniguchi, Duerden, &amp; Freeman, 2005</xref>). Recreation should also be considered a prime context to positively impact adolescent identity development. The SRIFF provides a theoretical explanation of the interaction between participation in this program and participant’s identity development. This model will hopefully prove useful to practitioners when developing programs targeting positive identity development. Although the SRIFF is derived from an adventure recreation program, important benefits may result from the implementation of this framework in nonadventure recreation contexts. As long as the main elements of the model are included, similar developmental outcomes should be expected in a variety of program settings.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Erikson claimed identity formation represents the key developmental task of adolescent. Research supports this claim in so far as the successful navigation of identity development has been linked to a variety of positive outcomes. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0743558411417869">Schachter and Ventura (2008)</xref>, the field of identity research is traditionally marked by a singular focus on the individual as a lone actor. At the same time, almost all other areas of developmental psychology adopt a more holistic perspective of development wherein the individual exists within a milieu of bidirectional relationships with contextual and social elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0743558411417869">Lerner, 1998</xref>). The current study made an effort to assist with the expansion of focus for identity research by attempting to qualitatively identify antecedent elements and processes of identity formation. Future research is needed to further validate both these findings and the proposed SRIFF.</p>
