<p>Masculinities scholarship emerged as an important addition to the sociological study of gender in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Concerned with making men the focus of analysis, this literature highlighted the centrality of homophobia in the regulation of men’s behaviours. This coincided with feminist scholarship that demonstrated how homophobia was making young men both emotionally illiterate and socially isolated, and has become part of the orthodoxy of understanding the social dynamics of male youth.</p>
<p>It is in this context that Niobe Way discusses boys’ friendships. In <italic>Deep Secrets: Boys’ Friendships and the Crisis of Connection</italic>, she reports on trends that depart from the tenets of this masculinities literature. In doing so, the book is a groundbreaking work that challenges some of the axioms of traditional masculinities research, while providing important nuances to other cherished understandings of masculinity. However, it also remains frustratingly trapped in a crisis narrative, arguing that boys are still in crisis despite these significant and positive changes.</p>
<p><italic>Deep Secrets</italic> examines the friendships of 135 working-class boys of colour in the United States. Having collected data on the topic since the mid-1980s, Way adopts a rich mixed-method design, interviewing each boy several times over the course of three years – between the ages of 14 and 18. After an introduction that previews the book and provides an overview of research on boys and friendship, the book is split into two further sections: Part 1 detailing the rich emotional friendships of boys during early and middle adolescence; and Part 2 discussing late adolescence, a period of development in which, Way argues, boys undergo a crisis of connection.</p>
<p>It is Part 1 where the book comes alive. <italic>Deep Secrets</italic> tells the story of how young boys speak ‘about “circles of love,” “spilling your heart out to somebody,” … and “feeling lost” without their male best friends’ (p. 91). She documents the ways in which boys share deep secrets with their best friends, in whom they put a great deal of trust. Yet she also talks about the fear that friends will betray this trust or not share the same emotional bond. When her participants describe an ideal friendship being about ‘trust and love and never breaking apart’ (p. 92), one can understand their fear that their friendships will not measure up to this ideal.</p>
<p>Way provides substantial data to evidence her claims. And while mainly in block quotes that can become a little repetitive at times, she also presents data in exciting and powerful ways. For example, in two places (pp. 102, 152) after an extended block quote, she highlights the conflicts in expressing emotions by removing all the words of that quote apart from the ‘voice of the “I”’ (p. 102), enabling the reader to see the emotional conflict: ‘I don’t; I feel; I can’t; I still get; I really don’t …’ In this manner, Way enables the reader to feel the complexity of these friendships.</p>
<p>Part 2 of <italic>Deep Secrets</italic> is presented in much the same way as Part 1, but the focus this time concerns the growing distance between boys as they develop into early adulthood. Boys describe their aging friendships as ‘fading’ (p. 184). The sense of loss is palpable, and Way argues that this disconnect between friends is significant, long lasting and with serious consequence. It is this section that nuances the literature on masculinities and friendship, providing important data on Latino and black youth, yet her analysis broadly chimes with the seminal literature of Mac an Ghaill, Pollack, Connell and others.</p>
<p>While I welcome <italic>Deep Secrets</italic> as an important addition to the literature on boys’ friendships, I also find it frustrating. Way critiques the earlier literature on young boys as ignoring their emotionality and close friendships, while accepting the research about older male youth which finds they remain emotionally distant – seemingly reading the literature in such a way to fit her data. While it is possible that the literature was more accurate among older rather than younger youth, a more convincing explanation is that a profound change has occurred in the social dynamics of male youth since the earlier research was undertaken. And perhaps the result of being a developmental psychologist, Way does not engage with a key social trend that scholars of masculinity have argued has markedly changed boys’ behaviours – that of decreasing homophobia.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038512458381">Anderson (2009)</xref>, for example, has argued in his book <italic>Inclusive Masculinity</italic> that homophobia has been instrumental in keeping men emotionally distant, and he shows that men have become more emotionally open with their friends as homophobia has decreased. I have also demonstrated in <italic>The Declining Significance of Homophobia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038512458381">2012</xref>) that male youth aged 16–18 are exhibiting remarkable levels of intimacy. Accordingly, rather than there being a crisis of connection between all boys, it seems more likely that Way has found the continuing influence of homophobia on Latino and African-American working-class boys in the United States. Nonetheless, <italic>Deep Secrets</italic> is a powerful work that is a welcome and timely addition to the literature on masculinities, friendship and emotion.</p>
