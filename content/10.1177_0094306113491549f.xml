<p>More than a decade into the new milennium and after much ado about the notion of a now “post-feminist world,” women have been safely delivered into the sociological terrain of subjects, subjecthood, and agency. It would be hard not to agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306113491549">Francine Deutsch (2007)</xref> when she argues that processes of “undoing gender” characterize our moment, and that a number of phenomena, among which feminism and other kindred social movements are prominent, have enabled many women, in diverse parts of the planet, to enjoy autonomy and exercise control over their lives and bodies in ways that would have been far beyond their realm of possibility some fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as is also widely recognized, benefits have accrued to women through highly unequal patterns, produced largely through gender’s intersection with class, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and world geopolitical structures. Research looking at the lives of poor women in the Global South or women from subaltern racial or ethnic groups in the Global North, women who live in the run-down ghettoes that could perhaps represent the “slumified” future of our planet (Juliet Mitchell, foreword p. xv) demonstrate the contradictory ways in which social position allocates access to (or denial of) this new global world of agency and possibility.</p>
<p>In an equally controversial vein, contemporary social science literature has looked at the role of media in the construction of subjectivities and social relations: from television to internet, and the whole realm of rapidly-evolving information technologies that have intensified global “connectedness” to degrees that only several decades ago would have been completely unimaginable. Scholars engage in hot debate around the consequences and effects of these “mediations.” Is hegemony comfortably enjoyed by the homogeneity of corporate media structures whose advertising and limited scripts reproduce global patterns of domination and produce powerful new forms of “digital exclusion”? Or should particular attention be paid to how new media enable democratizing tendencies and possibilities of critical engagement or “self imagining” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306113491549">Appadurai 1996</xref>)?</p>
<p>Lisa Beljuli Brown’s book, fruit of much reflection and a year of living and sharing with poor Afro-Brazilian women living in two different <italic>favelas</italic> (slums) in the northeastern Brazilian city of Salvador, contributes to current debates in both gender and media studies. Her interest in women’s lives and experiences, and particularly in understanding the subjectivity and struggles of the planet’s poorest (“Little is known about their emotional survival. What are the mental rather than the material costs of poverty?” [p. xviii]) leads to her exploration of <italic>telenovela</italic> watching, where she believes she can find the key to explaining how women living in the most miserable of conditions (as the Brazilian economy provides the benefits of its current <italic>puissance</italic> to so many others) keep on, feeling their own plight validated by television soap operas that turn women’s suffering into a heroic and cross-class female destiny, and taking pleasure in the daily episodes which also become a cherished moment of female sociability. She explicitly states her goal of contributing a new approach to “audience ethnography,” based on immersion in people’s daily lives (rather than more conventional limited contacts with interviewees). This enables her to uncover “what motivates people from the slums, especially women, to invest in certain stories about their lives? What makes telenovelas so compelling?” (p.xxii).</p>
<p>Brown is in fact quite successful in her ethnographic enterprise, providing us with a superbly written account of women living in miserably poor conditions and sometimes shockingly disconnected from the dynamic knowledge (and material) possibilities of a world which, we are so often encouraged to believe, increasingly weaves all the planet’s inhabitants into dense and promising webs of social relations. Her deeply empathic text credibly renders their lives visible and tangible to readers whose own lives may never have brought them anywhere near places like the <italic>bairro</italic> from which Brown’s friends and informants see and experience the world. The many hours she spent with them as they watched and discussed several recent Brazilian <italic>telenovelas</italic> proved a highly effective methodology for reception study, for moving as close as possible to the life world of members of a particular audience and thus being able to perceive what kind of mirror on their own existence these women—overburdened with responsibilities for raising children in poverty, without the effective support of husbands, partners, or social services, most often caught within the trap of survival through underpaid domestic service employment—find in telenovela dramas of female suffering. For these “suffering” telenovela protagonists—almost exclusively, rich (or upper middle-class) white women, young, beautiful, well-dressed—are privileged with a life style of physical comfort that provides the starkest of contrasts to what the favela women are obliged to inhabit.</p>
<p>Although Brown is successful in establishing closeness with the women of the community she studies, it is not clear, as a foreigner attempting to interpret Brazil, how much opportunity she had to circulate within other Brazilian environments, such as an academic milieu in which exchanges with other gender and media researchers could be established. Dialogue with current Brazilian scholarship on related themes (such as works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306113491549">Esther Hamburger [2005]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113491549">Heloisa Buarque de Almeida [2003]</xref>, feminist scholars who look at telenovelas from a gender perspective) is largely absent from her pages.</p>
<p>Without negating the validity of Brown’s recourse to psychoanalysis and to classical theories of alienation’s notions of “fragmentation of the self,” her depiction of her informants’ struggles to see themselves as “whole” within a social context that is constantly reducing them to “body parts” sometimes seems overdrawn. The “metonyms” she devises (“vagina, uterus, back”) in reference to the three functions that her informants’ social function ascribes them (sex object, instrument of reproduction, and worker/care giver) may be evocative and helpful in advancing a sort of “dense description” of these women’s lives, as possible analytical tools—but should not be confused with people’s actual perceptions of themselves, their lives, and others. This is clearly so for the case of “vagina”—which, as she notes is negatively valued, yet somewhat compensated within the symbolic economy by the womb (motherhood.) Her metonym obscures the question of women as objects of male sexual desire, for it is evident that men do not desire (women as) “vaginas.” Greater attention to current Brazilian studies of hetero and homosexual desire and sexuality would most certainly have alerted her to the cultural fact that, within a Brazilian “symbolic economy,” the parts of feminine (whether women or <italic>travesti</italic>!) anatomy seen as evoking male desire are <italic>tetas</italic> and <italic>bundas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094306113491549">Pelucio 2009</xref>). Other affirmations that the author makes throughout the text could be subjected to further questioning, such as her allegation that (poor) men do not enjoy a sociability comparable to that which the women she has engaged with weave around moments of daily life and <italic>telenovela</italic> watching—which in fact Almeida’s ethnography has shown is not always such an exclusively female pastime. Our own research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491549">Adelman and Becker, forthcoming</xref>) forms part of an ethnographic literature providing quite another picture, pointing to popular and middle-class men’s privileged (public sphere) access to particular spaces and opportunities for homosocial activities of leisure and sociability, particularly those that are linked to sport.</p>
<p>These difficulties aside, Brown provides a brave and important narrative, of ample interest to gender and media scholars and to all who seek to understand the contemporary world, its processes of inclusion and exclusion, connection and marginalization.</p>
