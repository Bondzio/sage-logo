<abstract>
<p>This article proposes a method of evaluating effect, impact and efficiency of treatment using the standardized mean difference (SMD) of outcomes between the treatment and the control groups. Since the SMD is commensurable (divisible and measurable by a common standard), here it is given a unit name ‘effect’ as an expression of the ‘standardized effect’. Based on the assumption that impact is the sum total of the change brought about by the treatment in the population, this article asserts that impact can be calculated by multiplying the ‘standardized effect’ by the population under treatment given that the sample represents the population. Extending this logic, efficiency can be calculated by dividing the impact by the total input of the treatment expressed in a monetary value. An example of the application of this approach to the evaluation of Japan’s Foreign Student Policy toward Thailand is introduced and its merits and limitations are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and compilation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) in many developing countries have promoted the collection of indicators related to various aspects of development. These indicators are monitored in order to examine the impact of development interventions conducted by donor organizations, as well as the developing countries themselves. There has been active discussion as to how to measure the impact of the treatments accurately by utilizing outcome indicators: an important question in providing effective development assistance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356389012443163">Clements et al. (2008)</xref> point out the existence of the incentive for positive evaluation bias in development agencies.</p>
<p>The Center for Global Development (CGD) set up the Evaluation Gap Working Group. After examining various evaluations of social sector programs, the working group report points out that few truly rigorous impact evaluations have been conducted and calls for collective action by all stakeholders in development assistance to promote more and better impact evaluations supported by evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012443163">Center for Global Development, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The most rigorous method for impact evaluation is widely acknowledged to be randomized controlled trial (RCT). According to Lachin et al. (1998), ‘RCTs are considered the most reliable form of scientific evidence in healthcare because they eliminate spurious causality and bias.’ However, it is difficult to conduct RCTs in social settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356389012443163">Ravallion (2003)</xref> of the World Bank states, ‘Randomization is the theoretical ideal and a natural benchmark for assessing non-experimental (quasi-experimental) method.’ While admitting that ‘there are sometimes opportunities for randomizing the assignment of an anti-poverty program, possibly on a pilot basis,’ he concludes that ‘it is frequently the case in practice that randomization is not a feasible option.’ In spite of this kind of perception, various efforts have been made by the aid agencies and the network of academics and aid practitioners toward conducting more rigorous impact evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012443163">Aoyagi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356389012443163">International Initiative for Impact Evaluation, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356389012443163">Khandker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356389012443163">Poverty Action Lab, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356389012443163">Sasaki, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356389012443163">Hansen and Rieper (2009)</xref> review the practice of evidence-based evaluations by the evidence-producing organizations in health, social welfare and education sectors and found that some subscribe to a narrow concept of evidence, only including results from RCT-designed studies, while others subscribe to a broader concept of evidence from a variety of study designs reflecting their epistemological tradition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356389012443163">Radej (2011)</xref> proposes a meso approach to synthesize the results of various impacts of a regional development program on the economic, social and natural environment but the magnitude of each impact is not reflected in the synthesis.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to propose a method to measure the effect, impact and efficiency of treatment through using the standardized mean difference (SMD) of the outcomes between the treatment and the control groups. We assume that the ‘standardized effect’ expressed by the SMD (effect size statistic) is commensurable and give it a unit name ‘effect’. If impact is defined as the total change brought about by the treatment in the population, impact can be calculated by multiplying the SMD by the population size. Efficiency can then be calculated by dividing the impact by the total input of the treatment. This population effect approach can facilitate the comparison of impact and efficiency between the different treatments using the same set of indicators.</p>
<p>To facilitate the understanding of this method, the proposed method is applied to the evaluation of Japan’s foreign student policy (hereafter ‘FSP’) by comparing those who had studied abroad in Japan and those who chose to study in the universities in their own country. Since the control group could not be randomly selected due to the limitation of the evaluation design, the result contains a selection bias. An important premise of this method is the accuracy of the SMD, so this case is not a good example of applying this method. However, it will help the reader to understand this method better and to utilize this method in a more rigorous way in the future.</p>
<p>The first section of this article introduces the basic concepts and the steps of the proposed method in comparison with the existing methods of impact evaluation. The second section demonstrates an example of its application in the evaluation of Japan’s FSP. The final section concludes with a discussion of this method’s merits and limitations.</p>

<title>A method to measure the effect and impact</title>
<p>In the impact evaluation, ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression is one of the most commonly used methods to measure the impact of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356389012443163">McEwan, 2010</xref>). A basic regression model, assuming a linear correlation, can be written as below where <italic>Y</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> represents the outcome of each individual <italic>i, X</italic> stands for the control variables, <italic>ϵ</italic> is a residual (error term) and <italic>D</italic> is a dummy variable where <italic>D</italic> = 1 represents the treatment while <italic>D</italic> = 0 stands for non treatment.</p>

</p>
<p>Using OLS, the regression coefficients <italic>a, b</italic>, and <italic>c</italic> can be estimated. In the absence of controls for X, the estimates of <italic>c</italic> would be interpreted as the average difference between the treatment and the non treatment (= control) groups (treatment effect). However, if the treatment and the control groups are not selected randomly, <italic>D</italic> will be an endogenous variable and the treatment effect cannot be measured correctly.</p>
<p>Although RCTs are the best solution to this problem, an alternative solution is ‘matching’ when RCT is not possible. Matching involves pairing treatment and control units that are similar in terms of their observable characteristics. By choosing the appropriate treatment and control groups through matching, the average treatment effect (ATE) can be measured by the difference of the average values of the treatment and control groups. Abadie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356389012443163">2001</xref>: 2) show the population and sample ATE in the following <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1356389012443163">equation (2)</xref> where <italic>Y</italic>

<p>If one could assume that the observable factors are almost the same on average [X(1)≈X(0)] and the unobservable factors are also almost the same on average [ϵ(1)≈ϵ(0)] in the treatment and the control groups, estimate of the ATE would be <italic>c</italic>.</p>
<p>Although only RCTs enable the above assumptions, matching is an effort to minimize the difference of the observable factors of the two groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) is one of the most advanced methods of matching. Propensity score is defined as the predicted probability that the individual receives a treatment, given their observed characteristics. Probabilities of the treatment conditional on covariates are estimated using a probit or logit regression. Matching is conducted between the treatment and control units whose propensity scores are sufficiently close. Yet, the causal interpretation of PSM rests on the unverifiable assumption that no unobserved variables are correlated with outcomes and with probability of the treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356389012443163">McEwan, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Using PSM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356389012443163">Abadie et al. (2001)</xref> estimate the effect of participation in National Support Work (NSW), a job training program in the USA, on individual earnings as $1903 in 1978 based on 445 observations. The ATE expressed in raw units can easily be interpreted as an expression of the impact of the program. However, it is not always easy to examine the impact of programs by comparing the ATE in raw units. For example, the magnitude of an ATE of $1903 would be different between Program A and B, when the average income of the treatment group is $11,903 and that of the control group is $10,000 in the former while that of the treatment group is $101,903 and that of the control group is $100,000 in the latter. One may hope to compare the magnitude of impact by dividing the ATE by the average outcome of the control group. However, this is possible only when the outcome is measured on the ratio scales that have a true zero.</p>
<p>Many outcome measures are scaled in arbitrary units and lack a true zero. Effect size statistic expresses the magnitude of effect in a standardized form that makes it comparable across measures that use different units or scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356389012443163">Rossi et al., 2004</xref>: 304). The SMD is the expression of the effect size when the indicator is a continuous variable.</p>
<p>This characteristic of effect size also makes it easier to calculate the weighted average of the SMD of the different outcome measures to express the synthesized effect as long as all of the outcome measures are continuous variables. The odds ratio is used in the calculation of effect size found in the binary variables. Since the SMD and the odds ratio are different in their nature, it is not possible to synthesize the effect when the outcome measures consist of both continuous and binary variables.</p>
<p>The calculation of the SMD is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012443163">Box 1</xref>. As you can see in the first equation in the box, the SMD shows the ATE on a scale on which the pooled standardized deviation value of the two groups is expressed as one. It shows the size of the ATE relative to the range of the lowest and highest scores of the treatment and control groups. There are a few approaches to the calculation of the SMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356389012443163">Carson, 2008</xref>: 3), and the Hedge’s approach (called Hedge’s ‘g’) is adopted here, in which pooled standardized deviation (SD) of the treatment and the control groups is calculated by weighting each SD by its sample size. The reason for using Hedge’s ‘g’ is that it is not as influenced by the sample size as Cohen’s approach (called Cohen’s ‘d’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356389012443163">Barnette, 2007</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>SMD is an expression of the standardized size of effect and is commensurable. Based on this, here it is given the unit name ‘effect’ that shows the size of the ‘standardized effect’. If we assume that the sum total of the standardized effect in the treatment group shows the whole impact of the treatment in the sample, it is calculated by multiplying the SMD by its sample size as shown in the first equation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356389012443163">Box 2</xref>. Extending this logic, it would also be possible to calculate the sum total of the ‘standardized effect’ (= SMD) in the population by multiplying the SMD by the population size, as shown in the second equation in Box 2, assuming that the sample represents the population properly (the mean and SD of the sample should be almost identical with those of the population). This calculated impact is expressed by the units of ‘effect’ and the population, for example ‘effect*person’.</p>

<p>If the impact of the treatment is measured in this way, efficiency can also be calculated by dividing the whole impact by the total input of the treatment expressed in a monetary value. The equations to calculate the efficiency are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356389012443163">Box 3</xref>. The second equation shows that efficiency is SMD per capita input. The calculated efficiency is expressed by the unit of ‘effect’ and the unit of the population per monetary unit, such as ‘effect*persons/$1000.’</p>

<p>The important assumption of this method is that the treatment and the control groups are comparable. An RCT would minimize this difference of the two groups, called ‘selection bias’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389012443163">Duflo and Kremer, 2003</xref>). If an RCT cannot be undertaken, other designs such as matching are necessary to minimize the difference of the observable variables of the two groups though they cannot assure the minimization of the difference of unobservable variables between the treatment and the control groups.</p>
<p>We also have to note that a standardized measure of effect size can be misleading in some cases. In raw units, the effect of putting one-inch-heel shoes on the height of people is constant across all people. In standardized units, however, the effect would depend on whether the sample in a study included people of similar heights or had a wider range of heights. So the efficiency of a one-inch heel on height would be different in the different samples even though the ‘real’ effect (in raw units) is a constant. The standardized effect expressed by the SMD shows a comparative size of the effect to the variance of the outcome values of the group(s).</p>
<p>Rossi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356389012443163">2004</xref>: 311–13) point out the difficulty in achieving adequate statistical power (<italic>t</italic> test with α = .05) in the various combinations of effect sizes (SMD) and sample sizes. Relatively high power (significant difference) is attained only when either the sample size or the threshold effect size is rather large. Achieving both is often unrealistic for impact evaluation. The SMD will be smaller when the outcome measure has any measurement error than the case when the outcome measure contains less measurement error if statistical tests are applied to control the type I error (finding statistical significance even when there is no difference between the two groups).</p>

<title>Case study: Japan’s foreign student policy evaluation</title>
<p>In this section, an application of the proposed method is demonstrated in the evaluation of Japan’s FSP toward Thailand by comparing Thai students who studied abroad in Japan with those who instead studied at and graduated from a Thai university.</p>
<p>In 1954, nine years after their defeat in the Second World War, the Japanese Government restarted the FSP by introducing the Japanese Government Scholarship Program (hereafter ‘JGSP’). Since then, Japan has made efforts to increase the number of foreign students by taking various measures, such as strengthening JGSP and the support program (hereafter ‘SP’) for those studying in Japan at their own expense, including a system to reduce or exempt their tuition fees and the provision of a moderate amount of honors scholarships. The majority of these foreign students in Japan are from Asian countries.</p>
<p>From an analysis of the related policy statements, two main objectives of the FSP were identified for the years between 1954 and 2001: to develop human resources in the foreign student’s home countries and to foster pro-Japanese leaders to promote friendship with these countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356389012443163">Sato, 2002</xref>: 202). The first objective was set because the FSP was conducted as part of Japan’s official development assistance (ODA).</p>
<p>In 2002 a survey was conducted in Thailand for the evaluation of Japan’s FSP. Foreign students from Thailand made up the fifth largest foreign student group in Japan for the year 2002, behind China, Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia. Thailand was chosen as the focus of the research because of the large number of Thai alumni from Japanese higher educational institutions (HEIs) and the existence of an alumni association.</p>
<p>A questionnaire was one of the main components of the survey and samples were taken from not only the Thai people who had studied at Japanese HEIs between 1954 and 2001 (treatment group), but also those who had not studied abroad but graduated from Thai HEIs (control group) and those who studied at American universities for more than one year during this period. The graduates of American HEIs were selected as a comparison group since the USA has attracted the largest number of foreign students from Asia and is considered to be a successful policy model.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356389012443163">UNESCO (1963–1999)</xref> statistics, the number of Thai students who studied abroad in 1964 was 2,512, which increased to 17,093 or 0.03 percent of the total Thai population in 1996. The most popular destination has been the USA, and its share was 71.2 percent of Thai students studying abroad in 1996. According to the recent OECD statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356389012443163">2003</xref>), however, the percentage of those who study in the USA decreased to 43.3 percent in 2003, followed by Australia (24.6%), UK (11.5%) and Japan (6.0%).</p>
<p>A total of 6,392 Thai students is estimated to have studied at Japanese HEIs between 1954 and 2001 from the statistics of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan: 2,993 (46.9%) were those sponsored by JGSP, 3,153 (49.2%) were self-financed students with the support of the SP, and 246 (3.9%) were sponsored by the Thai government. According to UNESCO and OECD statistics, the number of those who studied at American HEIs during the same period is estimated to be around 81,000, about 13 times larger than that of the Japanese HEIs graduates.</p>
<p>In response to the questionnaires mailed to 600 members of the Old Japan Student Association, Thailand (OJSAT), who were chosen randomly from the alumni association’s name list, 332 replies were collected (response rate was 55.3%). Among the 332 respondents, 165 respondents studied under JGSP, 147 respondents were self-financed students under the SP, and 20 respondents were supported by the Thai Government Scholarship Program.</p>
<p>In response to the mailed questionnaires to 769 members who have odd numbers on the name list of the American University Alumni Association (AUAA), 223 replies were collected as a comparison group (response rate was 29.0%).</p>
<p>Seventy-two replies from the Thai HEIs graduates who had not studied abroad were collected as a control group. They were selected from the colleagues of the Japanese HEIs graduates.</p>
<p>In order to apply the proposed method, ‘matching’ was conducted by choosing only those who were born between 1949 and 1982 from the treatment, control and comparison groups. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1356389012443163">Table 1</xref> shows the main attributes of the three groups after this matching. The attributes of those who studied under JGSP and SP are also shown for the comparison and will be explained later.</p>

<p>The alumni of Japanese HEIs showed more affinity toward the Japanese than the alumni of Thai HEIs with a significant difference. The alumni of American HEIs showed more affinity toward the Americans than the alumni of Thai HEIs but without a significant difference. There was a significant difference between the Japanese and American HEIs alumni in their affinity toward the country of their study.</p>
<p>The recognition of social influence of the alumni of Japanese HEIs is smaller than that of the alumni of American HEIs with a significant difference. An alumnus of a Japanese HEI explained the reasons as follows: ‘Those who graduated from Japanese universities are in the minority so the way of thinking (among the Thai) almost seems to be American style’. According to the academic staff data of the Chulalongkorn University, which is one of the most prestigious national universities in Thailand, among the 12 heads of the departments in the Faculty of Engineering, seven heads are the graduates of American HEIs and one is the graduate of a Japanese HEI. In the Faculty of Science, eight heads are graduates of American HEIs and none are graduates of a Japanese HEI among the 14 department heads. These figures confirm that the alumni of American HEIs are more influential than those of Japanese HEIs, partly because the former outnumber the latter.</p>
<p>Regarding participation in friendship-promotion activities with the country of their study, the percentage is higher among the alumni of the Japanese HEIs than the alumni of the American HEIs with a significant difference. These questionnaire results seem to show the general tendency of the alumni of Japanese HEIs to like the Japanese people more than the average Thai person and to engage in friendship-promotion activities with Japan, though their social influence is much smaller than that of the alumni of American HEIs who outnumber them. We also have to bear in mind that those who chose to study in Japan might have had an affinity toward the Japanese before their study, which should be counted as a selection bias.</p>
<p>Though the treatment and control groups are not sufficiently homogeneous, the choice has been made here to use the data to calculate the standardized effect of Japan’s FSP in the attainment of the objective of ‘fostering pro-Japanese leaders to promote friendship between Japan and Thailand’ in order to demonstrate the application of the proposed method.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1356389012443163">Table 3</xref>, the standardized effect (the SMD between the treatment and the control groups) is calculated to be a 0.315 effect. Though the SMD contains the error caused by the selection bias, the impact of Japan’s FSP is calculated just to demonstrate the proposed method.</p>

<p>To measure efficiency, the cost of Japan’s FSP needs to be ascertained. The FSP has been conducted by MEXT and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA): MEXT mainly oversees the measures in Japan, such as the education and support for the foreign students and provision of scholarships, while MOFA is responsible for the measures overseas such as the recruitment and selection of JGSP students and support for the alumni associations.</p>
<p>As Levin and McEwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356389012443163">2001</xref>: 45) point out, the assumption that the budget will contain all the cost information is usually erroneous because ‘budgets often do not include cost information on all the ingredients used in the intervention’ and omit costs paid by other agencies. In the case of Japan’s FSP, these invisible costs include the extra personnel cost of the academic/administrative staffs in the HEIs to guide and support the foreign students who often do not speak/write Japanese well and the cost borne by the HEIs and local governments for the education and support of the foreign students.</p>
<p>However, it is difficult to estimate these personnel and institutional costs correctly since the level of Japanese-language proficiency varies among the students and the costs borne by the HEIs and local governments for the foreign students are not often differentiated from those of the Japanese students. It should also be pointed out that the cost of the FSP is estimated to be much higher in 1954 when JGSP was started. New educational programs including Japanese-language courses, new academic/administrative staffs, and new facilities including dormitories had to be prepared for the new program. Inexperienced staff had to spend much more time guiding and supporting the foreign students in the beginning. These costs gradually declined as the education and support of foreign students was institutionalized and became part of the regular operation of Japanese HEIs. As such it is difficult to estimate the decline of the initial cost correctly without a detailed survey.</p>
<p>Since these additional costs are difficult to ascertain, the FSP budget of MEXT and MOFA for Thai students will be used in the calculation of efficiency in this article. It is however important to note that the estimated cost based on this budget is much smaller than the true cost that contains the expenditures mentioned above.</p>
<p>The FSP budget of MEXT and MOFA used for Thai students between 1969 and 1999 was calculated by multiplying the program budget by the percentage of Thai students. The annual budget is deflated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in 2000 and then summed up.</p>
<p>The sum total of the FSP budget for Thai students from 1969 to 1999 is calculated to be 30,426 million yen. The efficiency of Japan’s FSP toward Thailand is calculated to be 0.052 effect*person/million yen as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1356389012443163">Table 3</xref>.</p>
<p>JGSP and SP are the main pillars of Japan’s FSP. The Japanese government has used a comparatively large amount of money for JGSP: the JGSP budget used for the Thai students between 1969 and 1999 is calculated to be 26,734 million yen, which was mainly used for the provision of government scholarships, the recruitment and selection of JGSP applicants, and support for their education and living in Japan. The SP budget for the Thai students who study in Japan at their own expense during the same period is 3692 million yen, which was mainly used for the exemption or reduction of their tuition fees, the provision of honorary scholarships, and the support for their education and living in Japan. The total SP budget for Thai students is about one seventh of the total JGSP budget between 1969 and 1999 as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1356389012443163">Table 3</xref>. Since the budgetary inputs of JGSP and SP are so different, their efficiency needs to be examined.</p>
<p>From the main attributes of the responses under JGSP and SP shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1356389012443163">Table 1</xref>, the following differences between the two groups are apparent:</p>
<list id="list4-1356389012443163" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the percentage of female respondents is higher in the JGSP than in the SP respondents;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the percentage of university faculty members is higher, while that of company employees and company owners is lower, in the JGSP than in the SP respondents;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the percentage of those who studied undergraduate courses is higher in the SP while the percentage of those who studied master and doctoral courses is higher in the JGSP respondents than the other group.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Since the OJSAT membership list does not differentiate between those under JGSP and SP, it is not possible to compare the characteristics of the samples and the populations.</p>
<p>The mean and SD of the two respondent groups regarding their affinity toward the Japanese are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1356389012443163">Table 3</xref>. Both the JGSP and the SP groups show higher affinity toward the Japanese than the control group with significant differences. The SP respondents’ affinity toward the Japanese is slightly higher than that of the JGSP, though without a significant difference.</p>
<p>When asked about their motivation to study in Japan, the acquisition of scholarship is the most influential factor for the JGSP respondents, while an interest in the Japanese language is stronger for the SP respondents. There are significant differences between the two groups with regard to these responses. In addition, the SP students’ responses show that they were more capable of understanding (listening to) and reading Japanese while studying than the JGSP students with significant differences. The SP students’ higher interest in and capability in Japanese may have affected their seemingly higher affinity toward the Japanese people.</p>
<p>The standardized effect (SMD) of the JGSP to the objective of ‘fostering pro-Japanese leaders’ is calculated to be 0.327 effect while that of the SP is 0.343 effect as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1356389012443163">Table 3</xref>. The SP shows a higher standardized effect than the JGSP though the figures may include the error caused by selection bias.</p>
<p>The impact and efficiency of JGSP- and SP-sponsored students who started their study in Japan between 1969 and 1999 are calculated based on the SMD, population, and the Japanese government budgetary input into the two programs during the same period. For the JGSP, impact and efficiency were measured to be 814 effect*person and 0.030 effect*person/million yen respectively. For the SP, impact was 837 effect*person and efficiency was 0.227 effect*person/million yen as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1356389012443163">Table 3</xref>. The efficiency of the SP is about 7.6 times higher than that of the JGSP.</p>
<p>Though the calculated figures may not be accurate because of the selection bias, it appears that the SP has higher efficiency than the JGSP. This indicates a need for the further expansion of the SP for the efficient execution of the FSP toward Thailand.</p>
<p>Before concluding this section, the role of OJSAT in the promotion of mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries will be introduced as another proof of this evaluation.</p>
<p>OJSAT was established in 1951 as the first alumni association of Japanese HEIs in the world. It started one of the most prestigious Japanese language schools in Thailand and has published many books introducing Japanese culture and society. The profits derived from the language school and publishing business have provided necessary funds for their activities such as holding seminars on the latest topics in Japan. OJSAT also has co-sponsored the Japan Education Fair and Examination for Japanese Universities with the Japanese Embassy in an effort to promote study in Japan.</p>
<p>In the 1970’s when Japanese investment drastically increased in Thailand, there was a rise of anti-Japanese sentiment among the Thai people. The most symbolic incident was the visit of Prime Minister Tanaka in 1974, who was met with an anti-Japan demonstration. It was so severe that he was unable to leave his car. However, in the late 1980’s when Japanese investment again increased in Thailand, such strong anti-Japanese feeling did not occur among the Thai people. According to the poll survey conducted by the MOFA of Japan, 89 percent of the respondents in Thailand regarded Japan as a friendly country and 69 percent replied affirmatively about Japan’s role in the development of Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356389012443163">Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>According to an official in charge of public relations at the Japanese Embassy in Thailand, this positive change in the sentiment toward the Japanese has been brought about partly by the efforts of OJSAT, as well as the Japanese companies in Thailand, for the promotion of mutual understanding and friendship. These activities of OJSAT have been recognized by the Japan Foundation, an affiliated organization of MOFA, and the representatives of the OJSAT were awarded its Special Prize by the Crown Prince of Japan in 2002.</p>
<p>In this section, we have examined the calculation of the standardized effect, impact, and efficiency of Japan’s FSP, JGSP, and SP regarding the objective of fostering pro-Japanese sentiment to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. Though the calculated figures are not accurate because of the selection bias, we can confirm the general tendency of the Thai alumni of the Japanese HEIs to have affinity with the Japanese and to engage in friendship-promotion activities with Japan, as represented by the activities of OJSAT. Japan’s FSP seems to have had certain positive impact in the attainment of the objective and the SP seems to be more efficient than the JGSP.</p>

<sec id="section4-1356389012443163">
<title>Merits and limitations of the proposed method</title>
<p>The previous sections introduced an evaluation method to measure the standardized effect by using the SMD of the outcomes between the treatment and the control groups. Since the SMD is commensurable, here it is given a unit name ‘effect’ as an expression of the ‘standardized effect’. Based on the assumption that impact is the sum total of the change brought about by the treatment in the population, it is asserted here that impact can be calculated by multiplying the ‘standardized effect’ by the treated population given that the sample represents the population. Extending this logic, it is also asserted that efficiency can be calculated by dividing the impact by the total input of the treatment expressed in a monetary value.</p>
<p>The method was applied to the evaluation of Japan’s FSP toward Thailand though the result contained selection bias. Based on the answers on the Likert scale (continuous variables that lack a true zero) regarding the affinity toward the Japanese between the treatment group and the control group (those who never studied abroad and graduated from Thai HEIs), the standardized effects, impacts and efficiencies of JGSP and SP were calculated and compared. The SP shows a higher standardized effect, impact and efficiency than the JGSP. The result implies that the SP is more efficient than the JGSP in attaining the objective of fostering of pro-Japanese people and promoting friendship with Japan in Thailand.</p>
<p>In the last part of this article, the merits and limitations of the proposed method are summarized.</p>
<p>One of the merits of using a standardized effect measure is that it is possible to compare outcomes across measures even when the indicators lack a true zero. This characteristic of the SMD also makes it easier to measure the synthesized magnitude of the effect by calculating the weighted average of the SMD of different outcome measures, as long as they are continuous variables.</p>
<p>However, this method has several limitations that must be considered before further application. The first is that ‘the statistical effect sizes . . . are not necessarily good guide to the <italic>practical</italic> magnitude of the program effects they represent. Nor is their level of statistical significance indicative of their practical significance’ as pointed out by Rossi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356389012443163">2004</xref>: 314). Although Cohen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012443163">1988</xref>: 25–7) states that effect size (in this case, Cohen’s ‘d’) is small when d = .2, medium when d = .5, and large when d = .8 as a common conventional frame of reference, he also expresses reservations that these terms are relative.</p>
<p>With that being said, it should be kept in mind that the standardized effect expressed by the SMD is a comparative value, of which the significance may differ in different cases. One should be careful in comparing them between different treatments that use a different set of outcome measures.</p>
<p>The second reservation is that a standardized measure of an effect size (SMD) can be misleading in some cases. A SMD is harder to interpret than an ATE expressed in raw units and is affected by the variance in the treatment and the control groups.</p>
<p>The third point is that the existence of reliable data is a pre-requisite of this method. It is ideal to use the result of an RCT. However, if this is not possible, another method that minimizes selection bias must be adopted. Cost estimation should also be undertaken carefully, considering all the factors of cost that are not included in the budget.</p>
<p>We should also note that this kind of quantitative method, based on statistical data analysis, cannot explain the reasons why certain interventions are effective while others are not. The reasons for varying performance may be found not only in the treatment itself, but also within the treated population, which may be uncontrollable. Hence, this kind of quantitative method should be conducted in combination with qualitative analysis to explore these factors further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356389012443163">Bamberger and Fujita, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering these limitations, the proposed method should only be used when reliable ATE data are available and when it is difficult to compare effect, impact and efficiency in raw units. This method can also be used to show the synthesized effect of different outcome measures if all the outcome measures are continuous variables.</p>
<p>Standardized effect is a relative value and the utility of this method should be tested further by comparing more data, with the co-operation of evaluators and development workers.</p>
