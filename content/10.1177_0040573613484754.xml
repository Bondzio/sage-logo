<sec id="sec1-0040573613484754" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In an earlier article I argued that the Zion tradition was created in David’s time as David’s imperial ideology to justify his imperial expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484754">1</xref></sup> As I noted in that article,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484754">2</xref></sup> my argument depended on the assumption that the material in 2 Samuel and 1 Kings about the imperial extension of David and Solomon’s realm rested on actual historical memory and was not just late glorification of shadowy, insignificant tribal chieftains or, even worse, historical romance about fictional characters that never existed. In the ongoing debate between the so-called minimalists and maximalists, even some of the maximalists have begun to radically downplay the extent of David’s reported conquests, with little justification in my opinion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484754">3</xref></sup> In this second article I will try to show why the claims of the biblical texts should be taken as history, not legend, and why they are quite believable traditions for the area and period at the beginning of the first millennium <sc>bce</sc>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573613484754"><title>The Kingdoms Conquered by David Were Not Major Powers</title>
<p>In the first place, one should note that the states and kingdoms that David is reported to have conquered (2 Sam 5:6–12, 17–25; 8:1–14; 10:1–11:1; 12:26–31; 21:15–22; 22:8–39; 1 Kgs 11:14–25) were not impressive ancient powers like Egypt, Assyria, or Babylon. The Amalekites were only a nomadic people, and the Philistines, Edom, Moab, and Ammon were regional states, none of which occupied significantly more territory or supported a significantly larger population than the combined tribes of Israel and Judah, which occupied territory on both sides of the Jordan. In terms of population and territorial extent, David’s most formidable opponent appears to have been Hadadezer, the Aramean king of Zobah, who from his power base in the northern Bekah Valley and the northern edge of the Anti-Lebanon range had expanded his control south over the Damascus region, and north far more loosely toward the Euphrates. While Hadadezer apparently could claim the allegiance of related Aramean tribal groups farther north across the Euphrates (2 Sam 10:16), he was unable to incorporate the city state of Hamath much closer but still to the north of his power base (2 Sam 8:9–11).</p>
<p>Despite the impressive resources of the Arameans of Zobah, however, David’s most difficult fighting seems to have been in his early years with the Philistines. When one looks at the list of David’s military heroes and most famous elite warriors (2 Sam 21:15–22; 23:8–39), most of them won their fame in the Philistine wars, one achieved his fame in the war against the Moabites, and one by killing an Egyptian. The Aramean wars are not explicitly mentioned at all. David’s ultimate victory over the Philistines is indicated by the makeup of his royal bodyguard that consisted of Philistine mercenaries—the Gittites, Cherethites, and Pelethites (2 Sam 8:18; 15:18–22). No analogous tradition for a Philistine palace guard is attested for any king after Solomon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573613484754"><title>The Chronology of the Conquests</title>
<p>Because we have only summaries, lists of royal officers and heroes, and bits and pieces of tradition in narratives that were primarily serving other purposes, it is difficult to reconstruct the actual chronological sequence of David’s imperial wars. It appears, however, that his first wars began as defensive wars against the Philistines until he eventually subdued them in his early years, in the process honing a very effective professional army with a very able officer corps (2 Sam 5:17–25; 8:1). His wars against Edom (2 Sam 8:11–14) and Moab (2 Sam 8:2) probably followed his success against the Philistines. It was presumably his success against these kingdoms that made the advisors of Hanan, the new king of Ammon, suspicious of David’s motivations for sending diplomatic condolences when Hanan’s father Nahash, David’s old ally, died (2 Sam 10:1–8). The resulting war with Ammon and the siege of its capital, Rabbat-Ammon, led to David’s first conflict with the Aramean Hadad-ezer of Zobah, whom the Ammonites had paid to come to their aid. The Arameans fled from the numerically inferior, but far more professional army of David’s general Joab, and the Ammonite capital, Rabbat-Ammon, either remained under siege, or the siege was recommenced the following spring. (The ability of well-disciplined, battle-hardened troops led by experienced officers to defeat numerically superior and sometimes vastly superior, but inexperienced, poorly led, and less disciplined troops is evident from the German army’s success against France, against British and American troops in North Africa, and especially against Russian armies in the east during the first few years of World War II.) Rabbat-Ammon fell after a prolonged siege, and with its fall the rest of the Ammonite territory was subdued (2 Sam 12:26–31). Apparently sometime during this thorough conquest of Ammon, the Arameans made another attempt to disrupt David’s expansion in northern Trans-Jordan, but they were again defeated in a decisive battle (2 Sam 10:15–19), and David is reported to have put garrisons in the southern Aramean region of Damascus (2 Sam 8:6). The tradition also suggests that David’s army made plundering raids into the very heart of Hadadezer’s power base, taking much booty from his cities of Berothai and Betah (2 Sam 8:3–12).</p>
<p>There may have been a revolt in Edom while David’s armies were occupied in the northern Trans-Jordan and Aramean territory, but Joab apparently put down this revolt in very bloody fashion, and Edom was also garrisoned (2 Sam 8:13–14; cf. Ps 60:1). Indirect proof for this garrisoning of at least the eastern and northeastern territories is provided by the account of Absalom’s revolt against David. When Absalom led his large army of combined tribal militias against Jerusalem, David had to abandon his capital, since he had only a relatively small body of troops in Jerusalem, consisting primarily of his palace guard. He fled across the Jordan to the northeast, and only there was he able to assemble the bulk of his professional army, many of whom may have been on garrison duty. It is worth noting that he received support from the former Ammonite capital, from Shobi, another son of Nahash, the earlier king of Ammon (2 Sam 17:27–29). Indirect proof for David’s control of Damascus and Edom is also provided by the rather specific traditions that the sole survivor of the ruling house of Edom only returned to Edom sometime during the reign of Solomon, and an Aramean warlord only regained control of Damascus during the same period (1 Kgs 11:14–25).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040573613484754"><title>David’s March to the Euphrates and the Western Ideal for Conquerors</title>
<p>There is an obscure notice that David engaged the Arameans as he returned from setting up or renewing his monument at the Euphrates (2 Sam 8:3; 1 Chron 18:3), but this notice is often dismissed out of hand as historical fiction or reduced to insignificance by identifying the river Purat, not as the Euphrates, but as a minor wadi only a few miles northeast of Jerusalem. The idea that David may have marched to the Euphrates to set up a monument there is not that far-fetched, however, when one considers the ancient ideals for kings with imperial pretensions.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0040573613484754"><title>The Mesopotamian ideal</title>
<p>In Mesopotamia, the model for all pretentious conquerors was Sargon the Great of Akkad in the late third millennium <sc>bce</sc>, who marched against his Sumerian enemies to the south, thoroughly defeating them and marching all the way to the shore of the Persian Gulf, where his army ritually washed their weapons in the sea. Then he turned north and west, where he conquered all of Middle and Upper Mesopotamia, crossed the Euphrates and took Ebla in north Syria, and marched all the way to the Cedar Forest and the Silver Mountain in the Lebanon or Amanus, and perhaps into Anatolia, but certainly to the Mediterranean.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484754">4</xref></sup> His third successor, Naram-Sin, also claims to have taken Ebla and Aleppo (Arman) in the west, duplicating Sargon’s march to the Mediterranean.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484754">5</xref></sup> Both Sargon and Naram-Sin could rightfully claim to have ruled from the upper sea (the Mediterranean) to the lower sea (the Persian Gulf), and this became the ideal for any great Mesopotamian king to emulate. Relatively few Mesopotamian rulers were actually capable of achieving this goal on any long-term basis, but many rulers of Assyria and Upper and Middle Mesopotamia did at least march to the Mediterranean. Yahdun-Lim of Mari, a contemporary of Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria, claimed to be the first king of Mari to reach the Mediterranean, where his troops bathed in the sea, and to have cut timber in the Cedar and Boxwood mountains.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484754">6</xref></sup> He set up a monument there and claims to have imposed a permanent tribute on the land on the shore of the sea, but any hegemony he may have enjoyed over this area was extremely short-lived. A few years later his enemy, Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria, who conquered Mari, claims to have set up his inscription in the land of Lebanon on the shore of the Great Sea.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484754">7</xref></sup> With the rise of the Hittite empire and Mitanni, access to the Mediterranean was effectively denied to Assyria until the collapse of those states, but after they fell, Assyria kept pushing to reach the sea. Tiglath-pileser I (1114–1076 <sc>bce</sc>) marched to Mount Lebanon, took tribute from Byblos, Sidon, and Arvad, and enjoyed a boat ride on the Mediterranean,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484754">8</xref></sup> but during the latter half of his reign, the Arameans were threatening the Assyrian heartland itself. Ashur-bel-kala (1073–1056<sc> bce</sc>) again reached Mount Lebanon and rode in boats of Arvad on the Mediterranean, but by the end of his reign the Arameans were again threatening Assyria. It was not until the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883–859<sc> bce</sc>) that the Assyrians again marched to the Lebanon and the Mediterranean and took tribute from the rulers of the sea coast as far south as Tyre and Sidon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484754">9</xref></sup> Despite Ashurnasirpal’s successes, however, his successor, Shalmaneser III (858–824<sc> bce</sc>), had to fight hard to reconquer the trans-Euphrates region and the northern Mediterranean seacoast. Neither the north Syrian nor the south Syrian defensive leagues gave in easily to Shalmaneser. By the end of his reign, which was marked by a revolt led by one of his sons, Assyria was again in a period of weakness. His successor, Shamshi-Adad V (823–811<sc> bce</sc>), had to put down the revolt, and, following that, his attention was focused on Babylon to the south. Adad-narari III (810–783<sc> bce</sc>), faced a revolt of Arpad in north Syria, but he apparently put down the revolt, then subdued Damascus, and took tribute from all the western states, including Tyre, Sidon, Samaria, Edom, and Philistia, as far as the great sea. Shamshi-ilu, the field marshal of Shalmaneser IV (782–773<sc> bce</sc>), also campaigned successfully against Damascus in 773 <sc>bce</sc>, but under Ashur-dan III (772–755<sc> bce</sc>) and Ashur-narari V (754–745<sc> bce</sc>) Assyria was in decline, and its control even of northern Syria slipped. It was not until Tiglath-pileser III’s (745–727<sc> bce</sc>) campaigns to the west, beginning with the conquest of Arpad in 743–740<sc> bce</sc>, that Assyria’s rulers again reached the Mediterranean Sea, but Tiglath-pileser and his successors through Ashurbanipal were ultimately successful beyond even their Sargonic model. They did, in fact, despite temporary setbacks, rule from sea to sea, and they were able to maintain this rule over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Looking back over this history, up until Tiglath-pileser III and his successors, many if not most of these marches to the sea were plundering raids that had nothing to do with permanent control of most of the territory crossed. When even a quite modest, well-organized and well-armed body of plundering troops were spotted making an unexpected move through a region, unless they were confronted by a very powerful kingdom prepared for such a move, the typical response in antiquity was for the fortified cities to shut their gates, and for the rural tribes to take their women and flocks and disappear into the steppe until the raiding army passed by. Isolated fortified cities might pay tribute to get the enemy army to pass on if they were threatening enough, but the casualties of such raids were normally the relatively few unfortunates caught by surprise in the open by raiding parties. Apart from some notable Assyrian exceptions, prolonged sieges of well-fortified and well-defended cities were not the norm for such long-distant campaigns, particularly in the second and first part of the first millennium.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0040573613484754"><title>The western ideal</title>
<p>This ideal of rule from Sea to Sea was known in Israel (Zech 9:10; Ps 72:8), probably borrowed from Mesopotamia. The traditions of Sargon the Great’s wide-reaching conquests were known in Palestine as elsewhere in the ancient Near East. A copy of the Sargon legend, “King of Battle,” was actually found at Megiddo. Nonetheless, this ideal did not really fit the situation in Israel. Israel lived so near the Mediterranean that it was no big deal that their rule should stretch from the Mediterranean to another point. On the other hand, no Israelite ruler in the whole monarchal period had the remotest hope of extending his rule as far as the lower Sea, the Persian Gulf. Another model existed in southern Syria and Palestine, that of the great Egyptian conquerors of the mid-second millennium, whose claim to fame was their successful campaigns against Mitanni all the way to the Euphrates, the River. Thus the western ideal of imperial rule extended from the River to the ends of the earth (Zech 9:10; Ps 72:8), or from the sea to the River (Ps 80:12), or with an allusion to the cosmogonic myth, from the Sea to the Rivers (Ps 89:26). We know from the Aramaic inscriptions of a servant of Hazael, the Aramean king of Damascus, that Hazael marched to the Euphrates in the late ninth century,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484754">10</xref></sup> and there is no reason to doubt that David could have made such a march a century earlier, in the first half of the tenth century. After David’s initial and impressive defeats of Hadadezer’s main armies, there was little to block such a raid north to the Euphrates. Hamath was David’s ally and unlikely to challenge his march north, and there is little evidence that the territory between Hamath and the Euphrates that David’s army would have to cross was thickly settled with powerful kingdoms that would necessarily block such a march. This whole area had been overrun by semi-nomadic Aramean tribes in the latter part of Tiglath-pileser I’s reign, and even the Assyrian heartland was threatened by these tribal groups, so the situation in David’s time was quite different, being more fluid and more open than both the earlier and later periods of strong regional powers, with well-fortified cities trying to resist Assyrian expansion.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0040573613484754"><title>The Wealth of the United Monarchy</title>
<p>According to the biblical record, David’s conquests brought abundant booty, tribute, and wealth to his kingdom (2 Sam 8:2, 6–8, 10–12; 12:30), and the wealth said to have been amassed by Solomon during his long reign was enormous (1 Kgs 4:20–28; 10:1–29). Yet despite the narrator’s obvious nationalistic pride in his country’s wealth during its golden age of the united monarchy, there is no reason to dismiss these accounts as wildly exaggerated, much less as fictional. From the Assyrian accounts of the booty and tribute that they took from the tribal and city states along the Euphrates and its tributaries, it is clear that even moderate-sized states on a major trade route could amass enormous wealth in a relatively short time. Judah in the late eighth century<sc> bce</sc> under Ahaz and Hezekiah controlled only a limited portion of the two-way southern trade routes from Arabia and farther east and south that continued on to the Mediterranean and regions farther west, but the transit tax on this trade was enough to make the Judean state wealthy. The Toronto archaeologist John Holladay, based on the Assyrian tribute figures for this period, calculated the Judean kingdom’s income from this transit tax during the reigns of Ahaz and Hezekiah as running somewhere in the neighborhood of five million dollars per year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484754">11</xref></sup> In the approximately thirty years between Ahaz’s payment of tribute to Tiglath-pileser III in 733–732<sc> bce</sc>, and Hezekiah’s payment of tribute to Sennacherib in 701, the Judean treasury had to accumulate a surplus of almost $50 million in gold and silver bullion over and above its expenses in paying its military and royal officials to maintain this transit tax system and other government services, not to mention the yearly tribute due to Assyria that continued until Hezekiah’s revolt in 705<sc> bce</sc>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613484754">12</xref></sup> In the tenth century<sc> bce</sc>, at least until toward the end of Solomon’s reign, the Davidic-Solomonic empire controlled access to the Mediterranean for almost the whole of the southern trade routes, so the wealth from the transit tax that poured into the empire’s coffers would have been significantly greater than that for the far more partial and limited control exercised by eighth-century Judah. The story of the visit of the Queen of Sheba to the Solomonic court underscores the importance of good relations between the spice traders of South Arabia and the Solomonic state that controlled their access to distant markets (1 Kgs 10:1–13). Solomon’s wealth was also augmented by his seaborne trade, in league with Hiram of Tyre, from Ezion-geber on the shores of the Red Sea, along the coast of Africa (1 Kgs 9:26–28; 10:11–12, 22). Moreover, the tenth-century empire also profited from the initial Davidic conquests and the enormous plunder and booty associated with those conquests, and, following those conquests, from the continuing yearly tribute from the vassal states. In the ninth century<sc> bce</sc>, king Mesha of Moab is reported to have delivered to the Omride dynasty of Israel a yearly tribute of “one hundred thousand lambs, and the wool of one hundred thousand rams” (2 Kgs 3:4). Even allowing for an element of exaggeration, such yearly tribute from all of Israel’s surrounding vassals in the tenth century would obviously have enhanced the empire’s balance sheet significantly. If eighth-century Judah was wealthy even without such annual tribute, the advantages of the dominant united monarchy of the tenth century would have made it far wealthier. Great wealth, however, does not prevent governments from deficit spending, and there are indications that Solomon’s massive building projects eventually led to at least short-term economic difficulties that led to strains with his ally Hiram of Tyre (1 Kgs 9:10–14) and probably played a major role in the northern tribes’ ultimately negative attitude toward his administration (1 Kgs 11:26–40; 12:1–19). The loss of Damascus and Edom in the last years of Solomon (1 Kgs 11:14–25) would also have affected the state’s income, and cannot have helped Solomon’s popularity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0040573613484754"><title>Two Other Arguments against Historicity</title>
<p>Two other arguments have been urged against the historicity of the biblical account of David’s reign and imperial expansion. Some scholars have argued that the archaeological record does not support the account of David’s conquests because of a lack of destruction layers in Palestine that may be attributed to David’s period, and others argue that Hebrew writing was not sufficiently developed in the tenth century to produce such sophisticated Hebrew narrative prose as that found in the David narratives in 1–2 Samuel.</p>
<sec id="sec9-0040573613484754"><title>Archaeology</title>
<p>The first argument seems to imply that the seven-year civil war between David and the followers of Saul must have resulted in conquered and destroyed cities that would have left a clear archaeological trace, or that David’s expansion in the north and against the Philistines must have resulted in such. There is little in the biblical text to justify such an assumption, however. The biblical account says little to nothing about David’s destruction of cities in Israelite territory or even in Philistine territory. The only prolonged siege that one reads about is the siege of the Ammonite Rabbah (2 Sam 12:26–31). If one were looking for archaeological remains of David’s conquests, the place to look would be in Ammonite or Edomite territory, not in Israel, and even then, minus an inscribed stela, ideally in a stratified level, attributing the destruction of the site to David, the archaeological evidence would remain quite ambiguous. Dyed-in-the-wool minimalists would probably not even accept the evidence of a stela. When an Aramaic stela from the late ninth century was found at Dan that mentioned “[Jeho]ram son of […] king of Israel and [Ahaz]ayahu son of […kin]g of the house of David (<italic>byt dwd</italic>),” the Israelite and Judean rulers killed in Jehu’s coup in 842 <sc>bce</sc>, some minimalists egregiously accused the Israeli archaeologist of forging the inscription, and others attempted to avoid the clear mention of David as the founder of the Judean dynasty by the idiotic rendering of the key expression <italic>byt dwd</italic> as “the house of Dod.” The obvious rendering of the expression <italic>byt dwd</italic> is “house of David,” since Aramaic and Hebrew kingdoms were often referred to by the word for house followed by the name of the founder of the ruling dynasty, and according to Israelite tradition, David was the founder of the continuing Judean dynasty. The Assyrians, for example, often referred to Israel as <italic>bit humri</italic>, “the house of Omri,” after the founder of one of Israel’s most illustrious dynasties. Moreover the specific expression <italic>byt dwd</italic>, “house of David,” continues to be attested as a common way of referring to the Judean royal court in late eighth-century Judah (Isa 7:2, 13). In contrast, the rendering of <italic>byt dwd</italic> as “house of Dod” or “house of the uncle” is completely unparalleled and totally ad hoc; it is obviously adopted for no other reason than to avoid the disturbing inscriptional evidence for the supposedly fictional David as the actual founder of the Judean dynasty dating less than two hundred years from David’s accession to the throne.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0040573613484754"><title>Writing</title>
<p>The second argument is simply an argument from silence. Writing of various sorts is referred to often enough in the narrative sources of the Deuteronomistic History (Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, 1 Samuel–2 Kings), but since the date of those sources is in dispute, those references are often dismissed or downplayed. There are relatively few preserved Hebrew inscriptions from any century prior to the Babylonian exile, though the preservation of authentic and sophisticated oracles from the eighth-century Hebrew prophets and traditions about writing reflected in their oracles make it clear that writing was well known by the eighth century. Since the normal writing material used in Israel during the monarchy was pen and ink on papyrus or leather, or in some cases ink on pottery sherds, few remains of this material have been preserved. Papyrus and leather documents seldom survive long in the Palestinian climate unless very carefully preserved, so there was never much hope of discovering any significant trove of such documents from the pre-exilic period in Israel. During the early excavations in Israel, no one was looking for writing on potsherds, so the question of how much written material on that medium was lost due to the careless way potsherds were treated early on remains unanswerable. There are references in the sources to monumental inscriptions on stone stela, presumably similar to Mesha’s Moabite stela, but inscribed stone stela are seldom preserved intact. Left in enemy territory they are apt to be broken or effaced by the enemy, and usable stones, whether inscribed or not, were often reused secondarily for building purposes, both of which happened to the Aramaic stela at Dan. Indeed, there are only a handful of inscribed West Semitic stela preserved in all of western Asia. That is not really compelling evidence that few West Semitic rulers set up such stela; it is more likely simply one of the accidents of history that most of the stela they set up were destroyed or for other reasons remain undiscovered. In short, the lack of preserved written material clearly datable to the tenth century is not particularly surprising and provides no really compelling reason for denying the possibility of sophisticated written Hebrew literature from that period. An argument from silence simply cannot bear the weight that these critics hang on it.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0040573613484754"><title>The Theological Relevance of Historicity</title>
<p>Finally, particularly for a theological journal like <italic>Theology Today</italic>, one must ask the question what theological difference, if any, the historicity of the Davidic narratives makes. One should certainly not claim that historicity was a necessary component of genuine revelation in Scripture, since so much of Scripture consists of diverse literary genres that are anything but historical in nature. Even today religious truth is very often communicated better by fictional genres than by history; one need only look at the enduring legacy of writers like C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien as confirmation of this point. On the other hand, the theological value of religious writings that make historical claims and base their argument on these claims, as the Deuteronomistic History certainly does, must to some extent be judged on the basis of the actual historicity of those claims. That does not mean that every detail in the historical narrative must be confirmed—that never happens even in modern historical writing, where both the details and the overriding interpretation of those details are often challenged by rival historians with different interpretations—but unless there is some underlying factual basis for the narrative, one may simply dismiss any theological claims based on that historical narrative. If David and Solomon never existed and the united monarchy was simply a figment of later writers’ imagination, it is hard to take very seriously God’s choice of and promise to David and Jerusalem as a basis for future hope, as prophets like Isaiah (Isa 7:1–9; 8:23–9:1–6; 14:32; 29:1–8) and Jeremiah (Jer 23:5–6; 33:14–26) did, and as Christians, who see Jesus as both the son of David and Son of God (Rom 1:3), continue to do. At some point, at least for the theology of a credal religion like historic Christianity, historicity does matter.</p>
