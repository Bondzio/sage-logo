<p>If it is the case, as Walter Benjamin once wrote, that “every epoch dreams the one to follow,” then perhaps it is in the desert oasis of Las Vegas, a proverbial dream factory if ever there was one, that key features of 21st-century capitalism were being dreamt some 70 years ago. Over the course of these seven decades, the service sector has grown to become by far the largest occupational category in the United States, and leisure industries (or the “experience economy”) have grown to multibillion dollar proportions, in the United States and around the world. Moreover, the no-tax and regulatory-lax environment that existed in the 1940s Nevada (in stark contrast to the postwar Fordist regime that dominated elsewhere) has become an increasingly generalized model globally. This is especially evident in a financial sector that is to a startling degree abstracted from the brick-and-mortar economy and that now gives a new and more expansive meaning to the term <italic>casino capitalism</italic> as a normative mode of capital accumulation, one in which the house enjoys inexorable advantage. What happened in Vegas, it turns out, has not stayed in Vegas at all. And if this is the case, a return to the source promises abundant conceptual riches, and these are indeed delivered in Jeffrey Sallaz’s <italic>The Labor Luck: Casino Capitalism in the United States and South Africa</italic>.</p>
<p>As a researcher, Sallaz combines qualities that are difficult to find even in isolation: exceptionally rigorous devotion to ethnographic fieldwork alongside an expansive and creative attention to the role of history and social structure in shaping local outcomes. At its base, the book derives from extensive participant observation of casino blackjack in Las Vegas and in South Africa. Here, Sallaz performs exemplary workplace ethnography for an age when the casino floor may be closer than the factory floor to providing a template for understanding modal experiences of labor. Sallaz discovers in the process two strikingly different regimes of labor control: hegemonic control in the case of Nevada and coercive control in South Africa. Given that both cases examine the same game being dealt, one in which the house edge is always at its base “just math,” and since Sallaz shows that labor practices in South African and Nevadan casinos once looked basically the same, this divergence opens up fascinating questions and leads Sallaz to extend his analysis from the immediacy of the casino floor to broader contextual factors, including a challenging and insightful engagement with the differential impacts of globalization.</p>
<p>The first part of the book offers an engagingly descriptive characterization of the operative labor regimes in Las Vegas and South Africa, via observations in two specific sites, “Silver State” and “Gold City” casinos. At Silver State, the management of the labor force is hegemonic, which is to say that blackjack dealers are encouraged to take an entrepreneurial stance toward their labor via the game-within-a-game of hustling player tips. This game is less exotic than you might think; millions of baristas, bartenders, and waitrons are playing their own version of it every day. Allowing player tips, which siphon gambler dollars out of circulation and a probable final resting place in the casino till, may seem like an extraordinary concession for casino management to offer. However, the enterprise receives substantial compensation for this largesse, not least that it leads both players and dealers to massively inflate their own sense of agency at the tables, and keeps both sides playing at maximum intensity a game that in the long view has only one real winner. At the blackjack table we witness, not uniquely but more strikingly than elsewhere, something Weber would not have anticipated: the combination of an intensely rational system (a game based in iron laws of probability, its integrity supported by the world’s most sophisticated system of surveillance) with the most ludicrous forms of magical thinking, harmlessly (for the bottom line) distributed among players, dealers, and even management.</p>
<p>No such fun is being had at Gold City, at least not for the dealers. Here, tips are strictly banned, something which, surprisingly, the gamblers resent as much as the dealers, since it denies them the opportunity to enter into a thoroughly illusory collusion with their servers. This is not the only place that Gold City sacrifices customer satisfaction to strip dealers of any vestiges of agency, the most obnoxious being the relentless requirement that dealers “show hands” after every round (proving there is no ace up their sleeve), in contrast to Vegas where it is only done when one dealer relieves another. Both casinos employ state-of-the-art surveillance technology, but it is only in South Africa that panoptic discipline is the central fact of the dealer’s workplace experience. Whereas Silver State elicits “buy-in” from its staff, Gold City rules by the most coercive means possible.</p>
<p>Following the precepts of Michael Burawoy’s extended case method, Sallaz shifts in the second half to a historical examination of gaming in Nevada and South Africa to tackle the problem of why these casinos are so strikingly different their strategies of labor control. In other words, he extends from the minute observations of the milieu to a theoretical account of broader structural forces. Here we find a paradox—globalization, at least in some renderings, should increase isomorphism among similar enterprises, as the neoliberal template traverses the world. Here, South Africa is an especially interesting case, because it was thrust into a fairly mature global economy from which it had formerly been a pariah, the timing strikingly correspondent to a similar “baptism by fire” for the nations of the former Soviet Union. In fact, most of what has written about these territories’ abrupt inclusion in capitalist globalization, following the collapse of despised regimes, stresses their quick capitulation to the neoliberal vulgate. Sallaz challenges this view persuasively and shows how the end of apartheid actually led to a reduction of casino agency in the labor market that translated to increased disciplinary practice on the casino floor. Meanwhile, as noted above, Nevada gambling continued to operate in a lax regulatory environment that once was an outlier in the United States but increasingly has become a national and international template.</p>
<p>Sallaz’s examination of this history is extensive to the point of exhaustion, and it is the case that the second half of the book is a much tougher slog than the first (particularly because the postwar period of Vegas’ explosive growth features fewer colorful mobsters than one would hope). Despite the fact that Sallaz really has produced a coherent theoretical analysis—one of exceptional relevance to understanding new regimes of work and the structures of global capitalism more generally—it occasionally and perhaps inevitably produces the sensation of reading two different books. Certainly, I found myself wishing as the book stretched on that more explicit work be done to keep the history tethered to the ethnography. Nonetheless, this is a highly impressive accomplishment that signals the arrival of a major new talent in the discipline, a master of theoretically informed ethnography on the cutting edge of studying work, economic sociology, and globalization.</p>
