<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> Homework can have beneficial effects for students; however, it presents challenges, particularly for students with attention problems. Although effective homework interventions exist, intervention development and evaluation has been hampered by the lack of psychometrically sound measures. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the construct validity of the Homework Performance Questionnaire (HPQ), Parent and Teacher Versions, in a sample of children with ADHD. A secondary purpose was to examine variations in homework performance as a function of individual characteristics, such as academic achievement, quality of the family–school relationship, and child’s diagnostic status. <bold>Method:</bold> The sample included 91 children (34% female) with ADHD in Grades 2 to 6. Measures included parent and teacher ratings of homework performance and the quality of the parent–teacher relationship as well as direct assessment of child academic achievement and homework performance (i.e., samples of completed assignments). Correlational analyses were used to examine construct validity, and ANOVAs were used to evaluate group differences. <bold>Results:</bold> Each factor of the HPQ had a significant relationship with other measures of relevant constructs. There were no significant differences in homework performance between groups for ADHD subtype, medication status, or comorbidity, with the exception of learning disability. Children with ADHD and learning disabilities had significantly lower teacher ratings of academic competence. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Results of the present study suggest that HPQ scores may be used to make valid inferences about the homework performance of children with attention problems. These rating scales may be helpful in progress monitoring and evaluating intervention effectiveness.</p>

<p>Homework, or work assigned by teachers to be completed outside of instructional time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711416795">Cooper, 1989</xref>), may have beneficial effects on educational development. For example, homework provides opportunities to practice and master skills, apply concepts, and develop study skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711416795">Keith &amp; Keith, 2006</xref>). Research suggests a positive relationship between homework (i.e., amount of homework completed, time spent working) and academic performance (i.e., standardized test scores, grades; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711416795">Cooper, 2001</xref>), particularly for students in middle and high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711416795">Cooper, Robinson, &amp; Patall, 2006</xref>). Effect sizes are generally in the moderate to large range; however, these studies are limited by the lack of a systematic assessment of homework (i.e., homework performance typically is defined by only one indicator, such as amount of time spent working; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711416795">Cooper et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, homework provides opportunities for parent–child interaction and family involvement in education, and homework is a natural means of regular communication between families and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711416795">Olympia, Sheridan, Jenson, &amp; Andrews, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>As indicated, homework has several benefits; however, it can be quite challenging for many children and families. If assignments are too difficult, children may become frustrated or parent–child conflict may increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711416795">Power, Karustis, &amp; Habboushe, 2001</xref>). In addition, family–school relationships may be compromised if homework arouses tension between parents and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711416795">Cooper et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Children with attention problems, including those with ADHD, frequently have challenges related to homework. For example, children with increased levels of inattention often fail to record assignments correctly, make careless mistakes on assignments, and forget to bring homework materials home or return them to school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711416795">Langberg, Arnold, Flowers, Altaye, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711416795">Langberg, Arnold, Flowers, Epstein, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711416795">Power, Werba, Watkins, Angelucci, &amp; Eiraldi, 2006</xref>). The homework difficulties of children with ADHD may be associated with heightened levels of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711416795">Karustis, Power, Rescorla, Eiraldi, &amp; Gallagher, 2000</xref>). In addition, children with ADHD and learning problems have more homework difficulties than children with ADHD without learning problems, although existing research suggests that the group differences are small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711416795">Langberg, Arnold, Flowers, Altaye, et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, children with ADHD and homework problems may experience impairment in their relationships with parents and teachers because of challenging behavior during homework sessions and failure to complete assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711416795">Power et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Interventions such as goal setting and contingency contracting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711416795">Miller &amp; Kelley, 1994</xref>), conjoint behavioral consultation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711416795">Weiner, Sheridan, &amp; Jenson, 1998</xref>), and self-management strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711416795">Axelrod, Zhe, Haugen, &amp; Klein, 2009</xref>) have been shown to be effective in improving homework performance. In addition, the behavioral treatment included in the Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD (MTA) has been shown to have a positive impact on homework functioning for children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711416795">Langberg, Arnold, Flowers, Epstein, et al., 2010</xref>). However, research related to the development and evaluation of homework interventions has been limited by the lack of appropriate measures of homework performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711416795">Langberg, Arnold, Flowers, Epstein, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711416795">Power et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, data-based decision making for students with homework problems has been hampered because of the limited availability of measures for intervention planning and progress monitoring.</p>
<p>To date, two scales have been developed to measure homework performance. The Homework Problem Checklist (HPC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711416795">Anesko, Schoiock, Ramirez, &amp; Levine, 1987</xref>) is a 20-item, parent-report measure developed to evaluate homework difficulties. Recent research has revealed that the HPC assesses two factors (i.e., Inattention/Avoidance of Homework and Poor Productivity/Nonadherence With Homework Rules; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711416795">Power et al., 2006</xref>). HPC scores may be useful in screening and outcome assessment; however, several limitations should be noted. The scale is deficit focused, which does not inform the development of interventions based on strength building, and it does not include a teacher-report version. Given that teachers are involved in school-based aspects of homework (e.g., assigning work, receiving and grading returned assignments), and parents’ involvement with homework is limited to the home environment, teachers and parents observe different components of homework performance. Therefore, parent and teacher reports may provide complementary information about children’s homework behavior and skills. In addition, many items on the HPC cross-load with symptoms of ADHD, which makes it difficult to measure homework performance independent of symptoms of this disorder.</p>
<p>The Homework Performance Questionnaire (HPQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711416795">Power, Dombrowski, Watkins, Mautone, &amp; Eagle, 2007</xref>) was developed in partnership with parents and teachers to address some of the measurement difficulties related to homework performance assessment. The HPQ includes a parent and teacher version and has been developed for students in first through eighth grades. The parent-report version is unique in that items focus on homework strengths, and items were designed to assess homework performance independent of <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711416795">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) ADHD symptoms. The teacher-report version, which is also strength based and does not include items that directly measure ADHD symptoms, is the first teacher-report measure of homework performance.</p>
<p>The HPQ–Parent Version (HPQ-P) includes 35 items that load on three factors. Student Task Orientation/Efficiency includes items that assess homework behavior (e.g., child is ready to start homework on time, child works steadily on homework), and the Student Competence factor assesses parent perceptions of the child’s academic skills/preparedness to do homework (e.g., child understands how to do homework, homework is easy for child). This factor can also be considered a method of examining instructional match or the extent to which homework difficulty level is consistent with the child’s academic skill level. Finally the Teacher Support factor includes items to assess the extent to which parents and teachers collaborate related to homework (e.g., teacher and parent have similar expectations, teachers understand homework challenges). The HPQ–Teacher Version (HPQ-T) is comprised of 22 items on two factors. Student Responsibility items assess homework behavior (e.g., organizes necessary materials, turns assignments in on time), and Student Competence items assess academic skills or instructional match (e.g., has ability to complete homework independently, assignments are easy for child). Alpha coefficients range from .77 to .82 for the three factors on the Parent Version and from .86 to .90 for the two factors on the Teacher Version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711416795">Power et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the relationship between homework and educational functioning, the potential for homework to foster family involvement in education, and the need for effective interventions to address homework challenges, there clearly is a need for measures to more accurately assess homework problems and strengths from the perspective of parents and teachers, independent of other constructs. The refinement of measurement issues can be highly useful in developing homework interventions and monitoring treatment effectiveness.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the present study was to examine the construct validity of the HPQ-P and HPQ-T in a sample of elementary school–aged children with ADHD likely to be in need of interventions targeting homework problems, based on their diagnosis of ADHD and the presence of parent-reported homework difficulties. Given that measure validity should be examined with each population with which the measure will be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711416795">American Educational Research Association, 1999</xref>) and the fact that children with ADHD frequently experience functional impairment related to homework performance, validation of the HPQ in a sample of children with ADHD is important.</p>
<p>A second purpose of the present study was to understand how homework performance varies as a function of child characteristics. More specifically, the following research questions and hypotheses were addressed:</p>
<list id="list1-1087054711416795" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To what extent do HPQ scores relate to other measures of homework and academic performance? It was hypothesized that there would be a negative relationship between parent-rated homework problems on the HPC and parent and teacher ratings of homework performance on the HPQ. It was further hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between parent and teacher ratings on the HPQ and academic achievement scores as well as scores on a naturalistic indicator of homework performance (i.e., rates of accuracy on children’s actual homework samples).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To what extent do parent ratings of teacher support of homework performance, as assessed by the HPQ, relate to parent and teacher ratings of the quality of the family–school relationship? Given that teacher support of homework is a concrete way in which teachers can assist parents and work on building a collaborative family–school relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711416795">Christenson &amp; Sheridan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054711416795">Power &amp; Mautone, 2008</xref>), it was hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between parent ratings of teacher support of homework and parent and teacher ratings of the family–school relationship.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To what extent does homework performance vary as a function of diagnostic status, including (a) ADHD subtype, (b) presence of a comorbid internalizing disorder, (c) presence of a comorbid externalizing disorder, and (d) presence of a learning disability (LD) in a sample of children with ADHD? In addition, does homework performance vary as a function of medication status among children with ADHD? Given the heterogeneity in the population of children with ADHD, the goal of this research question is to explore whether ADHD subtypes, patterns of comorbidity, and medication status are associated with an increased risk of homework difficulties.</p></list-item>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in this study were drawn from a larger sample of families and teachers who consented to participate in a federally funded clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a family–school intervention for second- through sixth-grade children with ADHD and their families (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711416795">Power et al., under review</xref>, for additional details). Children were eligible for the larger study if the following inclusion criteria were met: (a) The child was enrolled in Grades 2 through 6; (b) the child met criteria for ADHD–combined type or ADHD–inattentive type on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children–<italic>DSM IV</italic> (K-SADS-P IVR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711416795">Ambrosini, 2000</xref>), based on parent report; (c) the child was rated at or above the 85th percentile on the Inattention or Hyperactivity-Impulsivity factor of the school version of the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711416795">DuPaul, Power, Anastopoulos, &amp; Reid, 1998</xref>), or the Attention Problems or Hyperactivity subscales of the Behavior Assessment System for Children–Second Edition (BASC-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054711416795">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 2004</xref>); (d) the child scored at or above 0.75 of a standard deviation above the mean on the HPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711416795">Anesko et al., 1987</xref>); and (e) the child scored at or above an estimated IQ of 75 on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711416795">The Psychological Corporation, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to the MTA Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711416795">MTA Cooperative Group, 1999</xref>), children who met <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria for a psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, chronic tic disorder or Tourette’s disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder serious enough to warrant separate treatment, history of major neurological illness, or history of suicidal or homicidal behavior/ideation were excluded because these children were likely to require additional treatment that was not provided in the context of the clinical trial. Furthermore, children were excluded if they were currently receiving psychotropic medications, and their parents chose not to undergo a new medication trial as part of the study. Children with learning disabilities, disruptive disorders (oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder), and internalizing disorders (anxiety and mood disorders with the exception of bipolar disorder) were included.</p>
<p>A total of 215 children were referred to the clinical trial; for 109 of the cases, children were eligible and the family consented to participate. In 102 cases, teacher consent was also obtained (six parents withdrew shortly after consenting, and in 1 case, the school did not consent to participate). At the time of consent, families were given the option to participate in the 12-week family psychosocial intervention with or without medication to treat the child’s ADHD symptoms. If the family elected to undergo a trial of medication, they were referred to the study’s medication team prior to group assignment. The medication trial followed a protocol similar to the Texas Medication Algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711416795">Pliszka et al., 2006</xref>) to determine optimal medication and dose. Then the family was randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for the family intervention. Baseline data for the intervention study were used in analyses for the present study; these data were collected prior to participants’ involvement in any intervention sessions. A subset of measures for the clinical trial were used in analyses for the present study (see description of measures below), and outcomes of the clinical trial are reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711416795">Power et al., under review</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the 102 cases with parent and teacher consent, 91 (89%) provided sufficient data to be evaluable cases in the current analyses. Four of the 102 cases were discarded because greater than 15% of the items on measures for this study were not completed. An additional 7 cases were discarded due to missing homework samples. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711416795">Table 1</xref> reports the distributions related to child and family demographics, school type, child diagnostic status, and medication status for the sample of 91 cases. ADHD subtype and internalizing/externalizing disorder status were determined by the K-SADS-P IVR. It should be noted that the 91 children in the sample attended 75 different schools. For cases in which multiple children were enrolled in the same school, 5 schools included 2 participating children, 3 schools included 3 participants, and 1 school included 6 participants.</p>

Recent research has shown that the HPC measures two factors: Inattention/Avoidance (e.g., child is distractible, procrastinates, and complains about homework) and Poor Productivity/Nonadherence With Homework Rules (e.g., child does not know what work has been assigned, forgets to bring materials home, forgets to return assignments to class); coefficient alphas range from .90 to .92 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711416795">Power et al., 2006</xref>). Coefficient alphas in the current study sample were .90 for Inattention/Avoidance, .81 for Poor Productivity, and .90 for the Total Score.</p>

<title>Homework samples</title>
<p>Samples of student homework were collected and scored using scoring criteria developed for the clinical trial. Teachers were asked to collect student homework for 1 week during each data collection period. Three homework assignments were randomly selected and scored by a trained research assistant. Students received points for attempting an item, providing a correct answer, and following each of the directions. Scores for each homework sample were computed by dividing the number of points earned by the total number of possible points and multiplying by 100. Median level of performance across the three scored samples was used in analyses. Interrater reliability was calculated for 38% of the sample; the mean percentage of agreement was 94.8%.</p>

<sec id="section8-1087054711416795">
<title>Parent–Teacher Involvement Questionnaire (PTIQ)</title>
<p>The PTIQ was developed as an outcome measure for the FAST Track study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711416795">Kohl, Lengua, McMahon, &amp; Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2000</xref>). This measure assesses the quality of the family–school relationship from the perspective of parents and teachers. The parent version of the Quality of the Parent–Teacher Relationship factor consists of six items, and the teacher-report version includes five items. The alpha coefficient for the current sample was .90 for the parent version and .83 for the teacher version.</p>

<title>Wechsler Individual Achievement Test–Second Edition (WIAT-II)</title>
<p>The Word Reading, Reading Comprehension, Numerical Operations, and Spelling subtests of the WIAT-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711416795">The Psychological Corporation, 2002</xref>) were administered to children as a measure of academic achievement. Split-half reliability coefficients, as reported in the test manual, range from .97 to .98 for Word Reading, from .94 to .96 for Reading Comprehension, from .87 to .92 for Numerical Operations, and from .93 to .96 for Spelling. For purposes of data analysis, the mean of WIAT-II standard scores across the four subtests was calculated as a measure of overall academic achievement.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To address the first two research questions (i.e., evaluate the construct validity of HPQ scores), correlations between each HPQ factor and measures of homework and academic performance and the quality of the parent–teacher relationship were examined. Specifically, Pearson product-moment correlation between the HPQ, HPC, homework samples, WIAT-II, and PTIQ were conducted. To account for multiple comparisons and correlations, significance was evaluated at the .01 level. The <italic>p</italic> value was not further reduced because our purpose was to examine patterns among the correlations as opposed to specific correlations in isolation. To address the third research question (i.e., the extent to which homework performance varies as a function of diagnostic status), a series of ANOVAs using a <italic>p</italic> level of .01 (adjusted from .05 to account for multiple comparisons) was conducted. To evaluate the magnitude of the effect for significant comparisons, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711416795">Cohen, 1988</xref>) was computed.</p>
<p>Because demographic characteristics could influence the relationships between the HPQ factors and the criterion variables as well as diagnostic group differences, each demographic variable (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711416795">Table 1</xref>) was examined as a potential covariate. To be included as a covariate, the following criteria had to be met: (a) There was a significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and moderate relationship (<italic>r</italic> &gt; .25 or Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> &gt; 0.5, which are roughly equivalent values; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711416795">Cohen, 1988</xref>) between the HPQ factor and the demographic variable (potential covariate) and (b) the correlation between the criterion variable and the demographic variable was significant and greater than or equal to .25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711416795">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 1996</xref>). For instances in which demographic variables met criteria to be considered as covariates, the demographic variable(s) were entered in the model and partial correlations (<italic>pr</italic>s) were computed.</p>

<title>Examination of Potential Covariates</title>
<p>When demographic variables were examined to determine whether they met criteria for inclusion as covariates for the first two research questions (i.e., construct validity), participant’s grade in school and percentage of students in the participant’s school eligible for free or reduced-price lunch met criteria. Specifically, grade met criteria for analyses involving HPQ-T Student Responsibility, HPQ-T Student Competence, and the criterion variables HPC Poor Productivity and homework sample scores. In addition, the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch met criteria for analyses involving HPQ-T Student Competence and WIAT-II mean score.</p>
<p>When demographic variables were examined for inclusion as covariates for Research Question 3 (i.e., extent to which homework performance varies as a function of diagnostic status), gender, family status (i.e., two-parent or single-parent household), and percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch met criteria. Gender met criteria for analyses involving HPQ-T Student Responsibility and ADHD subtype (i.e., combined type vs. predominantly inattentive type). Family status met criteria for analyses involving HPQ-T Student Competence and ADHD subtype. Finally, free or reduced-price lunch met inclusion criteria for analyses involving HPQ-T Student Competence and LD status.</p>

<title>Research Questions 1 and 2: Construct Validity of the HPQ</title>
<sec id="section14-1087054711416795">
<title>Student task orientation/efficiency and student responsibility</title>
<p>As a first step, we evaluated the validity of HPQ-P and HPQ-T factor scores that measure student behavior related to homework (i.e., Student Task Orientation/Efficiency on the HPQ-P and Student Responsibility on the HPQ-T). These factors, which are rated by different informants, were found to be significantly related to each other (<italic>r</italic> = .29; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In addition, HPQ-P ratings of Student Task Orientation/Efficiency were significantly related to parent ratings on the HPC Total Score and factor scores (i.e., Inattention/Avoidance and Poor Productivity). These correlations, which examined relationships among measures that were all rated by parents, were moderate to large and in the expected (i.e., negative) direction (range = −.52 to –.81; all <italic>p</italic> values &lt; .001). HPQ-T scores for Student Responsibility were also significantly related to parent ratings on the HPC Total Score and Poor Productivity factor scores; these correlations were in the moderate to large range (–.34 and –.44; both <italic>p</italic> values &lt; .001). Teacher ratings of Student Responsibility on the HPQ were significantly related to student performance on actual homework assignments (<italic>r</italic> = .47; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). However, parent ratings of Student Task Orientation/Efficiency on the HPQ were not significantly correlated with student performance on homework samples (<italic>r</italic> = .14). Finally, parent and teacher ratings on the HPQ factors pertaining to student behavior related to homework were not significantly correlated with academic achievement scores as assessed by the WIAT-II.</p>
<p>For the HPQ-P, there were no variables that met criteria for inclusion as covariates for the Student Task Orientation/Efficiency factor. For the HPQ-T Student Responsibility factor, grade level was included as a covariate in the analyses comparing HPQ-T ratings of Student Responsibility with HPC Poor Productivity and homework samples. When controlling for grade, the relationship between the HPQ-T Student Responsibility factor and the HPC Poor Productivity factor remained significant and in the moderate range (<italic>pr</italic> = −.38; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In addition, when controlling for grade, homework sample scores still significantly correlated with teacher ratings of Student Responsibility on the HPQ (<italic>pr</italic> = .39; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1087054711416795">
<title>Student competence</title>
<p>As a next step, we evaluated the validity of HPQ-P and HPQ-T factor scores that measure student competence in completing assigned homework. There was a significant correlation between parent and teacher ratings of Student Competence on the HPQ (<italic>r</italic> = .33; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Parent ratings of Student Competence on the HPQ were significantly correlated with parent ratings on the three indices of the HPC (range = −.45 to –.56; all <italic>p</italic> values &lt; .001), but teacher ratings of Student Competence on the HPQ were not significantly correlated with parent ratings on the HPC scales. In addition, parent and teacher ratings of Student Competence on the HPQ were significantly related to student academic achievement on the WIAT-II (<italic>r</italic> = .28; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 and <italic>r</italic> = .42; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively). The relationships between parent and teacher ratings of Student Competence and student performance on actual homework assignments were both small and nonsignificant.</p>
<p>For parent ratings of Student Competence on the HPQ, no variables met criteria for inclusion as covariates. For teacher ratings of Student Competence, free or reduced-price lunch was included as a covariate in the examination of the relationship between the HPQ-T Student Competence factor and WIAT-II mean score. The <italic>pr</italic> between HPQ-T Student Competence and WIAT-II mean score remained significant and moderate (<italic>pr</italic> = .36; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Although the relationship between teacher-rated Student Competence and homework sample scores was nonsignificant, grade met inclusion criteria as a covariate in this comparison. When grade was included in the model, the relationship remained nonsignificant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1087054711416795">
<title>Teacher support and the parent–teacher relationship</title>
<p>To examine the concurrent validity of parent ratings of Teacher Support on the HPQ, the Quality of the Parent–Teacher Relationship factor of the PTIQ was considered. The HPQ-P Teacher Support factor demonstrated a significant, moderate correlation with the Quality of the Parent–Teacher Relationship factor of the parent version of the PTIQ (PTIQ-P; <italic>r</italic> = .45; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The relationship between parent ratings of Teacher Support and teacher ratings of the Quality of the Parent–Teacher Relationship (PTIQ-T) was small and nonsignificant (<italic>r</italic> = .23). In addition, parent ratings of Teacher Support on the HPQ were significantly related to student performance on actual homework samples (<italic>r</italic> = .36; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and to the Total Score and Poor Productivity score on the HPC (<italic>r</italic> = −.36 and –.46, respectively; both significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 level). No variables met criteria for inclusion as covariates in the analyses involving the Teacher Support factor.</p>

<sec id="section17-1087054711416795">
<title>Research Question 3: Homework Performance as a Function of Diagnostic Status</title>
<p>Diagnostic variables, including ADHD subtype, comorbidity, presence of a LD, and child medication status were examined to determine whether children in these groups differed with regard to homework performance. A series of ANOVAs was conducted to evaluate these potential group differences.</p>
<p>There were no significant differences on any of the HPQ parent or teacher factors as a function of ADHD subtype (i.e., combined type vs. inattentive type). Although there were no significant differences between ADHD subtypes for teacher-rated Student Responsibility, gender met inclusion criteria as a covariate in this comparison. When gender was included in the model as a covariate, the analysis continued to reveal no significant differences between ADHD subtype for this HPQ factor. In addition, although there were no significant differences between ADHD subtypes on teacher-rated Student Competence, family status met inclusion criteria as a covariate in this comparison. A 2 (ADHD subtype) × 2 (family status) ANOVA was conducted to determine the impact of this covariate; the interaction between ADHD subtype and family status was nonsignificant.</p>
<p>In addition, there were no significant differences on any HPQ parent or teacher factor as a function of (a) medication status (i.e., whether the child was prescribed medication to treat ADHD), (b) presence of a comorbid internalizing disorder, (c) presence of a comorbid externalizing disorder, and (d) presence of a comorbid internalizing <italic>and</italic> externalizing disorder.</p>
<p>Children with ADHD and LD were rated by teachers as having lower Student Competence than children with ADHD only, <italic>F</italic>(1, 89) = 9.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>d</italic> = 0.65. In analyses examining teacher ratings of Student Competence for children with ADHD with and without LD, percentage of students eligible for subsidized lunch met criteria for inclusion as a covariate. With free or reduced-price lunch added to the model as a covariate, the difference between children with and without LD on teacher ratings of Student Competence failed to reach significance at the .01 level, <italic>F</italic>(1, 88) = 5.26, <italic>p</italic> = .024. Children with ADHD and LD did not significantly differ from children with ADHD only on parent or teacher ratings on any other HPQ factors.</p>

<sec id="section18-1087054711416795" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Research has shown that children with ADHD usually demonstrate significant difficulties with homework performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711416795">Power et al., 2006</xref>); however, the development and evaluation of interventions to address such difficulties has been limited by the availability of psychometrically sound measures of homework performance. To date, only two measures exist to evaluate homework performance (i.e., the HPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711416795">Anesko et al., 1987</xref>] and HPQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711416795">Power et al., 2007</xref>]). There is little psychometric information about these measures, and the HPC only includes a parent-report version; to our knowledge, the HPQ is the only homework assessment measure that includes a teacher-report version. In addition, the HPQ is strength focused, and the items were designed to measure homework independent of other constructs (e.g., ADHD). In addition, the HPQ factor scores allow for examination of homework behavior (i.e., responsibility and task orientation) distinct from ability to perform homework assignments (i.e., academic competence). The results of this study suggest that scores derived from the parent- and teacher-report versions of the HPQ can be used to make valid inferences about the homework performance of elementary school–aged children with ADHD, more specifically students in Grades 2 to 6.</p>
<p>As hypothesized, scores on the HPQ-P were significantly related to measures of homework behavior, academic skills, and the quality of the parent–teacher relationship. Specifically, parent-rated Student Task Orientation/Efficiency was significantly, positively related to teacher-rated Student Responsibility and negatively related to parent ratings on the HPC. Parent ratings of Student Competence were positively related to teacher-rated Student Competence and academic achievement as measured by the WIAT-II and negatively related to HPC scores (parent rated). Finally, the Teacher Support factor of the HPQ-P was significantly related to parent perceptions of the quality of the parent–teacher relationship (PTIQ-P).</p>
<p>In addition, consistent with the hypotheses, there were several significant relationships between scores on the HPQ-T and scores on measures of homework behavior and academic skills. Teacher-rated Student Responsibility was significantly related to parent ratings on the HPC and students’ performance on homework assignments, and the relationship between scores on the HPQ-T Student Competence factor and scores on the WIAT-II was significant and positive.</p>
<p>A comparison of diagnostic groups revealed no differences in HPQ scores between ADHD subtypes or between children with ADHD and comorbid disorders and those with ADHD alone. There were significant differences between children with and without LD; children with ADHD and LD received lower ratings of Student Competence on the HPQ-T than children with ADHD alone, which provides additional evidence of the construct validity of HPQ scores.</p>
<p>The inclusion of samples of students’ homework assignments is a unique feature of this study. Results suggest that homework samples are feasible to collect, can be scored reliably, and are related to other measures of homework performance. Homework sample scores can be used as another measure of homework performance within a multimethod battery; complementary information provided by parents, teachers, and direct assessment can be useful for intervention planning and outcome evaluation.</p>
<sec id="section19-1087054711416795">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>The HPQ likely will be useful in the initial assessment of students’ homework difficulties as well as for progress monitoring as interventions are put into place. The factor structure of the HPQ allows for differentiation between ability to perform homework assignments (i.e., Student Competence) and homework behavior (i.e., Student Task Engagement/Orientation, Student Responsibility). The purpose of homework is for students to have an opportunity to practice skills taught during the school day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711416795">Cooper, 2001</xref>). Therefore, for cases in which students demonstrate difficulties on Student Competence factors, issues of instructional match (i.e., the extent to which the homework assignments are consistent with the students’ skill levels) might be addressed. Homework assignments might be adjusted to insure a high ratio of known to unknown material to increase student success as material is practiced and mastered. Alternatively, if parent and teacher ratings of homework indicate that the student is demonstrating difficulties with homework behavior, behavioral interventions might be implemented and evaluated (e.g., goal setting and contingency contracting; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711416795">Miller &amp; Kelley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711416795">Power et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, in cases where parent ratings of Teacher Support are low, conjoint behavioral consultation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711416795">Sheridan &amp; Kratochwill, 2008</xref>) might be indicated. These consultation sessions could be utilized to strengthen the family–school partnership and develop homework interventions that span the home and school environments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1087054711416795">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although the results suggest that the scores derived from the HPQ-P and HPQ-T can be interpreted to evaluate student homework performance, several limitations must be noted. The sample for the present study included children diagnosed with ADHD who had identified homework problems. It is possible that the participating children were more impaired than a random sample of children with ADHD; however, it should be noted that the majority of children with ADHD also have significant difficulties with homework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711416795">Power et al., 2006</xref>). Additional validity studies including a general sample of students are necessary; however, the present study presents evidence of the validity of HPQ scores for children with ADHD. In addition, all of the participating parents and teachers consented to participate in an intervention study targeting children with ADHD who had homework problems. It is possible that these parents and teachers were more invested in addressing the children’s difficulties than the broader population of parents and teachers associated with children who have ADHD. In addition, although the sample size for the present study was sufficient for the correlational analyses, the sample sizes for the subgroups used to examine diagnostic differences were relatively small in some cases. This resulted in reduced power to identify potential subgroup differences. Further research with larger samples is warranted.</p>
<p>Finally, although homework samples were collected and scored reliably, there are some limitations to the homework sample data. There appears to be a ceiling effect in the homework sample scores; most of the children received relatively high scores on this measure. The homework sample measure requires additional development and validation to be sensitive to increments in student performance across the full range of homework performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1087054711416795">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Homework often is challenging for many students, particularly students with attention problems. To date, identification of and progress monitoring for students with homework problems has been hampered by the lack of reliable and valid homework assessment measures. The results of the present study illustrate the construct validity of the HPQ-P and HPQ-T in a sample of elementary school–aged children with ADHD. The HPQ might be a useful measure for homework intervention planning.</p>
