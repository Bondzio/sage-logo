<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prevention of preterm birth, in order to improve perinatal morbidity and mortality, is one of the most important aims of perinatal medical care. Preterm birth is often caused by maternal infection or enhancement of uterine contractility, the control of which is essential to avoid preterm delivery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112450333">1</xref>
</sup> However, the mechanisms underlying enhanced uterine contractions and their inhibition by tocolytic agents are poorly understood. </p>
<p>Contractions of uterine smooth muscle cells are regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through nonselective cation channels (NSCCs) as well as L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Receptor-operated NSCCs have been identified in a variety of smooth muscles, including noradrenaline- or calcium-activated NSCCs in portal vein smooth muscle cells,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112450333">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112450333">3</xref>
</sup> whereas acetylcholine (Ach)-activated NSCCs were reported to induce depolarization that led to the contraction of iliac, gastric, and tracheal smooth muscles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112450333">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112450333"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112450333"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112450333">7</xref>
</sup> In our previous reports, the NSCC current and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-induced currents were identified in rat myometrial smooth muscle cells and have shown to play a role in the regulation of uterine contractions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112450333">8</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112450333">9</xref>
</sup> Adenosine triphosphate–enhanced ion conductance in the myometrium has been documented in cultured uterine smooth muscle cells from pregnant rats to regulate myometrial cell contractions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112450333">10</xref>
</sup> Adenosine triphosphate was found to induce depolarization following initial hyperpolarization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112450333">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>More recently, some purinergic P2 receptor agonists of the myometrium were reported to mediate uterine contractions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112450333">12</xref>
</sup> P2 receptors are subclassified as ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2Y receptors; 7 subtypes of P2X receptors and 8 subtypes of P2Y receptors have been cloned.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112450333">13</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112450333">14</xref>
</sup> P2X receptors are present in most organs and are involved in a wide range of physiological processes including regulation of smooth muscle contractions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112450333">15</xref>
</sup> For example, the expression profile of 7 P2X receptors has been determined in the human bladder.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112450333">16</xref>
</sup> P2X7 receptors have been identified in human smooth muscle of saphenous vein and their activation have been shown to induce muscle contractions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112450333">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We previously investigated the expression profiles of P2X receptors in the rat myometrium, where we found P2X4 and P2X7 receptors to predominate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112450333">18</xref>
</sup> The expression levels of these P2X receptors were dramatically increased under conditions that mimicked preterm delivery, produced by the administration of the antiprogesterone agent mifepristone or by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced uterine inflammation, suggesting that the enhancement of P2X receptors is related to preterm delivery in this rat model. We also concluded that ATP-induced currents in pregnant rat myometrial cells are carried by P2X7 receptors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112450333">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The present study clarified the P2X receptor subtypes that generate ATP-induced conductance in rat myometrial cells. Myometrial P2X4 and P2X7 receptor genes were transfected into cultured cells, and the reconstructed ATP-induced currents were characterized through these P2X receptors.</p>

<title>Isolation of P2X Messenger RNAs</title>
<p>Total cellular RNA was isolated from all layer of myometrial tissue dissected from pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats at day 19 using the TRIzol protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). Messenger RNA (mRNA) was purified by a FirstTrack mRNA purification kit (Invitrogen), and first- and second-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) were synthesized with a Marathon cDNA kit using poly(dT) primer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey). Myometrial P2X4 and P2X7 cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1(–) mammalian expression vectors (Invitrogen). All resulting constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). P2X4 and P2X7 receptor sequences are deposited with the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) data libraries under accession numbers X87763 and NM019256, respectively.</p>

<sec id="section5-1933719112450333">
<title>Transient Transfection and Cell Culture</title>
<p>Cloned P2X4 and P2X7 cDNAs were transiently transfected into the COS-7 cell line within the vector pCA-GFP, containing the S65A bright green fluorescent protein mutant to detect transfected cells. Transfection was performed with Effectine reagent (Qiagen K. K., Tokyo, Japan), and the cells were grown to 50% confluency in Dulbecco modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen), containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, Maryland), 30 U/mL penicillin G (Invitrogen), and 30 μg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen), in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air at 37°C. Transfected cells were used for electrophysiological experiments through posttransfection day 3. Transfection-positive cells were identified by epifluorescence microscopy performed using a 100-watt mercury lamp and a standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set (TM2000; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Single isolated green fluorescent cells were used for patch-clamp studies.</p>

<title>Patch-Clamp Experiments</title>
<p>The cultured cells were resuspended from the culture dish by treatment with trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma Chemicals, St Louis, Missouri) for 30 seconds. The suspended COS-7 cells were placed into 0.5-mL recording chambers mounted on an inverted microscope (TM2000; Nikon). The cells were used for the patch-clamp study after one hour of re-suspension and used up within 8 hours. The conventional whole-cell patch-clamp method<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112450333">19</xref>
</sup> was applied.  The patch pipette was connected to a voltage clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B; Axon Instruments, Burlingame, California), and test pulses were generated and the current recorded using a computer connected to a direct memory access (DMA) interface (DigiData 1200; Axon) using pCLAMP software (Axon). The recording chamber contained an Ag-AgCl<sub>2</sub> pellet as the ground electrode. All experiments were carried out at room temperature.</p>
<p>A step pulse or ramp pulse protocol was used for recording ion currents. The holding potential was set at −40 mV in all experiments. The ramp pulse protocol used a constant preconditioning pulse of +40 mV for 100 milliseconds and successive ramp pulses from +40 to −100 mV for 350 milliseconds. Data were plotted as the current generated in response to the ramp pulse against the membrane potential from −100 to +40 mV, without subtracting the leak current. </p>

<title>Desensitization of P2X4 and P2X7 Channel Currents </title>
<p>Ionic currents in P2X4- or P2X7-transfected COS-7 cells were induced by the external application of 0.1 mmol/L ATP.

<title>Selectivity for Monovalent Cations of P2X7 Receptor</title>
<p>P2X receptors are classified as NSCCs and are permeable to several monovalent cations. We examined the selectivity of the P2X7 receptor for monovalent cations by measuring reversal potentials for each cation under different ionic conditions, using Li<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>, or K<sup>+</sup> as main cations in the external solution. The reversal potentials were determined as the intersection of the current–voltage curves in the presence or absence of ATP. The reversal potentials for 125.4 mmol/L K<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, and the standard (Na<sup>+</sup>) external solution were 10.5 ± 1.7 mV (n = 19), 8.0 ± 2.7 mV (n = 13), 6.7 ± 2.7 mV (n = 12), and 1.2 ± 1.8 mV (n = 22), respectively.

<p>This study cloned P2X4 and P2X7 receptor cDNAs and transfected them into the cultured COS-7 cell line. The whole-cell patch-clamp method was applied to transfected COS-7 cells to characterize reconstructed myometrial P2X4 or P2X7 receptors, allowing us to compare reconstructed P2X currents with ATP-induced currents in myometrial cells. P2X7 receptors are NSCCs that are permeable to various monovalent ions. The permeability order of myometrial P2X7 receptors for monovalent cations in this study was K<sup>+</sup>&gt;Cs<sup>+</sup>&gt;Li<sup>+</sup>&gt;Na<sup>+</sup>, which was similar to ATP-induced currents in rat myometrial cells.<sup>

</p>
<p>P2X7 receptors expressed in COS-7 cells showed no desensitization for at least 5 minutes, as observed for the ATP-induced currents of rat myometrial cells,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112450333">9</xref>
</sup> whereas P2X4 receptor currents declined to less than 10% within 1 minute. These findings show that the ATP-induced currents in myometrial cells are mainly carried by P2X7 receptors. Desensitization to agonists is a common characteristic of P2X receptors, and its time course can be used for subclassification purposes. P2X1 and P2X3 have thus been shown to desensitize rapidly, while P2X2, P2X4, and P2X5 gradually desensitize over 30 to 60 seconds. However, the P2X7 receptor was previously shown to have no desensitization,<sup>

</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112450333">21</xref>
</sup> which is in agreement with our results.</p>
<p>P2X7 receptors expressed in COS-7 cells were dose-dependently activated by ATP at concentrations higher than 10 μmol/L; the mean EC<sub>50</sub> of ATP was calculated to be 152 μmol/L. This value is comparable to that of the ATP-induced currents in myometrial cells (74 μmol/L). P2Z-like receptors in toad gastric smooth muscles<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112450333">22</xref>
</sup> required 150 μmol/L ATP to induce the current and recorded an EC<sub>50</sub> of 700 μmol/L. An EC<sub>50</sub> of 780 μmol/L has been measured for the human recombinant P2X7 receptor,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112450333">23</xref>
</sup> while a 10-fold smaller EC<sub>50</sub> value was reported for the rat recombinant P2X7 receptor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112450333">24</xref>
</sup> The relatively low EC<sub>50</sub> for ATP in the present study indicates that the P2X7 receptors in rat myometrial cells belong to a group with high sensitivity to ATP.</p>
<p>P2X7 receptors expressed in COS-7 cells were activated by various nucleotides and ATP analogs, especially Bz-ATP. This is widely recognized as a strong P2X7-selective receptor agonist<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719112450333">25</xref>
</sup> with a potency 4.8-fold higher than that of ATP in rat microglia,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112450333">26</xref>
</sup> and 5-fold higher than ATP in a neuroblastoma cell line.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112450333">27</xref>
</sup> In this study, Bz-ATP enhanced current 4.3-fold compared with ATP, and the potency was higher than the response of ATP-induced current in rat myometrial cells. The application of αβ-MeATP and 2MeATP also induced P2X7 receptor current, but these were smaller than those with ATP. Our results ranked the effectiveness of ATP analogs in the order Bz-ATP &gt;&gt;ATP&gt;αβ-MeATP&gt;2MeATP, which is in good agreement with the reports for other P2X7 receptors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112450333">27</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112450333">28</xref>
</sup> and is similar to that of ATP-induced currents in rat myometrial cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112450333">9</xref>
</sup> These findings support the idea that the P2X7 receptor is the main charge carrier for ATP-induced currents in rat myometrial cells.</p>
<p>P2X7 receptor currents were sensitive to some antagonists such as suramin and PPADS, but the blockade was partial and reversible even at saturated doses. Using the more specific P2X7 receptor inhibitor A438079, receptor currents were reversibly blocked by about 50% with 1 µmol/L, 83% with 10 µmol/L, and 90% with 100 µmol/L. This sensitivity was comparable to a previous report in which Bz-ATP-evoked currents were inhibited by 0.3 to 3 µmol/L A438079 in nonneuronal cells of dorsal root ganglia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112450333">29</xref>
</sup> A438079 had a more potent effect on expressed P2X7 receptor current in the present study than on ATP-induced currents in myometrial cells, suggesting that the latter has additional unknown contributors. These pharmacological findings also support the notion that ATP-induced currents in myometrial cells are carried by P2X7 receptors.</p>
<p>In this study, the P2X7 receptor was blocked by Mg<sup>2+</sup>, as previously observed in rat myometrial cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112450333">9</xref>
</sup> The IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.12 mmol/L was, however, smaller than that of ATP-induced currents in myometrial cells. This blockade is a mechanism to inhibit uterine contractions by suppressing the depolarization of cell membranes in rat myometrial cells. As the physiological concentration of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> is approximately 0.45 mmol/L in rat serum,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112450333">30</xref>
</sup> over 75% of a cell’s capacity to conduct ionic currents should be blocked at the baseline Mg<sup>2+ </sup>concentration used. However, blockage could be carried out at concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> higher than 0.45 mmol/L. Thus, therapeutic administration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> to inhibit uterine contractility in preterm delivery could be explained through the suppressive effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on P2X7 currents.</p>
<p>Maternal inflammation, such as chorioamnionitis, has been reported to be related to preterm delivery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719112450333">31</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112450333"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112450333">33</xref>
</sup> Previously, we showed that the expression levels of P2X4 and P2X7 receptors were dramatically enhanced in inflammatory and hormonally induced preterm labor model rats by the application of LPS and the antiprogesterone mifepristone.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112450333">18</xref>
</sup> The increase in P2X7 expression in response to inflammation should enhance uterine contractility and the influx of calcium ions to activate inflammatory cascades. The P2X7 receptor might therefore be a mechanism of preterm labor.</p>
<p>In conclusion, all the observed properties of cloned P2X7 receptors from the pregnant rat myometrium in the present study were in good agreement with those of ATP-induced currents in freshly isolated myometrial cells. Therefore, we conclude that ATP-induced currents in rat myometrial cells are mainly carried by P2X7 receptors. Further studies on human P2X receptors might lead to the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying preterm labor and the development of new treatments.</p>
