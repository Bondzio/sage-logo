            <bold>Adoption by Lesbians and Gay Men: A New Dimension in Family Diversity</bold> by David M Brodzinsky and Adam Pertman (eds). USA: Oxford University Press (2012), 266 pages, £25. ISBN 978 0195322606</title>
         <sec id="sec2-0308575913480101">
            <title>Reviewed by Helen Cosis Brown, Professor of Social Work, University of Bedfordshire, UK</title>
            <p>Brodzinsky and Pertman's edited collection of American papers has much to offer beyond the confines of the USA. The book comprises a wide range of contributions, some discursive, a number reporting on research findings and others setting out the relevant US legal and contextual landscape. Much of the content is transferrable to other countries, although because the UK's legal context for lesbians and gay men is different in some regards from that of many US states, some of the reported debates in the USA are different from those pertinent to the UK.</p>
            <p>The book will be of great value to those with an interest in queer studies, social policy, law, social work and adoption and fostering. Internationally, its strengths lie in bringing together a range of papers that utilise different approaches and methodologies but which all focus on adoption by lesbians and gay men. The chapters that summarise research studies and report on their findings are of particular importance. These include papers on: a national survey of adoption agency policies and practices; findings from a national longitudinal study of adolescent health for those living with same-sex parents; a review of a US national longitudinal lesbian family study; support to gay and lesbian adoptive families, before and after adoption; and gay and lesbian adoptive parents, stressors and strengths. Not only are these chapters informative in that they report on research findings relevant to lesbian and gay adoption but they also, in my view, have something to say about fostering and adoption practice more broadly.</p>
            <p>The studies discussed in the book vary to some degree regarding their research design, methodological approach and methods used for data collection and analysis. This inevitably means that the validity and reliability of their findings differ to some degree. Having said that, none of the authors make claims about their findings or the implications of these for adoption practice beyond what would be considered reasonable and proportionate.</p>
            <p>In addition to the chapters reporting on research studies, Goldberg and Gianino's paper addressing clinical issues and interventions with lesbian and gay adoptive parents is valuable in that it makes use of case material which enables the authors' ideas to be exemplified through clinical practice case study material. This allows some of the lived experience and complexities that arise in the real world of adoption practice to be explored. Mallon's chapter on home studies and how these are best conducted when assessing prospective lesbian and gay adopters draws on and builds upon work he has previously undertaken and published in the USA and the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0308575913480104">Mallon and Betts, 2005</xref>), some of which drew on my own work from the early1990s.</p>
            <p>As an edited collection, the book brings together diverse materials which add up to a constructive and informative whole. Because it is a US text some of the chapters are written from a position of still having to make and win the argument that lesbian and gay men can make excellent, good and ‘good enough’ adopters and foster carers. This inevitably means that some of the more complex questions relating to when things do not go to plan or do not go well, demonstrated in the extreme UK example when two gay men sexually abused foster children in their care, are not explored. Although this case was the exception, the inquiry report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0308575913480104">Parrott et al, 2007</xref>) was helpful in reminding those responsible for the recruitment, assessment, supervision and support of foster carers, as well as the recruitment and assessment of adopters, that an overly positive and ungrounded, optimistic approach, where ideological concerns take precedence over children's welfare and safeguarding, is in no one's interests.</p>
