<abstract>
<p>Brown rice after germinating for 24 and 48 h was milled into flour and incorporated in whole wheat flour at a level of 10% to prepare chapattis. The objective was to use chapatti as a delivery vehicle for germinated brown rice. The flour blends and chapattis made from the flour blends were evaluated for their antioxidant properties. Incorporating germinated brown rice flour increased the total phenolic content of the flour blend from 1897 to 2144 µg FAE/g. The total flavonoids content increased significantly from 632.3 to1770.9 µg CAE/g and metal chelating activity significantly increased by 71.62%. Antioxidant activity increased significantly by the addition of brown rice flour and addition of 24- and 48-h germinated brown rice flour further increased the antioxidant activity significantly. The total phenolic content and total flavonoids content decrease significantly in all the blends after baking the flour into chapatti. A decrease of 3% to 29% was observed in the total phenolic content and a decrease of 25% to 42% was observed in the total flavonoids content. However, baking of the flour blends into chapatti increased the reducing power, metal chelating activity by three folds and antioxidant activity from 64% to 104%.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013211414173" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rice (<italic>Oryzae sativa</italic>) is world’s largest cultivated cereal crop and its consumption provides more than 50% of the daily calories ingested by more than half of the world population. It is consumed in the milled form, that is white rice after the removal of husk and bran. Rice without removal of bran is called brown rice; it has a higher nutritional value but is not preferred by consumers due to its harder and fibrous texture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211414173">Gujral et al., 2011a</xref>, in press). Bran is a good source of fiber, phytochemicals, minerals and vitamins. Germination of brown rice has been reported to enhance its nutraceutical value with increased level of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), lysine, vitamin E and dietary fiber, niacin, magnesium, vitamins B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>6</sub>, respectively. Germinated brown rice (GBR) proves to be suitable for type 2 diabetic patients, because of the high content in dietary fiber, as fiber can regulate blood sugar levels and prevent type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013211414173">Kayahara and Kikuichi, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Wheat is a major cereal in India and is consumed mainly in the form of unleavened flat bread known as chapatti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211414173">Gujral and Pathak, 2002</xref>). Chapatti is usually prepared from whole wheat flour and the desired quality parameters in chapatti are greater pliability, soft texture, light creamish brown color, slight chewiness and baked wheat aroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211414173">Gujral et al., 2008</xref>). GBR could be incorporated into wheat flour to make chapattis, thus promoting consumption of GBR and also increasing the nutritional value of chapattis. Recent research studies have demonstrated that the phytochemicals like polyphenols and phenolics in whole grains are concentrated in outermost layers and, hence, their removal would lead to products that are less beneficial to health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211414173">Shahidi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013211414173">Madhujith et al., 2006</xref>). It is claimed that grains contain more antioxidants than previously thought due to a relatively high amount of bound components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211414173">Pérez-Jiménez and Saura Calixto, 2005</xref>). Cereals are therefore potentially good sources of natural antioxidants. Evidences indicate that phenolic compounds have potent antioxidant properties and free radical scavenging capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211414173">Shahidi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1082013211414173">Yu et al., 2002a</xref>). In rice, ferulic acid and p-caumaric acid are the major phenolic compounds and exist in the free, soluble or insoluble bound form which is found in dietary fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1082013211414173">Sosulski et al., 1982</xref>). The natural antioxidants in cereals may function as reducing agents, free radical scavengers, single oxygen quencher and potential complexes of pro-oxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1082013211414173">Zielinski and Kozlowska, 2000</xref>). The objective of the present investigation was to utilize GBR flour in chapatti making and to study the effect of incorporating GBR flour on the antioxidant properties of chapatti and changes in the antioxidant properties upon baking.</p></sec>

<p>Wheat and rice cultivar PBW-343 and PR-111, respectively, were procured from Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana (Punjab). The wheat was milled in to whole wheat flour by passing through a stone mill and sieved through 60 BSS sieve to obtain flour of 98% extraction rate.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec5-1082013211414173"><title>Preparation of GBR</title>
<p>The paddy was dehusked in a McGill rice Sheller (Rapsco, Brookshire TX, USA) and brown rice was obtained. The brown rice was steeped for 24 h and care was taken that water was changed at 2-h intervals. The GBR was allowed to germinate (temp. 25 °C, humidity-100%) in a seed germinator (Narang Scientific, New Delhi) for 24 and 48 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211414173">Gujral et al, 2011a</xref>). The GBR was dried in a cabinet dryer at 50 °C to a moisture content of 12%. The dried GBR was ground in Super Mill 1500 (Newport Scientific, Australia).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1082013211414173"><title>Preparation of chapatti</title>
<p>Preliminary trials were carried out to determine the amount of water to be added to the flour to develop non-sticky viscoelastic dough that could be easily rolled and sheeted to make a chapatti. Trials were carried out to optimize the level of GBR flour to be added to prepare acceptable chapatti and GBR at a level of 10% was selected. The flour was mixed with optimum water for 3 min in a laboratory mixer (National Manufacturing Company, Lincoln, USA). Dough ball (50 g) was rounded and then placed on a rolling board with guide rails 2 mm in thickness and sheeted. The dough was rolled in one direction, inverted and then rolled in a perpendicular direction. The diameter of the chapattis before and after baking was noted to measure shrinkage (%). The raw chapatti was immediately placed on an electric hot plate at 350 °C and baked for a total of 1 min on both sides. The puffing height of chapatti during baking was noted. The chapatti was allowed to cool for 10 min at 25 °C (80% relative humidity) and then was weighed to determine bake loss. The chapattis were freeze dried (Sim International, USA) and packed in polyethylene pouches and placed in an air tight container at 25 °C. Further freeze dried chapattis were ground in Super Mill 1500 (Newport Scientific, Australia) and passed through 60 BSS sieve and flour stored in airtight container at −20 °C till further analysis.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013211414173"><title>Total phenolic content</title>
<p>The total phenolic content (TPC) was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu specterophotometric method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211414173">Sharma and Gujral, 2010b</xref>). The sample (200 mg) was extracted with 4 mL acidified methanol (HCl/ methanol/water, 1:80:10, v/v/v) at room temperature (25 °C) for 2 h using wrist action shaker (Narang Scientific, Delhi, India). The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min on a centrifuge (Eltek, RC 4100 F, Mumbai, India). Aliquot of extract (200 µL) was added to 1.5 mL freshly diluted (10 fold) Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. The mixture was allowed to equilibrate for 5 min and then mixed with 1.5 mL of sodium carbonate solution (60 g/L). After incubation at room temperature (25 °C) for 90 min, the absorbance of the mixture was read at 725 nm (Shimadzu, UV-2450, Kyoto, Japan). Acidified methanol was used as a blank. The results were expressed as µg of ferulic acid equivalents per gram of flour.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013211414173"><title>Antioxidant activity</title>
<p>Antioxidant activity (AOA) was measured using a modified version of the method explained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211414173">Brand-Williams et al. (1995)</xref> using free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) solution in methanol. Ground barley samples (100 mg) were extracted with 1 mL methanol for 2 h and centrifuged at 3000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant (100 µL) was reacted with 3.9 mL of a 6 × 10<sup>−5 </sup>mol/L of DPPH solution. Absorbance (A) at 515 nm was read at 0 and 30 min using a methanol blank. AOA was calculated as % discoloration.

</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1082013211414173"><title>Reducing power</title>
<p>The reducing power was measured as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1082013211414173">Zhao et al. (2008)</xref>. Flour blends (0.5 g) was extracted with 80% methanol on wrist action shaker for 2 h. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 10000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant (1 mL) was mixed with phosphate buffer (0.2 mol/L, pH 6.6) and 2.5 mL potassium ferricyanide (1%) was added. The mixture was allowed to stand for 20 min at 50 °C. After incubation, 2.5 mL of trichloroacetic acid solution was added to mixture, which was then centrifuged at 10000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The upper layer of solution was mixed with 2.5 mL deionized water and 0.5 mL ferric chloride (0.1%). The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 700 nm. Increased absorbance of the mixture indicated increased reducing power. A standard curve was prepared using various concentration of ascorbic acid equivalents/g of flour.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1082013211414173"><title>Metal chelating (Fe<sup>+2</sup>) activity</title>
<p>The metal chelating activity of extract was measured as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013211414173">Dinis et al. (1994)</xref>. The extract was mixed with 50 µL of ferrous chloride (2 mM/L) and 1.6 mL 80% methanol was added. After 5 min, the reaction was initiated by the addition of ferrozine (100 µL) and the mixture was shaken on vortex. Further, the mixture was incubated at room temperature (25 °C) for 10 min. Absorbance of solution was measured at 562 nm on a spectrophotometer. The chelating activity of the extract for Fe<sup>+2</sup> was calculated as follow:

</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1082013211414173"><title>Total flavonoids content</title>
<p>The total flavonoids content (TFC) was determined as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211414173">Jia et al. (1998)</xref>. The extract (250 µL) was diluted with 1.25 mL distilled water. Then, 5% solution of sodium nitrite was added (75 µL) and the mixture was allowed to stand for 6 min. Further, 150 µL of a 10% aluminium chloride was added and the mixture was allowed to stand for 5 min. After that, 0.5 mL of 1 M sodium hydroxide was added and solution was mixed well. The absorbance was measured immediately at 510 nm using a spectrophotometer. Catechin was used as standard and results were reported.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1082013211414173"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out using Microsoft Excel Software and Fishers least significant difference (LSD) test was used to describe means with 95% confidence.

<sec id="sec14-1082013211414173"><title>Chapatti dough water absorption, shrinkage, puffing height and bake loss</title>
<p>The dough water absorption and baking characteristics of the control wheat flour and wheat flour containing 10% of GBR flour germinated for 0, 24 and 48 h are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211414173">Table 1</xref>. When brown rice flour was added to the wheat flour, the water absorption of the dough was lowered by 19.0%. A minor and insignificant decrease in water absorption was observed when GBR flour (24 and 48 h) was incorporated. The control chapatti shrank by 4.6% upon baking, which is attributed to denaturation of gluten protein. The addition of ungerminated brown rice (UBR) lowered the chapatti shrinkage by 30.88%. The reduction in shrinkage is attributed to the dilution of gluten protein. The shrinkage was least (2.04%) when GBR (48 h) was added, which can be attributed to presence of proteolytic enzymes in GBR, which breakdown the gluten protein in the wheat flour and hence there was lesser shrinkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013211414173">Singh et al., 1998</xref>).

</table-wrap></p>
<p>Puffing height of the chapatti increased by 38% upon addition of UBR. This may be attributed to dilution of gluten protein, as the protein network was weakened and the steam generated during baking process led to greater puffing. Further increase of 18.2% was observed when GBR (24 h) was added. This may be due to the modification of wheat gluten by proteolytic enzymes of germinated rice. This also correlated with shrinkage at this level, however when GBR (48 h) was added the puffing height was lowered to 3 cm. This reduction is attributed to excessive breakdown of gluten protein by proteolytic enzymes from the 48 h GBR.</p>
<p>When UBR was added, the bake loss was lowered by 37.18%. This can be attributed to the increased fiber content contributed by the UBR. Fiber/hydrocolloids have been reported to increase the water absorption capacity, thus lowering the bake loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211414173">Holtekjolen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013211414173">Sharma and Gujral, 2010a</xref>). However, when GBR 24 and 48 h was added, the bake loss increased, which can be attributed to the breakdown of fiber in rice bran due to the carbohydrases produced during the germination process, lowering their molecular weight and water-holding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1082013211414173">Tian et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1082013211414173"><title>Total phenolic content</title>
<p>The TPC of the wheat flour was 2003 µg FAE/g (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013211414173">Table 2</xref>). When brown rice flour was added to the wheat flour, the TPC was significantly decreased by 5.3%, whereas addition of 24 h GBR flour increased TPC by 7.0%. When 48 h GBR flour was added to wheat flour, the TPC content showed a significant decrease of 19.4%. After germination, various changes in the phenolic compounds occur which are not only dependent on the type of seeds but also on the process conditions, the presence or absence of light and germination time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211414173">Lopez-Amoros et al., 2006</xref>). Further, they also reported decrease in trans-ferulic acid and trans p-caumaric acid as germination time increased. Increase in TPC after addition of 24 h GBR could be attributed to the increase in the free phenolic forms due to dismantling of the cell wall during germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013211414173">Shibuya, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211414173">Gujral et al., 2011b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1082013211414173">Tian et al. (2004)</xref> reported that during germination of rice, the carbohydrase enzymes hydrolysed the starch to release the bound phenolic compounds increasing the TPC. However, addition of germinated (48 h) brown rice leads to decrease in TPC. This may be attributed to the formation of insoluble complexes with proteins that hinder their extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211414173">Beta et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211414173">Sharma and Gujral (2010b)</xref> reported that the germination of barley leads to decrease in TPC. Furthermore, alteration of the structure of phenolic compounds upon germination may also be a reason for decrease in TPC. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211414173">Satwadhar et al. (1981)</xref> reported that the decrease in the phenolic content is due to change in their chemical composition and structure.

<p>After baking, the TPC in control chapatti was reduced to 1382 µg FAE/g. This reduction in TPC after baking can be attributed to the heat effects on flour components. The TPC was significantly lowered when all the above flour blends were baked into chapatti. The highest decrease (28%) was observed in the flour blend containing brown rice flour, whereas the flour containing 48 h GBR flour showed a decrease of 20% and the flour containing 24 h GBR flour showed a decrease of only 3.39% and had the highest TPC (2071 µg FAE/g). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211414173">Bryngelsson et al.

<p>The antioxidant activity (AOA) of the wheat flour was 7.18% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013211414173">Table 2</xref>). A significant increase in AOA was observed when flour from 24 and 48 h GBR was added. This increase may be due to the synthesis of compounds like vitamin C and tocopherols which are responsible for AOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211414173">Sharma and Gujral, 2010b</xref>). During germination, the hydrolytic enzymes modify the endosperm and may liberate some of the bound components that play a role in AOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013211414173">Doblado et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>It was observed that the AOA in flour with UBR was higher than that with GBR (24 and 48 h). The AOA is related to the TPC, however there is no correlation upon germination because many factors are involved. Increase in the free phenolic forms is due to dismantling of the cell wall during germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013211414173">Shibuya, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211414173">Gujral et al., 2011a</xref>, in press). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211414173">Satwadhar et al.

It was also observed that the TPC in blend with UBR was lower than that in blends with GBR, while the AOA in blend with UBR was higher than that in blends with GBR. This may be attributed to the absence of correlation between TPC and AOA upon germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211414173">Sharma and Gujral, 2010b</xref>) and due to reasons discussed above. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013211414173">Frias et al.

<p>The AOA was significantly increased when all the above flour blends were baked into chapatti. The highest increase (103.5%) was observed in the flour blend containing GBR flour (48 h) whereas the flour containing 24 h GBR flour showed an increase of 38.8% and the flour containing UBR flour showed an increase of 74.7%. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013211414173">Dewanto et al.

Many authors claim that higher antioxidant properties of thermally processed foods is attributed to the formation of Maillard products such as HMF (5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde), which render high AOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211414173">Duenas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013211414173">Siddhuraju, 2006</xref>). Compared with the flour, the AOA in control decreased after baking, while the AOA in blends with UBR and GBR increased after baking. This increase may be attributed to the formation of Maillard browning products after baking of chapatti which increases the AOA. The higher level of free sugars and amino acids after germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013211414173">Kayahara and Kikuichi, 2000</xref>) and proteins of the rice bran lead to increased Maillard browning that may contribute to the increased AOA.</p>

<sec id="sec17-1082013211414173"><title>Total flavonoids content</title>
<p>The TFC of the wheat flour was 632 µg CE/g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211414173">Figure 1</xref>). When brown rice flour was added to the wheat flour, the flavonoids content was significantly increased by 180.1% as compared to control flour.

Moreover, after replacing the wheat flour with flour from GBR (24 h and 48 h), the TFC was gradually decreased as compared to blend containing UBR flour. The flavonoids are considered phenolic compounds and therefore they may be either metabolized to other compounds or they may leach into the steeping water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211414173">Dicko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1082013211414173">Urbano et al., 1995</xref>). Significant decrease in flavonoids content was observed when all the flour blends and wheat flour (control) were baked into chapatti.

<p>The transition metals have been reported to be catalysts for the initial formation of free radicals.

However, among the blends, the metal chelating activity was increased significantly by 71.62% after addition of UBR. Further, incorporating the GBR (24 h) lowered the metal chelating activity by 6.5%, but further incorporating GBR (48 h) increased the metal chelating activity by 79.2%. The transition metals have been reported to be catalysts for the initial formation of free radicals.

<p>The reducing power is also an indicator of AOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013211414173">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). The electron donor compounds are considered as a reducing agent and can reduce the oxidized intermediates of the lipid peroxidation reactions; therefore, they may be primary or secondary antioxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1082013211414173">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). The reducing power of the wheat flour was 23.4 µg AAE/g (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013211414173">Table 3</xref>). The addition of rice flour from UBR decreased the reducing power by 8.1%. Further, when the wheat flour was replaced with flour from GBR (24 and 48 h), the reducing power was decreased by 3.3% and 5.8 %, respectively. Compared with the control, the reducing power in GBR was lower (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013211414173">Table 3</xref>), while the TPC was higher in GBR (24 h) and was lower in GBR (48 h). The TPC may not be correlated with the reducing power after germination. The phenolic compounds are related to the AOA and reducing power however after germination alteration in the structure of phenolic compounds leads to reduction in their ability to donate electrons, leading to decrease in reducing power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1082013211414173">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The decrease in reducing power after replacing wheat flour with UBR and GBR flour may be due to dilution of phenolic compounds of wheat flour. In case of blends containing flour from germinated rice, as the duration of germination increased the reducing power decreased; this may be attributed to leaching of phenolic compounds in the soaking water and or due to the degradation of phenolic compounds as a result of enzymatic action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211414173">Sharma and Gujral, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211414173">Beta et al., 1999</xref>). After baking, the reducing power of chapatti was increased by 44.4% while the increase in reducing power of chapatti containing flour from ungerminated and germinated rice (24 and 48 h) was 28.8%, 16.3% and 30.6%, respectively. The increase in reducing power after baking can be attributed to production of Maillard reaction products that may play a role in antioxidant properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1082013211414173">Woffenden et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>GBR flour can be incorporated in whole wheat flour for making chapatti and such chapatti can be used as a delivery vehicle for the bioactive compounds present in GBR. GBR significantly affects the antioxidant properties of the chapatti with the extent of germination duration and baking having significant effects.</p></sec></sec>
