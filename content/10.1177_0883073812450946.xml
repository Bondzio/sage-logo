<p>The diagnosis of Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder, is primarily based on congenital facial and abducent nerve palsy. Involvement of other cranial nerves is also common. Occasionally the V, X, XI, and XII cranial nerves are involved, resulting in a difficulty to chew, swallow, and cough, which often leads to respiratory complications. Mental retardation and autism have been reported in some cases. Moebius syndrome can be associated with orofacial anomalies and limb malformations. The authors describe a patient with a confirmed diagnosis of Moebius syndrome associated with hydrosyringomyelia. No case of Moebius syndrome involving primarily the spinal cord has been reported so far. This patient did not present with other factors directly linked to syringomyelia.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder, is primarily based on congenital facial and abducent nerve palsy. Involvement of other cranial nerves is also common. Occasionally the V, X, XI, and XII cranial nerves are involved, resulting in a difficulty to chew, swallow, and cough, which often leads to respiratory failure. Moebius syndrome can be associated with orofacial anomalies and limb malformations. Disturbances in psychomotor and speech development are very common and mental retardation is estimated to occur in 10% to 15% of the cases. There might be a higher incidence of autistic spectrum disorders in Moebius patients. Several hypotheses on the leading pathophysiological causes have been advanced, that is, nuclear agenesis or hypoplasia, vascular malformation, and genetic and environmental factors. The etiology of Moebius syndrome is still unknown. Much of the authors’ knowledge is derived from case reports.</p>
<p>Syringomyelia is defined as a tubular cavitation within the spinal cord. It has been suggested that all intraspinal cavities of nontumoral nature be referred to as hydrosyringomyelia, including hydromyelia, which is a dilatation of the cord central canal lined by ependyma, and syringomyelic cavity, which is lined by glial cells.</p>
<p>This article reports on a patient with a confirmed diagnosis of Moebius syndrome associated with hydrosyringomyelia.</p>

<title>Case Study</title>
<p>This 2-year-old female is the first child of nonconsanguineous parents. Her father is aged 39 years, her mother is aged 30 years. Family history is unremarkable with no maternal diabetes or exposure to teratogenic agents during pregnancy. The child was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy with spontaneous delivery at term, and no postnatal complications; birth weight was 3360 g. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes after birth were 9 and 10, respectively. A physical examination revealed severe bilateral clubfoot, mask-like facies because of bilateral facial palsy, complete on the left and incomplete on the right, and bilateral and incomplete abducens palsy resulting in an inability to abduct the eyes with bilateral esotropia. Microglossia and drooling of saliva were also evident. The child had feeding problems during her first months of life because of insufficient sucking and palatal weakness, which resulted in poor growth and presented with congenital absence of some primary teeth. Early motor milestones were normal, but only recently did she start walking with help. A neurological examination of the lower and upper limbs revealed no abnormalities; there was no Babinski reflexes bilaterally. Sphincter control was not achieved. Oral communication was impaired and characterized by warbling and some vocalizations, comprehension was limited to simple commands. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed the absence of the left VII cranial nerve; the right VII cranial nerve was present but markedly hypoplastic; the VI cranial nerve was absent bilaterally. There were no other structural abnormalities of the brain, and the brainstem configuration was normal, but a spinal MRI revealed a hydrosyringomyelic cavity between the fifth cervical and second thoracic vertebrae. Routine laboratory tests and thyroid status tests were normal and there were no abnormal results on abdominal echography and echocardiography. The child had normal hearing and no respiratory problems. No electrophysiological studies were performed. The electroencephalographies during wakefulness and sleep showed bursts of theta activity in the right temporo-parieto-occipital areas during hyperpnea, which were present also during sleep, and sharp waves between spindles.</p>
<p>The child’s bilateral clubfoot was casted and successfully treated with orthopedic surgery at the age of 4 months. A radiological examination of the spine and pelvis did not reveal skeletal abnormalities. Therefore, the patient showed all the major signs associated with Moebius syndrome. Karyotype analysis revealed a normal female karyotype (46, XX); no array-based comparative genomic hybridization study was performed. As the majority of reports on Moebius syndrome are sporadic, this patient is a sporadic case. She received physiotherapy and speech-language therapy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Moebius syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man no. 157900) is a rare, nonprogressive congenital condition causing nerve palsy (either complete or incomplete) with a prevalence of 0.0002% to 0.002% of births.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812450946">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The classification of Moebius syndrome was later extended to include<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812450946">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812450946">3</xref></sup> unilaterally or bilaterally complete or incomplete facial weakness and loss of eye abduction, congenital dysfunction of other cranial nerves (predominantly bulbar), malformations of orofacial structures, reductive limb anomalies (especially talipes deformities), and defects of the chest wall. Moebius syndrome is also associated with congenital absence of primary and permanent teeth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812450946">4</xref></sup> Mask-like facies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812450946">Figure 1</xref>) with incomplete closure of the eyelids during sleep is the most imposing manifestation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812450946">5</xref></sup> often leading to a diagnosis soon after birth.</p>

</fig>
<p>There is no agreement today on the minimal criteria for diagnosis: some researchers suggest that the diagnosis should be restricted to patients with both congenital sixth and seventh nerve palsies and skeletal defects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812450946">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812450946">7</xref></sup> while others consider congenital facial nerve palsy (either complete or incomplete) as a criterion sufficient for diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812450946">5</xref></sup> Much of the authors’ knowledge is derived from case reports. Rare findings are congenital heart defects, dextrocardia, arthrogryposis multiplex, urinary tract anomalies, anosmia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Usually Moebius patients have a normal life expectancy, but many of them need surgery to correct deformities. Because of traits such as mask-like facies, drooling saliva, strabismus, and speech difficulties, children with Moebius syndrome are at risk to be misdiagnosed as mentally retarded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812450946">5</xref></sup> However, it is difficult to determine the true incidence of mental retardation in this patient population. Generally mental retardation, which is said to be mostly mild, is estimated to occur in about 10% to 15% of individuals with Moebius syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812450946">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Speech problems are said to occur in 76% to 90% of the patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812450946">9</xref></sup> They can be the result of functional involvement of the lips, tongue, palate, and occasionally the larynx, which primarily depends on which cranial nerves, in addition to facial palsy, are damaged and to what extent. In some cases, the speech delay may be the consequence of mental retardation or hearing loss.</p>
<p>Some studies have suggested a strong association of Moebius syndrome and autism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812450946">10</xref></sup> This association, however, remains questionable since the diagnosis of autistic disorders in Moebius patients is very challenging as they present with extensively reduced or absent facial expressions and eye contact—2 crucial features of social interaction—because of cranial nerve palsies.</p>
<p>Because some cases have a widespread pathology, Moebius syndrome has been hypothesized to be because of a vascular insufficiency of the brainstem. The most widely accepted hypothesis for its pathogenesis is that of a disruption of the primitive subclavian arteries and their branches before establishment of a sufficient blood supply to the brainstem by the vertebral arteries. The vascular disruption could be caused by various teratogens acting on the embryo until the end of the first trimester.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812450946">11</xref></sup> Genetic mechanisms could also cause hypoplasia or aplasia of the cranial nerve nuclei, but they only play a minor role. Three different chromosomal regions have been reported as candidate regions for familial Moebius syndrome, MBS1 (OMIM 157900, 13q12.2-q13), MBS2 (OMIM 601471, 3q21-q22), and MBS3 (OMIM 604185, 10q21.3-q22.1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812450946">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812450946"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812450946">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The patient shows various features associated with Moebius syndrome, but she also presented a hydrosyringomyelic cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812450946">Figure 2</xref>) that seems to be substantially asymptomatic, as it happens in many cases. Motor deficits of the upper limbs were absent in about 40% of patients with syringomyelic syndrome and weakness or atrophy of any of the 4 extremities was lacking in 22% of patients: clinical features are variable with many atypical clinical manifestations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812450946">15</xref></sup> The small extent of the spinal cavity in these patient may explain the absence of significant motor or sensitive deficits. Hydrosyringomyelia is hardly related to Moebius syndrome, which generally seems to spare the spinal cord. Furthermore, factors directly linked to syringomyelia such as Chiari malformation type I and hydrocephalus, spinal trauma, or postmeningitic spinal arachnoiditis are not present in the clinical history of the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812450946">16</xref></sup> There is no clear explanation for the development of syringomyelia in this case. Several theories have been proposed as to processes involved in the development of spinal cyst formation, but none are completely compatible with the observed clinical pathology of syrinx development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812450946">16</xref></sup> Alteration of cerebrospinal fluid flow has been suggested as an important mechanism leading to the development of syringomyelia. The pathophysiologic characteristics of syringomyelia were studied widely in Chiari malformations (by far the most common association). Displaced cerebellar tissue is believed to create a functional obstruction to the back-and-forth pulsation of cerebrospinal fluid across the foramen magnum. An exaggerated cerebrospinal fluid pulsatility could drive the cerebrospinal fluid along the perivascular spaces into the substance of the spinal cord, where cavities can develop in areas of relative mechanical weakness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812450946">17</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>However, since Moebius syndrome has been hypothesized to result from a vascular insufficiency of the brainstem, we cannot exclude that a spinal vascular event could have contributed to the development of syringomyelia in this specific case.</p>
<p>As far as is known, this is the first report of the co-occurrence of Moebius syndrome and syringomyelia and more extensive reports and further investigations are needed.</p>
<p>There are many unanswered questions that are relevant for counseling and treating Moebius patients. As Moebius syndrome can be associated with a variety of abnormalities, diagnosis and treatment require a multidisciplinary approach with a team of specialists including a child neurologist, pediatrician, plastic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon, ophthalmologist, pediatric otolaryngology, audiologist, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, general dentist, occupational and physical therapists, and speech therapist. Moreover, when suggested by clinical findings, the possibility of spinal abnormalities in Moebius patients should be investigated.</p>
