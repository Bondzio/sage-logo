<body>
<p>Vascular access-related complication is sometimes the cause for significant morbidity in an otherwise successful endovascular procedure. Early recognition and appropriate treatment are crucial in limiting the consequence of the access complications. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the rare complication of iliac artery avulsion associated with endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) and to increase awareness among procedurists in current day practice.</p>
<p>Recently, a 61-year-old woman with a 5.8-cm fusiform Crawford Type IV thoraco-abdominal aneurysm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574413484596">Figure 1A</xref>) was treated with a customized Zenith Fenestrated AAA Endovascular Graft (Cook Inc, Bloomington, IN). The customized endograft consisted of a tube endograft that extend from the mid descending thoracic aorta into the abdomen aorta, with a giant scallop for the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in the distal landing zone. A preloaded catheter was incorporated in the endograft design to aid in the cannulation of the SMA, and as a result, the delivery device was 27F in caliber. No vessel access difficulties were anticipated, as the vessels were not excessively tortuous and were 7.5 mm in caliber on both sides, on computed tomography (CT) angiography.</p>

Crawford type 4 thoracoabdominal aneurysm which terminates at the level of the ostium of superior mesenteric artery (white arrow). As the celiac axis was occluded, the endograft was designed to cover the celiac axis with a giant scallop for the superior mesenteric artery. B, One year post-EVAR, the sagittal oblique thin maximal intensity projection CT image showed the endograft to be occluding the aneurysm with thrombosis of the aneurysm sac (“*”) and no endoleak. The superior mesenteric artery was well perfused (white arrow). The bypass graft was also patent (not shown). CT indicates computed tomography; EVAR, endovascular aortic repair.</p>

<p>During the procedure, the right common femoral artery cut down was performed for delivery of the endograft, and successful trial of access site suitability was performed by serially passing 21F to 25F dilators over the guidewire through the access vessel. The 27F delivery device was then advanced into position without difficulty, and the endograft deployed as per the manufacturer’s instruction for use successfully occluded the aneurysm and preserved flow to the SMA. Midway during withdrawal of the delivery device, however, a sudden “give” was felt by the operator and a segment of vessel was seen wrapped around the delivery device emerging from the entry site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574413484596">Figure 2</xref>). Suspecting arterial avulsion and without further withdrawal of the delivery device, a right-sided limited laparotomy was performed to expose the right iliac vessels for visual inspection. On exposure of the right iliac arteries, full-thickness avulsion of the common iliac artery bifurcation extending into the proximal external iliac artery was confirmed, with only the delivery device bridging a large defect between the proximal common iliac artery and the common femoral artery and no overlying vascular tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574413484596">Figure 3</xref>). Bypass graft using a polytetrafluroethylene graft bridging the avulsed segment, extending from the common iliac artery to the common femoral artery, was performed. This was followed by ligation of the common iliac artery, internal iliac artery, external iliac artery, and complete withdrawal of the delivery device. Total estimated blood loss for the entire procedure was 700 mL, with no significant additional blood loss attributed to the avulsion injury or the attendant repair. The 1-year postprocedure CT showed exclusion of the aneurysm and patency of the SMA and iliac graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574413484596">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

The avulsed iliac artery can be seen wrapped around the delivery device (white bracket), the appearance is similar to that seen at the entry site when the “give” was felt during device withdrawal. This appearance is sometimes coined as “iliac on a stick.”</p>

The avulsed arterial segment (common iliac artery bifurcation to external iliac artery) was bridged by the delivery device without overlying vascular tissue (white arrow), consistent with the full-thickness avulsion. The delivery device having bridged the vascular defect serves to tamponade potential torrential blood loss. Surgical bypass graft was subsequently placed and the avulsed ends ligated.</p>

<p>Iliac avulsion during EVAR or “iliac on a stick” is a rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574413484596">Figure 2</xref>) but potentially catastrophic access-related complication. Similar to iliac ruptures, relevant risk factors such as large caliber devices, inadequate access vessel diameter, tortuosity, and heavy calcifications are relevant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413484596">1</xref>
</sup> Although this complication is well documented in the early years of EVAR, ironically, with increase in the number of EVAR performed, it has become a rare complication due to the trend toward the development of delivery devices of increasingly small profile and improved trackability (eg, hydrophilic coating). Nevertheless, in cases of complex aneurysms, where fenestrated or branched endografts are needed, the presence of components such as side branches results in delivery devices remaining large in caliber (eg, 25F). If additional features such as preloaded catheters are added to aid target vessel cannulation, further increase in the delivery device caliber by about 2F can be expected. Careful assessment of access vessel size on pre-EVAR CT is therefore mandatory, and the use of ancillary techniques such as iliac conduits or endoconduits (controlled rupture of iliac arteries using balloon mounted covered stents) should be considered in cases with equivocal access dimensions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413484596">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>When iliac avulsion is encountered, further withdrawal of delivery device should be halted, as the delivery device can serve to tamponade the avulsed segment from catastrophic bleeding, as in our case. Insertion of a semicompliant balloon for aortic occlusion from contralateral access can also be lifesaving, should temporary hemostasis be needed to allow time for surgical repair. It is important to realize that unlike EVAR-related iliac rupture, where the iliac artery is usually a laceration and endovascular stenting can be expected to be successful, the full-thickness iliac avulsion differs in the lack of overlying vascular structure for endovascular stent graft to effectively anchor or adhere to and should not be attempted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574413484596">Figure 3</xref>). Additionally, if the proximal internal iliac artery is also avulsed, cross pelvic retrograde hypogastric flow could result in continued bleeding. Finally, differentiating between partial-thickness or intimal/endothelial avulsion (that possibly can be treated with stent graft) and full-thickness avulsion is difficult, and complete withdrawal of the delivery device that tamponades an avulsion to allow for angiographic assessment and trial of endovascular stenting can lead to significant blood loss. This article serves as a reminder for operators of this previously well-known foe of EVAR in current day practice and highlights the importance of prompt recognition and institution of hemostatic maneuvers followed by surgical assessment and repair.</p>
