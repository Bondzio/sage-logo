In 1859, when German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff was able to successfully purify substances and conclusively show that each pure substance produces a unique light spectrum, analytical spectroscopy was born.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112446071">1</xref></sup></p><p>From the discovery of unique atomic spectra developed modern spectroscopy in the 20th century. Spectroscopy involves the study of light to determine the chemical composition of substances and the physical properties of molecules, ions, and atoms. Light is a type of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic waves radiate from electrically charged particles that are set in motion when an electric field couples with a magnetic field. The waves act like a stream of particles without mass termed photons. The energy of these photons is inversely related to the wavelength of the radiation. Components of the electromagnetic spectrum relevant to diagnostic spectroscopy for tissue include the ultraviolet (UV) A range (315-400 nm), the visible light range (400-700 nm), and the near infrared (NIR) range (700-900 nm). When light strikes the tissue, it can be absorbed with or without reemission or scattered by surface or subsurface interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112446071">2</xref></sup></p><p>Throughout the years, different spectroscopic techniques have been utilized in characterizing soft tissues in the field of obstetrics and gynecology.

This device is used to detect spectral differences between the tissues under different components (proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid) and focuses on their spectral changes. The FTIR spectroscopic analysis of normal (n = 5) human placental tissues compared with tissue from individuals with pregnancy-complicated diseases like intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR; n = 5) and diabetes mellitus (DM; n = 5). Tissues were collected from patients who had vaginal delivery within 24 hours. The tissues were divided into 3 parts: the upper one-third portion (P1; nearest part to amnion fluid), the middle portion (P2), and the lower one-third portion (P3). Sample tissues were put into physiological saline and preserved at 4°C. Their IR spectra were measured within 24 hours. Tissues were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Afterward the samples were cut off (2-mm diameter pieces) and used for the FTIR measurement. The rest of the tissue was fixed in formalin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ([H&amp;E] cell staining) and periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reaction (glycan staining) for histological investigation. Placental tissues were also investigated histochemically. The differences in spectra especially of P2 FTIR spectra among P1, P2, and P3 in normal placentas were observed. The findings indicated pathological and biochemical changes in placental tissues in IUGR and DM via the usage FTIRS. They correlated their finding with histochemical staining of placenta. This method was helpful in early diagnosis and identification of IUGR and DM. Despite the small sample size, this study showed that FTIR is potentially useful when it can be applied to clinical study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112446071">5</xref></sup></p><p>Also this is a new technology for cervical cancer screening. Instead of detecting the morphological changes as used in Pap smear test, this technique detects, at the molecular level, structural changes in functional groups through the changes in the infrared absorption spectrum. The FTIRS is inexpensive and less time consuming, and it examines cells in their natural state (no fixation and staining). Moreover, it is a computer-operated system; the screening of a large number of cervical samples is feasible by a continuously automated process. When the infrared light is passed through a cervical cell sample, a molecule absorbs infrared radiation of the appropriate frequency, which excites it from one vibrational or rotational level to another. A graph of energy absorbed versus frequency is the absorption spectrum of the sample. The FTIR spectra can be interpreted as normal and abnormal results. For cervix cancer, Sindhuphak et al utilized FTIRS. Sample, which was taken from cervix with a spatula, was placed in 10 mL of normal saline and kept at −20°C for a month before preparation. The saline specimens were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minUTES and the cell pellets were transferred to microcentrifuge, centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes to provide a small pellet of cells for FTIR analysis, and then stored at −80°C until the spectral analysis was carried out. Results were compared to the histologic diagnosis (gold standard). The FTIRS yielded high sensitivity (96.3%) and specificity (96.4%) and offered good false-negative rates (3.7%) and negative predictive values (97.6%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112446071">6</xref></sup></p><p>The FTIRS may be useful in predicting precancerous lesions because the cancerous processes induce cellular changes at the molecular level that are reflected on the FTIR spectra. Cervical biopsy specimens were obtained from the outpatient department. Chang et al utilized FTIRS in comparing cervical precancerous tissue samples of 22 patients with the pathological examination of colposcopic biopsies. All the samples were frozen at −20°C and stored until use. Two successive 8 µm thick sections were taken from each tissue and cut by microtome at −20°C. One was placed on the platinum-covered microscopic slide and used for spectroscopic studies. The other section was placed on a glass slide, dipped in formalin, and stained with H&amp;E using the standard procedure. The slide was then examined by a pathologist. Considerable differences in the spectra were observed between normal and premalignant epithelial tissue. The ratios of normal and precancerous tissues were 1.40 ± 0.91 and 0.29 ± 0.19, respectively. The results established that color mapping method of FTIRS could assist early diagnosis of cervical precancerous tissue, on the basis that the changes in the spectra match pathological changes in the cervical tissue. Therefore, FTIRS can be an alternative screening technique for screening where Pap smear screenings are insufficient even though it can be time consuming.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112446071">7</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section4-1933719112446071"><title>Raman Spectroscopy</title><p>Raman is a scattering spectroscopy technique is similar to emission spectroscopy but detects and analyzes all of the wavelengths that a substance reflects upon excitation by vibration (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112446071">Table 1</xref>).

The vaginal probe was slightly bent allowing good visualization during placement on the cervix. Eight multimode silica fibers (400 mm diameter, 3MFT 400 EMT, Thorlabs, Inc, Newton, New Jersey) were coupled to the laser source to transmit the light to the tip of the probe without any need of sample preparation.

On the other hand, its optimum usage method and application area needs to be refined to reach more standard methodology. It may useful to identify multiple plasma protein markers that might be characteristic of in situ and invasive cervical cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112446071">20</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section8-1933719112446071"><title>Fluorescence Spectroscopy</title><p>Fluorescence spectroscopy is an emission spectroscopy technique that measures the amount of light of a certain wavelength that a substance reflects. Fluorescence spectroscopy (FS) is based on the electronic excitation induced in susceptible fluorophore molecules, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), collagen, and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), upon exposure to certain wavelengths of UV and visible light. As electrons return to their native state, light of longer wavelength than the incident light is emitted. Characteristic excitation/emission matrices illustrate the different wavelengths at which various fluorophores maximally absorb and emit light. Molecules that absorb the incident light and do not fluoresce, such as hemoglobin, also affect the spectral profile. The fluorescence emissions from a given tissue are a function of its metabolic as well as structural features, such as the neovascularization, decrease in collagen cross-linking, and biochemical changes associated with neoplasia. With FS, a real-time and noninvasive diagnosis is possible, which can quantitatively detect changes in cellular chemistry and tissue morphology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112446071">2</xref></sup></p><p>The FS is being studied as one of many optical technologies that make a diagnosis in real time. All the research and industrial groups studying this device in the cervix have used 2 approaches: (a) point probes that interrogate specific cervical sites, sampling 2 to 3 mm<sup>2</sup>, and (b) multispectral imaging approach that image the entire cervix. Point probe studies can biopsy the site under the probe, yielding both a “per site” and “per patient” sensitivity and specificity. Multispectral approaches suffer the requirement to register spectroscopic measurements with thickness (mm) of cervical epithelium. A formal review of the literature has yielded reports of the performance of fluorescence, reflectance, and combined spectroscopy for the in vivo screening and diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL), and cervical neoplasia. The review focused on many of the aspects of pilot study, phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, and clinical trial design in order to examine whether these factors are important in the performance of these devices, as studied to date. A total of 26 studies were covered (2 screening and 24 diagnostic studies). These studies used 6 different device applications. Since all these devices are being compared to the current standard-of-care colposcopy, it is somewhat disconcerting that all 3 groups also report different performances of their comparison colposcopy data. The subject of the variation in colposcopy deserves further evaluation in light of these new technologies. According to the review, performance of all devices decreased when the sample size and the heterogeneity of population increased and also when the age of patients were over 50 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1933719112446071">39</xref></sup> The review presents successful findings of several studies that used different methods and spectroscopic devices.</p><p>The Pap smear has been reported to have a false negative rate of 15⁁ to 40%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112446071">40</xref></sup> The review presents successful findings of several studies that used different methods and spectroscopic devices. Weingandt et al designed a study to potentially find a tool for screening and diagnosing, which has more accuracy than Pap smear. To assess the feasibility of FS in the diagnosis of CIN, broadband light excitation was utilized. Collagen fibers are the main source of autofluorescence. Neoplastic transformation is associated with epithelium or increased cellular density. Epithelial neoplasm may decrease autofluorescence. By using these properties of autofluorescence, spectral measurements were taken from 685 cervical sites (in 68 patients) for the localization and differentiation of CIN and compared with colposcopically directed biopsy and HPV DNA testing. These spectral measurements were performed by imaging a 2 mm diameter tissue area through the endoscope optics via a beam splitter onto a 400 µm core quartz fiber connected to a spectrometer. Sensitivity of the equipment was tested on a fluorescence standard prior to each measurement series. A resection loop attached to the endoscope was used to achieve a predefined distance for reproducible spectral measurements. High-grade CIN lesions (CIN 2/3) presented a significantly reduced autofluorescence compared with CIN 1 (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the detection of high-grade CIN (CIN 2/3) of 88%, 53%, 29%, and 95% and for CIN 3 only of 100%, 51%, 28%, and 100% were obtained, respectively). Patients with a positive HPV DNA testing showed a significantly lower autofluorescence than patients tested negative for HPV DNA. This technique demonstrated a high sensitivity for high-grade CIN of over 90%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719112446071">41</xref></sup></p><p>In clinical practice, the preoperative discrimination between malignant and benign ovarian tumors is important, and several techniques have been described for this purpose. Visualization of ovarian tumors is possible with ultrasonography but prediction of malignancy is not accurate. Other tools, such as CT examination and MR imaging, can also not differentiate accurately between benign and malignant tumors. The FS were used to distinguish ovarian cancers from normal ovarian structures and benign neoplasms, as well as differentiate between normal variations and abnormal structures from 11 patients undergoing oophorectomy. Brewer et al explored whether FS signatures differed between normal variations within the ovary, benign neoplasms, and ovarian cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719112446071">42</xref></sup> Their findings showed decreased fluorescence by neoplastic samples. The great variability in the structural changes measured and evaluated in the ovarian surface and subsurface provided valuable information for developing spectroscopy both to screen and to evaluate women for occult neoplasms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719112446071">42</xref></sup></p><p>The FS has been used the least among all spectroscopic techniques. Its results are promising especially for screening cervical tissue and early diagnosis of pre-cancerous cervical lesions. Today, portable devices that can replace and/or complement Pap smear has been designed and put into medical usage. A medical device company in Massachusetts has recently completed clinical trials with its noncontact imaging instrument, with the intent of securing US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use as an adjunct to colposcopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112446071">2</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec id="section9-1933719112446071"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the field of obstetrics and gynecology, different spectroscopic techniques have been used because they are noninvasive, sensitive, specific, inexpensive, less time consuming, and examine cells in their natural state compared to traditional methods.

Study design plays a crucial role on how to handle specimens. Some sample preparation techniques are extremely detailed, while others are more concise. At best, we tried to provide a comprehensive look. In some techniques such as mass spectroscopy, specimen has to be prepared prior to evaluation. In other techniques such as fluoresce spectroscopy, surface contact is adequate for the evaluation. Hence, usually no prior preparation is needed. Overall, whatever technique is used the common ground is to preserve the specimen without ruining it.</p><p>It is very difficult to rank or prefer one technique to the other as each technique has a different application with only a few intersecting usages. Hence, the method of usage differs from one spectroscopic technique to the other like in one technique to touch the outer tissue is enough (FS), while in another measures in vivo (NMRS). Each technique has its pros and cons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112446071">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1933719112446071">3</xref>).

cases to find the mechanisms of disease and to find a way to predict disease. Using spectroscopy as a new technique, researchers identify pregnancy-related problems, such as hypertension, preeclampsia, eclempsia, and observe properties of placenta and IUGR fetus. Even the results are preliminary and are very valuable to understand the details and different aspects of disease.</p><p>Different spectroscopic techniques also have been used by researchers to identify different cancer biomarkers to provide more detailed cancer screenings like adjunct usage to Pap screening in cervix cancer. In addition, functional studies can provide additional information on the role of protein biomarker in the development and progression of cervical cancer. Ultimately, spectroscopic techniques can become integrated into the management of patients with cancer through the design and tracking of individualized therapy. Identification of the proteins different in invasive and in situ cancer may be of great value in the understanding of cervical cancer invasion and in the development of novel therapeutic intervention in the future.</p><p>In infertility, the techniques have been applied to select the most suitable embryo for transfer. They can also be utilized in further studies for analysis of stem cell differentiation in human embryos. They might enable us to distinguish human embryonic stem cells, which have own spectroscopic measure result. Researchers are focused to find different protein biomarkers and other molecular levels’ peak in gynecologic diseases like premature ovarian failure and early prediction of premenopause. Also studies may provide important insights for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying clinical manifestations of diseases and the identification of causative molecular factors and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</p><p>There are still many shortcomings that have to be overcome. This review shows that there are many different techniques in spectroscopy and each have their own advantages and disadvantages. For the time being, the best option for different applications is not clear. Standardization is still an issue to be resolved. Further studies likely will help guide new engineering and clinical applications of spectroscopic techniques, optimizing the best method for different applications in the field of obstetrics and
