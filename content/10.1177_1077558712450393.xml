<p>E. Richard Brown, a long-time member of the <italic>Medical Care Research and Review</italic> editorial board and the founding director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, passed away on April 20, 2012. Dr. Brown, a professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, suffered a stroke while at a conference in Kentucky.</p>
<p>“Rick was a tireless advocate for the uninsured throughout his distinguished career,” said Gerald Kominski, the center’s current director and a professor of public health. “Everyone who worked with Rick in any capacity during his life recognized his intense determination to make health care services more accessible and more affordable to all Americans.”</p>
<p>Dr. Brown founded the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research in 1994. It has since grown into one of the nation’s leading health policy research centers and the premier source of health policy information and analysis on California’s population.</p>
<p>Dr. Brown also served as a senior health policy adviser to the Barack Obama for President campaign, as a health policy adviser to three members of the U.S. Senate, and as a full-time senior consultant to President Clinton’s Task Force on National Health Care Reform. He was a past president of the American Public Health Association.</p>
<p>We at <italic>Medical Care Research and Review</italic> are saddened by the loss of Dr. Brown, who worked tirelessly on behalf of many causes, including the journal and the field of health services research generally. We are dedicating this issue of the journal to him. Notably, the first two articles focus on insurance coverage for disadvantaged populations, an area for which Dr. Brown had great passion.</p>
