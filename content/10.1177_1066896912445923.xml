<abstract>
<p>A 4-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay, using probes to chromosomes 11q, 6p, 6q, and 6 cent, has recently been proposed as an ancillary tool for the diagnosis of melanoma. The authors report herein their experience with this assay. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the assay for histopathologically unequivocal cases, they analyzed 50 melanocytic nevi, 50 primary melanomas, and 15 metastatic melanomas. Of 50 melanocytic nevi, 47 were FISH negative on initial readout (test sensitivity, 94%); 49 were FISH negative after correction for tetraploidy (test specificity, 98%). Of 50 primary melanomas, 41 were FISH positive (test sensitivity, 82%). Of 15 metastatic lesions, 13 were FISH positive (test sensitivity, 85%). Of the 9 FISH-negative melanomas, 6 metastasized. The tumors of the 5 patients who had survived thick primary melanoma for more than 5 years without recurrence were all FISH positive. Half of the patients whose primary melanoma was tested by FISH had undergone sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. When the authors compared the FISH results of those 25 melanomas with the SLN status, no statistically significant correlation was found. These findings document limitations of the current FISH assay. A rare nevus may be FISH positive. Some primary metastasizing melanomas are FISH negative. Even metastatic melanomas can be FISH negative. Awareness of the limitations in test sensitivity and specificity of the FISH assay is important to avoid an erroneous diagnosis by overreliance on cytogenetic findings. Correlation with clinical and histopathological findings is paramount for accurate diagnosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Histopathological analysis of hematoxylin and eosin–stained tissue sections remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of melanoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912445923">1</xref></sup> In the majority of cases, experienced dermatopathologists can make a definitive, reliable, and reproducible distinction between a melanocytic nevus and malignant melanoma. However, this distinction is not always straightforward. There is a subset of lesions with unusual or atypical histopathological features that are difficult to classify.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912445923">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912445923">3</xref></sup> Examples of such lesions include nevoid melanoma, atypical spitzoid melanocytic tumors, and atypical blue nevus–like melanocytic neoplasms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912445923">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912445923"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912445923">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>When pathologists disagree with each other or acknowledge their inability to render a definitive diagnosis based on routine sections, this poses a dilemma for clinicians and patients. Therefore, pathologists have explored the use of ancillary techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy for problematic melanocytic tumors. One such test, which has recently been proposed for distinguishing nevi from melanomas and gained significant popularity, is the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test that enumerates copy number changes for chromosomes commonly altered in melanoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912445923">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912445923">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of diagnostic problems have been examined with this test showing good correlation between proposed cutoff values and histopathological interpretations of diagnostically straightforward consensus cases of common or rare lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912445923">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912445923"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912445923"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912445923"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912445923">11</xref></sup> Preliminary data have also been presented suggesting a possible value for the test in the workup of ambiguous melanocytic neoplasms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912445923">7</xref></sup> or for prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912445923">12</xref></sup> However, not all investigators had a positive experience using this test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912445923">13</xref></sup> We report herein our findings examining histopathologically unequivocal cases of 50 melanocytic nevi, 50 primary melanomas, and 15 metastatic melanomas. We also compared 25 melanomas from patients who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy with the nodal status as a preliminary assessment of whether the FISH status of a melanoma could be relevant for selection of patients for this procedure.</p>

<sec id="section2-1066896912445923" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The study was approved by the institutional review board. A total of 115 histopathologically unequivocal cases with sufficient residual tumor tissue were retrieved from the archives of the pathology department. They included 50 melanocytic nevi, 50 primary melanomas, and 15 metastatic melanomas. The melanocytic nevi included ordinary acquired nevi (20), dysplastic nevi (15), Spitz nevi (10), 4 congenital nevi (4), and 1 blue nevus (1). Of the primary melanomas, 25 were nodular and 20 of the superficial spreading type; 3 tumors were lentigo maligna melanomas, and 2 were acral melanomas.</p>
<p>FISH testing was performed using 4 probes targeting Ras responsive element-binding protein-1 (VysisLSI RREB1-Spectrum Red), myeloblastosis (VysisLSI MYB-S Gold), cyclin D1 or chromosome 11q (VysisLSI CCND1-Spectrum Green), and centromeric enumeration probe control for chromosome 6 (VysisLSI CEP6-Spectrum Aqua) from Abbot Molecular, Inc. Sections 5 µm in thickness were mounted onto SuperFrost Plus positively charged slides (ThermoShandon, Pittsburgh, PA), baked at 56°C overnight, deparaffinized, submersed in 1× SSC, pH 6.3, at 80°C for 35 minutes, and washed in water for 3 minutes. After protease digestion (4 mg pepsin/mL 0.2 N HCl) at 37°C for 15 minutes, sections were rinsed in water for 3 minutes, passed through graded ethanol, and dried. Hybridizations were carried out at 37°C for 16 to 18 hours in an automated codenaturation oven (HYBrite or ThermoBrite Denaturation/Hybridization System, Abbott Molecular Inc, Des Plaines, IL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were placed in washing buffer (2× SSC/0.3% NP40, Abbott Molecular Inc) at room temperature for 2 to 10 minutes to remove the coverslips and then immersed in 73°C washing buffer for 2 minutes, dried, and mounted with DAPI I antifade solution (Abbott Molecular Inc).</p>
<p>Slides were evaluated with an epifluorescence microscope equipped with DAPI, Aqua, Gold, GreenV2, and Red single band-pass filter sets (Abbott Molecular Inc). A total of 30 lesional melanocytes were analyzed per case. A lesion was considered to have a positive FISH result if any of the following criteria were met: (1) gain in 6p25(RREB1) relative to CEP6 greater than 55%, (2) gain in 6p25(RREB1) greater than 29%, (3) loss in 6q23 (MYB) relative to CEP6 greater than 40%, or (4) gain in 11q13(CCND1) greater than 38%.</p>
<p>Fisher’s exact test was used to assess statistical significance. Data management and analyses were performed with Stata v 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section4-1066896912445923">
<title>Melanocytic Nevi</title>
<p>Of the 50 melanocytic nevi, 29 occurred in female patients and 21 in male patients. Their ages ranged from 1 to 91 years at the time of diagnosis (mean = 43 years; median = 45 years). Of the 50 nevi, 47 were FISH negative on initial read, using previously published criteria without correction for polyploidy, which would imply a test specificity of 94%. On re-reanalysis, 2 Spitz nevi were found to show tetraploidy. With correction for tetraploidy, the final FISH result was determined as negative. The positive FISH result of 1 compound melanocytic nevus of a 72-year-old man could not be attributed to tetraploidy. A copy number gain of chromosome 6p (gain of RREB1 in 63% of enumerated cells) was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912445923">Figure 1</xref>), whereas the enumerations for 11q, 6cent, and 6q were within normal limits. The clinical and histopathological findings were re-reviewed. Clinically, the lesion was thought to be a congenital nevus, which had become darker. The histopathological findings are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912445923">Figure 1A</xref>. There were no features of in situ or invasive melanoma. Scattered junctional nests were noted. Only a few solitary units of melanocytes were seen at the dermoepidermal junction. Most of the melanocytic proliferation was intradermal. The lesion showed good evidence of maturation. No mitotic figures were identified. The Ki-67 labeling index was less than 1%. Given the benign histopathological features, the FISH result was interpreted as “false positive.” No further surgery was performed, and there has been no local or distant recurrence within 4 years of follow-up. Thus, after correction for tetraploidy, 1 of 50 melanocytic nevi was FISH positive, resulting in a test specificity of 98%.</p>

<title>Melanomas</title>
<p>A total of 50 primary cutaneous melanomas were examined: 23 were from women and 27 from men. The ages of the patients ranged from 19 to 85 years (mean = 56 years; median = 59 years). The Breslow thickness of the tumors ranged from 0.4 to 20 mm (mean = 4.2 mm; median = 3 mm). Of the melanomas selected for this analysis, 15 metastasized.</p>
<p>Of the 50 tumors, 41 tested positively by FISH; 9 cases failed to meet FISH criteria for melanoma and 6 of them were associated with subsequent nodal and/or distant metastatic melanoma. Thus, of the 15 melanomas with known metastases at the time of the completion of this study, 9 (60%) were FISH positive, and 6 (40%) were FISH negative. An example of a FISH-negative metastasizing melanoma is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896912445923">Figure 2</xref>. The patient had a primary lentigo maligna melanoma measuring 2.2 mm in thickness, with perineural invasion. Within 3 years of the excision of the primary tumor, the patient was found to have metastatic melanoma in a regional neck node and in the lung.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Histopathologically, the distinction between melanoma and a melanocytic nevus can usually be made with confidence if one is given an adequate biopsy of the lesion that permits evaluation of the key features relevant for the diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912445923">1</xref></sup> However, there is a set of melanocytic proliferations that are difficult to classify by light microscopic features because of conflicting evidence, when some features (eg, circumscribed wedge-shaped silhouette) favor a nevus, whereas others (eg, mitotic figures, incomplete maturation, and cytological atypia) suggest a possible melanoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912445923">14</xref></sup> Pathologists have been searching for ancillary methods to improve the diagnostic accuracy for such tumors. One method that has recently been proposed with encouraging preliminary results enumerates melanocytes for chromosomal copy number changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912445923">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912445923">6</xref></sup> Although comparative genomic hybridization is in principle superior, its application to small biopsy material has been technically difficult, which is why a FISH test has been developed examining melanocytic proliferations for chromosomal gains or losses using a 4-colored probe set for chromosomes 6p, 6q, 6cent, and 11q.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912445923">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In their seminal work, Gerami et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912445923">6</xref></sup> reported a sensitivity of 86.7% and a sensitivity of 95.4% in a validation set of 83 melanomas (melanomas by consensus diagnosis). Because the purpose and potential value of the test is not to confirm straightforward melanomas, which can more efficiently (faster and cheaper) be diagnosed on a hematoxylin and eosin–stained section, Gerami et al examined a set of 27 ambiguous melanocytic tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912445923">6</xref></sup> In their experience, the FISH test correlated well with outcome: all 6 tumors, which metastasized, were FISH positive. Their results have encouraged further exploration of this technique as an ancillary method for the diagnosis of problematic melanocytic tumors. A number of investigators have reported quite variable experiences in the use of the FISH test. Gaiser et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912445923">13</xref></sup> reported a specificity of the test of only 50% and a sensitivity of 60%. The FISH analysis by Vergier et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896912445923">15</xref></sup> of 43 nonequivocal melanomas and nevi revealed a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. In a review of 500 cases from a commercial laboratory, 83.8% of melanomas were FISH positive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912445923">16</xref></sup> The false-positive rate of melanocytic nevi was stratified according to the level of atypia. For ordinary nevi, false-positive results were below 2%. It was 6.7% to 10.3% for dysplastic nevi with moderate to severe atypia, and 12.2% for Spitz’s nevi. Another commercial laboratory analyzed 32 nevi and 31 melanomas by FISH and reported an overall sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 94%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896912445923">17</xref></sup> The sensitivity of our series of 50 melanocytic nevi and 50 primary melanomas was 82%, and the specificity after correction for tetraploidy was 98%. The differences in reported specificities and sensitivities are likely related to differences in methodology and case selection. A strength of our series is the fact that all melanomas were consensus diagnoses (reviewed by more than 1 pathologist at our institution and an outside institution; not a single case was included in which any pathologist ever doubted the diagnosis of melanoma), and several were confirmed as malignant by follow-up (15 melanomas were known to have metastasized at the completion of the study).</p>
<p>As apparent from all studies, not all malignant melanomas are positive by FISH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912445923">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896912445923">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912445923"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896912445923"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896912445923"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896912445923">19</xref></sup> As documented in this series, 6 of 9 FISH-negative melanomas metastasized, and 2 nodules of metastatic melanoma were FISH negative. A negative FISH test in spite of the presence of unequivocally malignant histopathological features and adverse clinical outcome may be a result of the fact that the melanoma has copy number changes of chromosomes other than those targeted by the assay. It may also imply that not all melanomas may be associated with copy number changes. Thus, one needs to be cautious when cytogenetic results are used for the interpretation of difficult melanocytic lesions. A negative FISH result does not exclude the diagnosis of malignant melanoma.</p>
<p>Similar caution is needed for the interpretation of melanocytic nevi. Some nevi are reported as FISH positive, when in fact the histopathological findings and clinical course unequivocally favor a benign status. One pitfall in this regard is the issue of tetraploidy, which was not addressed in the original enumeration protocol of Gerami et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912445923">6</xref></sup> However, it has subsequently been documented that up to 10% of Spitz’s nevi may be tetraploid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066896912445923">20</xref></sup> Thus, corrections for tetraploidy are needed when enumerating FISH results. Tetraploidy is apparent when there are 4 copies per nucleus of any chromosome tested. The issue of whether or not to discount tetraploid nuclei, however, is not always straightforward, especially when confronted with a mix of signals, including gains of 3 and 4 copies, and when outside material is sent with no specifications as to how thick the sections are (truncated tetraploid nuclei may falsely appear to have only 3 copies of a chromosome). Although tetraploidy may be the most common reason for false-positive FISH results of melanocytic nevi, it does not explain all cases of melanocytic nevi with copy number changes meeting FISH criteria for melanoma. A positive FISH result of a nevus may be related to “cherry picking” of abnormal nuclei (large nuclei at different foci in a lesion are selectively counted, instead of counting all nuclei in a given area) and/or the fact that some numerical chromosomal aberrations indeed occur in benign lesions, thereby setting inherent biological limits to the specificity of empirical threshold values. One example of a chromosomal copy number gain in a benign melanocytic proliferation is already accepted: it is known that a subtype of Spitz nevi may have an isolated copy number increase of chromosome 1 p.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066896912445923">21</xref></sup> Another melanocytic nevus composed of large epithelioid cell melanocytes has been found to be associated with loss of BAP1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066896912445923">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066896912445923">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the FISH test was introduced, it was suggested that it could serve as an ancillary method for the assessment of diagnostically difficult melanocytic proliferations, that is, when a pathologist struggles with distinguishing a nevus from melanoma. An initial set of 26 diagnostically ambiguous melanocytic tumors was analyzed by FISH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912445923">6</xref></sup> The test was positive only in a subset of tumors with subsequent adverse outcomes; albeit, not all tumors with adverse outcomes were FISH positive. In a separate series North et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912445923">12</xref></sup> reported that patients with FISH-negative tumors have a more favorable prognosis than those with FISH-positive tumors. Although our study was not designed to determine the prognostic value of the FISH test, 2 observations make us skeptical about the prognostic power of the test with the current probe set.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912445923">6</xref></sup> First, a random sample of primary melanomas with histopathologically high-risk features from patients who survived their tumor for more than at least 5 years without evidence of metastatic disease failed to show any proportional increase in the number of FISH-negative cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1066896912445923">Table 2</xref>). A second line of evidence raising doubt about the prognostic value comes from the comparison of FISH results with SLN status. The SLN status is considered the most powerful prognostic indicator for clinical outcome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066896912445923">24</xref></sup> but there was no statistically significant association with the FISH result of the primary tumor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066896912445923">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, in conclusion, our findings document limitations of the FISH test when used to distinguish nevi from melanoma. Although a positive FISH test strongly suggests melanoma (specificity of 98%), a rare melanocytic nevus may be FISH positive. A negative test does not exclude melanoma. Nearly one fifth of the primary melanomas of this series were FISH negative. Even a rare metastatic melanoma may be FISH negative. Caution is also needed when considering FISH results for prognostic purposes or for patient selection for SLN biopsy. In spite of its limitations, the FISH test may be helpful in selected settings to confirm a suspected diagnosis of melanoma. Furthermore, efforts are already under way to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the FISH test by including additional probes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066896912445923">25</xref></sup></p>
