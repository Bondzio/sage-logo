<p>The present volume, a <italic>Festschrift</italic> for John Barton, consists of eight lectures originally presented at a symposium that marked his sixtieth birthday. The contributions, whose authors all pursued graduate studies under Barton, share a common interest in Amos, and although they range widely they also show a penchant for themes familiar from Barton’s own work (e.g. his <italic>Oracles against the Nations: A Study of Amos 1.3–2.5</italic> [1980]; <italic>Understanding Old Testament Ethics</italic> [2003]). The five chapters surveyed below represent well the nature of the collection.</p>
<p>Katharine Dell, in “Amos and the Earthquake: Judgment as Natural Disaster,” notes the importance of an earthquake as a punishment for sin during Uzziah’s reign in Zech 14:5 and Josephus (<italic>Ant</italic>. 9.222–27). Accepting its historicity on the basis of this double reference and archaeological evidence from eighth-century BCE Hazor, she argues that in Amos the earthquake is much more than a chronological marker. Dell looks first at 9:1–4, 5–6, where the use of <italic>rۢš;</italic> (r in 9:1 establishes a link to 1:1, and she argues that the melting earth (9:5; similarly 8:8) falls in the same semantic field. Both texts describe the phenomena as judgment. Dell also argues that seismic events are reasonable explanations of the destructions described in 3:14–15 and 6:9–11, and concludes that earthquakes in Amos express God’s power and effect his punishment of human evil in particular (11–12). The earthquake mentioned in 1:1 was thus “a key part of Amos’s prediction and ultimate vindication” (14).</p>
<p>Daniel L. Smith-Christopher explores violence against women in “Engendered Warfare and the Ammonites in Amos 1.13.” After exploring (<italic>bq</italic>ۢ and language associated with it in the Hebrew Bible, Smith-Christopher presses beyond many contemporary interpretations’ focus on the violation of human rights, especially violence against the unborn, to the issues of “identity and land,” both salient concerns in light of Israel’s proximity to Ammon (geographically and kinship-wise, 23). He argues that Ammon’s violence and expansion of its territory share these paired motivations, while on Israel’s part this oracle is part of a fairly consistent antipathy among the biblical writers for the “Transjordanian peoples generally” (30). The final facet of his study deals with the association of violence with women, both in the Hebrew Bible and across history (e.g. Rwanda in the decades before and after the new millennium), and emphasizes the “social context” for these actions (37). This essay raises issues which go far beyond interpretation and merit reflection and wise action.</p>
<p>The last essay focused on Amos itself rather than on its reception comes from Aulikki Nahkola, who studies the book’s lion, bear, and snake imagery (especially in 5:19). Espousing a model of perception which includes biological, psychological, and conceptual elements, Nahkola endeavors to discover what associations these animals would have had for Amos’s ancient audience (associations quite possibly different from our own). After noting archaeological evidence that all three animals were present in the Levant and that each held some relation to one or more cults in the ancient Near East, the author concludes, first, that the lion was primarily associated with “the idea of power,” and was thus frequently associated with both deity and royalty. Serpents possessed a more mythological function, and had connotations of evil, but were also seen as “hostile,” while bears were more simply thought of as “angry and ferocious” (98). Nahkola concludes that these feared animals “were not encountered often enough for that fear to be modified in relation to reality,” and that this element of the unknown made them suitable symbols for the Day of the Lord, whose horrors would exceed the audience’s capacity for belief (104).</p>
<p>Paul Joyce offers the first of several essays that explore Amos’s significance for other disciplines, in this case psychological interpretation. Joyce finds insufficient material in the text to aver anything with regard to the psychology of Amos the prophet (108), and focuses especially on the psychology of the text (following D.J.A. Clines and C. Exum in speaking of its “unconscious drives,” “narrative neuroses,” and “repressions, displacements, conflicts and desires”). Joyce explores the surprise-element present at various points in Amos in light of social psychology’s understanding of cognitive dissonance, which can entail repression and projection, arguably present in the audience’s response to Amos’s announcements of doom (111). The text’s effect on the reader also receives attention, and although the essay’s conclusions are very tentative (appropriately so in a field so young), they raise profitable questions.</p>
<p>Andrew Mein explores a pre-critical reception of Amos in the life of the Dominican “prophet-preacher” of Florence, G. Savonarola (1452–1498). Savonarola preached a series of 27 sermons on Amos early in 1496, less than two years after the fall of the Medici and immediately after the French king Charles VIII had invaded Italy and dismantled Florence’s government. Savonarola and many like him saw these events as evidence of divine displeasure with Florentine morals, and in his sermons his new government, which was in many ways far more democratic than anything the city had seen to date, becomes the means for every citizen to prevent “the abuse of power by religious and secular leaders” (125). Savonarola also identified with the daring and dangerous existence of his Israelite prototype, and indeed was eventually executed by Pope Alexander VI. Mein cites from most of the reformer’s sermons, and provides a fascinating look at the reappropriation of an ancient text to address similar situations two millennia later.</p>
<p>This volume has something for readers in almost any discipline, although it is surely most useful for those in Biblical Studies. Inevitably, some of the essays are stronger than others, and some break new ground while others are more evaluative or reflective, but they will invite most every reader to expand her or his hermeneutical horizons.</p>
