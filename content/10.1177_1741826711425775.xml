<p><bold>Background:</bold> European research on ethnic variations in cardiovascular disease has mostly examined mortality endpoints using country of birth as a proxy for ethnicity. We report on chest pain and angina by ethnic group.</p>
<p><bold>Design and methods:</bold> Retrospective cohort linking the Census 2001 for Scotland (providing 14 ethnic group categories) and hospital discharge/community and hospital deaths data. Directly age-standardized rates and rate ratios were calculated. Risk ratios were adjusted for age and then highest educational qualification of the individual using Poisson regression. Ratios were multiplied by 100 and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. The reference was the White Scottish population (100). In the results below, the 95% CI excludes 100.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There was raised chest pain mortality/hospital discharge risk in Indian men (rate ratio 141.2), Other South Asian women (rate ratio 140.9), and Pakistanis (rate ratio 216.2 in men, 243.0 in women). Rate ratios were lowest in other White British (rate ratio 76.1 in men, 73.7 in women) and Chinese (rate ratio 67.6 in men, 76.7 in women). Adjustment for age and education attenuated, but did not abolish, differences in other White British (risk ratio from 73.5 to 83.5) and Pakistani (risk ratio from 209.0 to 198.2) male populations and increased them in most others, e.g. other South Asian men (from risk ratio of 128.9 to 140.1). Pakistani populations had the highest risk of angina (rate ratio 189.3 in men, 159.7 in women). Other White British (rate ratio 81.4 for men, 78.0 for women), Other White (rate ratio 89.6 men, 85.2 women), and Chinese (rate ratio 60.5 men, 67.4 women) had the lowest risk. Adjustment for education did not greatly alter these patterns.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There were important ethnic variations. The results call for replication elsewhere in Europe and targeted prevention programmes and vigilant diagnosis and management by clinicians.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711425775" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Studies of the variations in cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Europe have mainly used country of birth as a proxy for ethnicity and focused on mortality and other severe manifestations of CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711425775">1</xref></sup> Despite the scarcity of data, in European countries where data exist there are important ethnic variations in CVD; irrespective of whether ethnicity is based on country of birth,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711425775">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711425775">3</xref></sup> self-assigned ethnic group,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711425775">4</xref></sup> or some other proxy. Reducing inequalities, a European and global priority, needs to start with data to assess the challenge and permit evaluation of change over time. In addition to socioeconomic perspectives, the equity lens needs an ethnic group perspective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711425775">5</xref></sup> The key to prevention and control of CVD is control of risk factors and early detection. In this paper we examine two manifestations of CVD where early, correct diagnosis is vital–chest pain and angina.</p>
<p>Varying modes of presentation of chest pain and angina in different ethnic groups have been noted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711425775">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711425775">7</xref></sup> For example, South Asian populations have more diffuse chest pain and are less likely to report the classic crushing central chest pain of myocardial infarction. Their angina is more resistant to control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711425775">8</xref></sup> Studies indicate that South Asians seek medical care promptly and delayed care is not the cause of their high rates of CVD mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711425775">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>To our knowledge neither the incidence of hospitalization for chest pain, nor the incidence of hospitalization for angina, has been described by ethnic group in a European country. We report this using a Scottish retrospective cohort study incorporating a direct indicator of ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711425775">4</xref></sup> Scotland’s major migrant populations, and hence ethnic majority groups, are from England and Wales, Ireland, Pakistan, India, and China. Mostly, these are long-established populations, though more recently established populations include those from Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean. Our method partially fills an important gap, as no European prospective cohort studies have published longitudinal data on disease incidence by ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711425775">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711425775">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741826711425775" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The methods of our retrospective cohort study are published in detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711425775">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711425775">11</xref></sup> We used computerized matching of names, addresses, and dates of birth to link the Census 2001 for Scotland (providing self-reported ethnic group for each individual, and other demographic and social variables), to the Scottish Community Health Index (register of patients using the NHS), and then to death records (including in the community) and hospital discharge/deaths database (Scottish Morbidity Record 2001, SMR01 database).</p>
<p>About 95% of people counted in the 2001 census (4.9 million) were linked to health records, i.e. 4.65 million, with 85% or more linked in every ethnic group. The total estimated Scottish population was 5.06 million so our cohort includes about 92% of the population. One category is selected by Census respondents from a list of 14 categories in response to the question ‘What is your ethnic group?’ The category labels are self-explanatory. We used these categories but because of small numbers we grouped Bangladeshis with Other South Asian; and Caribbean, African, Black Scottish, and Other Black, into one group, henceforth called African origin or African for short.</p>
<p>For people aged ≥30 years of age (approximately 3 million), we analysed first-event chest pain and angina death or hospitalization. The proportion of deaths in relation to hospitalizations was low, e.g. for angina it was 0.6% of the total events. The ICD codes used were: for chest pain ICD10 R07 and ICD9 765.5; for angina ICD10 I20 and ICD9 413. These chest pain codes are for pain in throat and chest excluding dysphagia, epidemic myalgia, breast pain, neck pain, and sore throat (supplementary material Appendix I). The angina codes include all forms of angina. It is, unlikely, however that people with stable angina would be hospitalized. First event meant there was no hospital record of chest pain or angina in the 10 years preceding the index event in the SMR01 database. This database includes cause of death from the death certificate. We calculated directly standardized rates per 100,000 per year by sex, rate ratios, risk ratios using Poisson regression with robust variance, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) around summary measures. To clarify, rate ratio denotes the ratio of the directly standardized rates of hospitalization/mortality. Risk ratio refers to the output of the Poisson regression model. Age adjustment used 10-year age groups. We multiplied ratios by 100 so the reference population was 100. The Poisson regression models were chosen due to their suitability for analysing frequency data and the independent variables were selected in advance in order to test our prespecified hypotheses. The standard reference population was the White Scottish population. We adjusted rate and risk ratios by age, and risk ratios also for age and education status (see below). No other confounders were included. We did not test for interaction given lack of power for most analyses in most ethnic groups.</p>
<p>We examined the relationship between eight indicators of socioeconomic position and all CVD rates to identify the validity of potential confounding factors. (The numbers were insufficient to assess this for specific causes.) The indicators were: (1) the postcode-based Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation; (2) car ownership; (3) educational qualification of the individual; (4) educational qualification in the household; (5) National Statistics socioeconomic classification at individual level; and (6) National Statistics socioeconomic classification at household level; (7) household tenure; and (8) economic activity in the previous week. The educational qualification of the individual was selected as the most consistently associated measure. Henceforth, all references in this paper to education and highest qualification refer to the indicator ‘highest qualification of the individual.’ This variable was categorized as: (1) no qualifications; (2) school-level qualifications; and (3) higher education-level qualifications (e.g. professional qualifications, diplomas, and degrees). In every ethnic group, the relative risk for all CVD deaths/hospitalizations for those individuals with a higher qualification compared with no qualification was less than 1 (mostly about 0.8), and the 95% CI excluded 1 in 8/10 ethnic groups for men and 9/10 groups in women. The other seven indicators were less consistent. Education varied by ethnic group. Education was used in analyses as a proxy for socioeconomic position. The population ≥75 years were excluded as they were requested in the census form not to answer the education question, so the number of events is slightly smaller for the risk ratios compared to directly age-standardized rates and ratios, the latter maximizing study power and providing a cross check for the analysis of the age group 30–74 years. The Disclosure Control Committee ruled that publishing the numerators by ethnic group for both analyses risked disclosure of identity. The reduction in number of cases was higher in the White than non-White population as the latter were younger on average. For example, the number of events for White Scottish men in this analysis was 44,872 (89.5% of the 30-plus age group) and for Pakistani men was 398 (97.3%)</p>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711425775"><title>Ethics and disclosure</title>
<p>The work was approved by the Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (for Scotland) and the Privacy Advisory Committee of NHS National Services Scotland. The ethical and other permissions and related issues have been reported in detail,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711425775">4</xref></sup> including an independent assessment by an ethicist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711425775">12</xref></sup> The analysis was conducted on a standalone computer in a locked room in the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS; now renamed National Records Scotland) by author HB and named researchers (MS, GB; see other contributors), following a strict protocol. Outputs were screened by a GROS disclosure committee before release from GROS.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1741826711425775"><title>Chest pain</title>
<p>The chest pain death/hospitalization rate was similar in men and women, as shown in the age-standardized rates in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711425775">Table 1</xref>. The rate ratios and risk ratios were reasonably similar, indicating that analysis of the subset of cases with education (30–74 years) was valid. The rate ratios showed a substantial excess of chest pain in Indians (rate ratio 141.2 in men, 148.6 in women), Other South Asians (rate ratio 140.9 in women), and Pakistanis (216.2 men, 243.0 women) compared to the reference. The rate ratios were comparatively low in Other White British (76.1 in men and 73.7 in women) and Chinese (67.6 in men and 76.7 in women). Adjustment for educational qualifications attenuated the difference between White Scottish and Other White British but did not abolish it (e.g. in men the risk ratio went from 73.5 to 83.5). After this adjustment, risk ratios were higher in Indian men (from 124.3 to 136.7) and Other South Asian men (from 128.9 to 140.1).

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711425775">Table 2</xref> shows that the age-standardized rates for all angina in men were mostly higher than in women. With the one exception of Other Ethnic Group women where the two numbers were divergent (though 95% CI still overlapped), the rate ratios and risk ratios were similar, indicating the risk ratios based on the subset of case (30–74 years) were valid. Pakistani men and women had the highest rate ratios (rate ratio 189.3 in men, 159.7 in women). Indian men and women were similar to the reference group. Other White British (rate ratio 81.4 in men, 78.0 in women) and Chinese (rate ratio 60.5 in men, 67.4 in women) had the lowest rate ratios. Rate ratios were low in Other White populations (89.6 in men and 85.2 in women).</p>
<p>Adjustment for educational qualification did not abolish the differences between White Scottish and Chinese (risk ratio from 47.6 to 44.7 in men, from 44.5 to 40.9 in women) and Other White British (75.6 to 84.9 in men, 70.5 to 80.3 on women). The risk ratio for Pakistani men was hardly affected (from 199.9 to 193.1), but it was attenuated for Pakistani women, though it was still very high (from 207.0 to 182.1).</p>

<sec id="sec9-1741826711425775"><title>Main findings</title>
<p>There were large ethnic variations in the incidence of death/hospitalization for chest pain and angina compared to the White Scottish population which has comparatively high rates of CVD. The very high rates for Pakistanis, compared to the White Scottish, were in accordance with their high CHD mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711425775">2</xref></sup> By contrast, Indians had only a moderate excess of chest pain and no excess of angina compared to the reference population. The different experience of Indians and Pakistanis is especially notable as, on the basis of risk factor patterns, Bhopal et al. in 1999 predicted such divergence in CVD outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711425775">13</xref></sup> Adjustment using our chosen indicator of socioeconomic position (educational qualification) led to varying effects. The Other White British (mainly English) and Chinese fared best but after socioeconomic adjustment the former group’s advantage diminished though it did not disappear, with little change in the Chinese. The Irish were similar to the White Scottish, reflecting the high absolute risk in both populations. These ethnic variations are substantial and point to both priorities for concerted action (e.g. among Pakistani populations) and to learning more for prevention (e.g. understanding the factors that protect the Chinese population from CVD). The higher directly standardized rate for angina in men in most ethnic groups does not corroborate the data indicating that angina is more common in women than men,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711425775">14</xref></sup> at least not for the more severe variety that leads to hospitalization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741826711425775"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>
<p>The strength of the study is the exploration of novel territory with new methods, overall size (4.65 million people, about 3 million aged ≥30 years and included in the analysis), the availability of an ethnic code based on self-completion, information on a wide range of ethnic groups, and the linkage of census data to both hospital morbidity and community/hospital mortality so differences in hospitalization do not simply reflect community mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711425775">4</xref></sup> Audits show high completeness (99%) and quality (94% diagnostic coding accuracy) of the SMR01 file for coronary heart disease diagnoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711425775">15</xref></sup> All deaths are certified by a doctor in Scotland and all public hospitals are required to submit data capturing about 95% of hospitalizations nationally. Record linkage studies of this magnitude usually do not have individual informed consent. In addition to Ethics Committee approval we obtained an ethical opinion from a professor of medical ethics that concluded that, on balance, the benefits of linkage exceeded the potential harms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711425775">12</xref></sup> The validity of available indicators of socioeconomic position is not yet established in multiethnic studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711425775">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711425775">18</xref></sup> We tested eight indicators and selected individual educational qualification. If any of these were acting as confounding variables, they would be statistically associated with both the factor under study (ethnicity) and the outcome (all CVD, used to maximize the statistical power of analysis). As socioeconomic variables are co-correlated, adjustment for all would be inappropriate not least because mismeasurement errors in confounding factors may lead to either diminution or exaggeration of associations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711425775">19</xref></sup> The choice of education was based on visual examination of graphs showing the relationship between each of eight indicators (in each ethnic group by sex) and all CVD directly standardized death/hospitalization rates. We then quantified associations using relative risks. A committee of five people agreed, unanimously, that individual educational qualification was the superior indicator of the eight tested. These data break new ground in Europe, both in terms of findings and in linkage methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711425775">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711425775">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The weaknesses of the study include the small population size for some non-White populations and hence small number of events and imprecision of estimates; the variation in linkage rates by ethnic group (ranging from 85.1% in Other South Asian to 95.3% in White Scottish); the inability to capture events that may have occurred outside the UK; the difficulty of making accurate and comparable diagnoses of chest pain and angina in clinical practice; and the unavailability of cardiovascular risk factor data. There are no similar studies, for comparison, in other parts of Europe where ethnic minority populations are larger. There is no easy way of capturing events internationally, but deaths of UK residents are reported back via several channels, including embassies and consulates, and the primary care registration systems. Such reports, however, may not give accurate cause of death.</p>

Our data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711425775">26</xref></sup> further emphasize the heterogeneity, both of risk factors and outcomes, which continues to be neglected even in recent research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711425775">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The causes of ethnic variations in disease are complex but include behaviour, stressors, socioeconomic factors, and biological factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711425775">27</xref></sup> One influential perspective is that ethnic variations largely reflect socioeconomic position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711425775">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711425775">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711425775">28</xref></sup> This is an important but incomplete explanation that is difficult to study partly because indicators may not perform consistently across ethnic groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711425775">16</xref></sup> In Scotland, for example, both Chinese (low CHD) and Indian (high CHD) populations have a similar socioeconomic position, lower on some indicators than the White Scottish population higher in others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711425775">29</xref></sup> but their CHD experiences are divergent. To take one indicator, the percentage of economically active people who were unemployed at 2001 census was about 7% in White Scottish, 8% in Chinese, and Indians, and 12 % in Pakistanis. We explored the role of socioeconomic position and CVD using a range of measures because the across-ethnic group validity of the well-known measures of socioeconomic position is questionable and the usual measures sometimes give divergent pictures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711425775">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711425775">27</xref></sup> The chosen indicator, individual educational qualification, was an important confounding factor that in our models reduced differences between White Scottish and Other White British but not in Chinese groups and it augmented some differences between the White Scottish and other groups, e.g. Indian populations.</p>
<p>There is emergent evidence that angina is more common in women than men, which is paradoxical given the excess of cardiovascular mortality in men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711425775">14</xref></sup> Our directly standardized rates show, for most ethnic groups, an excess in men. While it is possible that women with angina are less likely to be hospitalized, it may be that angina diagnosed in women is less likely to be cardiac, which is reflected in the findings of a recent survey of angina in Helsinki.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711425775">30</xref></sup></p>

<p>This paper contributes to the European effort to tackle CVD and ethnic inequalities therein, in three ways. First, it shows a method to study the phenomenon more widely in Europe through linkage, given the paucity of primary longitudinal research data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711425775">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711425775">10</xref></sup> Second, it calls for practical clinical and public health actions to focus prevention and disease programmes and research on the populations at greatest need, here Pakistani populations. Third, it calls for studies to examine why some populations (e.g. Chinese in much of Europe) fare comparatively well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711425775">31</xref></sup> so lessons can be learned.</p>
