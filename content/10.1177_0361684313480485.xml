<p>As feminist psychologists, we are acutely aware of the sexist, racist, and classist attitudes and stereotypes that undermine entry into and success in traditionally male workplaces for White women and women and men of color. Their implications can be summed up with the phrase that inspires the title of an impressive new book about intersections of race and class for women in academia: <italic>Presumed Incompetent</italic>. The extensive collection of essays and research studies compiled by Gutiérrez y Muhs, Niemann, González, and Harris takes us well beyond the demonstration of persistent negative attitudes and stereotypes on the part of dominant group members and into the often difficult, sometimes triumphant, but always complicated lived experiences of women of color in higher education.</p>
<p>This is an incredibly important collection. It affirms with quantitative and qualitative data that despite affirmative action policies and their (slowly) increasing numbers in academia, women of color continue to be presumed incompetent. Chapter after chapter demonstrates that women of color in the academy know that they have to work harder than White faculty to prove themselves to their colleagues and students, as well as to get tenure, and that critical misunderstandings about affirmative action subject them to an assumption that aside from their race they are otherwise unqualified for the jobs that they have (a phenomenon that Wallace, Moore, Wilson, and Hart’s chapter provocatively suggests is quite different in industry where “affirmative action” hires are more likely to be viewed as contributing unique skills to the strength and diversity of the workplace). As Harris and González note in their introduction, the power of individual stories is that, taken together, they demonstrate patterns indicative of structural problems that require structural solutions.</p>
<p>Importantly and painfully, the chapters in this volume remind us that diversifying the faculty does not eliminate racism. Women of color in a variety of disciplines, who work at different levels of the academic hierarchy, share stories of the intersections of sexism, racism, and classism that manifest in egregious salary discrepancies; excessively high expectations for service; inadequate mentorship; rifts with their families of origin (especially in cases of “upward” class mobility); silencing and invisibility; and being demoted, dismissed, or treated as an “exception.” Although there are chapters about—and by—effective White allies, there are also stories of unsupportive White women colleagues, some of whom presume a similarity based on gender that critically ignores the intersectional effects of racism and sexism for women of color. The book is in some ways a disheartening testimony to the persistence of discrimination based on the intersections of gender, race, and class in academia; it is at the same time a manifestation of the successes of many brilliant and hardworking women of color.</p>
<p>Psychological concepts, research, and researchers are very present in this volume. Many chapters, including those written by non-psychologists, illustrate phenomena and cite research related to identity, stereotypes and prejudice, discrimination, alliance-building, and sense of belonging. One of the coeditors (Yolanda Flores Niemann) is a psychology professor, and several chapters or section introductions are authored by psychologists (including Beth Boyd, Nancy Cantor, John Dovidio, Kelly Ervin, and Stephanie Shields). The collection is also useful for scholars of higher education. It includes rich histories of different constituencies of women of color in academia. Harris and González’s introductory chapter offers a particularly insightful analysis of the individualist, White, middle- and upper-middle class, heterosexual, and male culture of academia that ultimately expects everyone else to assimilate to its norms and values.</p>
<p>The book is very long (the coeditors call it “monumental,” which is apt!), but the truth is that it could have been even longer. The coeditors note that many declined their invitation for fear of retaliation or to protect their colleagues—because they were warned that this kind of writing would seem too “personal” and thus “unprofessional” or because they could not bear to revisit painful experiences. Indeed, many authors who did contribute began their chapters with a description of their initial reluctance to do so; others appear to be writing under a pseudonym or at least do not disclose their institutional affiliation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Gutiérrez y Muhs, Niemann, González, and Harris have compiled a rich and varied set of essays that can serve a wide range of purposes and that have the potential for tremendous impact. Women of color in the academy will no doubt find themselves in many places in this book, and I suspect it can go a long way toward not only validating their experiences but also assuring them that that their challenges are not “personal” or idiosyncratic. Chapters on teaching evaluations (by Sylvia R. Lazos) and a set of lessons and recommendations by Yolanda Flores Niemann based on all of the other chapters in the book are a must-read for every faculty and administrator who is committed to meaningfully “diversifying the faculty.” There is a long way to go to achieving that goal in a way that is grounded in social justice and real transformation; <italic>Presumed Incompetent</italic> can play a significant role in helping us get there.</p>
