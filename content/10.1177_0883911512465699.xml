<abstract>
<p>Drug eluting coronary stents coated with a bioactive and biostable polymer system (THBA70), based on acrylate copolymers bearing a salicylic acid derivative as side substituent, were evaluated. The microstructural architecture of the copolymer THBA70 comprises a random copolymer of a methacrylate derivative from triflusal (4-trifluoromethyl salicylic acid) with 45 mol% of THEMA (2-methacryloyloxyethyl [2-(acetyloxy)-4-(trifluoromethyl)] benzoate), which makes the system anti-thrombogenic with good adhesion to the surface of metallic stents. The bioactive coating prevented thrombosis, an adverse effect associated with the implantation of drug-eluting stents. The in vitro drug delivery of drug-eluting stents under dynamic conditions indicated excellent controlled drug release. The THBA70 films loaded with relatively low concentrations of taxol or simvastatin in contact with fibroblasts produced inhibition of cell proliferation with a dose-dependent bioactivity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The implantation of stents has been used extensively in the treatment of coronary artery obstructions in recent years. However, a frequently occurring and undesirable secondary effect of the use of these devices is in-stent restenosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911512465699">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911512465699"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911512465699">3</xref></sup> This is due to the growth of smooth muscle cells during the restriction of blood vessels after the application of angioplasty and implantation of the coronary stents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911512465699">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911512465699"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911512465699">6</xref></sup> The rate of restenosis has been reduced with anti-proliferative drugs eluted from polymer-coated stents that inhibit the growth and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the edges of the stented segment of the artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911512465699">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911512465699"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911512465699"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911512465699"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911512465699"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911512465699">12</xref></sup> Local delivery of sirolimus, paclitaxel, zotarolimus or everolimus from polymer-coated stents has efficaciously reduced restenosis rates. These devices have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and other devices are in advanced stages of development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911512465699">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911512465699">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911512465699">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although drug-eluting stents (DES) have brought about impressive clinical benefits in the treatment of arterial obstruction, their use has led to higher rates of stent thrombosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911512465699">15</xref></sup> There are several reasons for this complication, including delayed re-endothelialization by drug elution, an increase of platelet aggregation and thrombosis induced by polymer persisting in the artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911512465699">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911512465699">17</xref></sup> Work on DES is, therefore, focused on the design of new polymer platforms. We reported a new bioactive polymeric system for stent coating (THBA70),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911512465699">18</xref></sup> that contained triflusal, a powerful anti-aggregation drug derived from salicylic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911512465699">19</xref></sup> Because of the favourable physico-chemical properties of this copolymer system and its biological attributes: excellent biocompatibility, good adhesion to surfaces and an inherent anti-thrombogenic effect; this material could be applied easily and successfully as an anti-thrombogenic coating for coronary stents. In addition, the polymer matrix loaded with specific antiproliferative drugs offers an excellent system for controlled release in the formulation of DES.</p>
<p>In this article, the application and biological evaluation of a polymeric coating for coronary stents (THBA70) charged with two alternative anti-proliferative drugs, simvastatin (SMV) and taxol (TX), are described. Simvastatin (SMV), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor derived from fungal fermentation, is widely used as a safe and effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, as well as to suppress the proliferative response of vascular smooth muscle cells after vascular injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911512465699">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883911512465699">21</xref></sup> TX is an extract derived from the bark of the <italic>Taxus brevifolia</italic> tree. TX inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation by the stabilization of microtubules, and thereby inhibits cell division leading to cell death and apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883911512465699">22</xref></sup> Thus, the incorporation of SMV or TX in the polymeric coating (THBA70) could potentially improve the stent application and provide long-term non-thrombogenic activity.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>Triflusal was kindly provided by Laboratorios Uriach. THEMA monomer, 2-methacryloyloxyethyl [2-(acetyloxy)-4-(trifluoromethyl)] benzoate, was synthesized in our laboratory as described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883911512465699">23</xref></sup> Butyl acrylate (BA, Aldrich) and 1,4-dioxane (Panreac) were vacuum distilled. 2,2-Azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN, Merck) was recrystallized twice from ethanol. THBA70 copolymer was synthesized by free radical polymerization in our laboratory as reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911512465699">18</xref></sup> The polymer was obtained by the free radical polymerization at 60°C of a 70:30 wt/wt mixture of the corresponding monomers THEMA and BA ([M] = 0.95 M) in 1,4-dioxane, using AIBN as initiator (1.5 × 10<sup>−2</sup> M) (r<sub>THEMA</sub> = 1.05; r<sub>BA</sub> = 0.33).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911512465699">18</xref></sup> The THBA70 copolymer was obtained at high conversion (&gt;90%); the Mn was 52,000 and the Mw was 131,000 with a polydispersity index of 2.54. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) were obtained from Sigma.</p>

<sec id="section4-0883911512465699">
<title>Stent coating</title>
<p>A homogeneous film of the polymer THBA70 containing 2.5 wt% of TX (or SMV) was formed on the surface of the metallic stent by spray projection of a dioxane solution (4% wt/v) of the polymer THBA70 and the drug TX or SMV on the surface of the metallic stent. The spray was applied to the expanded stent using computer-assisted rotating technology, assuring a homogeneous distribution of the coating and excellent adhesion of the film to the metallic surface. The coating was dried in an oven under a controlled atmosphere to give a final thickness of 2.5–3.0 µm. The coating contained 300 ± 2 µg of the copolymer and 7.5 µg of the antitumoral drug (taxol or simvastatin) physically and homogeneously distributed in the coating matrix.</p>
<p>The coating was verified by optical microscopy that no fragmentation or cracking of the polymer film occurred. The flexibility of the polymer THBA70 was relatively high (glass transition temperature, Tg = 21°C). The thickness of the coating was measured with an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, Philips XL30) in the environmental mode, to avoid metallizing the samples. At least 10 data points from different regions of the coated stents were obtained.</p>
<sec id="section5-0883911512465699">
<title>Stent drug release</title>
<p>Six sterile-coated and sterile-expanded stents were placed in a 6 × 60 mm cylindrical chamber, and the medium was circulated by a peristaltic pump. The release media were 7 mL of PBS with 20% of FBS for the analysis of SMV and 5% of Tween20 for the analysis of TX. This was necessary to improve the solubility of the drugs in water. Experiments were carried out at 37°C and with a flow rate of 12.5 mL/min. At specific times, 0.5 mL of the circulating fluid were collected through a three-way sample collector and replaced by the same volume of fresh medium to maintain a constant volume.</p>
<p>Drug release was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The analysis of SMV was performed using a (40:60) aqueous methanol solution of PIC A (a solution of tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate in water, supplied by Waters) as the mobile phase and a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A Shimadzu HPLC system (LC20AD), equipped with ultraviolet–visible (UV-VIS) detector Shimadzu SPD-10A VP set at 239 nm and a Waters μBoundapak C18 column (3.9 × 300 mm), was used for the determination of SMV. The same conditions were used for the analysis of TX, with a mobile phase of water/methanol (40:60) and a 227 nm. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate using stents stored at room temperature for 0 and 9 months and 1.5 years, to evaluate the stability of the coating.</p>

<sec id="section6-0883911512465699">
<title>Cell cultures</title>
<p>SMV and TX were supplied by Iberhospitex S.A. Thermanox (TMX) and Alamar Blue (AB) were supplied by Serotec and Aldrich, respectively. Polystyrene discs (TMX) of 10 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness were used as support of films made with 2% w/v solutions of THBA70 and THBA70 + SMV or THBA70 + TX in dioxane:ethanol (1:2). These films were used for direct and indirect biocompatibility experiments. The anti-proliferative drug was loaded in a range of 0.62 to 2.5 % for TX and 0.16 to 2.5% for SMV (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883911512465699">Table I</xref>). All specimens were sterilized with ethylene oxide. The negative control was tissue culture plastic, an international standard.</p>

The medium was removed at different time periods (1, 2 and 7 days) and replaced with other 5 mL of fresh medium. Fibroblast cells were seeded in sterile 96-well culture plates with 11 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/mL in complete medium and incubated to confluence. The medium was then replaced with the corresponding eluted extract and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. A solution of MTT was prepared in warm PBS (0.5 mg/mL), and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Excess medium and MTT were removed, and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was added to all wells in order to solubilize the MTT taken up by the cells. This was mixed for 10 min, and the absorbance was measured with a BioTek ELx808IU detector using a test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Two very significant side effects of the implantation of coronary stents are thrombosis and restenosis produced by proliferation of smooth muscle cells. In order to avoid these complications, a family of copolymers was developed based on the random distribution of acrylic monomeric units with complementary properties; BA, which provided adhesion and flexibility to polymeric chains and THEMA, with adequate anti-thrombogenic activity. The copolymer system THBA70 is an acrylic statistical copolymer with a composition of 45 mol% of THEMA and 55 mol% of BA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512465699">Figure 1</xref>). According to the reactivity ratios of the corresponding monomers and the free radical polymerization procedure, the co-monomer units are randomly distributed along the macromolecular chain. This microstructure provides good adhesion properties to the metallic surface (associated with the BA sequences) and confers adequate flexibility with glass transition temperature, Tg = 21°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911512465699">13</xref></sup>. The in vitro release of the anti-proliferative drugs was evaluated in a dynamic circuit to simulate in vivo conditions of blood flow and turbulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883911512465699">Figure 2</xref>). A comparison of the drug release profiles obtained in dynamic conditions for SMV-loaded and TX-loaded coatings is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512465699">Figure 3</xref>. The TX (or SMV) maximum of 2.5 wt% was distributed homogeneously in the coating.</p>

<p>In both cases, the drug was released in a sustained manner for 18 days. The release was followed by dynamic assays of groups of six loaded stents according to the protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883911512465699">Figure 2</xref>). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate, the average data being plotted in the diagrams of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512465699">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
<p>The drug delivery from sterilized coated stents after different storage times was evaluated for the stability of DES. This assay is important in the assessment of the stability of the coating on storage, with the corresponding critical implications for the commercialization process. The TX-loaded stents did not show significant differences in the release profile when examined at different intervals up to 1.5 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911512465699">Figure 4</xref>).

<p>Cell viability for the polymer system THBA70 was maintained at the same level as for TMX. In the case of SMV-charged formulations (S1, S2 and S3), the cytotoxicity of the eluent decreased with successive washings, and the highest were the extracts obtained at day 1. The increment of SMV in the formulations caused a major release of toxic components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512465699">Figure 5(a)</xref>). The results of a similar analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512465699">Figure 5(b)</xref> of the systems loaded with TX. The values of relative cell viability with respect to the TMX control were approximately 20% lower than control. This is a consequence of the natural anti-proliferative effect of TX.</p>

<p>In the presence of TX or SMV, the cell structure and morphological aspects changed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0883911512465699">Figure 7</xref>. The fibroblast distribution and morphology changed after cultures of 24 h were placed in contact with TX-polymer system T2 extracts taken after 2 days. In addition to the normal fibroblast with a fibre-like structure, several rounded cells were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0883911512465699">Figure 7(a)</xref>). Some of the latter were observed to have small vesicles in the cytoplasm membrane, identified as apoptotic bodies, which is a clear indication of the activation of an apoptotic process.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>THBA70 is a highly hydrophobic and relatively flexible random copolymer constituted by random sequences of the methacrylic derivative of salicylic acid THEMA and BA, which contains 45 mol% of the bioactive THEMA units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911512465699">Figure 1</xref>). The system was loaded with a homogenous distribution of the anti-proliferative drugs TX or SMV. At the doses used in the present study (up to 2.5 wt%), this did not lead to aggregation or formation of crystalline clusters (confirmed by optical microscopy with polarized light and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC)); there was an adequate diffusion of the drugs to the physiological medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512465699">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>The copolymer system THBA70 had a clear anti-aggregating effect on platelets, with a long sustained effect due to the high stability of the polymer. THBA70 may, therefore, be considered to behave as a ‘polymeric drug’ with anti-thrombogenic effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911512465699">18</xref></sup> Based on the diagrams shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512465699">Figure 3</xref> that controlled release was obtained for both SMV-loaded and TX-loaded stents, but the SMV examples had fast releases during the first 2 days in comparison with the release profile of the TX-loaded stents. This can be explained by considering the highly hydrophobic character of TX and the polymer, which renders the drug–polymer system highly stable in the physiological medium. SMV, being less hydrophobic, was released faster mainly from the more external layers of the polymer coating, but in both cases, the release was controlled by diffusion. After sterile storage, the long-term stability of the TX and SMV–DES coating was analysed at various times. The release profile for TX was similar after 9 months and 1.5 years of storage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911512465699">Figure 4</xref>). The SMV–DES, under storage, did not produce any diffusion or aggregation of the charged drug and remained as amorphous molecules distributed homogeneously in the bulk coating.</p>
<p>It is known that SMV exerts an anti-proliferative effect on different types of cells like fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883911512465699">25</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911512465699"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883911512465699"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883911512465699"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883911512465699"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883911512465699">30</xref></sup> In this study, the cellular behaviour evaluation of the polymer system THBA70 loaded with SMV effectively suppressed cell survival of fibroblast cultures. The MTT assays carried out with coatings of THBA70 + SMV at concentrations of SMV 2.5 wt% (S1), SMV 0.62 wt% (S2) and SMV 0.16 wt% (S3) showed a dose-dependent effect of the drug in the fibroblast toxicity for a period of 7 days. An inhibitory effect on cell proliferation was observed during the first day of the experiment and remained for 1 week with a clear influence by the concentration of the drug charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512465699">Figure 5(a)</xref>). The system charged with TX behaved rather similar except the cytotoxicity of THBA70 + TX was somewhat higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911512465699">Figure 5(b)</xref>) than the corresponding coating with SMV at the same dose, T1 = 2.5 wt% and T2 = 0.62 wt%. Higher concentrations of TX or SMV produced a cumulative effect on the cytotoxicity of fibroblasts, leading to the death of the culture. This does not happen under dynamic conditions or in vivo where there is constant replacement of the medium.</p>
<p>A good correlation between the release profile of TX or SMV and the cytotoxic effects in fibroblast cultures is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0883911512465699">Figure 6</xref>. The alterations in the population and proliferation of fibroblasts were observed by optical microscopy. With cells treated with eluents obtained after 2 days, a higher inhibition was observed for those systems charged with SMV. However, based on the images of cells treated with the system THBA70 + TX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0883911512465699">Figure 7(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0883911512465699">(b)</xref>), the apoptotic process, which is related to the mechanism of the effect of TX on cells, was evident.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0883911512465699">Figure 9</xref>, the cell viability in the first day of experiment – inferred directly from the optical density ratio (OD <sub>570 nm</sub>/OD <sub>630 nm</sub>) – was practically the same for the control TMX, the polymer itself THBA70 and the polymer–SMV at the three concentrations of SMV analysed. On day 4, the clear influence of the concentration of SMV on the proliferation of cells was consistently observed, an effect that is much more marked after longer time periods (7, 14 and 21 days). Cell behaviour correlated well with the release profile of SMV to the culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512465699">Figure 3</xref>). THBA70 is hydrophobic, non-soluble and stable in the medium; therefore, the release of SMV or TX was by diffusion following the profile in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911512465699">Figure 3</xref>. The relatively fast release in the first 4 days for SMV was sufficient to modulate and control the proliferation of cells, and this effect was even more marked at 7, 14 and 21 days. After the same intervals, the natural decrease of cell proliferation due to hindrance of the growing cells was seen in control experiments, with the polymer and with the polymer–SMV systems.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>THBA70 copolymer derived from the anti-thrombogenic drug triflusal (a derivative of salicylic acid) showed a very low level of cytotoxicity in standard cultures of fibroblasts, promoting the adherence and proliferation of cells. The physical addition of SMV or TX to this copolymer induced a modulated drug release controlled by diffusion from polymer-coated coronary stents, extending over a period of time beyond 15 days, dependent on the load. The addition of these drugs caused a modulated decrease of cell proliferation on the surface of the material, depending on the level of the anti-proliferating drug incorporated.</p>
