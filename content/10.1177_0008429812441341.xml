<abstract><p>There is a surprising silence about any kind of education of children by Christian families until quite late, and information about the education of girls is even scarcer. Margaret MacDonald and I, in <italic>A Woman’s Place: House Churches in Earliest Christianity</italic> (Fortress Press, 2006), tried to develop whatever information there is. Here we follow some of the elusive strands from ascetic writers of the third and fourth centuries that suggest the beginnings of a full educational program for girls, which would certainly have applied only in selective situations, but that may have its origins much earlier.</p>
<p>Il ya un silence surprenant sur toute forme d’éducation des enfants par les familles chrétiennes jusqu’à assez tard, et l’information sur l’éducation des filles est encore plus rare. Avec Margaret MacDonald j’ai essayé d’élaborer l’information existante [<italic>A Woman’s Place: House Churches in Earliest Christianity</italic> (Fortress Press, 2006)]. Ici, nous suivons quelques-uns des volets insaisissables d’écrivains ascétiques des IIIe et IVe siècles qui suggèrent le début d’un programme complet d’éducation pour les filles qui ne s’aurait certainement appliqué que dans des situations sélectives, mais qui peut avoir ses origines beaucoup plus tôt.</p>

<p>Before the fourth century, there is very little information about how Christians educated their children. We must assume that they sent them to the regular schools, where they learned literacy through Homer or Virgil, depending on the language of instruction, and were taught at home the proper understanding of the virtuous life. We must also assume that among Christian families the ordinary patterns were present regarding social status, gender differences and education. Though we certainly know of some highly educated elite women, generally boys were favored for literacy education over girls, and therefore higher rates of literacy prevailed among men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008429812441341">Marrou, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008429812441341">Harris, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0008429812441341">MacKay, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to realize that generally when we speak of “education” in the ancient Mediterranean world, we tend to mean formal, school education, especially literacy, philosophy, and rhetoric. To limit notions of education to these disciplines is, of course, an elitist and sexist bias. Education means the training of children to take their place in adult society by acquisition of whatever skills are needed. That included in many contexts the training of girls in household skills and management, and the training of boys in the technical skills of artisans, builders, and the like. There is also the important aspect of character formation, at whatever social and educational status. About these kinds of education, however, except in the context of the philosophical schools, the sources are mostly silent, so that we can only surmise what this area of training was like.</p>
<p>What is especially lost, except for passing references (e.g., 1 Tim 5:10; Titus 2:3–5), is traditions of women’s education, passed down from generation to generation of women and rarely committed to writing. This is intergenerational communication from mother to daughter, over many years of formal and informal training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441341">Osiek, MacDonald and Tulloch, 2006</xref>: 90–92). Such training included production of food and clothing, household management, and sexual initiation. It also included training to character and those virtues most highly prized in women. While numbers of girls were educated in literacy especially in their own homes, the majority were not. Yet their learning in household management was often highly skilled and highly prized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441341">Osiek, MacDonald and Tulloch, 2006</xref>:144–163).</p>
<p>We return to the discussion of literacy, because that is where the preponderance of evidence is located. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008429812441341">Eusebius</xref> relates that when Origen in Caesarea began his biblical work with the support of his powerful patron Ambrose, he was supplied with everything he needed:<disp-quote>
<p>As he dictated there were ready at hand more than seven shorthand-writers, who relieved each other at fixed times, and as many copyists, as well as girls skilled in penmanship (κóραις '∊π℩ τò καλλιγραφ∊ι⌢ν 'ησκημ∊´ναις); for all of whom Ambrose supplied without stint the necessary means. (<italic>Ecclesiastical History</italic> 6.23)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This is an intriguing and rare reference to trained girls in a copyists’ world that we generally assume to be male. We also know that in later years, as the monastic movement developed for women, copying manuscripts became a principal work for them. But how did they acquire their education?</p>
<p>By the late fourth century, discussions begin to develop among Christian writers on how to raise mostly sons, but occasionally also daughters. This means that traditions and theories for such education were by this time in process of development. Here we will examine four documents that give hints at an emerging distinctively Christian way of education, albeit based on earlier exemplars, but modified in specific ways.</p>
<p>Most of the few such discussions, especially about raising girls, are intended for a girl to be raised in virginity and asceticism. Jerome’s Ep. 107 to Laeta and Ep. 128 to Gaudentius are good examples, and we will consider them later. Two such discussions do not necessarily envision a life of asceticism beyond that of the normal ideals of virtuous life, however. The first is John Chrysostom’s <italic>On Vainglory</italic> <italic>and the Raising of Children </italic>(π∊ρí κ∊νοδοξíας καí ανατροϕης των τέκνων). This sermon/treatise is of uncertain date and place, whether in Antioch or Constantinople. In any event, it was written in the last years of the fourth or first years of the fifth century. There are possible influences from Plutarch; John certainly read earlier treatises on the education of children.</p>
<p>Roughly the first fifteen paragraphs concentrate on “vainglory,” which we might simply call “fixation on honor.” By paragraph 16 he has turned to raising children; the topic flows naturally from consideration of vainglory into how to raise a child not to be vainglorious. Nearly all the discussion for the next seventy-four paragraphs focuses on sons, though with occasional references to a daughter. The final paragraph (90) turns fully but briefly to the role of mothers with their sons—and even with their daughters.</p>
<p>John is really writing about the raising of sons by fathers. He compares the child to a statue that must be carefully sculpted and adorned (22), the child’s soul to a city filled with citizens who need training by laws composed by parents (25), and to a tablet waiting to be written upon (26). Among other precepts, he inveighs that the child should be taught not to speak ill of or contemptuously to anyone, even slaves. If he can learn not even to abuse slaves, then he will not abuse his equals, either (31).</p>
<p>At the same time, the child’s environment should be so controlled that he hears nothing harmful, especially from slaves and nurses who surround him (37). No frivolous stories of romance; rather, parents and tutors should get the child interested in Bible stories by telling them like “Once upon a time” narratives (38–40). John even illustrates what he means with the example of the story of Jacob and Esau. “Once upon a time there were two brothers … .”</p>
<p>In choosing a name for a child, parents should not follow Greek religious customs, such as lighting candles that are each assigned names, and naming the child for the last candle to go out (48). (This odd custom is attested later in Byzantine practice: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008429812441341">John Chrysostom, trans. Laistner, 1951</xref>: 17, n. 27. Not much more is known about it, or about usual ways of naming children.) In some families, the custom was to name children after grandparents.</p>
<p>Much of what Chrysostom says here could apply equally to daughters as well as to sons, but in the final paragraph, he says:<disp-quote>
<p>Let his mother learn to train her daughter by these precepts, to guide her away from extravagance and personal adornment and all other such vanities that are the mark of harlots. Let the mother act by this ordinance at all times and guide the youth and the maiden away from luxury and drunkenness. This also contributes greatly to virtue. Young men are troubled by desire, women by love of finery and excitement. Let us therefore repress all these tendencies. Thus we shall be able to please God by rearing such athletes for Him, that we and our children may light on the blessings that are promised to them that love Him (cf. I Corinthians 2:9), by the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit be ascribed glory, power, and honor, now and for evermore. Amen. (<italic>On Vainglory and the Raising of Children</italic> 90)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The second, nearly contemporary, treatise in which the education of girls is not intended especially for the ascetic life is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429812441341">Gregory of Nyssa</xref>’s <italic>Life of Macrina</italic>, Gregory’s touching account of his final visit to his older sister in her monastery at Annesi in Pontus when he was on his way home from the Council of Antioch in September 379. Their brother Basil the Great had died eight months earlier. Gregory arrived to find Macrina dying. He was able to be present for her death and funeral, and afterwards composed the <italic>Life</italic> of his sister for the monk Olympius. The letter briefly touches on Macrina’s upbringing in view of engagement and marriage, which was diverted to celibacy only by the adolescent Macrina’s own decision when her fiancé died suddenly, and ultimately to the founding of a monastery.</p>
<p>Here is what he says of her education in par. 3:<disp-quote>
<p>Well, the child was reared. Although she had her own nurse, yet as a rule her mother did the nursing with her own hands. After passing the stage of infancy, she showed herself apt in acquiring childish accomplishments and her natural powers were shown in every study to which her parents’ judgment directed her. The education of the child was her mother’s task; she did not, however, employ the usual worldly method of education, which makes a practice of using poetry as a means of training the early years of the child. For she considered it disgraceful and quite unsuitable, that a tender and plastic nature should be taught either those tragic passions of womanhood which afforded poets their suggestions and plots, or the indecencies of comedy to be, so to speak, defiled with unseemly tales of Troy. But such parts of inspired Scripture as you would think were incomprehensible to young children were the subject of the girl’s studies; in particular the Wisdom of Solomon, and those parts of it especially which have an ethical bearing. Nor was she ignorant of any part of the Psalter but at stated times she recited every part of it. When she rose from bed, or engaged in household duties or rested, or partook of food or retired from table, when she went to bed or rose in the night for prayer, the Psalter was her constant companion, like a good fellow-traveler that never deserted her. (<italic>Life of Macrina</italic> 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We turn now to two letters of Jerome, intended as responses to requests for advice about the raising of a daughter who was to be dedicated to virginity and asceticism. In some respects, this is a special case and not indicative of the education of most Christian girls; yet, as we will see, much of it was probably by this time general wisdom.</p>
<p>Ep. 107 to Laeta, daughter-in-law of Jerome’s ascetic companion, Paula, was written from Bethlehem about 403 CE. His letter to Gaudentius, Ep., 128, was written about 413. Both seek advice on raising their daughter for the ascetic life. Jerome of course borrows from previous educational writers, but he also shows himself to be a keen observer of children, or at least, capable of listening to the advice of those who have raised them. One suspects the background voice of his beloved monastic companion Paula, who had raised five children. Some of the details of his teaching reveal that a very young child is envisioned here.</p>
<p>Christians are not born, but made, he asserts (107.1). There is some of the usual advice. The little girl should associate only with other girls, not boys. She should learn obedience to her mother and teachers. She should avoid public places and learn to love her own chamber (128.3), though she can attend all-night church vigils with her mother (107.9). These nocturnal vigils on major feast days and the feasts of important saints, with picnicking and camping out overnight in church, were quite the rage in Italy and especially in North Africa. Augustine’s mother Monica was very devoted to them. While Augustine, Monica, and the rest of their group were resident in Milan, Monica discovered that the local bishop, Ambrose, had forbidden them, and she had to acquiesce (Augustine, <italic>Conf.</italic> 6.2). Later, when Augustine was bishop in Hippo, he and Aurelius of Carthage also tried to suppress them. His <italic>Letters</italic> 22 and 29 speak of the excessive drinking that often accompanied these supposed acts of piety.  </p>
<p>The girl should learn to get along without bathing. This theme runs through the ascetic literature, probably for a number of reasons, including association with luxury and the necessity of nakedness in the public context of the baths. Jerome is not unduly hard on such a young child, however. She should have a virtuous nurse and be doted upon by her grandparents (107.6). She should have a good male tutor (surprisingly) and not be taught by women to shorten words. Perhaps this has to do with correct speech rather than use of colloquialisms or what we might call slang. It is curious that this practice is identified with women. Women’s household communications with each other perhaps used such dialects or verbal shorthand.</p>
<p>She should not be allowed any gold, pearls, cosmetics, or pierced ears—common advice for virtuous women (cf. 1 Tim 2:9; 1 Peter 3:3). She should not listen to instrumental music, which was probably associated with luxury, in contrast to unaccompanied voices (107.8). She should not be present “at the weddings of your slaves” (107.11), an interesting allusion to a social event that is rarely referenced in the literature of household life. While there was no such thing as a legal marriage between slaves, we know from inscriptional evidence that indeed slaves did consider themselves married and even used the legal terminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008429812441341">Martin, 2003</xref>). It thus goes without saying in Jerome’s thinking that the child should not attend family weddings, which may be celebrated elsewhere than the household in which she lives. Celebrations of slave unions must have taken place within the house itself, so that the child would then have to be secluded in some other part of the house. The prohibition for the girl destined to asceticism was undoubtedly because of the association of weddings with revelry and drunkenness. We can therefore assume that the same level of celebration, though perhaps not with the same expenditure, happened in households that celebrated slave unions.</p>
<p>Baptism for the child is a great advantage: it was therefore not yet taken for granted in Jerome’s circles. He does not call here for infant baptism, and he does not specify an ideal age, only that this ritual of admission to the community is a good thing, presumably because the girl, old enough to realize what is happening, will be impressed by this reminder of her identity.</p>
<p>Her parents are her first models, so, with advice applicable to parents everywhere, Jerome prescribes that “Never either in you or her father let her see what she cannot imitate without sin” (107.9). While her parents must exemplify virtue in her presence, they seem exempt from giving dietary example. The girl should not eat with her parents, lest she acquire a taste for luxurious foods. This piece of advice rather begs the question of how her parents dine, even when they are not entertaining guests. Apparently they are not held to the diet that he would like applied to their daughter, probably because of social obligations for the Roman elite. Nevertheless, she can have a little wine (because the Bible says so, 1 Tim 5:23) and some meat. Though a vegetarian diet is best, he has the good sense to say that it is not for a small child (107.8). Her day should consist of prayer, reading, and spinning, her normal food of herbs, wheat bread and sometimes fish, so that meat is to be only occasional. She should be taught to fast, but only moderately (107.9). She should rise at night for prayer and the Psalms, and pray in the morning, at the third, sixth, and ninth hours, and at evening (107.9). This rhythm of daily prayer and of Psalms was long established in Christian daily life. It is unlikely that the girl was expected to do this alone. Presumably, her parents or her nurse should be taking the lead here.</p>
<p>In the area more strictly of education, she should be taught daily to memorize some verses of Scripture, starting with the Psalms and Wisdom of Solomon, the same two biblical collections that were the basis of the spiritual education of Macrina, as described by her brother Gregory. She should learn the Scriptures in Greek, but also study Latin early to get her accent right (107.9). She should be given the letters of the alphabet made of wood or ivory for her toys, so that she will learn them by play. She should be shown exemplars of writing, and her hand guided on a wax tablet to form the letters. She should be rewarded for good spelling, and given sweet treats and time off to play when she does her lessons correctly. Rewards are to be given, but no scolding. She should have companions to study with who are serious girls, so that she will have competition.</p>
<p>She should read all the Scriptures, but the Song of Songs last, so that once she knows all the Scriptures, she will understand its spiritual meaning. She should, however, avoid all the apocryphal writings because they require a great deal of discretion and discernment (107.11). Once she has mastered all the Scriptures, she should be allowed to read all of Cyprian, Athanasius, and Hilary. Of course, says Jerome, if you really want to do the best thing for her, send her to her grandmother Paula in Bethlehem! (107.13). This is in fact what Laeta eventually did. Little Paula arrived in Bethlehem and spent the rest of her life in her grandmother’s monastery.</p>
<p>When the elder Paula died in 404, her daughter Eustochium, little Paula’s aunt, succeeded her in the leadership of the women’s monastery. Sadly, Jerome outlived not only his contemporary Paula but also her daughter Eustochium. When Eustochium died, about 420, the younger Paula in turn succeeded her aunt in the monastery’s leadership, which was kept in the family for three generations.</p>
<p>These women about whom we have some information were obviously wealthy elite women who could have enjoyed lives of luxury. Instead, they chose an opposite extreme, lives of severe asceticism but also of a level of learning that probably no other women of their time enjoyed, with the possible exception of those rare women philosophers of whom mention is sometimes fleetingly made, like their contemporary Hypatia of Alexandria. We still have little idea about education for the rest of the women of the Empire. It is clear, however, that by the end of the fourth century, there was an educational tradition being formed that took the best of its classical heritage and reshaped it by substituting the Scriptures in Greek for the epic texts of the culture (though Paula and her companions also learned the Bible in Hebrew). It is also clear from the accounts that have come down to us that at least in these elite would-be-monastic circles, monastic life enhanced learning for women, and the theological education of women was just as important as that of men.</p>
