<abstract>
<p>This article describes the development and validation of a six-scale survey to assess school climate in terms of students’ perceptions of the degree to which they feel welcome and connected, together with a scale to assess students’ perceptions of bullying. The development of each survey involved a multi-stage approach, including: 1) an extensive review of research related to school climate to identify components that can be considered important for effective schools made up of diverse students; 2) elucidating the scales identified in step one; and 3) writing individual items within the scales. Items from previously validated questionnaires were examined and, if appropriate, adapted. We used Trochim and Donnelly’s (2006) framework for construct validity to guide the validation of the new questionnaire. When the questionnaire was administered to a sample of 4067 high school students from eight schools, various statistical analyses ensured the questionnaire’s discriminant, convergent, concurrent and predictive validity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A school’s culture has been referred to as a school’s ethos or climate and, although there is no consensus on the definition of school culture, it is generally agreed that it involves a group phenomenon based on the quality and character of school life and patterns of people’s experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1365480212473680">Cohen, McCabe, Michelli, &amp; Pickeral, 2009</xref>). For the purpose of this article, school climate refers to the quality and character of school life, including the norms, values and expectations that a school accepts and promotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1365480212473680">Brookover, 1985</xref>). These, in turn, create an environment that dictates whether the staff, students and parents feel safe (socially, emotionally or physically), welcome and respected.</p>
<p>In the literature, there has been some confusion between the terms ‘school culture’ and ‘school climate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1365480212473680">Schoen &amp; Teddlie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1365480212473680">Van Houtte, 2005</xref>) and, until recently, these terms have often been used interchangeably. The notions of climate and culture originated from the different disciplines of psychology and anthropology, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1365480212473680">Van Houtte (2005)</xref> has suggested that school culture is best understood as a component of school climate, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1365480212473680">Schoen and Teddlie (2008)</xref> have recently proposed a model whereby school climate can be better understood as a level of school culture. Although it is acknowledged that research involving both traditions have merit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1365480212473680">Freiberg, 1999</xref>), for the purpose of this research, we have used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1365480212473680">Schoen and Teddlie’s (2008)</xref> model as a guide.</p>
<p>It is widely acknowledged that a school’s culture is a major factor that can affect and influence school improvement and change efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1365480212473680">Bryk &amp; Schneider, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1365480212473680">Daly, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1365480212473680">Sailes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1365480212473680">Schoen &amp; Teddlie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1365480212473680">Van Houtte, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1365480212473680">Deal and Peterson (1999)</xref> are of the opinion that school reform efforts are likely to fail if they are not meaningfully linked to a school’s culture. Past studies also indicate that elements of the school culture play a pivotal role in promoting or providing barriers to the implementation of school-wide programs, including those related to bullying and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1365480212473680">Coyle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1365480212473680">Greene, 2008</xref>). The school culture characteristics that are likely to support successful implementation include collaboration, connections among staff, a sense of family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1365480212473680">Coyle, 2008</xref>) and the quality of relationships between students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1365480212473680">Coyle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1365480212473680">Greene, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Positive school climates have been found to be related to increased student engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1365480212473680">Brady, 2006</xref>) and improved academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1365480212473680">Brookover et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1365480212473680">Esposito, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1365480212473680">Hoy &amp; Hannum, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1365480212473680">MacNeil, Prater, &amp; Busch, 2009</xref>). In one study, involving 270,000 fourth and eighth graders in over 10,000 schools, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212473680">Lubienski, Lubienski, and Crane (2008)</xref> performed a multilevel analysis of National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data to identify differences among schools on five factors (school size, class size, school climate, teacher certification and instructional practices) while holding demographic factors constant. This study revealed that that some of these factors, including school climate, are positively correlated with student achievement.</p>
<p>Past research has indicated that the school climate perceived by adolescents is a strong predictor of emotional and behavioural outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1365480212473680">Esposito, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1365480212473680">Kuperminc, Leadbeater, &amp; Blatt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1365480212473680">Loukas &amp; Robinson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1365480212473680">Roeser, Eccles, &amp; Sameroff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1365480212473680">Wang, Selman, Dishion, &amp; Stormshak, 2010</xref>). A large-scale study involving 10,400 students from schools across Israel revealed that a school’s climate was related to student’s reports of physical victimization, threats and verbal-social victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1365480212473680">Khoury-Kassabri, Benbenishty, &amp; Astor, 2005</xref>). Research evidence supports the notion that changes in the school climate (particularly in terms of improved teacher–student relationships and improved discipline and order) can reduce behaviour problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1365480212473680">Gottfredson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1365480212473680">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) and help to create a safe school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1365480212473680">Gottfredson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1365480212473680">Sherman et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Because research has shown that the school climate is integrally related to student academic, emotional and behavioural success at school, as well as a strong influence on the success of school reform, the focus of our research was to identify factors that contribute towards a positive school climate and to develop a questionnaire that could be used to assess these. In practical terms, this instrument could provide school administrators and those involved in reform efforts with a reliable, valid and convenient tool that can be used to provide information about students’ perceptions of the school climate that can be used to guide changes in practices. It can also be used to provide information to monitor reform efforts aimed at increasing the safety and inclusivity at the school.</p>

<title>Theoretical background</title>
<sec id="section3-1365480212473680">
<title>Relationships</title>
<p>Social capital involves features related to the cohesiveness of groups including strong social bonds that involve high levels of interpersonal trust and norms of reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212473680">Dessel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1365480212473680">Kawachi &amp; Berkmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1365480212473680">Putman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1365480212473680">Wilkinson, 1996</xref>). As such, social capital is an important feature of peer relationships that provides the foundation for connectedness in school communities. Research evidences have indicated that the accumulation of social capital can to lead to the reduction of social conflict (such as bullying) and increase the tolerance of diverse cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1365480212473680">Kawachi &amp; Berkmann, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Relationships within a school environment play a pivotal role in creating a safe and inclusive school climate. To this end, James <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212473680">Noonan (2005</xref>, p. 65) states:<disp-quote>
<p>If there is a common thread to creating a positive school climate, it is the importance of relationships – student to student, teacher to student, teacher to family, administrator to staff, school to community. Perhaps it is simplistic to conclude that something as inherently comprehensive and complex as school climate boils down to such subjective considerations as people and relationships, but that may be closest to the truth.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Within the school environment, the establishment of social bonds with teachers and with other students is influential in creating social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1365480212473680">Roffrey, 2008</xref>) and important in attaining positive student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212473680">Anderson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1365480212473680">Carbonaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1365480212473680">Johnson, Crosnoe, &amp; Elder, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1365480212473680">Shields, 1991</xref>). Philosophical assumptions about how school members treat and interact with each other involve unspoken norms and beliefs. These norms and beliefs influence the types and nature of interactions between teachers and students that take place in a school and are critical to the school climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212473680">Dessel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The teachers’ relationships with the students are a pivotal aspect of any school environment and can have a powerful influence a students’ experience of school. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1365480212473680">Noddings (1996)</xref> those students who perceive themselves to be noticed and valued by teachers are more likely to work hard and to care about themselves and others. Research has shown that students who perceive their teachers to be supportive, have greater confidence in tackling new problems and are more likely to persevere in completing challenging tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1365480212473680">Loukas &amp; Robinson, 2004</xref>). Other research has found that, if students consider teachers to be approachable, supportive and care about them, then they are more likely to seek the teachers’ help if there is a problem, have better achievement and fewer behaviour problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1365480212473680">Reinke &amp; Herman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1365480212473680">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Conversely, students who feel uncared for by teachers are likely to experience higher levels of disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1365480212473680">Sherman et al., 1997</xref>). Based on these research findings, we considered the teachers’ relationships with and support of students to be an important factor that influences the school climate.</p>
<p>The notion of peer connectedness is concerned largely with building positive levels of student-to-student rapport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1365480212473680">Roffey, 2008</xref>). The establishing of bonds between peers is a critical component of a positive school climate and numerous studies testify to the powerful influence of peer connectedness with a range of student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1365480212473680">Goldbaum, Craig, Pepler, &amp; Connolly, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1365480212473680">Rutter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1365480212473680">Stewart, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1365480212473680">Welsh, 2000</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1365480212473680">Hirschi’s (1969)</xref> social control theory, adolescents who establish social bonds within the school environment are more likely to strive to meet the expectations of society and have fewer behaviour problems. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1365480212473680">Loukas et al. (2006)</xref>, students who have a sense of social connectedness are less likely to be affected by the negative effects of self-criticism and low self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have found that positive peer relationships, acceptance and positive interactions among peers are related to reduced victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1365480212473680">Goldbaum et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1365480212473680">Kilian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1365480212473680">Welsh, 2000</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1365480212473680">Stewart (2008)</xref>, positive peer relations provide students with the means to learn and adopt more prosocial ways of dealing with conflict, thereby reducing the risk of being either a perpetrator of bullying or a victim of peer aggression. In fact, research has indicated that positive relationships with peers can promote psychological and life skills and may be related to academic achievement and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212473680">Cotterell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1365480212473680">Nichols &amp; White, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1365480212473680">Stewart, 2008</xref>). Given these theoretical and research findings, we considered students’ relationships with their peers to be a key component of the school climate.</p>

<title>School connectedness</title>
<p>Relationships within schools are considered to have a powerful influence on school connectedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1365480212473680">Rowe &amp; Stewart, 2009</xref>). School connectedness refers to a student’s sense of belonging within the school environment. Theory related to school connectedness has, in recent literature, been described as an ecological concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1365480212473680">Rowe, Stewart, &amp; Patterson, 2007</xref>). From this ecological view of school connectedness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212473680">Dessel (2010)</xref> considers the importance of the quality of relationships and degree of connectedness and cohesion amongst different and multiple groups within the school community.</p>
<p>Research findings indicate that students’ perceptions of school connectedness (sense of belonging to a school community) is positively related to academic achievement and engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1365480212473680">Bond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212473680">Lonczak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1365480212473680">Pittman &amp; Richmond, 2007</xref>). Students’ perceptions of school connectedness also have been found to be related positively to students’ completion of secondary school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1365480212473680">Bond et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, it is increasingly acknowledged that having a sense of connection to the school is strongly related to promoting students’ mental health and psychosocial well being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1365480212473680">Bond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1365480212473680">Hawkins, Kosterman, Catalano, Hill, &amp; Abbott, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1365480212473680">Resnick et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1365480212473680">Rutter, Maughan, Moretimore, Ouston, &amp; Smith, 1979</xref>) and reduced violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1365480212473680">Bisset, Markham, &amp; Aveyard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1365480212473680">Kliewer &amp; Murrelle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1365480212473680">Patton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1365480212473680">Springer, Parcel, Baumler, &amp; Ross, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been growing acknowledgement, that a comprehensive whole school approach to improving and promoting school connectedness is beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212473680">Battistich, Schaps, &amp; Wilson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1365480212473680">Erickson, Mattaini, &amp; McGuire, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1365480212473680">Hawkins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1365480212473680">Youngblade et al., 2007</xref>). Theoretical and research findings support the importance of school connectedness as an important component of the school climate that is likely to influence students’ achievement and engagement. Therefore, school connectedness was included as a construct in our study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1365480212473680">
<title>Inclusivity and affirming diversity</title>
<p>Most schools today include students from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Although, traditionally, inclusive education has referred to the inclusion of students with disabilities into mainstream classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1365480212473680">van Kraayenoord, 2007</xref>), our study draws on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1365480212473680">UNESCO’s (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1365480212473680">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1365480212473680">2000)</xref> broader aims and notion of inclusion that advocate respect, acceptance and appreciation of the diversity of our world’s cultures. In a school environment, then, inclusion and affirming diversity is related to the creation of harmony in difference so that students with differing cultural and language backgrounds feel that they are acknowledged and valued.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that the culture of the school can become a hostile environment for individuals who are exposed to victimization, harassment or prejudice. The bullying or harassment of individuals who are regarded as different (as a result of their race, religion, ability or sexual orientation) can lead to prolonged absence from school and increased violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1365480212473680">Whitted &amp; Dupper, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1365480212473680">Fraser (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1365480212473680">Rutter et al. (1979)</xref> have highlighted that the many hours that students spend in school contributes enormously to a students’ socialization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212473680">Dessel (2010</xref>, p. 408) points out that the school environment is a microcosm of our society and provides numerous opportunities for students to learn about ‘differences, conflict resolution and peaceful coexistence’. Having said this, however, past research has also indicated that prolonged contact between diverse groups and the celebration of diversity (such as Harmony Day) is not sufficient to alleviate prejudice and break down barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212473680">Dessel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Teachers often are not prepared to teach in classrooms with diverse students and are ill-equipped to deal with racism or prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1365480212473680">Marshall, 2001</xref>). Bearing in mind that the majority of teachers are white and middle class, it is not surprising then that they often are unable understand the views of minority groups.</p>
<p>Research findings indicate that the key to providing a truly multicultural education is in changing the school climate. Examining the language used in curriculum and in day-to-day interactions can help to shape the school culture. By better preparing our teachers to use anti-racist strategies and to involve an intergroup, intercultural approach that highlights the benefits of diversity, helps students to better understand their place in society. Past research highlights numerous examples of best practice and programmes that promote intercultural relationships, including multicultural and anti-bias education and moral development programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1365480212473680">Banks, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1365480212473680">Erickson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1365480212473680">Stephan &amp; Vogt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1365480212473680">Twemlow, Fonagy, &amp; Sacco, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1365480212473680">Whitted &amp; Dupper, 2005</xref>). Given the research evidence related to the importance of affirming diversity in providing an inclusive school climate, this construct was included in our study.</p>

<title>Creating an orderly environment</title>
<p>Students’ perception of their safety is an important aspect of the school culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1365480212473680">Cohen et al., 2009</xref>) and, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1365480212473680">Teddlie and Reynolds (2000)</xref>, contributes to an effective school ethos. Having clear rules and order helps students and staff to know what is expected of them and provide clear guidelines about interpersonal conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1365480212473680">Hernandez &amp; Seem, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1365480212473680">Hernandez and Seem (2004)</xref> purport that clearly defining what is considered to be acceptable behaviour is likely to lead to the creation of a safer school climate. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1365480212473680">Wang et al. (2010)</xref>, there is a need for the school climate to communicate and enforce a fair system in which clear rules are established in a fair and equitable manner. Research evidence suggests that schools which establish, communicate and enforce a fair discipline system have fewer behaviour problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1365480212473680">Kawachi &amp; Berkmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1365480212473680">Sugai &amp; Horner, 1999</xref>). Given that research evidence supports the importance of having fair, clear and consistent rules to creating a safe school environment, this construct was considered pivotal in ensuring a positive school climate.</p>
<p>Recent research indicates that adolescents often are unwilling to report and seek help if school rules are broken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1365480212473680">Eliot, Cornell, Gregory, &amp; Fan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1365480212473680">Oliver &amp; Candappa, 2007</xref>), with the rate at which students seek help declining considerably in the middle years of schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1365480212473680">Williams &amp; Cornell, 2006</xref>). In their Improving the Quality of Education for All (IQEA) project, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1365480212473680">Teddlie and Reynolds (2000)</xref> found that the ways in which a school deals with problems is likely to be reflected and established in school culture.</p>
<p>Research indicates that, in schools where students believe that they know how to report the breaking of school rules and feel comfortable doing so, the rights of students are more likely to be upheld and safer school conditions prevail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212473680">Antrop-González, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1365480212473680">Bandyopadhyay, Cornell, &amp; Konold, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1365480212473680">Williams &amp; Cornell, 2006</xref>).

<title>Past questionnaires to assess school climate</title>
<p>Surveys have been used extensively to assess school climate. The theoretical foundations of much of the research related to school climate can be traced back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1365480212473680">Lewin’s (1936)</xref> field theory in which the interaction of personal characteristics and the environment is a determinant of human behaviour. Later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212473680">Murray (1938)</xref> used Lewin’s theory to formulate a needs-press model of interaction in which personal needs can be supported or frustrated by the environment. To date, the majority of multidimensional instruments for assessing the notion of educational climate have been centred on students’ perceptions of schooling at the classroom level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1365480212473680">Fraser, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1365480212473680">Huang &amp; Fraser, 2009</xref>). There have been some examples, however, of classroom-level surveys being used to help to assess the school climate. For example, the My Class Inventory (originally developed as classroom climate instrument) was adapted for use at the school level and involving the four aspects of Friction, Cohesion, Competition among Students and Satisfaction with Classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1365480212473680">Loukas &amp; Murphy, 2007</xref>). Other studies related to the school climate have used the Classroom Environment Scale (originally developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1365480212473680">Trickett &amp; Moos, 1973</xref>). The use of the CES was found to provide a starting point for identifying dimensions related to social climates and have been found to be related to a range of outcomes, including a commitment to academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1365480212473680">Eccles &amp; Midgely, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1365480212473680">Phillips, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1365480212473680">Shouse, 1996</xref>). Our research, however, sought to include information about students’ experiences of whether the school affirmed cultural diversity, whether mechanisms were in place that allowed students to report behaviour that was prejudiced and whether the school rules helped them to feel safe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1365480212473680">Felner &amp; Felner, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1365480212473680">Gottfredson &amp; Gottfredson, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>A review of the literature revealed that there have been a number of surveys developed to assess school culture, but most of these were designed to assess teachers’ view of the school climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212473680">Anderson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1365480212473680">Maslowski, 2006</xref>), including the Work Environment Scale (WES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1365480212473680">Moos, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212473680">1986</xref>) which was later adapted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1365480212473680">Docker, Fraser, and Fisher (1989)</xref> to describe teachers’ work environment, and the School-Level Environment Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1365480212473680">Aldridge, Laugksch, &amp; Fraser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1365480212473680">Fisher &amp; Fraser, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1365480212473680">Huang &amp; Fraser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1365480212473680">Johnson &amp; Stevens, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1365480212473680">Johnson, Stevens, &amp; Zvoch, 2007</xref>). In addition, there are questionnaires developed to assess the organizational culture of the school, including, the School Culture Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1365480212473680">Saphier &amp; King, 1985</xref>), the School Work Culture Profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1365480212473680">Snyder, 1988</xref>), School Values Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1365480212473680">Pang, 1995</xref>) and the School Cultural Elements Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212473680">Cavanagh &amp; Dellar, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Some multidimensional questionnaires have been developed to assess students’ experiences of the climate of the school. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1365480212473680">Ainley, Batten, Collins, and Withers (1998)</xref> developed a scale as was used as part of a large Commonwealth-funded project in Australia. Despite claims of the scale being multidimensional, only the internal consistency and not the factor analysis was reported. Another survey was the School Climate Bullying Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1365480212473680">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009</xref>), designed to assess the nature and prevalence of bullying at school and includes the scales of Prevalence of Teasing and Bullying, Aggressive Attitudes and Willingness to Seek Help. Although an important survey, the School Climate Bullying Survey only assessed this one component of the school climate. The Assessment of Climate, Cultural Pluralism and School Safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1365480212473680">Brand, Felner, Shim, Seitsinger, &amp; Dumas, 2003</xref>) assesses 10 scales of Teacher Support, Consistency and Clarity of Rules and Expectations, Achievement Orientation, Negative Peer Interactions, Positive Peer Interactions, Disciplinary Harshness, Student Input in Decision Making, Instructional Innovation, Support for Cultural Pluralism and Safety Problems. Another study involving perceptions of school climate focused on order and discipline and achievement motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1365480212473680">Koth, Bradshaw, &amp; Leaf, 2008</xref>). Given that, to date, there is no single questionnaire that has been validated for use in high schools that are culturally and linguistically diverse the development of this new survey has filled this gap.</p>

<sec id="section8-1365480212473680">
<title>Design and procedures</title>
<p>The development and validation of the school climate questionnaires involved both quantitative and qualitative research methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1365480212473680">Creswell &amp; Plano Clarke, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1365480212473680">Trochim and Donnelly’s (2006)</xref> framework for construct validity was used to guide the validation of the new questionnaire. According to this framework, a construct must fulfil both translation and criterion-related validity requirements.</p>
<p>The development of the new questionnaires followed a three-stage approach. The first step involved identifying and defining salient scales and consisted of two steps. First, an extensive review of theories and research related to school culture was carried out. This assisted us in identifying components of the school climate that theorists, researchers and practitioners consider essential for effective schools made up of a diverse population of students. The second step was to elucidate the scales identified in step one, thereby maximizing the content validity of the instrument by ensuring that it was based on a sound theoretical framework. The third step involved writing individual items within the scales. Items from previously validated questionnaires were examined and, if appropriate, adapted. However, the majority of the items were developed for the purpose of this questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1365480212473680">
<title>Data sources</title>
<p>The sample for the large-scale administration involved all of the students (grades 8 to 12) from eight high schools. This provided a sample of 4067 students, 1971 of the students were boys and 1850 were girls (266 students did not specify their gender) ranging from 12 to 17 years of age. Of these students, approximately 65 percent were born in Australia and 35 percent were born overseas, and 76 percent spoke English as their first language and 24 percent of the students did not. Schools were selected to provide a representative sample of schools in metropolitan Western Australia. As such, the schools ranged in terms of cultural diversity and location, particularly with respect to socio-economic demographics.</p>

<title>Analysis of data</title>
<p>For the newly developed What’s Happening In This School? (WHITS) questionnaire, analysis was undertaken to fulfil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1365480212473680">Trochim and Donnelly’s (2006)</xref> construct validity framework. A pilot study was conducted with 53 students from two Year 8 science classes to confirm the face validity of the new surveys. Seven students from these two classes, based on their willingness to participate, were selected for semi-structured interviews. A range of low-achieving to high-achieving students was selected to ensure that the sample was representative of the population. The main purpose of the interviews was to confirm whether students were responding to the items on the basis intended by the questionnaire developers.</p>
<p>The next step involved examining the criterion validation of the new questionnaire in terms of the discriminant validity, concurrent validity and predictive validity. To examine the convergent validity, exploratory factor analysis involving the use of oblique rotation, was used in the principal component analysis. Factor loadings indicated how strongly each item was related to a particular factor, eigenvalues showed the relative importance of each factor, and the cumulative variance was used to check whether a sufficient number of factors have been retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1365480212473680">Field, 2009</xref>). The Cronbach alpha coefficient was calculated for each factor to provide an indication of the internal consistency reliability. The factor loadings and internal consistency reliability measure ensured the convergent validity of the questionnaires.</p>
<p>Discriminant validity was also established using factor analysis. Brown (2004) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1365480212473680">Field (2009)</xref> explained that oblique rotation in exploratory factor analysis provides realistic representation of how factors are interrelated. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1365480212473680">Field (2009)</xref>, based on theoretical grounds there should be a moderately strong relationship between factors. However, factor correlations above 0.80 imply overlap of concepts and point towards poor discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1365480212473680">Brown, 2006</xref>). The component correlation matrix obtained from oblique rotation was used to determine whether the correlation values met the requirements of discriminant validity.</p>
<p>Concurrent validity was assessed to make sure that each construct was able to distinguish between those groups which it was expected to distinguish. If, as past research suggests, the climate of a school differs to that of other schools, then, concurrent validity can be established by examining the ability of each scale to differentiate between different schools. This was investigated using ANOVA. The eta<sup>2</sup> statistic, based on the ratio of the between-group effect to the total amount of variance in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1365480212473680">Field, 2009</xref>), was calculated to provide information about the amount of variance attributed to class membership.</p>
<p>Predictive validity was assessed to ensure that the score on the construct predicts scores on other dimensions based on theoretical grounds. Theoretical and research underpinnings discussed in the literature review suggested that students’ perceptions of bullying is associated to the school climate. Students’ perceptions of the extent to which they are bullied by others, as assessed by a newly-developed scale, was used. Because the hypothesis was that there is a negative correlation between each WHITS scale and bullying, the correlations were tested using a one-tailed Pearson coefficient.</p>

<title>Development of the WHITS</title>
<p>Content validity was established by basing the constructs in the survey on sound theoretical grounds, including school culture and school climate models, as well as school effectiveness and school improvement theories. An extensive review of literature authenticated that the items used to conceptualize the constructs were an accurate representation.</p>
<p>Given the importance of the school climate and the fact that students, as major stakeholders in the education process, it was considered necessary that students be given the opportunity to express their views. The importance of listening to students’ voices is not new and has been found, in past research, to be potentially transformative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1365480212473680">Aldridge &amp; Bell, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1365480212473680">Rudduck, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1365480212473680">Rudduck &amp; Demetriou, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A multitude of factors shape the quality and character of the school, however, for our questionnaire, in deciding which constructs to include, we considered the theory and research findings described above to ensure that we included school climate elements that were likely to support diversity. To this end, we developed six scales that can be used as indicators. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1365480212473680">Table 1</xref> provides a scale description and sample item for each of the newly developed scales. The first two scales, Teacher Support and Peer Connectedness were developed to assess students’ perceptions of the important teacher–student and student–student relationships in the school. The School Connectedness scale was developed to assess students’ perceptions of the extent to which they felt welcome at a part of the school. The Rule Clarity and Reporting and Seeking Help scales were developed to assess students’ perceptions of the extent to which the rules of the schools were clear and the degree to which they were aware of procedures and confident to report or seek help when there were breaches of the school rules. A copy of the WHITS questionnaire can be found in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1365480212473680">Appendix</xref>.</p>

<title>Development of the bullying scale</title>
<p>Bullying can be defined as a proactive behaviour (that is usually repetitive) and is characterized by an imbalance of power between the perpetrator and the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1365480212473680">Guerra, Williams, &amp; Sadek, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1365480212473680">Rigby, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1365480212473680">Solberg &amp; Olweus, 2003</xref>). Past research has reported that repetitive exposure to bullying can have a traumatic impact on victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212473680">Baldry, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1365480212473680">Carney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1365480212473680">Rigby, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Because past studies have identified that the climate created at a school is a predictor of bullying, this scale was selected for inclusion of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212473680">Dessel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1365480212473680">Gendron, Williams, &amp; Guerra, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1365480212473680">Pernice-Duca, Taiariol, &amp; Yoon, 2010</xref>). Further, research evidence has indicated that changes in the school climate can help to reduce a culture of bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1365480212473680">Bradshaw &amp; Waasdorp, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1365480212473680">Bandyopadhayay et al. (2009</xref>, p. 339) maintain that the school climate is particularly relevant for the prevention of bullying, because schools in which there is a culture of bullying ‘empowers bullies to act aggressively without fear of sanction, encourages passivity in bystanders and creates an environment in which bystanders of bullying see no reason to report their victimization or expect assistance’.</p>
<p>Our bullying scale was developed to examine the frequency with which students experienced bullying (whether physical, emotional or social). The scale involves a retrospective self report of bullying episodes that they have experienced over the previous four weeks. The scale takes into account that bullying can present itself in different forms (such as physical, verbal or written). The internal consistency reliability of this scale was 0.94.</p>
<sec id="section14-1365480212473680">
<title>Face validity</title>
<p>To ensure that the researchers and participants attributed similar meanings and interpretations to the constructs, seven Year 8 students were interviewed. These students indicated that the items were clear, concise and easily understood, thus supporting the face validity of the instrument.</p>
<p>Once we had established the criteria for translation validity, the next step was to establish whether the criterion validity (in terms of convergent, discriminant, concurrent and predictive validity) had been met. Analysis involving the data collected from 4067 students in eight government high schools in Western Australia was used. Prior to the analyses of the data, the multivariate normality and sampling adequacy of the data were tested. Bartlett’s test of sphericity indicated that this value was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The Kaiser-Maiyer-Olkin measure of adequacy was high (0.965), confirming the appropriateness of the data for further analysis. The results for the analyses conducted to support the criterion validity are discussed below.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Factor loadings indicate how strongly each item is related to a particular factor, eigenvalues show the relative importance of each factor, and the cumulative variance can be used to check whether a sufficient number of factors have been retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1365480212473680">Field, 2009</xref>). The results indicate that the eigenvalue for each factor was greater than 1 (considered acceptable using Kaiser’s criterion), whilst the cumulative variance for all six factors was acceptable at 64.05 percent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1365480212473680">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, all items loaded above 0.30 on their own scale and no other scales, therefore all of the items were retained.</p>
<p>The Cronbach alpha coefficient was calculated for each factor to provide an indication of the internal consistency reliability. It is contended that, in exploratory research, a lenient cut-off of 0.60 is common; to be considered a satisfactory scale, the alpha should be 0.70 or higher and for a ‘good’ scale a cut-off of 0.80 is required (Cohen et al., 2000). The internal consistency reliability value for each WHITS scale, reported at the bottom of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1365480212473680">Table 2</xref>, was above 0.89, with highest value of 0.91 for Reporting and Seeking Help. The factor loadings and internal consistency both strongly support convergent validity of the questionnaire.</p>

<title>Discriminant validity</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1365480212473680">Trochim and Donnelly (2006)</xref> suggested that discriminant validity is achieved when the correlations between a particular item and other items in the same construct are higher than its correlations with items from different constructs. Although oblique rotation in exploratory factor analysis provides a pragmatic representation of how factors are interrelated (Brown, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1365480212473680">Field, 2009</xref>), there should also be a moderately strong relationship between factors that is based on theoretical grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1365480212473680">Field, 2009</xref>). Factor correlations above 0.80, however, imply an overlap between concepts that may indicate poor discriminant validity (Brown, 2004). The component correlation matrix, generated from the oblique rotation and provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1365480212473680">Table 3</xref>, indicates that the highest correlation was 0.54. Thus, the requirement of discriminant validity for the WHITS scales was met.</p>

<title>Predictive validity</title>
<p>Predictive validity was used to estimate whether the scales of the WHITS could predict scores on a dimension that, based on theoretical grounds, it should predict. Theoretical and research underpinnings, discussed above, suggest that students’ views of the school climate should be strongly and negatively associated with students’ self reports of bullying (as assessed by the scale developed for the purpose of this study). Because our hypothesis was that there would be a negative correlation between each WHITS scale and students’ perceived bullying, correlations were tested using a one-tailed Pearson coefficient. The results reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1365480212473680">Table 4</xref> indicate that all of the WHITS scales had a statistically significant and negative correlation with student self-reports of the frequency of bullying, thereby supporting the predictive validity of the WHITS scales.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>Because research evidence has shown that the school climate is integrally related to student academic, emotional and behavioural success at school, as well as a strong influence the success of school reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1365480212473680">Daly, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1365480212473680">Deal &amp; Peterson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212473680">Dessell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1365480212473680">Sailes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1365480212473680">Schoen &amp; Teddlie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1365480212473680">Van Houtte, 2005</xref>), the focus of our research was to identify factors that contribute towards a positive school climate and to develop a questionnaire that could be used to assess these salient factors. In practical terms, this instrument will provide school administrators and those involved in reform efforts with a reliable, valid and convenient tool that can be used to provide information about students’ perceptions of the school climate that can be used to promote reflexivity in practices (as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1365480212473680">Durrant, 2012</xref>) and to guide changes. It was anticipated that a tool that allows students’ voices to be heard might promote transformative changes similar to those found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1365480212473680">McIntyre, Pedder, and Rudduck (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1365480212473680">Rudduck (2002)</xref>. The tool also could be used to provide information to monitor reform efforts aimed at increasing the safety and inclusivity at the school.</p>
<p>The new questionnaire satisfied all aspects of construct validity, as outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1365480212473680">Trochim and Donnelly’s (2006)</xref> framework. Translation validity was satisfied through a thorough review of literature, used to ensure that the scales and items were based on sound theoretical and research findings (content validity) and a pilot test that involved interviews with individual students (face validity). Criterion validity was established through the statistical analysis of data collected from 4067 students in eight schools. A factor analysis using oblique rotation established that each item loaded above 0.30 on its a priori factor and no other, thereby supporting the discriminant validity. The relatively high internal consistency reliability of no less than 0.89 for each of the six scales supported the convergent validity. A one-way ANOVA was used to determine whether each of the scales could distinguish between the perceptions of students in different schools. All of the scales were able to statistically significantly differentiate between schools, thus supporting the concurrent validity. Finally, the predictive validity was examined using the newly developed bullying scale to determine whether each of the six scales were able to predict the degree to which students perceived bullying to take place. The statistically significant and negative association between each of the six school climate scales and bullying scale supported the predictive ability of the new questionnaire.</p>
<p>For researchers, the use of this survey, in conjunction with other techniques such as interviews and observations, could lead towards a more comprehensive understanding of the school climate. Furthermore, longitudinal studies could be conducted to examine changes in students’ perceptions of the school climate and its influence on different criterion variables such as ethnic identity, moral development and student well-being.</p>
