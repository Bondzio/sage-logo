<abstract>
<p>The notion that affective/impulsive violence and predatory/instrumental violence constitute distinct behavioral phenotypes has been supported in the forensic literature. Prior research suggests that offenders committing affective/impulsive homicide exhibit differing patterns of anomalous regional brain activation and decreased executive functions relative to predatory/instrumental homicide offenders. However, no prior research has examined the extent to which murderers who kill impulsively versus those who kill as the result of the execution of a premeditated strategic plan differ with regard to other neuropsychological functions and intelligence. Based on established criteria, we classified 77 murderers into affective/impulsive and predatory/instrumental groups, and compared their performance on standardized measures of intelligence and neuropsychological functioning. Results revealed significant differences between the affective/impulsive group (mean Full Scale IQ = 79) and the predatory/instrumental group (mean Full Scale IQ = 93) on indices of intelligence, memory, attention, and executive functioning. Most differences remained significant after controlling for relevant background factors.</p>

<body>
<p>According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a total of 12,331 nonjustifiable homicides were reported to law enforcement authorities in the United States in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093854813479779">U.S. Department of Justice, 2011</xref>). It has been estimated that each murder is associated with more than $17.25 million in public costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854813479779">DeLisi et al., 2010</xref>), in addition to the immeasurable emotional cost to families and friends of homicide victims. Given the high societal and personal cost of homicide, it is not surprising that an impressive body of literature has amassed during the recent decades with regard to social, criminological, psychological, and biomedical characteristics of homicide offenders. This research has had direct implications for policy (e.g., development of preventative strategies), law enforcement (e.g., criminal investigation), the legal system (e.g., evaluating the risk of reoffending) and corrections (e.g., developing rehabilitative programs).</p>
<p>The notion that proactive and reactive types of violence represent distinct social, psychological, and neurological phenotypes has been supported in the literature. Although this classification has been applied to homicide offenders in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093854813479779">Amen, Hanks, Prunella, &amp; Green, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093854813479779">Declercq &amp; Audenaert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854813479779">Heilbrun, Heilbrun, &amp; Heilbrun, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813479779">Raine et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854813479779">Salfati &amp; Canter, 1999</xref>), no prior study has examined whether offenders who commit proactive versus reactive types of murder are characterized by distinct neurocognitive profiles. To this end, we classified a sample of incarcerated homicide offenders into affective/impulsive (reactive) and predatory/instrumental (proactive) homicide groups according to a set of defined and replicated criteria. We then compared these two groups on standard measures of neuropsychological functioning, including general intelligence, memory, attention and executive functions. In the following paragraphs, we outline the definitions of predatory/instrumental and affective/impulsive violence and review published literature that highlights the distinction between these two groups.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that not all violent behavior is the same, and criteria have been put forth over the years to classify violent behavior with respect to the reactive–proactive axis. Arguably of most direct relevance to forensic science is the affective/impulsive versus predatory/instrumental classification of violence, based on the autonomic, affective, psychological, and behavioral state of the individual at the time of the commission of the violent act (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0093854813479779">appendix</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854813479779">Meloy, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854813479779">1997</xref>). According to these criteria, affective/impulsive violence, as a defensive reaction to perceived threat, is preceded by high levels of autonomic arousal and accompanied by emotions of anger and fear. Conversely, predatory/instrumental violence is purposeful and proactive behavior, the goals of which vary in accordance with the perpetrator’s motivation; it is not typically preceded by high autonomic arousal or accompanied by strong emotions. The affective/impulsive–predatory/instrumental classification has been validated in the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093854813479779">Siegel &amp; Brutus, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854813479779">Siegel &amp; Victoroff, 2009</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093854813479779">Tweed &amp; Dutton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854813479779">Vitacco, Neumann, &amp; Caldwell, 2010</xref>) research literature, including homicide offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093854813479779">Declercq &amp; Audenaert, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There is evidence from prior research linking affective/impulsive violence with neurocognitive and psychological dysfunction. Affective/impulsive homicide offenders were reported to have greater difficulty inhibiting prepotent responses under time pressure conditions than nonhomicide offenders, presumably implicating prefrontal cortex dysfunction in that population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093854813479779">Chen, Muggleton, Juan, Tzeng, &amp; Hung, 2008</xref>). In fact, available findings from research examining regional brain activation in relation to affective/impulsive violence suggest hypoactivation in brain areas thought to underlie impulse control and other executive functions. Affective/impulsive homicide offenders have been shown to have decreased regional cerebral blood flow in the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093854813479779">Amen et al., 2007</xref>) and reduced amplitudes of evoked electroencephalographic response (N2) over the frontocentral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093854813479779">Chen, Tien, Juan, Tzeng, &amp; Hung, 2005</xref>) during go/no-go tasks. Similarly, homicide offenders pleading not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI), regardless of the affective/impulsive–predatory/instrumental classification, have been found to have reduced glucose metabolism in the prefrontal cortex, superior parietal gyrus, left angular gyrus, and the corpus callosum, as well as abnormal asymmetry of activation (left hemisphere lower than right hemisphere) in the amygdala, thalamus, and medial temporal lobe compared to nonmurderer controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093854813479779">Raine, Buchsbaum, &amp; LaCasse, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Psychologically, offenders who commit affective/impulsive crimes have been shown to have a wider range of serious psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854813479779">Stanford, Houston, &amp; Baldridge, 2008</xref>), as well as passive-aggressive, borderline, and avoidant personality characteristics, higher chronic anger, and fearful attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093854813479779">Tweed &amp; Dutton, 1998</xref>). With regard to crime characteristics, affective/impulsive offenders are more likely to have a close relationship with their victim, to have felt provoked by the victim, and to have acted in a state of anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854813479779">Cornell et al., 1996</xref>). There is also indication that affective/impulsive homicide offenders are more likely than predatory/instrumental homicide offenders to violate conditions of parole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854813479779">Heilbrun et al., 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, behavioral research has suggested that predatory/instrumental homicide offenders demonstrate an intact capacity to regulate executive control processes, except when motivational factors are present, unlike affective/impulsive murderers who appear more dysfunctional in impulse-control tasks regardless of the presence or absence of motivational factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854813479779">Levi, Nussbaum, &amp; Rich, 2010</xref>). In addition, offenders committing predatory/instrumental violence relative to those committing affective/impulsive violence tend to display higher psychopathic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854813479779">Stanford et al., 2008</xref>), to commit more severe physical violence and manifest more antisocial-narcissistic-aggressive personality characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093854813479779">Tweed &amp; Dutton, 1998</xref>), and to have an identifiable goal in committing violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854813479779">Cornell et al., 1996</xref>). Predatory/instrumental homicide offenders tend to use instrumental violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093854813479779">Woodworth &amp; Porter, 2002</xref>); often have previous offenses of theft, burglary, and vehicle theft; tend to be unemployed; and have a record in the armed services, previous prison sentences, familiarity with the area of the crime, and a social connection to the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854813479779">Salfati &amp; Canter, 1999</xref>). Additionally, parolees who violated parole by committing a violent offense were more likely to have committed a predatory/instrumental murder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854813479779">Heilbrun et al., 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>Very little is known about performance differences between the affective/impulsive and predatory/instrumental homicide offender groups on standard neuropsychological measures. There is some indication from recent research that homicide offenders with below-average scores on tests of executive functions (i.e., problem solving, cognitive flexibility, response inhibition) tend to follow offending pathways characterized by poor self-control and negative emotional responses to their crimes, whereas cognitively intact homicide offenders are characterized by premeditation and positive affect in response to their crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854813479779">Gilligan &amp; Lennings, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093854813479779">2012</xref>). However, this research was based on a relatively small (<italic>N</italic> = 26) sample of male offenders who had been found NGRI by the court, which limits the generalizability of these findings to the larger homicide offender population. Furthermore, these studies did not examine performance in other cognitive domains such as intellectual or memory functioning, or include symptoms validity tests (SVTs) as part of the neuropsychological assessment.</p>
<p>Only one study, to our knowledge, examined brain functioning in affective/impulsive versus predatory/instrumental homicide offenders classified using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854813479779">Meloy (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854813479779">1997</xref>) criteria outlined above. Predatory/instrumental homicide offenders did not significantly differ from normal control subjects in prefrontal glucose metabolism as measured by positron emission tomography during a continuous performance task; but they revealed significantly increased activity in right subcortical regions, including the amygdala, midbrain, hippocampus, and thalamus. In contrast, although affective/impulsive homicide offenders also revealed higher right subcortical activity, relative to normal controls, lateral and medial prefrontal activity was significantly decreased relative to normal controls and to predatory/instrumental murderers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813479779">Raine et al., 1998</xref>). The authors’ interpretation of this finding was that control of violent behavior results from a dynamic balance between activation of subcortical and prefrontal regions, such that normal prefrontal but overactive subcortical activation in predatory/instrumental homicide offenders results in aggressive yet goal-oriented behavior, whereas decreased prefrontal functioning combined with increased subcortical activation results in affective/impulsive homicidal aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813479779">Raine et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, evidence from past research suggests that offenders who commit affective/impulsive violence are characterized by significant neuropsychological dysfunction including behavioral disinhibition and below-average performance on some tests of executive functioning, varied but significant psychopathology, as well as abnormal activation of the prefrontal cortex and other brain areas involved in behavioral control and emotional regulation. In contrast, there is no consistent evidence linking predatory/instrumental violence to deficient impulse control, deficient neuropsychological test performance, or prefrontal abnormalities on neuroimaging. In addition, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813479779">Raine and colleagues (1998)</xref> reported differences in regional brain activation between affective/impulsive and predatory/instrumental homicide offenders classified using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854813479779">Meloy (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854813479779">1997</xref>) criteria, no prior study to our knowledge has systematically examined the performance of these two offender groups on standardized neuropsychological measures of memory, executive functioning, and intellectual status. The present study was designed to address this gap. Based on prior findings, we hypothesized that affective/impulsive homicide offenders are characterized by significant neurocognitive dysfunction and manifest lower overall intellectual functioning, relative to predatory/instrumental homicide offenders. Conversely, we hypothesized that predatory/instrumental homicide offenders are not characterized by significant neurocognitive dysfunction and perform within normal limits on most standardized neuropsychological measures.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample was comprised of 77 men and women charged with or convicted of first-degree murder in Illinois and Missouri. Collectively, these 77 individuals were charged with or convicted of the murders of 137 people. Regarding location, 70% of these individuals were evaluated while in custody at the Cook County Jail in Chicago, IL, and 30% were evaluated in other correctional facilities in Illinois and Missouri. All subjects were referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by attorneys or the court in relation to one of the following concerns: fitness to stand trial or criminal responsibility such as sanity during the guilt–innocence phase; mental retardation or neuropsychological abnormalities that represent potentially mitigating factors during the sentencing phase; or neuropsychological abnormalities that represent potentially mitigating factors during postconviction appeals. All participants voluntarily consented to undergo a neuropsychological evaluation and were examined by the first author. All evaluations were conducted between 2000 and 2007. A detailed description of the sample has been published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854813479779">Hanlon, Rubin, Jensen, &amp; Daoust, 2010</xref>). Briefly, participants were predominately African American (68%) and male (90%). Age ranged from 16 to 67 (<italic>M</italic> = 31.92), and participants had an average of 10.52 years of education (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.22). The majority of the sample (48 cases, 62%) was charged with or convicted of the murder of one individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854813479779">Hanlon et al., 2010</xref>). Of the other 29 participants, 27 were charged with or convicted of killing multiple individuals as part of a single act (i.e., double murders, triple murders, or mass murders). The remaining two participants were convicted of serial murders; for those participants, only the most recent homicide was coded.</p>

<title>Affective/Impulsive–Predatory/Instrumental Classification</title>
<p>Meloy’s forensic criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854813479779">Meloy, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854813479779">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854813479779">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854813479779">2006</xref>, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0093854813479779">appendix</xref>) were used to classify participants into the affective/impulsive and predatory/instrumental murder groups. Ratings were made on the basis of detailed crime scene descriptions in police reports, known relationships between the victim and the offender, reports of psychological and psychiatric evaluations by forensic examiners, court transcripts, statements made by offenders to police investigators, and statements of confession made to examiners. Two independent raters who were blind to each other’s ratings completed the classification. Interrater reliability was good (average intraclass <italic>r</italic> = .89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Inconsistencies between raters were resolved through consensus. The classification resulted in 44 individuals who committed murders as a result of affective/impulsive homicidal aggression and 33 individuals who committed murders that were carried out based on a predatory/instrumental strategic plan.</p>

<title>Neuropsychological Test Battery</title>
<p>Information regarding education, medical history, psychiatric history, and criminal history were obtained from available educational, medical, psychiatric, and law enforcement/correctional records. All defendants underwent a clinical interview and were administered a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests. Intellectual functioning was assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Third Edition (WAIS-III; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093854813479779">Psychological Corporation, 1998</xref>). Memory measures included the Logical Memory and Faces subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale–Third Edition (WMS-III; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093854813479779">Psychological Corporation, 1997</xref>) and the California Verbal Learning Test–Second Edition (CVLT-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854813479779">Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, &amp; Ober, 2000</xref>). Measures of executive functioning included the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093854813479779">Heaton, Chelune, Talley, Kay, &amp; Curtiss, 1993</xref>), the Conners’ Continuous Performance Task II (CPT-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093854813479779">Conners, 2000</xref>), the Trail Making Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854813479779">Reitan, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854813479779">Strauss, Sherman, &amp; Spreen, 2006</xref>), the Stroop Color and Word Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854813479779">Golden &amp; Freshwater, 2002</xref>), and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854813479779">Strauss et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Because neuropsychological assessment in criminal samples is often complicated by symptom exaggeration and/or malingering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093854813479779">Ardolf, Denney, &amp; Houston, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854813479779">Denney, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093854813479779">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093854813479779">Rogers, 2008</xref>), the analyses included only data from participants who passed at least three of the following symptom validity tests: Word Memory Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854813479779">Green, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854813479779">Green, Iverson, &amp; Allen, 1999</xref>), Test of Memory Malingering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093854813479779">Tombaugh, 1996</xref>), Rey15-Item Memory Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093854813479779">Rey, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093854813479779">Reznek, 2005</xref>), or the Victoria Symptom Validity Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854813479779">Slick, Hopp, Strauss, &amp; Thompson, 2005</xref>).

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between offenders who committed affective/impulsive homicide and those who committed predatory/instrumental homicide were examined using independent <italic>t</italic> tests for continuous variables and chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>) tests for categorical variables. To investigate group differences in neuropsychological functioning, we first conducted a series of independent <italic>t</italic> tests. Subsequently, hierarchical multivariate regressions were used to test the associations between group and neuropsychological functioning after adjusting for relevant variables showing group differences. In step 1, we entered demographic and behavioral variables (covariates) differing between the two groups. These included age, education, race, history of developmental disorders, history of an Axis I psychiatric diagnosis (e.g., mood, anxiety, psychotic disorder), and history of an Axis II personality disorder. In step 2, group status was entered. All <italic>p</italic> values are two-sided, and the statistical significance level was set at <italic>p</italic> = .05.

<p>Group comparisons and regression results for intellectual functions are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093854813479779">Table 2</xref>. Offenders who committed affective/impulsive murders were less intelligent than predatory/instrumental murderers as demonstrated by significantly lower Full Scale IQ (FSIQ), <italic>t</italic>(75) = −4.84; <italic>d</italic> = 1.13. Using the accepted IQ score qualitative descriptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093854813479779">Psychological Corporation, 1998</xref>), the mean FSIQ of the predatory/instrumental group (93) was in the average range, whereas the affective/impulsive group had a mean FSIQ in the borderline range (79). Similarly large effect sizes were observed for Verbal (VIQ), <italic>t</italic>(75) = −4.40; <italic>d</italic> = −1.03, and Performance (PIQ), <italic>t</italic>(75) = −4.26; <italic>d</italic> = −.98, intelligence composite scores, as well as the Verbal Comprehension (VCI), <italic>t</italic>(75) = −4.26; <italic>d</italic> = −.95, Working Memory (WMI), <italic>t</italic>(75) = −3.31; <italic>d</italic> = −.73, Perceptual Organization (POI), <italic>t</italic>(75) = −4.30; <italic>d</italic> = −.97, and Processing Speed (PSI), <italic>t</italic>(75) = −3.64; <italic>d</italic> = −.81, index scores. In fact, affective/impulsive murderers scored significantly lower across WAIS-III subtests (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093854813479779">Table 2</xref>). Following regression analyses, group differences on FSIQ, VIQ, PIQ, VCI, POI, and PSI remained significant after accounting for demographic and other background variables, although the difference on WMI became nonsignificant.</p>

<p>Group comparisons and regression results for memory scores are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0093854813479779">Table 3</xref>. Offenders who committed affective/impulsive murder had significantly poorer recall of contextually unrelated verbal information (i.e., word list) across various indices. Specifically, affective/impulsive murderers learned fewer words during repeated administrations of the list (CVLT-II total learning score), <italic>t</italic>(50) = −3.73; <italic>d</italic> = −1.05, and recalled fewer words after both short (1-2 min), <italic>t</italic>(48) = −3.28; <italic>d</italic> = −.95), and long (20 min), <italic>t</italic>(50) = −3.24; <italic>d</italic> = −.93, delay intervals. Likewise, affective/impulsive murderers had poorer recall for narrative verbal information (i.e., short stories), both when assessed immediately after presentation (WMS-III Logical Memory Immediate), <italic>t</italic>(66) = −3.75; <italic>d</italic> = −.94, and following a 30-min delay (WMS-III Logical Memory Delayed), <italic>t</italic>(66) = −4.16; <italic>d</italic> = −1.03. Group differences on measures of visual–nonverbal recognition memory for faces were significant but more modest than in the verbal domain, with affective/impulsive murderers exhibiting poorer recognition performance when asked to recognize pictures of faces immediately after presentation (WMS-III Face Recognition), <italic>t</italic>(66) = −3.16; <italic>d</italic> = −.78. These group differences remained significant after accounting for demographic and other background variables. The group difference for delayed face recognition performance did not approach significance despite its moderate effect size (<italic>d</italic> = −.41).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study is, to our knowledge, the first to compare intellectual status and neuropsychological functions among individuals committing affective/impulsive and predatory/instrumental homicide, in a single offender sample. As predicted, affective/impulsive murderers demonstrated significantly poorer performance than predatory/instrumental murderers across neurocognitive domains, with the largest effect sizes observed on measures of intelligence, memory, attention, and executive functions, in that order (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0093854813479779">Figure 1</xref>). Most of these differences remained significant after controlling for the influence of demographic and other background variables. Although there were no statistically significant group differences on measures of response inhibition, affective/impulsive murderers demonstrated clinically significant deficits on these measures. In contrast, predatory/instrumental murderers showed largely intact functioning across neurocognitive domains.</p>

<p>The current findings provide preliminary evidence for the neurobehavioral subtyping of murderers. Utilizing the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854813479779">Meloy (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854813479779">1997</xref>) criteria regarding affective/impulsive and predatory/instrumental violence to classify subtypes of murderers, we determined preliminary neuropsychological profiles of affective/impulsive murderers and predatory/instrumental murderers. Specifically, offenders who committed murder as a result of an affective/impulsive act were undereducated, relative to the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854813479779">U.S. Census Bureau, 2009</xref>), with a history of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., learning disorder, mental retardation, borderline intellectual functioning) and chronic substance abuse (i.e., alcohol abuse/dependence and/or drug abuse/dependence), combined with relatively low intelligence (mean Full Scale IQ = 79) and multiple neurocognitive deficits, including attentional dysfunction, an abnormally slow rate of information processing, deficient verbal memory functions, and executive dysfunction.</p>
<p>In contrast, offenders who committed murder as a result of the execution of a predatory/instrumental strategic plan were of average intelligence (mean Full Scale IQ = 93), without significant neurocognitive dysfunction, but with higher rates of both Axis I psychiatric disorders and personality disorders, relative to affective/impulsive murderers. Although both subtypes were characterized by high rates of substance abuse, the affective/impulsive murders were characterized by a significantly higher rate of substance abuse (93%), relative to the predatory/instrumental murderers (76%) in the current study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093854813479779">Table 1</xref>). Perhaps more importantly, the statistical differences between the two groups regarding intelligence and neurocognitive functions remained after controlling for the effect of substance abuse.</p>
<p>From a neuropsychological perspective, the current findings are consistent with and extend prior findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854813479779">Gilligan &amp; Lennings, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093854813479779">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813479779">Raine et al., 1998</xref>) regarding the neurocognitive differences between affective/impulsive and predatory/instrumental murderers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813479779">Raine and colleagues (1998)</xref> demonstrated normal regional brain activation in predatory/instrumental murderers during engagement in a CPT task, in contrast to affective/impulsive murderers who demonstrated significantly decreased bilateral prefrontal activation relative to normal controls and predatory/instrumental murderers. The neurocognitive characteristics of the affective/impulsive murderers in the current study—involving attentional dysfunction, defective rate of information processing, deficient memory encoding of verbal information, and selective executive dysfunction—support the neurophysiological model of deficient prefrontal activation among affective/impulsive murderers. Similarly, the relatively normal neurocognitive status of the predatory/instrumental murders in the current study is consistent with relatively normal prefrontal activation, despite the increased activation of right hemisphere subcortical structures demonstrated in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813479779">Raine and colleagues (1998)</xref> study. The current results also replicate the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854813479779">Gilligan and Lennings (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093854813479779">2012</xref>) findings of deficient performance on tests of executive functions in affective/impulsive (but not predatory/instrumental) offenders, and extend their findings by providing additional evidence of cognitive impairment in the affective/impulsive group on tests of intellectual functioning, memory, and sustained attention/vigilance. Furthermore, the inclusion of SVTs in the current study allows for firmer conclusions regarding the observed performance deficits being associated with neurocognitive dysfunction in the affective/impulsive group, rather than poor effort or symptom exaggeration.</p>
<p>Despite the consistency between the prior findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813479779">Raine and others (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854813479779">Gilligan and Lennings (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093854813479779">2012</xref>) and the neuropsychological findings of the current study, there were notable differences between the samples of murderers assessed. In both the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813479779">Raine and colleagues (1998)</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854813479779">Gilligan and Lennings (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093854813479779">2012</xref>) studies, all of the subjects pleaded and/or were found NGRI or incompetent to stand trial; as a result, they were confined to forensic hospitals. Conversely, only one subject in the current sample was ultimately found to be NGRI by the court. Similarly, although a few subjects in the current sample were considered unfit to stand trial following evaluations by forensic examiners and subsequently underwent therapeutic programming aimed at restoration of fitness, all of the subjects in the current sample were ultimately considered fit to stand trial by the court. As such, whereas all of the subjects used in prior research were forensic hospital detainees, all of the subjects in the current study were incarcerated in county jails or state prisons. In summary, although the subjects in the prior and current studies were very similar with respect to their violent criminal offenses (i.e., murder), the subjects in the current study constitute a more representative sample of murderers, in general, than those used in previous research.</p>
<p>Premeditation, by definition, is a cognitive concept that denotes “conscious consideration and planning that precedes some act,” whereas an impulse, by definition, is a behavioral concept that denotes “a sudden urge or inclination that prompts an unplanned action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093854813479779">Garner, 2001</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854813479779">Meloy (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854813479779">1997</xref>) defines predatory/instrumental violence as a planned, purposeful, and primarily cognitively derived act, whereas affective/impulsive violence refers to reactive, immediate, and primarily emotionally derived acts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0093854813479779">appendix</xref>). The current findings provide further validation of the Meloy criteria in an independent forensic sample.</p>
<p>Many jurisdictions within the United States (e.g., Florida), including the federal government, define first degree murder by statute as murder that is willful and premeditated. Some jurisdictions define first degree murder as intentionally killing and knowing that one’s actions will cause death, whereas premeditation is considered an aggravating factor (e.g., Illinois). Other jurisdictions define murder, in general, as intentionally and knowingly causing the death of another and have eliminated the term premeditation from the statute (e.g., Texas). Still other jurisdictions define murder as the intentional killing of another individual with malice aforethought (e.g., California). Regardless of the jurisdiction, the terms used to define murder invariably include cognitive concepts, such as intent, knowing, premeditation, and the archaic aforethought.</p>
<p>Legally, the cognitive concepts of intent, knowing, premeditation, and aforethought constitute the mental state at the time of the crime and underlie the legal concept for mens rea, which infers the degree of culpability in legal proceedings. Clearly, the predatory/instrumental murderers in the current study were considered to have committed their crimes with specific intent, involving the execution of a premeditated strategic plan directed toward a specific victim or victims. Conversely, it may be argued that given the neurocognitive limitations that characterized the affective/impulsive murderers, they may have possessed a limited mental capacity for formulating specific intent, despite their apparent general intent.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this study. The current study sample consisted of murderers incarcerated in Illinois and Missouri, and as such may not be representative of the greater homicide offender population; future research is needed to replicate the current findings in other locales and jurisdictions. Similarly, the exclusion of participants who failed symptom validity testing from the current analyses may have further resulted in a study sample that is underrepresentative of the target population; however, this exclusion criterion was necessary to ensure that any observed group differences were valid and not artificially inflated by suboptimal effort or malingering. Also, we chose the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854813479779">Meloy (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854813479779">1997</xref>) criteria to classify study participants into the affective/impulsive and predatory/instrumental groups as the most theoretically rigorous and empirically validated classification system; however, a substantial portion of extant research is based on other similar but distinct classifications of affective/impulsive and predatory/instrumental violence, which may partially limit direct comparison between those studies and the current findings. Relatedly, there is indication from prior research that some offenders tend to commit acts of both affective/impulsive and predatory/instrumental violence in the course of their criminal careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854813479779">Cornell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093854813479779">Flight &amp; Forth, 2007</xref>). Because this issue has not been addressed with regard to homicide specifically, further research is needed to examine whether homicide offenders who commit both types of murder differ from the affective/impulsive and predatory/instrumental groups in terms of neuropsychological outcomes. In any case, because only two cases in our sample were serial murderers, this limitation is not likely to have significantly affected our results. Lastly, future research should examine differences between affective/impulsive and predatory/instrumental homicide offenders on important legal outcome variables, such as conviction and sentencing outcomes, recidivism, and criminal versatility.</p>
