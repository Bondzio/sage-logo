<p>The introduction of the Median Group ideas in the 1980s by Patrick de Maré seems to me to have been met with concern, doubt or expectation from those most interested in large groups or, on the other hand, with no interest at all from small group conductors, and some lost their initial enthusiasm by not experiencing the new setting as being much different from the large group.</p>
<p>Since then the Median Group practice spread quickly in many European countries, the USA, Latin America, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>As it is, every convenor works differently with his own understanding and personality and ‘there are all sorts of median groups running’ as Pat used to say, which is why he registered the name Median Group® to prevent misuse. In the meantime and since his departure in 2008 de Maré developed and specified his theory of mind which further explains the concepts introduced in the Median Group theory: the principle of meaning added to the pleasure/reality principle, the conductor becoming more and more the convenor, free floating association versus free floating discussion or dialogue, transposition rather than transference, working on the collective conscious being the culture alongside the unconscious, and his final creative research on the concept of the mind itself, which gives the overall framework of his thinking.</p>
<p>The time arrived to have a first dialogue between Median Group convenors–and the occasion was the 2010 Congress in Bolzano/Bozen, Italy in the hope that others would join the 2nd Congress where some concepts of de Maré’s theory of mind could be introduced to better clarify his thinking.</p>
<p>The introduction by Malcolm Pines and the articles of Eduard Klain, Rocco Pisani and Dieter Nitzgen stress the substantial development of Foulkes’ ideas, the latter recognizing the introduction by de Maré of the concept of meaning in group analysis.</p>
<p>In her article, Helen Schick illustrates many Median Group work concepts including transposition whereas David Parsons in his original way brings Pat’s very original and provocative verve of being mindfully together. [Cynthia Rogers shows her creative and desirable way of motivating members to join in a Median Group setting, in keeping with de Maré’s attitude of viewing group members basically as friends. <bold>[This paper tbc]</bold>] Looking to the wide range of patients in the praxis Robi Friedman gives a helpful and convincing contribution to help to sort out an optimal indication for group therapy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the contribution of Nick Coutts is not available: his article presents the reasons as to why an approach to assessing the dialogue of the Median Groups run in prisons is attempted—exploring the methodology developed by the Institute of Criminology of the University of Cambridge based on the dialogue group that was held in HMP Norwich, as well as the research method and the positive results of the evaluation of that group.</p>
<p>The results include evaluation of the level of co-operation among participants; the freedom to express what the individual member wanted to say; the respect shown to volunteers and facilitators in the group; the respect shown by prisoners and the content of the dialogue. The contents of the full report, <italic>HMP Norwich Dialogue Group Evaluation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316413483073">2004</xref>) have been made available.</p>
<p>L. Pozzi and R. Schoellberger have displayed a brief description of two studies (and research) into the Median Group experiences in a closed ward and in an open psychiatric outpatients service. The first being about the self definition and well-being of 30 patients in three Median Groups, mostly under drug prescription, and 31 patients only under drug prescription. Dr. Laura Pozzi who introduced the Median Group to the closed psychiatric ward of a general hospital undertook the other study. It shows the high acceptance of the group—and on the group ward level—a sudden decrease of aggressive episodes.</p>
<p>On the whole the congress has been an occasion to demonstrate the introduction of Median Group work in the clinic with severely disturbed patients, to better understand the difference between small groups and Median Groups and transposition.</p>
