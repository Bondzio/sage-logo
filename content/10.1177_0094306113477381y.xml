<p>Social network analysis is currently enjoying a High Renaissance, with increasing numbers of social science and professional disciplines, even applied physics, excitedly exploring its potential to shift paradigms. That flourishing would not have occurred without the decades-long struggles of pioneering anthropologists and sociologists to build solid conceptual, theoretical, and methodological foundations on which to construct new paradigms for social structure and interaction. Prominent among those trailblazers is Charles Kadushin, who over the last half century, has conducted important network research on social circles in psychotherapy, opinion making, and the intellectual elites in the United States, Australia, France, and Yugoslavia. He now caps a distinguished scholarly career with an exposition that integrates the history, theories, and substantive applications of social network analysis.</p>
<p><italic>Understanding Social Networks</italic> takes a conceptual, rather than a methodological how-to-do-it, approach to the big ideas. Intended “for readers with no or a very limited background in mathematics or computers” (p. 4), this introduction should be especially accessible to neophytes wondering whether to invest additional time in mastering the esoteric notational systems ultimately necessary for deeper comprehension of the network enterprise. In often witty and folksy prose, Kadushin persuasively sells the virtues and benefits to be gained from structural relational explanations of diverse social domains. By the conclusion, only the most troglodyte of methodological individualists will remain unconvinced that understanding social connections matters a great deal.</p>
<p>Kadushin’s underlying assumption, that “social networks begin with people” (p. 11), arranges the sequence of chapters. Three cover such basic concepts and principles as dyads, triads, homophily, balance, centrality, cliques, and clusters. Six subsequent chapters discuss psychological, cognitive, and motivational foundations of interpersonal ties; small groups and leadership; organizations; the “small world,” circles, and communities; influence and diffusion of innovations, ideas, and diseases like HIV-AIDS; and social capital, that imprecise analog to financial capital (not that economists care whether Americans no longer bowl in leagues). The final chapter summarizes the conceptual tour de force in “Ten Master Ideas of Social Networks.” Dozens of sociograms and related figures reinforce the visual component so crucial to thinking like a network analyst. Where advanced concepts lie beyond the scope of this introduction (triad census, betweenness centrality), Kadushin references multiple sources for further self-study.</p>
<p>Despite the nontechnical treatment, Kadushin encompasses deep analytic coverage and broad empirical research. For example, in discussing small groups and leadership, he painstakingly unpacks the ideas embedded in George Homan’s propositions from <italic>The Human Group</italic> (1950). He connects them to Roger Gould’s mathematical theory of status hierarchies and Fritz Heider’s psychological balance theory to derive nonobvious propositions about the emergence of small-group leaders. “No semi-mystical attribution of qualities or adherence to norms that Homans has attributed to leaders is necessary [to explain the paradox that leaders] enjoy and tolerate greater asymmetry in their choices than others, and, as a result of group processes, … their rank is magnified by social influence processes within the group” (p. 87). However, given his predilection for individuals and their motivations, Kadushin pays scant attention to interorganizational and international networks where the units of analysis are corporations, nonprofits, intergovernmental organizations, and nation states. Those networks involve emergent network properties requiring additional explanatory concepts and propositions which transcend the micro- and meso-levels on which <italic>Understanding Social Networks</italic> persistently focuses. (Although small world research often analyzes ginormous datasets, such as the World Wide Web, the units of analysis are typically persons or websites rather than more complex social entities.) Nevertheless, after completing this volume, readers will be well prepared to undertake further study of those omitted actors.</p>
<p>The penultimate chapter makes a valuable contribution by discussing ethical dilemmas of network research, a topic neglected in most introductory texts. Given the growing popularity of Facebook and Twitter as research sites, and new automated technologies for vast data mining of the Web, university institutional review boards should make that chapter mandatory reading for all social researchers. Kadushin remarks that the laudable principles of the 1979 Belmont Report, which formed the basis for the Federal Human Subjects Code, “are difficult to adapt to social network research and for that matter to social science research” (p. 185). Fundamental desiderata for protecting human subjects—anonymity, confidentiality, privacy, and consent—are threatened in social network research by “one troublesome and distinctive attribute: the collection of names of either individuals or social units is not incidental to the research but the very point” (p. 188). Whenever a researcher asks an ego respondent to name their network alters, the latter have not given their informed consent to be included in the project. Organizational consultants confront dilemmas when management insists on knowing the specific relations among named employees as a condition for access to workplaces. Network research on illicit drug use, sexually transmitted diseases, and terrorism pose other quandaries of anonymity and confidentiality. Kadushin outlines the principles he personally follows to safeguard his own network data, but much work remains before the network analysis community reaches consensus on appropriate ethical standards that will mutually benefit subjects, organizations, researchers, and their societies.</p>
<p>Through his numerous insights into the origins and evolution of social network analysis over the past half century, Charles Kadushin demonstrates once again the deep wisdom of that great public philosopher, Yogi Berra, who noted, “You can observe a lot just by watching.”</p>
