<abstract>
<p>This article argues that the Rousseff government faced the challenge of deepening a reconfigured federative pact in relation to crime and public insecurity. Strengthening of federal level justice institutions began tentatively under the second Cardoso administration, and accelerated during President Da Silva’s second term. However, it required greater capacity to provide leadership to law-and-order agencies at state and municipal level, and to coordinate multi-agency action both horizontally (with the armed forces) and vertically (with municipal and state police and prison authorities). This was essential to tackle what Dilma’s government identified as the most pressing problems of drug consumption and cross-border trafficking, organized crime networks, prison management and other forms of social and criminal violence. Increased activism by federal and municipal authorities on public insecurity could not circumvent entirely the need for some key structural reforms affecting the state-level justice authorities that were likely to exact a high political price.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article examines the considerable challenges that crime, justice and citizen security posed to President Dilma Rousseff in the third term of a Workers' Party (PT)-led government and the extent to which there was continuity or a distinctive stamp in this policy arena. Over the last 15 years rising public fear of crime, as well as measurable indicators of insecurity, have progressively pushed this issue to the top of the political agenda. Brazil sees over 40,000 murders a year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920512440583">1</xref></sup> These are concentrated in the low income areas of the major cities and primarily affect young, black men, as both victims and perpetrators. This lethality has a number of drivers: the changing dynamics of the regional and local illegal narcotics trade, inter-personal and domestic grammars of violence,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920512440583">2</xref></sup> acquisitive crime and, finally, institutional violence – the police are estimated to be responsible for up to 10 percent of homicides.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920512440583">3</xref></sup> There are also organized crime networks operating throughout the country, often deeply embedded in weak and compromised local criminal justice systems and protected by corrupt politicians, rendering them difficult to extirpate without a systematic and multi-agency approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920512440583">Macaulay, 2011</xref>). The criminal justice system itself suffers from a number of structural flaws: hyper-autonomy and lack of coordination, even competition, between the different branches – police, courts, prosecution service, agencies with a similar function (the four main types of police) – and levels of government (federal, state and municipal). Part of this excessive autonomy is a lack of accountability to the public that these agencies were meant to serve, and of oversight by other government bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920512440583">Lemgruber et al., 2003</xref>). Aside from the general governance and human security implications of this matrix of problems, Brazil will host the football World Cup in 2014 and the summer Olympic Games in 2016 and faces an international public relations disaster if it does not get a grip on policing in the major cities. This situation also undermines Brazil’s wider soft power claims to global leadership on the basis of its good governance and support for international human rights regimes (pace Par Engstrom’s article, in this issue).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0896920512440583">
<title>The Public Security Institutional Framework</title>
<p>The Social Democratic Party (PSDB)-led governments of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995–2002) did not initially appreciate the importance of crime and citizen security, being more concerned with economic and other governance reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920512440583">Macaulay, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920512440583">2010</xref>). That said, much of Brazil’s institutional human rights armature (National Human Rights Plan and Secretariat) was erected early in Cardoso’s first term, impelled both by the president’s own political affinities and a desire to fully assert Brazil’s adherence to international community norms. However, this immediately created a dissonance between the government’s declared values, on the one hand, and rising urban violence, persistent human rights violations by police and poor management of the criminal justice system, on the other, that the new national and local human rights bodies found themselves powerless to influence in the absence of major structural changes to the country’s law-and-order apparatus. The country’s first National Security Plan (Plano Nacional de Segurança Pública, PNSP) was not launched until 2000, the middle of Cardoso’s second term, and, like many penal reforms in Brazil, it was rushed through in reaction to a major incident.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920512440583">4</xref></sup> A young homeless man had hijacked a bus in Rio’s middle-class Zona Sul, and the tragedy unfolded in real time on the nation’s televisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0896920512440583">5</xref></sup> A week later, the administration announced a list of 124 different policies to address 15 key issues in tackling crime and insecurity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0896920512440583">6</xref></sup> However, the plan was immediately criticized for its lack of coherence, depth and operability, as it failed to set out goals, priorities, allocation of responsibility to specific executive agencies and a timetable for implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920512440583">Soares, 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, some of these discrete aspirations turned into concrete policies that would form the foundations of more systematic reforms in the Lula era.</p>
<p>By contrast, as a presidential candidate, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva brought law-and-order into the election campaign of 2002 as an explicit policy commitment, although both main candidates (Lula and the PSDB’s José Serra) kept it out of the public presidential debates. Ten months before the election, he personally launched a 100-page alternative National Public Security Plan, written by a team of leading Brazilian policy experts, justice sector reformers, practitioners and academics under the aegis of his Instituto Cidadania (Citizenship Institute). It was intended as a comprehensive, non-partisan, technical blueprint of joined-up state policy. In particular it would have tackled the vertical and horizontal fragmentation of policing and public security in Brazil, where the 1988 Constitution determined that each of the 27 states would operate two separate police forces, the militarized <italic>Polícia Militar</italic> (PM), a uniformed, armed preventive force that constitutes 80 percent of the nation’s police, and the investigative <italic>Polícia Civil</italic>. Municipalities over a certain size are also allowed to operate a local police force with a limited remit, while the Ministry of Justice controls a federal police force. A cornerstone of this new Plan was a Unified Public Security System (Sistema Único de Segurança Pública, SUSP), which was intended to achieve greater operational cooperation between police forces, both horizontally at state level, and between the three levels of government, through six axes – training, information and data sharing, management, investigative technologies, external oversight and coordination with social policy providers – that would generate shared protocols, norms, practices and performance indicators. It was supposed to lead eventually to an untying of the constitutional knot, that is, legislative reform that would allow each state to determine the structure of its own police force.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, within a year Lula’s first administration largely jettisoned both this strategy and its authors, fearing that an overt federal government commitment to tackle crime and improve policing might backfire electorally, if policies did not deliver. His reform team in the Ministry of Justice managed to get the country’s state governors to agree to a so-called National Pact for Peace centred on the SUSP and the PNSP, but it was the federal government that acted as a veto player, pulling out at the last minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920512440583">Soares, 2007</xref>: 88). This permitted persistent neglect of serious problems such as the violent organized crime networks operating inside Rio de Janeiro’s and São Paulo state’s prison systems. These ended up forcing the issue into the following presidential election debates, which took place just after an unprecedented episode of orchestrated gang violence in São Paulo in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920512440583">Salla, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0896920512440583">7</xref></sup> Lula, whose offer of federal government support had been rejected by the state-level authorities, was thus able to attack his challenger, former São Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin, for complacence on urban violence, making it one of the factors that lost the PSDB the elections. Having gained electoral capital on law-and-order, the second Lula administration changed tack and decided to assert federal police control over this policy domain.</p>
<p>In 2007 the PNSP was rebooted as the National Public Security and Citizenship Programme (Programa Nacional de Segurança Pública com Cidadania, PRONASCI). This time, however, the plan was firmly backed by the executive branch in the form of a presidential decree and a pledge to invest R$6.707b by 2012, thus committing Dilma to this initiative for at least the first half of her term. Like its predecessor, its 94 proposed areas of activity are to be delivered through horizontal multi-agency action (19 ministries are involved) and joint state-municipal initiatives. Its ambition may turn out to be either its strength or its weakness, but it is founded more clearly than any previous initiative on the principles that human rights and police effectiveness are not mutually exclusive, that both preventive and crime-suppressing policing are necessary, and that improvements in the policing apparatus depend on wider social education and democratization of community-police relations.</p>
<p>PRONASCI’s profile meant that public security was an equally strong theme in Dilma’s 2010 election campaign, but this time neither as a reaction to unfolding events nor buried away in a policy document. The pattern during both the Cardoso and Lula governments was to shy away from public security reforms during their first terms in office in order to pursue more apparently rewarding policies in other areas. Both were impelled by the consequences of this negligence to take the issue more seriously and systematically in their second terms. An analysis of spending on public security in the second Lula term also suggests a significant shift in the relative contributions that the three levels of federal government make to public security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920512440583">Fórum Brasileiro de Segurança Pública, 2010</xref>: 7). Federal government spending in 2009 had risen 200 percent in relation to 2003 levels, while municipal contributions rose 168 percent, compared to increased investment by the state-level authorities of only 98 percent.</p>
<p>So, given the human rights and public security institutional architecture that Dilma inherited, would she fall back to the position adopted by her predecessors, of leaving higher profile and more politically challenging reforms for a possible second term when the electoral costs are lower or more calculable? The Ministry of Justice’s declared reform priorities for this administration are to secure the country’s borders against illegal trafficking of all types through inter-agency action by the armed forces, highway and federal police, to tackle the drug-related roots of current insecurity, and to undertake a structural reform of the prison system for which a commission is being constituted. All of these goals signal an intention to further consolidate the federal government’s capacity to lead and coordinate the actions of the other levels of government. However, the outcomes will inevitably depend on the actions of the multiple veto players connected to crime and security issues (state-level politicians, police lobbies, armed forces and so forth) produced by Brazil’s political and administrative federal matrix.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0896920512440583">
<title>Federal Governance</title>
<p>Comparative literature on the delivery of state policy in federal systems of government suggests that decentralized agencies cannot perform effectively unless there is institutional capacity and coherence around goals and norms at the highest level of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920512440583">Tendler, 1997</xref>). The enduring challenge for both the PSDB- and the PT-led administrations has been how to define the role of the federal government when most of the institutional infrastructure (police, prisons, courts) related to the justice sector is organized and operated by state-level governments. The federal authorities hold a certain number of levers, such as the power of legislation over a unitary penal code and over the constitutional provisions governing the justice system. However, they have been reluctant to deploy some levers, such as making state performance in crime reduction and respect for human rights a condition for centrally disbursed funding, and slow in developing others, such as the coordination and disciplining of state-level justice agencies in relation to an overarching federal vision of governance in this area.</p>
<p>The Cardoso administrations mainly resorted to the strategies of denial and delegation. No major constitutional or legal changes were enacted that altered the division of labour between state-level and federal government, and states essentially pursued public order and crime-fighting policies as they saw fit pragmatically or ideologically. Thus extra-judicial killings by the military police or torture by the civil police could be blamed on the lack of oversight, or connivance, by the state authorities. Federal intervention in law-and-order issues was largely avoided. In 2002 Cardoso overrode his then Minister of Justice and refused to send federal justice authorities into the state of Espírito Santo where a police death squad had been operating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920512440583">Global Justice, 2002</xref>). Part of Cardoso’s reluctance was political: he needed the support of state governors and state legislator delegations in Congress for his reform agenda. Part of it was pragmatic: the federal police was at that point tiny in number and completely overstretched. After much pressure from human rights organizations, a constitutional amendment was passed in 2004 that ‘federalized’ human rights violations that were not being properly investigated by state authorities, by allowing them to be dealt with by the federal justice system. But this was in many ways a token gesture. It did not tackle the structural weaknesses of the state-level justice systems and relied heavily on the goodwill and action of federal agencies.</p>
<p>Although the first Lula government also hesitated on police reform, it did focus on one very important area of federal-level justice infrastructure, by completing a reform of the judiciary that had become stalled for over a decade. The reforms introduced in 2004 included financial and administrative oversight through new governing Councils for the courts and prosecution service, anti-nepotism directives and the introduction of the principle of binding precedent, all of which reduced the hyper-autonomy of the judiciary as an institution and of individual judges and prosecutors. Access to justice is still patchy, particularly in relation to defence representation for the poor, but the Cardoso years saw the introduction of very successful civil and criminal small claims courts, while in 2006 Brazil finally got a bespoke law (the Maria da Penha law) to tackle the many cases of domestic violence flooding into the latter, which had been one of PRONASCI’s commitments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0896920512440583">
<title>The Ministry of Justice</title>
<p>The Lula years also saw a strengthening of the Ministry of Justice, the pivotal institution for developing more federal capacity in the area of law-and-order. The first step was to stabilize personnel and leadership. Between 1985 and 2002 Ministers of Justice had lasted an average of just one year in the post, and many had been political fixers and cronies with little legal background or interest. Those with expertise and a reform agenda were quickly toppled for political reasons, generally when they ran up against vested interests in the Ministry. This trend did not entirely end under Lula, who allowed the undermining of Luis Eduardo Soares, his reforming head of the Secretaria Nacional de Segurança Pública (National Public Security Secretariat) Luis Eduardo Soares and key author of the National Public Security Plan, after less than 10 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920512440583">Soares, 2000</xref>). However, whereas the eight years of Cardoso’s government had seen 10 Ministers, Lula’s saw only three. Márcio Thomas Bastos, who lasted longest (just over four years), had been Lula’s personal lawyer. Although he fitted the traditional mould of Justice Ministers in being a canny political operator employed to watch the President’s back, he also recognized the necessity of reforms such as that of the judiciary. Tarso Genro, Minister through most of Lula’s second term, had both a greater intellectual interest in the public security reform agenda, and the clout as a seasoned political heavyweight to carry through the next stage of justice reforms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0896920512440583">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dilma has continued in this vein. Her Minister of Justice, José Eduardo Cardozo, a former law professor from São Paulo, has a strong political track record, although he cannot match Genro in terms of administrative experience and national political influence. As a PT city councillor he was tenacious in pursuit of corrupt local politicians under the Celso Pitta mayoralty and as a result he received a record number of votes. As a federal deputy he promoted the Ficha Limpa (‘clean slate’) bill, which prevents politicians with criminal convictions from running for office. He is also Dilma’s right-hand man, having run her election campaign alongside Antonio Palocci. This gives him a potent combination of political currency and leverage in Brazil’s most populous state and the PT’s stronghold, a good public reputation and moral capital, and an understanding of the legal field. Whether it is powerful enough to push through much needed but controversial constitutional reforms on policing remains to be seen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0896920512440583">
<title>The Rise of the Federal Police</title>
<p>The strengthening of federal institutions under Lula proceeded with a major investment in the federal police force, which grew by over a third in number between 2001 and 2008 and acquired greater institutional autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920512440583">Arantes, 2011</xref>). The 1988 Constitution established its legal remit for protecting the property and interests of the federal government, dealing with inter-state or international crimes or those requiring a uniform response, suppression of the illegal narcotics and contraband trade, policing borders, ports and airports, and acting as federal investigative police. Márcio Thomas Bastos saw himself as building a ‘Brazilian FBI’ and under Lula the Federal Police earned public approval for its high profile and dogged assaults on institutional corruption, arresting and indicting politicians and bureaucrats for misuse of public money; in 2009 alone it carried out 288 different operations.</p>
<p>Dilma’s government has signalled that it will support further growth of the federal police. In 2008 Lula had authorized 2000 more posts, although not all have been filled as yet, and new appointments have been delayed by general public spending cutbacks. The Ministry of Justice has also pledged to deepen the force’s political neutrality and technical excellence by strengthening the national police academy, supporting training, operational partnerships and links with international counterparts, enhancing evidence gathering, improving personnel management in order to prevent corruption and bolstering the internal affairs and oversight department. This last issue has been perhaps the Achilles heel of an over-ambitious agency: in March 2011 the Ministry of Justice had to fire the head of the federal highway police after an undercover TV report revealed a lack of police monitoring of drugs trafficking and prostitution along the nation’s highways.</p>
<p>One of the important consequences of the rise of the federal police has been the squeezing out of the armed forces from a number of governance arenas that are not strictly military in character but which they continued to occupy as a hangover from military rule. The armed forces have been slow to relinquish the control over public security that they acquired in the early years of the military-civil regime, when they first incorporated the then relatively insignificant state-level <italic>Polícia Militar</italic> into the military command structure, making them henceforth the main public security force in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920512440583">Zaverucha, 2005</xref>). The 1988 Constitution maintained the armed forces’ responsibility to safeguard law and order, ‘at the request of the legally constituted authorities’. The state-level military police continued to pass crime-related data directly to the army officials managing an intelligence unit in the heart of the Ministry of Justice, much to the frustration of reformers hoping to build a coherent and usable national database for the purposes of strategic planning for crime reduction, and of the federal police force, which was itching for a larger remit and national importance. Turf battles fought inside the Ministry ended the tenure of two of Cardoso’s Ministers of justice when they tried to assert federal police jurisdiction over cross-border crime involving small arms and drugs, because the armed forces maintain a role in securing Brazil’s remoter borders, especially in the Amazon region. The military also refused to share crime data with the federal police. But the federal police have out-manoeuvred them and captured key pieces of technology provided through foreign technical cooperation, such as the FBI’s fingerprinting software.</p>
<p>The Dilma government has emphasized the operational integration of police and armed forces in combating illegal narcotics, organized crime, the small arms trade, and corruption. The border control initiative appears to be working as there is a clear division of labour. But in other areas inter-institutional competition is still present. For example, in 2004 the gun control statute specified that the database held by the federal police on small arms held by civilians and all police (SINARM) should be merged with the armed forces’ database (Sigma) held on their weaponry and that of sporting sharpshooters and collectors (presumably civilians). Yet again, while the numbers of the latter are small, the military has resisted any encroachment on their territory.</p>
<p>Dilma has pressed ahead with trimming the remit of the armed forces. One of the first institutional reorderings of her administration was to transfer ABIN, the national intelligence agency, from the Ministry of Defence, and the Institutional Security Office (Gabinete de Segurança Institucional, GSI) under the aegis of the Presidency, to which it has answered since its creation in 1999, to the Sub-Ministry for Public Security (SENASP) in the Ministry of Justice. The move was prompted in part by intelligence officials, irritated at having to answer to military officials, and partly by a sense in government that they had become loose cannons. Documents released at the end of 2010 through Wikileaks suggested that the GSI and ABIN had maintained closer links to US counterterrorism and intelligence agencies than the Lula government deemed desirable and had been involving the federal police directly in non-sanctioned detentions related to counterterrorism under the guise of counter-narcotics and counter-smuggling operations. Leaks also implied that during the Lula second term Dilma had opposed a GSI-drafted bill that would have categorized organized urban crime and social movement direct action as ‘terrorism’, and focused police attention on the population of Middle Eastern origin living in the so-called ‘Triple Frontier’ between Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0896920512440583">
<title>Drug and Prison Policy</title>
<p>A decree passed in her first week in office moved the counternarcotics agency (Secretaria Nacional de Políticas sobre Drogas, SENAD) and its respective council and fund from the purview of the GSI, to that of the Ministry of Justice. Lula’s first PNSP has actually included a proposal to move the drugs agency to a more appropriate home, such as the Ministry of Justice, or Health, or to a ministerial level SENASP, and his first Minister of Justice, Márcio Thomas Bastos had attempted to convince Lula of the importance of bringing the SENAD and Federal Police under the same institutional umbrella. However, the armed forces were resistant to the idea, and the proposal was never put into action.</p>
<p>However, despite the clear signal given by the shift in SENAD in relation to federal government/military relations, drug policy actually caused one of the first casualties of the administration and gave mixed signals about how the government would combine preventive and repressive strategies. The newly appointed head of the SENAD, Pedro Abramovay, had declared that the government was not interested in imprisoning small-time drug dealers. He was forced to resign after what was seen as his indiscretion in the very early days of an administration still highly sensitive to critical media coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0896920512440583">9</xref></sup> It is perhaps surprising that Minister of Justice Cardozo did not defend what was really a reiteration and logical extension of a policy developed under the Lula government of diverting users away from the criminal justice system and making greater use of non-custodial sentences and drug treatment. The shift from marijuana to cocaine to crack in recent years has fuelled a rise in social and drug-related violence. Recently, however, the regional debate, led by Fernando Henrique Cardoso and the former presidents of Colombia (Gaviria) and Mexico (Zedillo), has moved away from criminalization in favour of harm reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0896920512440583">10</xref></sup> The federal government intends to create, in conjunction with federal universities, 49 regional referral centres on crack and other drugs with the aim of training, in one year, 14,700 professionals for multidisciplinary intervention. This represents the next stage in a policy developed under both the PSDB- and PT-led governments of decriminalization of certain offences and of decarceration, keeping petty offenders away from the prison system through non-custodial sentences such as fines, community work and therapy orders.</p>
<p>Prosecution of small drug dealers has been one of the main motors behind the ballooning of the prison population due to the so-called ‘heinous crimes’ law of 1990, which made several types of serious crime, including ‘drug trafficking’, ineligible for bail or early release through amnesty or pardon. Attempts have been made to change the law but it continues to appeal to penal populists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0896920512440583">11</xref></sup> By the end of 2010 the national prison population stood at 496,251 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920512440583">DEPEN, 2010</xref>). Of São Paulo state’s 170,916 prisoners (34% of the nation’s total), nearly a third have been charged or convicted directly of drugs offences, without taking into account drug-related offences such as theft or homicide. Bail for such offences has been allowed since 2007 and in 2006 the Lula government passed a new anti-drugs law which, although it still treated the possession of drugs for personal use as a criminal offence, emphasized treatment, support and non-custodial penalties. However, there is evidence that many magistrates simply ignore procedural guidelines with which they disagree and apply preventive pre-trial detention where it is unnecessary or discouraged, as a form of pre-emptive punishment or control of suspects in particular social categories. It also seems that police and judges have colluded in interpreting, or mis-recording, the amount of drugs allowable for ‘personal use’ found on a suspect in order to apply a prison sentence under the tougher laws on drug trafficking. Thus, one third of prisoners are still awaiting trial in detention, often in very poor, cramped conditions in police cells. Thus neither the Cardoso nor the Lula governments eradicated the institutional conditions that allowed criminal gangs such as the First Command of the Capital (Primeiro Comando da Capital, PCC) in São Paulo, or those in Rio de Janeiro to flourish within the prison system, one of Abramovay’s concerns in his ill-timed statement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0896920512440583">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Again, in this policy area the Lula government concentrated on what it could reform unilaterally as a federal government, rather than on creating and imposing an overarching prisons policy on the states. His eight years in power saw the construction of five regionally based federal prisons for the most ‘dangerous’ and uncontrollable prisoners in the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0896920512440583">13</xref></sup> State authorities elect to transfer specific offenders from the state penitentiaries to these facilities, which are run under a ‘supermax’ security regime by the Federal Police, who have thereby acquired yet another discrete domain within the criminal justice system. This was undoubtedly accelerated by the May 2006 episode in São Paulo, but it would be naive to assert that the existence of federal prisons has broken the grip of the organized crime networks in Rio and São Paulo. The authorities in those two states have reached an uneasy truce with the Comandos, allowing them to operate relatively unhindered within the system in exchange for a negative peace, that is, the promise not to unleash riots and mayhem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0896920512440583">14</xref></sup> If President Rousseff is serious about tackling organized crime networks and restructuring the prison system, the federal government will have to persuade the state-level authorities to break this unwritten pact and ride out the violent criminal and political storm it would unleash.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0896920512440583">15</xref></sup> The lessons are writ large in Mexico, where a similar move by Calderón’s government sparked an unprecedented narco-war.</p>

<title>Civilianizing and Democratizing Policing</title>
<p>The Ministry of Justice has already declared the federal police to be Dilma’s ‘special weapon’. But while the force has already proven its worth in tackling political corruption, can its current virtues of technical competence and legitimacy be deployed, or transferred across, to the state-level police forces that deal with day-to-day, rather than exceptional, crime and violence? At the moment Brazil is caught in a vicious circle. As the state military police have shown themselves unable – due to corruption, incompetence and lack of training - to tackle organized and disorganized urban crime and violence, successive governments have persisted in deploying the army as an agency of last resort, especially in Rio de Janeiro, by virtue of its profile as a tourist destination, and peculiar topography and social divisions that breed drug gangs in its favelas. The army was called in to police the city for the UN Earth Summit in 1992, and two years later occupied several favelas to capture drug traffickers and seize drugs and guns in Operation Rio. After orchestrated and spectacular violence by the Red Command Gang (Comando Vermelho) in September 2002 Cardoso mobilized the army to provide security during the elections, and in the New Year Lula garrisoned 3000 troops in Rio to protect carnival revellers. In 2004 troops were called in to end a turf war between rival gangs in Rocinha, and in 2010 they occupied two other favelas in order to drive out traffickers and re-establish state control of territory. As Juliana Bertazzo notes (in this issue), while Cardoso brought the armed forces under civilian control in the Ministry of Defence, paradoxically he also oversaw an inscribing of the military’s domestic policing role in the Constitution, which was further entrenched under Lula.</p>
<p>In many ways this is a common trope in Brazilian public management: when an agency tasked with delivering a specific service fails, rather than reform that agency and make it effective, the task is given to another, or a new, public body, creating a layering that blurs missions and lines of responsibility, and induces either inter-agency competition or paralysis. While the armed forces may see some institutional advantage in maintaining a remit for public security, and their deployment in Haiti is good practice for this role, such mission creep is unhelpful in the long run for both the armed forces, which risk contaminating their image and personnel by association with drug trafficking and accusations of human rights violations by their troops, and for the state-level military police, who are able to avoid undergoing the necessary reforms. An alternative to using the armed forces to fill the public security gap is to deploy the National Public Security Force (Força Nacional de Segurança Pública) which is an elite, inter-state ad hoc military police task force, commanded by the federal police, intended to intervene in critical situations beyond the capacity of an individual state. Created in 2004 it has since intervened in several states to deal with prison riots and criminal factions, to help reduce rural violence in the Amazon and maintain order during police strikes. However, it has been gradually downgraded, with its personnel reduced from a peak of 3700 in 2007, during the Pan-American Games, to only 800 in 2010, when it was commanded by a major, not a colonel. This may be because of the introduction of new multi-agency initiatives in the favelas and borders that now replace its emergency functions.</p>
<p>The strongest signal from the incoming Dilma government that she intended to address this historical overlap between the armed forces and military police is the announcement of a Truth Commission to investigate human rights violations committed by both during the military regime of 1964-85. A bill to that effect was fast-tracked through Congress in the latter part of 2011, and the government hopes that, with a two-year deadline to report, its work will be completed by the end of her term. It remains to be seen whether revelations about the armed forces’ role in repression of political opponents – the systematic use of disappearance, extra-judicial execution and, especially, torture is already well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920512440583">Archdiocese of São Paulo, 1985</xref>) – and the spillover of these practices into policing of crime by the state-level police will produce such reputational damage as to cause the armed forces to retreat from any domestic policing role, as its counterparts in neighbouring Chile and Argentina have done. Their bullishness about the military regime has already been dented by the banning of the 31 March parades celebrating the 1964 coup. The impact on the state-level military and civil police is less obvious. So much time has elapsed that a purging of the ranks is now largely redundant: most known police torturers have retired. There is undoubtedly some path dependency with institutional cultures transmitted between one generation of officers to another, and this is clearest for the militarized police in terms of their training and accountability structures, as the military courts presently effectively protect them from prosecution. It is possible that a Truth Commission could be the only opportunity to create a climate of public opinion strong enough to counterbalance the weight of the lobby of former police officers and their allies in Congress and permit constitutional amendments that would enable states to demilitarize their police forces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0896920512440583">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The alternative to constitutional reform of the police is <italic>horizontal</italic> operational integration which many see as more feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920512440583">Beato Filho, 1998</xref>). A number of states have quietly merged their justice and public security secretariats and encouraged inter-force coordination in relation to geographical subdivisions, database sharing and joint command of the military and civil police. The big idea in urban policing now is the police pacification units (Unidades de Polícia Pacificadora, UPPs) operating in 17 of the most violent and drug-ridden favelas in Rio de Janeiro. These operations are distinguished firstly by the <italic>vertical</italic> integration of military, federal, state and municipal police, which are deployed in a ‘wave’. The army goes in first to secure the area, followed by the elite armed wing of the military police, the BOPE, who drive out the drug dealers. This is followed by specially trained state military police and municipal police with a more ‘community’ orientation centred on rebuilding citizen-police relations, something already tried in several locations but often in a piecemeal manner by a single branch of the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920512440583">De Mesquita Neto, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0896920512440583">17</xref></sup> Achieving collaboration rather than substitution or competition is no small thing. Such operations are also intended to change the institutional culture and operational culture, especially of the military police, many of whom are keen to embrace a more professional image and practice. On 4 January 2011, the Dilma government issued a ministerial directive that police should verbally advise members of the public that they are armed and of their intention to shoot if their orders are not obeyed. The directive echoes similar initiatives used by individual states to reduce police shootings, but is notable in being a federal government instruction to state-level police.</p>
<p>The second feature is multi-agency horizontal integration, with policing just one component in the provision of other state services. This approach has also been attempted before but this is the first time it has been initiated from the top down and has been accepted by lower level authorities. That said, many of the best violence reduction strategies in recent years have come from municipal governments in the major conurbations through the use of public consultations, deployment of municipal guards as community agents and ‘environmental’ city ordinances aimed at reducing alcohol consumption, improving street lighting and so forth. At least 865 cities in Brazil now have a municipal guard and 1230 have some administrative body responsible for crime reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920512440583">Fórum Brasileiro de Segurança Pública, 2010</xref>: 7). Dilma appointed to the key post of head of SENASP Regina Miki, who notably oversaw a 78 percent drop in homicides in the city of Diadema in Greater São Paulo between 2001 and 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920512440583">Guindani, 2005</xref>), underscoring the emerging federal partnership between the top and bottom tiers of the federation as a means of working around the rigidities and resistances of state-level policing arrangements. In May 2011 Regina issued a directive explicitly aimed at ‘strengthening the federal pact’ by regulating the municipal guards across Brazil.</p>
<p>In conclusion, now that the reform of the federal public security and justice institutions is being completed, the federal government under President Rousseff is facing the administrative challenge of cascading its vision of citizen security down through the other layers of government, especially at state level, to make the multi-level, multi-agency aspirations of the SUSP a reality. The state governments and their policing apparatus present the single biggest stumbling block to coordinated action. The problems are both technical and political. For example, Brazil continues to lack a consolidated database on crime and offending as the states persist in using their own, incompatible methodologies, or simply refuse to submit data to the Ministry of Justice. The constitutionally induced inflexibility around the state police would require such a high level of political capital to undo that it is likely that, like its predecessors, the Dilma government will find routes round, not through, the blockage. The new administration has been giving out contradictory messages about the relationship of the police and armed forces in relation to the control of crime and social violence, combining formal institutional separation of agencies with greater operational integration and collaboration. This tension, in the end, can only be resolved with a thorough-going institutional reform of the civilian police forces to build their capacity to deliver the security that Brazil’s citizens so desperately need.</p>

<p>The criminal networks, or Comandos, in Rio de Janeiro were born in two high security prisons in that state in the 1970s, when bank robbers were imprisoned alongside leftwing opponents of the military regime, from whom they learnt some valuable lessons about setting up clandestine networks.
