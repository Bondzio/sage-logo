<p>The publication in 1987 of <italic>Borderlands/La Frontera</italic> strengthened the theoretical work of a group of women, feminists and Latin Americans who had been born or were living in the United States and who expressed in their work – <italic>This Bridge Called My Back</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa and Moraga, 1981</xref>), <italic>Cuentos: Stories by Latinas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353511415969">Gómez et al., 1983</xref>) and <italic>Loving the War Years</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959353511415969">Moraga, 1983</xref>), among others – the experience of inhabiting a territory between two worlds. The paradigmatic work of Gloria Anzaldúa marked a point of inflection for their discussions, consolidating perhaps the field of what has been referred to as a <italic>women-of-color feminism</italic>, a feminism in the diaspora, clearly postcolonial and on the border. This article considers two issues in relation to the work of Anzaldúa. The first refers to the peculiarities and differences that distinguish her work in relation to certain proposals of white feminism (in particular, I will draw upon the work of Donna Haraway). The second is related to the epistemological consequences of this differentiation.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0959353511415969"><title>Two mestiza sisters</title>
<p>I will begin my discussion considering some elements of Donna Haraway’s work, particularly regarding the first chapter of her (1997) book <italic>Modest Witness@Second Millenium. FemaleMan Meets OncoMouse: Feminism and Technoscience</italic>. In this chapter, Haraway uses the work of Anzaldúa to construct the image of the <italic>Mestiza Cosmica</italic>. In her discussion, she describes a Lynn Randolph painting which clearly resembles the physical features of Anzaldúa. I will begin with a fragment of the text which condenses the differences I would like to draw attention to, italicizing below what will serve as the central point of my reflection:<disp-quote>
<p>A mestiza stands with one foot in Texas and one foot in Mexico. She is taming a diamond-back rattlesnake with one hand and manipulating the Hubble telescope with another …. La Mestiza Cosmica is the kind of modest witness coming into existence at the end of the Second Christian Millennium, when what can count as freedom, justice, knowledge, and skill are again very much at stake in the mutated experimental way of life …. La Mestiza Cosmica is historically specific, located in a particular time, place, and body; she is, therefore, a figure representing the kind of global consciousness a modest witness should cultivate. The rattlesnake and the four hands suggest a mode of consciousness called the Coatlicue state, associated with an Aztec goddess, as theorized by Gloria Anzaldúa. <italic>Not unlike Anzaldúa, who maintains a necessarily eclectic altar on her computer, Randolph's mestiza joins the snake and the Hubble telescope to demonstrate the kind of vision needed in the New World Order</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959353511415969">Haraway, 1997</xref>: 20)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Using the difference proposed between the Mestiza Cosmica and Anzaldúa’s mestiza, I suggest that this contrast evokes two different narratives: one, the narrative that Haraway builds from her idea of a cyborg conscience, and the other the narrative that Anzaldúa has constructed in <italic>Borderlands/La Frontera</italic>.</p>
<p>The work of Donna Haraway implies a strong critique of certain forms of scientific knowledge. In this text, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959353511415969">Haraway (1997)</xref> critiques the experimental point of departure that develops a particular form of testimony, defining modesty as one of its central virtues.<sup>1</sup> The virtue of modesty that characterizes the <italic>Modest Witness</italic> – the scientist – implies the concealment of its positions, emotions and opinions, with a certain inexpressiveness which renders invisible the subject who is speaking. Haraway proposes, with some humor, that this allows him (sic) to speak <italic>as a legitimate ventriloquist</italic> of the objective world:<disp-quote>
<p>Modesty is one of the founding virtues of what we call modernity. This is the virtue that guarantees that the modest witness is the legitimate and authorized ventriloquist for the object world, adding nothing from his mere opinions, from his biasing embodiment. And so he is endowed with the remarkable power to establish the facts. He bears witness: he is objective; he guarantees the clarity and purity of objects. His subjectivity is his objectivity. His narratives have a magical power — they lose all trace of their history as stories, as products of partisan projects, as contestable representations, or as constructed documents in their potent capacity to define the facts. The narratives become clear mirrors, fully magical mirrors, without once appealing to the transcendental or the magical. (1997: 24)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959353511415969">Haraway (1997)</xref>, the <italic>Modest Witness</italic> is the basis for the model of western science, both European and masculine, which has followed us to the present day and which has facilitated the notion of objectivity, establishing a strong differentiation between the object and subject of knowledge. This form of disembodied knowledge, through different discursive mechanisms, brings about the concealment of its positions and interests. Against the <italic>Modest Witness</italic>, Haraway introduces a new subject of knowledge which she calls the ‘Mutated Modest Witness’ who is capable of an embodied form of knowledge.</p>
<p>In this way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959353511415969">Haraway (1997)</xref> does not completely abandon the <italic>Modest Witness</italic>; rather, because of her faith in science (‘I sign into this religion’ she says to us in her text <italic>Crittercam</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959353511415969">Haraway, 2007</xref>: 185), she suggests the ‘Mutated Modest Witness’ with a viewpoint that is situated and has not only the capacity to reflect, but also to diffract knowledge. Her proposal is a critique of illustrated science, which paradoxically is located within the same tradition, indicating a mutation in its path. This is why Haraway can affirm her faith in science; it is also why her mestiza is accompanied by the Hubble telescope.</p>
<p>The fragment quoted initially seems to indicate that she finds material for this new ‘Mutated Modest Witness’ in the new Mestiza proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa (2007)</xref> in <italic>Borderlands/La Frontera</italic>. Nevertheless, the fragment also clearly indicates that the line separating Randolph's mestiza and Anzaldúa’s mestiza is not a tenuous one: ‘The Mestiza Cosmica connects the snake and the telescope of Hubble, while Anzaldúa's mestiza identifies with the snake and with the state of conscience called Coatlicue, proposed in the mystical tradition, within the knowledge of the indigenous Mexican cultures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959353511415969">Haraway, 1997</xref>: 37). This is why Anzaldúa’s mestiza necessarily supports an eclectic altar, perhaps distinguishing her destiny from that of the Mestiza Cosmica. The two mestizas are, however, sisters and it could be concluded that Haraway finds in the one (Anzaldúa’s mestiza) the inspiration for the other.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0959353511415969"><title>Two forms of knowledge</title>
<p>This differentiation makes it possible to suggest that the two mestizas, although sisters, respond to different traditions and trajectories of knowledge. Haraway’s mestiza continues in the scientific tradition (and it is possible to clearly locate her in the Critical Studies of Science), whilst Anzaldúa’s mestiza, in spite of giving inspiration to some elements of the Mestiza Cosmica, cannot be located within this tradition<sup>2</sup> and is better placed in what the post-colonial Latin American theorists have called ‘border thinking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353511415969">Mignolo, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In the introduction of the Spanish edition of his book <italic>Local Histories, Global Designs</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353511415969">Mignolo (2003)</xref> proposes the denomination of <italic>gnosis</italic> to capture a wider range of forms of knowledge which philosophy and epistemology contributed to casting away (in this he is following the ideas of the African theorist Valentin Y. Mundimbe [1988]). The origin of the word gnosis refers to knowledge in general, without specifying the difference between <italic>doxa</italic> (common opinion) and <italic>episteme</italic> (formalized knowledge). Mignolo proposes a ‘border gnosis’ or ‘border thinking’ as a kind of knowledge from a subaltern perspective. This implies a ‘knowledge otherwise’, a knowledge conceived from the borders of the modern /colonial world system. Hence ‘border thinking’ could be a powerful and emergent form of comprehension or episteme that absorbs hegemonic forms of knowledge from the perspective of the subaltern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353511415969">Mignolo, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>As subaltern, queer and someone of the third world in the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa (2007)</xref> recognizes herself as being multiply situated, complex, contradictory and <italic>many in one</italic>. This is why she chooses to narrate her experience from categories that are not part of the dominant Anglo-Saxon culture, where she is contradictorily immersed. Thus, she constructs new histories and a new and powerful narrative that proposes not only another history, but also another subjectivity, one unimaginable from ‘the advantageous position of the Cyclops-type self-satisfied eye of the dominant subject’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959353511415969">Haraway, 1997</xref>: 9).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa’s (2007)</xref> theory arises then from her own history and connects with the emergence of new spaces, of new narratives of refuges, which she constructs by weaving her histories with the subaltern knowledge of the indigenous Mexican people. In considering fragments of the texts of Anzaldúa, I will present particular points where border feminism involves epistemological ruptures and challenges for scientific knowledge (including their mutated versions) as well as for psychology, a clear inheritor of this form of thought. In doing this, I would like to bring out some of the possible queries that could be posed in this sense from the work of Anzaldúa.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0959353511415969"><title>Knowledge in the borderlands</title><disp-quote>
<p>But I, like other queer people, am two in one body, both male and female. I am the embodiment of the ‘hieros gamos’, the coming together of opposite qualities within. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa, 2007</xref>: 41)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Anzaldúa inhabits multiple identities. Her territory: Borderland (La Frontera) is a physical, geographical place of uncertainty.<sup>3</sup> This place opens the possibility of a new psychological, sexual and spiritual politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353511415969">Perez, 2005</xref>) that provides the space for new forms of knowledge. Like a mestiza in multiple senses,<sup>4</sup> Anzaldúa lives in this border ground, a place of mixture that is not only racial:<disp-quote>
<p>A borderland is a vague and undetermined place created by the emotional residue of an unnatural boundary. It is a constant state of transition. The prohibited and forbidden are its inhabitants. <italic>Los atravesados</italic> live here: the squint eye, the perverse, the queer, the troublesome, the mongrel, the mulato, the half-breed, the half dead; in short those who cross over, pass over, or go through the confines of the ‘normal’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa, 2007</xref>: 25)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Borderlands are a place of instability. In contrast to the canons of western thought, which look for the certainties of differentiations and which construct their own imagery from identities based on these differentiations, the borderland appears as undetermined, a place which is constantly in transition and which produces a feeling of unease. In this way, if illustrated science generates strong and established binary logics, subversion arises with the promise of the territories of transition and borders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959353511415969">Lugones (1994)</xref> sees the figure of the mestiza as one of resistance, capable of inhabiting these borderlands, since she herself is unclassifiable.</p>
<p>In different texts, Anzaldúa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353511415969">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353511415969">2009</xref>) suggests a form of knowledge which challenges the rational dichotomy of the modern/colonial world system and makes the way to the borderland possible. Her elaborations, therefore, have a different point of demarcation working from an undetermined area between feminist critique, theory and the narrative. Her writing also departs from many of the traditional forms of writing in the disciplines of the West. For Anzaldúa, writing must be <italic>alive</italic> and must produce transformations. When she writes, she goes to narratives which rearticulate and recreate indigenous traditions, recovering the voice of another type of knowledge; in her writing the word jumps, hurts and heals; it is, in fact, a spellbinding word.</p>
<p>This knowledge has a different voice, an intonation and a melody that speaks, and is impossible to find in the voice of the <italic>Modest Witness</italic>; Anzaldúa’s voice is alive and her writing has a force, implying a trip and a transition.<sup>5</sup> In this way it is impossible to separate words such as ‘knowledge’, ‘charm’ and ‘transformation’ in her work:<disp-quote>
<p>I look at my fingers, see plumes growing there. From the fingers my feathers, black and red ink drips across the page. Escribo con la tinta de mi sangre. I write in red. Ink. Intimately knowing the smooth touch of article, its speechlessness, before I spill myself on the insides of trees. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa, 2007</xref>: 93)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the following fragment written in Spanish,<sup>6</sup> Anzaldúa considers writing as a muse. It is a muse that tortures and awakens self-consciousness:<disp-quote>
<p>Musa bruja, venga. Cúbrese con una sábana y espante mis demonios que a rempujones y a cachetadas me roban la pluma, me rompen el sueño. Musa, ¡misericordia!</p>
<p>Oígame, musa bruja ¿Por qué huye uste´ en mi cara? Su grito me desarrolla de mi caracola, me sacude el alma. Vieja quítese de aquí con sus manos de navaja. Ya no me despedaze mi cara. Vaya con sus pinches uñas que me desgarran de los ojos hasta los talones. Váyese a la tiznada. Que no me coman, le digo. Que no me coman sus nueve dedos caníbales.</p>
<p>Hija negra de la noche, carnala ¿Por qué me sacas las tripas, por qué cardas mis entrañas?</p>
<p>Este hilvanando palabras con tripas me está matando. Jija de la noche ¡vete a la chingada! (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa, 2007</xref>: 72)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>After considering border identities, border knowledge and forms of writing which come from those borders, it is possible to indicate some of the challenges to traditional forms of scientific knowledge that arise from the work of Anzaldúa. Firstly, it should be recognized that her work operates from a different place from that which characterizes scientific reason. This new point of departure makes possible a way of thinking about forms of knowledge that cannot be separated from the experience of transition and transformation. This is why it is a matter of thinking through categories such as mestiza which do not fit the logics of dichotomy.</p>
<p>The journey through reading/writing is another key element in the work of Anzaldúa. The experience of her writing and our reading therefore becomes transformative, presenting the possibility of re-writing one’s own history.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0959353511415969"><title><italic>Autohistory-theory</italic>: A path from our own subjectivity to the social world</title><disp-quote>
<p>The struggle is inner: Chicano, Indio, American Indian, mojado, Mexicano, immigrant Latino, Anglo in power, working class Anglo, Black, Asian – our psyches resemble the border towns and are populated by the same people. The struggle has always been inner and is played out in outer terrains. Awareness of our situation must come before inner changes, which in turn come before changes in society. Nothing happens in the real world unless it first happens in the images in our heads. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa, 2007</xref>: 109)</p></disp-quote>
<p>The category of <italic>autohistory-theory</italic> brings together some of the elements of what might be thought of as the methodological proposal of Anzaldúa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959353511415969">Keating, 2005</xref>), a proposal that comes through an exercise with our own subjectivity. Subjectivity then emerges as a central element, articulating the possibilities of social transformation. It is a matter of invoking one’s own history (‘the struggle is inner’) and recreating larger histories (‘played out in outer terrains’), since only in this way is there a possibility of social transformation (‘nothing happens in the world unless it first happens in the images in our heads’). In this way our own psychology and desires are the source of transformation.</p>
<p>It is perhaps from this point that the multiple interpellations that Anzaldúa’s work make to psychology become clearer. Her ideas and images speak about a subjective world clearly intersecting with the social. However, as border knowledge, we would only find elements close to her proposals in discussions that are also on the borders of the discipline and that constitute a critique of modern thought (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353511415969">Enriquez, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959353511415969">Owusu-Bempah and Howitt, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>It is therefore possible to say that in at least three ways the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa (2007)</xref> demonstrates differences as regards modern thought (as well as scientific psychology). The first one is related to the rebellious opposition to binaries that is made clear by the idea of borderlands; the second one aims to eliminate the distinction between the knower and the known, positing instead a vision of our own subjectivity as the center of knowledge; and finally the third one rejects (scientific) control, and rather appeals to the experiences of uncertainty, transition and crisis.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0959353511415969"><title>Interpellating Latin American feminism</title>
<p>Within Latin American feminism, Anzaldúa’s proposals have stimulated a Mestiza feminism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959353511415969">Saldivar-Hull, 2000</xref>), which allows a movement from identity to post-identity politics, thus challenging essentialist visions of women. In this way, it opens a space for the recognition of minority subjectivities.</p>
<p>The question of autonomy and identity considered by many to be a feature of Latin-American feminism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959353511415969">Alvarez et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959353511415969">Curiel, 2009</xref>), is challenged by Gloria Anzaldúa’s category ‘La Frontera’ (Borderland) which opens a space for a non-essentialist epistemology. This is an epistemology of frontier capable of thinking identity conflicts and contradictions in many creative ways:<disp-quote>
<p>The psychological borderlands, the sexual borderlands and the spiritual borderlands are not particular to the Southwest. In fact, the Borderlands are physically present wherever two or more cultures edge each other, where people of different races occupy the same territory, where under, lower, middle and upper classes touch, where the space between two individuals shrinks with intimacy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa, 2007</xref>: 27)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The displacement from an essentialist way of thinking to a non-essentialist perspective has been signaled as a movement to decolonize feminism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959353511415969">Suárez Navas and Hernández, 2008</xref>). This movement contributes to a more complex feminism and to the constitution of an always mobile feminine subject.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0959353511415969"><title>Stories as a way of healing</title>
<p>Finally, I would like to use some examples of how, in Anzaldúa’s work, narrative interweaves with theory and experience. In the third part of <italic>Borderlands/La Frontera</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa (2007)</xref> recovers the figure of Coyolxauhqui, the ancient Aztec goddess, who was cut into pieces due to the rivalries with her brother. The big stone that represents Coyolxauhqui was found accidentally in an excavation near the Templo Mayor in 1978. In different writings, Anzaldúa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353511415969">2009</xref>) invokes the memory of this mutilated body, which she considers a metaphor for everything that has been broken in the mestiza, an inner state that must be overcome to create self-awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959353511415969">Kattau, 2007</xref>). Anzaldúa proposes that the reconstruction of the dismembered goddess is synonymous with change and the return of exiled emotions, creating the possibility of healing. In this sense, for Anzaldúa, the fact that the stone was found symbolizes a kind of return of all the personal and social fragmentations we experience, and indicates a means of transition for our own healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Anazaldúa invokes Coyolxauhqui as a way of explaining her feelings. In the following excerpt Anzaldúa calls to the fragmented goddess during the terrorist attack on New York (and the US Pentagon) on September 11, 2001:<disp-quote>
<p>The day the towers fell, me sentí como [I felt like] Coyolxauhqui, la luna [the moon]. Algo me agarró y me sacudió [Something grabbed me and shook me], frightening la sombra [soul] out of my body. I fell in pieces into that pitch-black brooding place. Each violent image of the towers collapsing, transmitted live all over the world then repeated a thousand times on TV, sucked the breath out of me, each image etched on my mind’s eye. Wounded, I fell into shock, cold and clammy. The moment fragmented me, dissociating me from myself. Arresting every vital organ in me, it would not release me. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa, 2009</xref>: 218)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In a similar vein, Anzaldúa appeals to the figure of Coyolxauhqui to speak about the fragmentations that must be healed, and Coatlicue, the mother of Coyolxauhqui, illustrates this healing. Her proposal again appears as a narrative: Coatlicue, the serpent goddess of the darkness and the light, contains all contradictions. She reigned before the Aztecs came to be a military and warlike bureaucracy, at which point she was forgotten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa, 2007</xref>). Because of her misfortunes, Coatlicue can still help us to find the way, to re-compose what we have lost:<disp-quote>
<p>Coatlicue depicts the contradictory. In her figure, all the symbols important to the religion and philosophy of the Aztecs are integrated. Like Medusa, the Gorgon, she is a symbol of the fusion of opposites: the eagle and the serpent, heaven and the underworld, life and death, mobility and immobility, beauty and horror … when we are not living up to our potentialities and thereby impeding the evolution of the soul or worse. Coatlicue the Earth opens and plunges us into her maw, devours us. By keeping the conscious mind occupied or immobile, the germination work takes place in the deep, dark earth of the unconscious. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353511415969">Anzaldúa, 2007</xref>: 69)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In following Anzaldúa in the exercise of constructing new narratives, it is possible to wonder if in these times humankind is inhabiting the black ground in which Coatlicue, goddess of multiplicity, keeps her detainees immobile until they successfully integrate, thus bringing opposites closer. As the western mind is busy and immobilized, perhaps something is germinating in the dark, deep ground of the unconscious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959353511415969">Aigner-Varoz, 2000</xref>). Anzaldúa speaks to us about a knowledge that refuses to disappear. This knowledge is in a battle to the death with other forms of knowledge that have lost the way to the borderlands.</p></sec>

<fn><label>1</label><p>This concurred with the arguments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959353511415969">Shapin and Schaffer (1985)</xref> in their studies on Robert Boyle, a scientist of the 17th century who was considered one of the founding fathers of experimental science (identified in the work as a ‘modest witness’).</p></fn>
<fn><label>2</label><p>Discussing this issue, Paula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959353511415969">Moya (1997)</xref> makes a critique of postmodern feminism. To Moya, postmodern feminism has generated a way of considering the differences that paradoxically eliminate such differences. I am following this critique when I insist on the distinction between the Mestiza Cosmica and Anzaldúa’s mestiza.</p></fn>
<fn><label>3</label><p>Recovering a Nahuatl word, Anzaldúa calls the borderlands: ‘Nepantla’, the spaces in between worlds. Her proposal is that transformation occurs in these places which are unstable and unpredictable, producing fear and anxiety.</p></fn>
<fn><label>4</label><p>Mestiza is a word that designates a person of mixed race, in Latin America the offspring of a Spanish American and an American Indian. In Anzaldúa’s work the word could be used as a metaphor of different kinds of mixtures.</p></fn>
<fn><label>5</label><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959353511415969">Keating (2005)</xref> proposes that Anzaldúa shapes her theory as transformative writing or ‘Shaman aesthetics’; her stories (prose and poetry) have the ability to transform the storyteller and the listener into someone or something else.</p></fn>
<fn><label>6</label><p><italic>Boderlands/La Frontera</italic> is written in three languages: Nahualt, Spanish and English. This is a gesture that contests the dominance of English as the main academic language.</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
