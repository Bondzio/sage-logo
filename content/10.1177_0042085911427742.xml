<abstract>
<p>The George Washington University’s Urban Initiative Professional Development School (UI-PDS) partnership used interviews, surveys, focus groups, and observations to research its effectiveness in preparing urban educators. The research conducted with UI-PDS preservice teachers and first year graduates, indicates they were well equipped to meet the challenges of urban teaching. They plan and implement lessons relative to students’ diverse backgrounds, interests, and skills while engage in student advocacy and collaboration. This research also attempted to unravel the components of the UI-PDS program that contributed to these outcomes. Identified components included daily teaching responsibilities, on-site support, collaborative practice, and participant’s personal attributes.</p>

<title>Teacher Preparation for Urban Schools</title>
<p>Literature on urban teacher preparation acknowledges that when it comes to preparing new teachers, there is a cultural and socioeconomic mismatch between the majority of teachers in training and their future urban students. Most urban preservice teachers are White female young adults from middle class backgrounds, whereas their students are typically, culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) and from low socioeconomic status backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085911427742">Grant &amp; Gillette, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911427742">Sleeter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085911427742">Wiggins, Follo, &amp; Eberly, 2007</xref>). Research on preservice urban teachers has indicated that many preservice teachers experiencing this mismatch demonstrate “culture shock” or “cultural disequilibrium” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085911427742">Bergeron, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911427742">Foote &amp; Cook-Cottone, 2004</xref>) and may not possess the cultural competence to effectively teach diverse students. There is a significant body of preservice urban teacher preparation literature revealing that many preservice teachers have negative preconceived notions about urban students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085911427742">Groulx, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085911427742">Leland &amp; Harste, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085911427742">Zygmunt-Fillwalk &amp; Leitze, 2006</xref>; see also literature review in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911427742">Sleeter, 2001</xref>). Commonly held beliefs include ideas such as students do not desire to learn or come from homes that do not care about education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085911427742">Groulx, 2001</xref>). Much of the prior research on preparing urban teachers discusses the importance of preservice teachers’ dispositions on whether they can be effective urban teachers. Research related to whether teacher preparation programs can influence preservice teachers’ dispositions is mixed. Researchers, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085911427742">Haberman (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427742">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085911427742">1996)</xref>, have found that preservice teachers who already possess positive dispositions toward working with CLD students from low socioeconomic status backgrounds are more capable at addressing the academic needs of CLD populations than preservice teachers who do not. However, other researchers have shown that given both preservice coursework and a supported and sustained field experience, preservice teachers who came to education with negative dispositions can and do modify their dispositions toward a more positive perspective on urban CLD students, their families, and their schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085911427742">Leland &amp; Harste, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085911427742">Wiggins, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085911427742">Zygmunt-Fillwalk &amp; Leitze, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although existing research examining urban preservice teacher dispositions has discussed a critical aspect of preparing urban educators, little existing research has examined the characteristics of urban teacher preparation programs that both support positive dispositions and provide preservice educators with the specialized skills to remain positive, work toward change, and effectively educate urban students. Supporting positive dispositions is a necessary aspect of urban teacher preparation; however, teacher development in this area cannot overshadow the specialized skills urban teachers need to effectively teach and work in urban schools. These two aspects of urban teacher preparation, dispositions and skills, are not divorced of one another, and effective urban teacher preparation must develop and support preservice teachers’ progress in both arenas.</p>
<p>This article outlines the program characteristics of an urban preservice preparation program to examine program characteristics that were most effective toward providing urban preservice teachers with the dispositions and skills needed to be urban educators. Both quantitative and qualitative data from preservice teachers (interns), first year program graduates (novices), and mentor teachers were analyzed for two purposes. One goal of this research was to identify which program characteristics provided intern and novice teachers with the most relevant experiences and produced the most personal and professional growth toward becoming effective urban educators. The second goal of this research was to present a picture of the intern and novice dispositions and skills evidenced in this growth; in other words, how did intern and novice teachers operationalize and internalize these experiences?</p>

<title>Professional Development Schools in the Age of Accountability</title>
<p>The professional development school (PDS) model, an innovation of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085911427742">Holmes Group (1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085911427742">1990)</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911427742">Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy (1986)</xref>, has been used as a model for simultaneous reform of teacher education and public schools based on school-university partnerships. Although collaboration is the driving force behind the model, the reform efforts are predicated on preparing new teachers to become teacher leaders within the public school system. There are now more than a thousand PDS partnerships within the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911427742">Abdal-Haqq, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085911427742">Schwartz, 2003</xref>). However, rigorous research on their effectiveness as well as their impact has been slow to emerge.</p>
<p>In 2001, The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) along with representatives of various constituencies of PDSs issued a set of standards to guide PDS accountability measures (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncate.org">www.ncate.org</ext-link>). With the proliferation of various PDSs, the NCATE standards provide common guidelines to direct PDS development, evaluation, and accountability.</p>
<p>Guided by NCATE Standard II: Accountability and Quality Assurance, we conducted research during one school year to examine the effectiveness of the UI-PDS. We investigated characteristics and practices of 1st-year novice and preservice intern teachers prepared in the UI-PDS as well as external variables within the PDS experience that influenced their preparation. The following research question guided our study:</p>

<title>The UI-PDS</title>
<p>The UI-PDS partnered The George Washington University’s (GWU) Graduate School of Education and Human Development with the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS). The UI-PDS was established in 1997 with Cardozo Senior High School (Cardozo) for the purposes of preparing highly qualified teachers to work in DCPS, an urban school district with historically low literacy levels and high poverty. The urban initiative (UI) teacher preparation program led to a 2-year master’s degree leading to dual licensure in a content area and special education. UI’s mission was to develop confident teachers skilled to take on the educational needs of adolescents with diverse learning strengths and needs within a social justice framework. The UI-PDS was a community of learners comprised of faculty, staff, graduate preservice teachers, alumni, and school personnel preparing teachers within the context of the day-to-day real life of urban secondary schools. The UI-PDS design features are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042085911427742">Figure 1</xref>. The partnership remained constant until the spring of 2006 when it ended due to funding constraints.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0042085911427742-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The UI was staffed by a full-time project director and part-time literacy coordinator. Other active members of the UI-PDS were two GWU faculty members, research assistants, Cardozo’s principal, and ninth grade team coordinator and teachers. We focused our recruitment on individuals who desired to work in DCPS. Using on-site interviews at Cardozo, we administered the Haberman Teacher Selection Interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427742">Haberman, 1995</xref>) to screen for dispositions favorable to teaching students living in poverty. We further identified candidates with already demonstrated dispositions toward or experiences in social justice.</p>
<p>After the first year of part-time evening course work, interns began their full-time internship at Cardozo. One of the unique features of this PDS was the use of a designated large classroom, called the Literacy Lab, situated within the ninth grade hall. The Literacy Lab was arranged to accommodate a traditional teaching area, a bank of 24 computers, and a flexible workspace that accommodated UI staff and interns. The Literacy Lab was a lively place that served as the hub for all UI-PDS work. The Literacy Lab often hosted Cardozo students and teachers before and after school and during the day when literacy classes were not in session. On any given day it was common to have the Literacy Lab used by interns coteaching a literacy class, a Cardozo teacher bringing in a class to use the computers, UI staff observing the literacy class for feedback, and other interns planning their lessons. The Literacy Lab was also where all UI staff reported for work every day, facilitating access to interns for continuous mentoring as they negotiated the complexities of learning to teach. Interns were able to work through issues as they happened, meeting formally and informally, to engage in instantaneous problem solving and reflective activities.</p>
<p>In response to Cardozo’s adolescent literacy needs, UI staff designed and developed a high school literacy curriculum, cotaught by interns, and supervised daily by the literacy coordinator. Being responsible for teaching the literacy class on a daily basis allowed interns to truly take on the role of the teacher. Their work was supported with daily supervision, weekly seminars, program coursework, and informal mentoring. Along with coteaching a literacy class, interns were responsible for teaching a content area and special education class with a Cardozo mentor teacher. Working with a Cardozo teacher fostered intern learning about the Individualized Education Program (IEP) process for special education students, record-keeping duties, and other professional teacher responsibilities.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of PDSs has been studied from various viewpoints. Studies comparing teachers prepared in a PDS with those prepared in a more traditional model support using a PDS approach in teacher preparation programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085911427742">Gill &amp; Hove, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911427742">Houston, Hollis, Clay, Ligons, &amp; Roff, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911427742">Mantle-Bromley, Gould, McWhorter, &amp; Whaley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085911427742">Neubert &amp; Binko, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085911427742">Sandholtz &amp; Wasserman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085911427742">Walling &amp; Lewis, 2000</xref>). Other studies have sought to verify benefits of the PDS model. The benefits discussed include greater confidence in teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911427742">Blocker &amp; Mantle-Bromley, 1997</xref>) better linkage between theory and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085911427742">Sim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085911427742">Van Zandt, 1998</xref>) and increased collegiality and collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085911427742">Grossman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085911427742">Woloszyk, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>In relation to specific teaching competences, studies support the merits of teachers prepared in a PDS as being more student centered, better at self-analysis and reflection, and more competent in some aspects of instruction, management, and assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911427742">Castle, Fox, &amp; Souder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911427742">Harris &amp; van Tassell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042085911427742">Reinhartz &amp; Stetson, 1999</xref>). However, there remains a lack of research that looks at the “connections among teacher characteristics, teacher education, teacher learning, and teaching practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042085911427742">Zeichner, 2005</xref>, p. 742). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085911427742">Mantle-Bromley (2002)</xref> discusses this issue in current PDS literature stating,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>More common are what Chen (1990) calls black box evaluations, where inputs and outputs are examined “without concern for the transformation processes in the middle. Such simple input/output evaluations may provide a gross assessment of whether or not a program works but fail to identify the underlying causal mechanisms that generate the treatment effects, thus failing to pinpoint the deficiencies of the program for future program improvement or development.” (p. 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>PDS programs are typically described in the literature along with their accompanying outcomes, but there is little attempt to discover what causal relationships exist between the two. There is a lack of research that looks at what is going on inside the PDS partnership that leads to outcomes found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085911427742">Cochran-Smith &amp; Zeichner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042085911427742">Teitel, 2003</xref>). This study was one small step in addressing that issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0042085911427742">
<title>Contextual Teaching and Learning as a Guiding Theory</title>
<p>Contextual teaching and learning (CT&amp;L) grounded the UI-PDS work and provided the theoretical framework for our research. CT&amp;L is a theoretical framework that unifies a constellation of education theories expressed as six attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085911427742">Sears &amp; Hersh, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085911427742">Sears and Hersh (1998)</xref> define CT&amp;L as,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Teaching that enables learning in which pupils employ their academic understandings and abilities in a variety of in-school and out-of-school contexts to solve simulated or real world problems, both alone and in various group structures. . . . Learning through and in these kinds of activities is commonly characterized as problem-based, self-regulated, occurring in a variety of contexts, involving teams or learning groups, and responsive to a host of diverse needs and interests. (p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>CT&amp;L incorporates multiple teaching and learning theories. It is a useful framework for urban teacher education because it emphasizes the situated, social, and distributed nature of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085911427742">Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989</xref>) as well as constructivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085911427742">Simon, 1995</xref>), self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085911427742">Bandura, 1986</xref>), problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085911427742">Albanese &amp; Mitchell, 1993</xref>), and school-to-career theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085911427742">Hamilton, 1990</xref>). In the UI-PDS the translation of CT&amp;L into practice involved attending to the six attributes. These CT&amp;L attributes are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042085911427742">Table 1</xref> and are aligned with a list of UI-PDS program features to illustrate the ways in which CT&amp;L was embedded in the UI-PDS.</p>

<title>Sample Selection</title>
<p>Typically the UI-PDS consisted of a small cohort of 5 to 11 interns per year. There were 10 total participants in this study, 5 intern and 5 novice teachers. The majority was female (7/10). Participants ranged in age from their mid-late twenties to early thirties with an average age of 27. Five were White, 3 were African Americans, and 2 were Asian Americans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0042085911427742">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All interviews and focus groups were conducted, recorded and transcribed by individuals external to the UI-PDS. A research team composed of the UI-PDS project director, GWU faculty advisor, and a GWU graduate research assistant (one of the data collectors) analyzed the data. After the first round of data collection, conceptual categories were created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085911427742">Merriam, 1998</xref>), and we determined that data could be analyzed using the four Pathwise<sup>®</sup> Observation System domains (planning, learning environment, teaching, and professionalism) with specific CT&amp;L attributes associated with each domain. The result of this coding was the creation of a fifth domain, focused on leadership and social justice, to address responses that were specifically associated with unique features of UI-PDS.</p>
<p>Descriptive matrixes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427742">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>) were used to generate explanations and interpretations found in the data. The research team met regularly to share findings, to verify coding within domains, and to identify and analyze themes crossing all domains. Matrix displays were developed to examine the relationships between program features and descriptions of novice and intern teacher characteristics. Finally, the research team, with the assistance of an additional GWU research assistant, used axial coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085911427742">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>) to reassemble data and describe emerging phenomena more concisely. The extensive collection of data sources, including quantitative and qualitative data, allowed for triangulation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section10-0042085911427742">
<title>Opening the Black Box</title>
<p>Our research question focused on identifying the teaching competencies that the UI-PDS interns and novices exhibited. In other words, we wanted to know after participation in the UI-PDS teacher preparation program what knowledge, skills, and dispositions do interns and novices bring to the teaching profession? We also wanted to hold the UI-PDS accountable for these outcomes, and therefore we needed a better understanding of UI-PDS features that contributed to these results. In an attempt to crack open Chen’s black box we designed the intern and novice self-assessment survey, which asked participants to select two components they felt were most helpful in the development of the skills within the five identified domains. The survey design corresponded to the Pathwise<sup>®</sup> and to the CT&amp;L attributes of the UI-PDS. The results of the survey along with data from intern, novice, and mentor interviews and focus groups assisted us in attempting to unravel which components of the UI-PDS experience contributed to intern and novice teacher learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0042085911427742">
<title>Organizing Content Knowledge for Student Learning</title>
<p>We examined novice and intern teachers’ experiences with planning instruction. Lesson planning was a consistent daily expectation during the internship year. UI-PDS interns were held accountable for producing weekly and daily plans for the literacy class and for planning with their mentor teachers in content classes. Staff, intern, and novice teachers all identified the daily experience of teaching literacy as the most influential factor in developing this ability. Intern and novice teachers also identified their personal attributes such as drawing on their personal histories and prior school and previous work/volunteer experiences as additionally important contributors to their ability to plan.</p>
<sec id="section12-0042085911427742">
<title>Differences between novices and interns</title>
<p>There was a marked difference in novice and intern experiences during the fall semester. All interns expressed frustration with the complexities of planning lessons that met students’ interests and needs, were appropriate for the 86-min class period and that yielded productive student outcomes. Lesson planning was portrayed as “extremely rigorous,” “frustrating,” and “time consuming” with interns expressing feelings of “being abused.” In addition, interns showed the greatest need in developing appropriate evaluation strategies for their students based on analyzing individual student performance.</p>
<p>Novice teachers reported feeling confident in their ability to plan. Their major concern was planning for students with the lowest reading levels. Novice teachers consistently referred to the range of literacy levels they were encountering. They reported feeling comfortable preparing lessons for students who were reading above a primary level (i.e., 4th grade and above) but struggled to plan for students with basic word identification needs. All novice teachers indicated this as a major planning issue whether they were teaching developmental reading or general education classes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0042085911427742">
<title>Commonalities between novices and interns</title>
<p>Both groups of teachers reported that by the end of the UI-PDS internship they felt confident in their ability to plan lessons. One intern described the “pain” and “gain” experience:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was hard at the beginning, to turn in a set of objectives, and then get rejected, and turn another set in, and get rejected again. The process for one hour of instruction, it could take three days to plan. But now, I’m very competent in my ability to do that, and I know that next year, it’s not going to be a difficulty . . . . I think that is a very valuable skill that I have developed over the course of the year.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The positive and productive developmental trajectory of lesson planning was one of the strongest themes across data sources.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0042085911427742">
<title>Creating an Environment for Student Learning</title>
<p>We examined interns and novice teachers’ ability to attend to social and emotional aspects of learning, which emphasizes types of interactions that occur between teachers and students. The most influential factor identified across novice and intern teachers were their personal attributes, most specifically drawing on their culture, ethnicity, identity, beliefs, and important life events that they brought to the program. The daily experience of coteaching literacy was also a highly influential factor in the development of their ability to develop and maintain positive student–teacher interactions.</p>
<sec id="section15-0042085911427742">
<title>Differences between novices and interns</title>
<p>As would be expected, novice teachers demonstrated a higher level of mastery of classroom management during observations than intern teachers. Using Pathwise<sup>®</sup>, all novice teachers were assessed at the mastery level, whereas intern teachers’ assessments averaged at the acceptable level. Despite their competence, novices reported grappling with schoolwide issues that affected their ability to manage their classes. All novices reported coping with inconsistent school disciplinary policies that ranged from lax to overly punitive. Some novice teachers also were working with students who demonstrated serious emotional and behavioral issues without support services to address those students’ needs. Novice teachers assessed their UI-PDS and university course preparation as inadequate in teaching them how to work with students who consistently presented challenging behaviors.</p>
<p>In contrast, interns’ issues with behavior management were more focused on finding a common ground with their coteacher in the literacy class and becoming comfortable with developing a ‘behavior management style.’ Findings from this domain suggested that Cardozo, the UI-PDS site, had more consistent disciplinary procedures than the schools where the novice teachers were employed. This was a benefit during the intern year but became a new challenge for the novice teachers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0042085911427742">
<title>Commonalities between novices and interns</title>
<p>The most consistent theme across all data sources was intern and novice teachers’ commitment to developing relationships with their students. Each teacher clearly wanted to know his or her students for two purposes: to be instructionally effective and to be a supportive and positive adult in students’ lives. Throughout the data, there was a noticeable lack of negative descriptions of students with many examples of actions each teacher had taken to get to know his or her students. The quotes below were typical statements:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My biggest strengths are my ability to relate and deal with the students, like deal with their issues and their day-to-day problems . . . the relationships I form with them . . . being able to get through to a lot of students that have difficulties with many other teachers. (Novice Teacher)</p>
<p>The classroom I have now all the students, I know them pretty well and what’s going on at home [and] their different situations that they have to tend to. (Intern Teacher)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0042085911427742">
<title>Teaching for Content and Literacy Development</title>
<p>Through this domain we investigated factors that support the act of teaching with student learning as a goal. Both interns and novices, overwhelmingly, identified being responsible for teaching the literacy class and on-site support as the two most influential elements in learning how to teach in ways that support students’ needs.</p>
<sec id="section18-0042085911427742">
<title>Differences between novices and interns</title>
<p>Pathwise<sup>®</sup> scores indicated that all novice teachers demonstrated acceptable to mastery performance in this domain with all exhibiting mastery in making content comprehensible to students and using instructional time effectively. Interns’ area of greatest challenge was using instructional time effectively as indicated by Pathwise<sup>®</sup> scores and self-assessments. When asked about intern performance, mentor teachers were impressed with the interns’ willingness to listen, collaborate, and spend the time necessary to plan, but also thought that time management and closing lessons were skills that were still developing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0042085911427742">
<title>Commonalities between novices and interns</title>
<p>Intern and novice teachers clearly accepted that a variety of literacy levels was to be expected in urban schools and consistently demonstrated a problem solving approach to teaching students with diverse literacy needs. The novice and intern quotes below demonstrated their acceptance combined with persistent problem solving to determine ways to address higher order thinking while accommodating for a lack of basic skills:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I got to [School X], there were students who couldn’t read at all. So, that was a struggle . . . and that’s something that a teacher needs to be able to do. (Novice)</p>
<p>The [unit test] section in which the students made the least progress was the definitions. I have shown some weakness in the vocabulary building. I try to steer away from the students memorizing the definition, but it seems that I need to focus more on basing the instruction around the vocabulary. (Intern)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Every novice and intern felt inadequately prepared to effectively teach students with the lowest reading levels. Both intern and novice teachers expressed a strong desire to continue to develop a repertoire of literacy strategies, and saw this as a necessity for urban teaching. Mentor teachers also voiced the need for a teacher to be able to meet diverse student literacy needs. The mentor teachers felt they, as well as the students, learned and benefited from literacy strategies that the interns had used. One mentor explained, “right now, this intern I’m working with, she has a lot of different reading tactic and strategies, I mean, I’ve kept a list of them that I’ll attempt to go through.”</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0042085911427742">
<title>Teacher Professionalism</title>
<p>Teacher professionalism addresses aspects of teacher efficacy including the ability to reflect and collaborate. The overwhelming influence that interns and novices chose for this domain was their personal attributes. The next two most identified influences were either being responsible for teaching in the Literacy Lab or on-site support by the UI-PDS staff.</p>
<sec id="section21-0042085911427742">
<title>Differences between novices and interns</title>
<p>Pathwise<sup>®</sup> and self-assessments of novice and intern performance showed the greatest difference in this domain. The novice teachers demonstrated a strong ability to reflect and demonstrate a sense of efficacy. Although interns demonstrated growth in these areas throughout the year, as a group, their Pathwise<sup>®</sup> scores indicated that they were exiting the internship with reflection and efficacy in the low acceptable range.</p>
<p>Although both groups were able to describe types of collaborative relationships they had developed, novices demonstrated the ability to initiate collaboration across a greater diversity of individuals and situations. Novice examples included joining a literacy task force, teaching reading strategies to colleagues, copiloting a new reading curriculum, and providing workshops in special education assessment to colleagues. There were several comments during the novice focus group about how they developed their skill set for professionalism. One novice explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think the [UI-PDS] program really set me up to push my learning. I really understand in a lot of my relationships with the kids and [in] a lot of my teaching, to reflect on that and know that that just some of that phase that you go through isn’t smooth, it is part of teaching, and I don’t think that I would have had that if I hadn’t gone through such an intense program.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interns, like novices valued collaboration to develop their teacher professionalism. However, unlike novices, interns focused on preestablished collaboration experiences:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The main things we rely on are the teachers that are right down the hall, and they are all of the same mindset. It’s really good to be able to access them . . . .Oh, it’s been great. With lesson planning, for instance, a bunch of us sit down on Thursdays and we go over each other’s lessons. And that’s very helpful. And we get ideas from one another.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0042085911427742">
<title>Commonalities between novices and interns</title>
<p>There was strong evidence that interns and novices were both developing their teacher professionalism by reflecting on what they learned from their students’ performance. The practice of reflection was strongly tied to their ability to assess and analyze student performance. One novice’s comment exemplifies this reflective practice:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I looked at the textbook [tests], and I said, there is absolutely no way [students] would have a shot at this—with the textbook on an entirely different level from what the kids were at, so I made up my own.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interns were also able to analyze the teaching and learning cycle through student performance data. Their analysis recognized that individualized instruction, the positive relationship between writing and reading comprehension, pretest data to cluster students for instruction, and multiple methods for instruction improved student performance. Both novices and interns alike were developing their sense of efficacy based on their growing understanding of the relationship of assessment to instruction.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0042085911427742">
<title>Leadership, Special Education, and Social Justice</title>
<p>The research team developed this domain in response to themes that emerged during data analysis that indicated issues surrounding special education, leadership, and social justice were important to consider when describing intern and novice teachers. UI-PDS factors that interns, novices, and staff identified as most influential in developing teacher competence in these areas were the personal attributes of the interns and novices supported by their experience coteaching literacy and interning with a Cardozo teacher.</p>
<sec id="section24-0042085911427742">
<title>Differences between novices and interns</title>
<p>Although all interns worked with a special education mentor, they were sheltered from experiencing the diversity of daily demands faced by special educators. In contrast, all 5 novices taught special education classes and supported inclusion during their first year of teaching. They provided vivid descriptions of the day-to-day reality of working within a challenged special education system.</p>
<p>Novices struggled with barriers to inclusion due to limited resources and administrative support. Although novices were prepared to coteach, no such arrangement was available in their schools. In addition to their teaching duties, all had case management responsibilities which involved monitoring student progress and conducting individualized education plan (IEP) meetings for 13 to 23 students. Fulfilling their case management responsibilities within underresourced special education departments was a major stressor in fulfilling their responsibilities as first year teachers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0042085911427742">
<title>Commonalities between novices and interns</title>
<p>Both interns and novices demonstrated detailed knowledge of the systematic issues faced by the school system. They expressed frustration with the lack of functional systems either within schools or systemwide to support teachers in providing special education and support services. Knowing the reality of the system helped interns and novices focus on what they could accomplish within the purview of their classroom responsibilities. For example, one intern expressed how she approached working with one of her students:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I learned that working with special education students, that even though the [IEP] paperwork says that a student is not able to “do” or “master” a certain skill, that they can, in fact, pass those certain skills. And, so it was totally surprising to work with kids and find that, after giving them that one-on-one attention and dialoging with them, they just kind of open up to you. And, I don’t know if it’s because of the relationship that you build with them that makes them want to try harder and work with you, or if it’s the instruction that, you know, they’ve received in the past. So, I just found it—that you can go beyond what their IEP says.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0042085911427742">
<title>Differences between novices and interns</title>
<p>When directly asked about leadership neither novices nor interns considered this relevant to their present positions. Novices were reluctant to recognize their leadership actions and instead reported on coping with managing the challenges of first year teaching. A novice explains,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t really see myself as a leader yet. I take part in everything and do what I’m supposed to do. . . . I’m just trying to get my feet wet before I take on more than I can handle. So, I wouldn’t be stepping up to any type of leadership positions at this point in my career, just because I don’t think I’m ready. . . . I need to teach for a while before I feel like I can lead really well.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, all novices participated in leadership actions such as being responsible for researching and creating a bilingual special education program, serving as the special education department chair, directing literacy workshops, reformatting special education courses, working collaboratively with special education advocates, participating in leadership teams, and developing curriculum.</p>
<p>One novice, who advocated changing a student’s IEP from non-diploma track to the diploma track, provided a clear example of emerging leadership:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I had one kid this year who was certificate. He’s in the 9th grade. He’s 17 . . . He’s so bright and talented and has this amazing artistic ability. . . . We managed to get him into an art program next year. So, he’s going to do art and then continue to work for his diploma. So, we put him back on the diploma track. . . . That was my biggest victory [this year].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although novice teachers expressed reluctance to call themselves leaders, their actions unmistakably indicate emerging leadership. Novices’ commitment to continued leadership development is evident in their future desires to work toward implementing structures that would further their collaborative work with other teachers and families to improve school success for students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0042085911427742">
<title>Commonalities between novices and interns</title>
<p>Social justice was both embedded in UI courses and a thematic strand of the UI literacy curriculum. Although interns entered the program valuing social justice as indicated by their Haberman interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427742">Haberman, 1995</xref>) and prior experiences, both groups struggled with integrating social justice into the content of their teaching. UI staff continually worked with interns to help them develop lesson topics that were relevant to the issues faced by their students. One novice teacher expressed the challenge of incorporating social justice issues into the curriculum:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think that it [social justice] is very important. While I don’t always get to use those principles directly to my classes, because I teach the science class where it’s sometimes hard to bring those issues up— especially with Botany. But, I think because they had such a focus on that throughout the [UI] program, I think it helps me understand where the kids are coming from, and that the world of the students is very different from the world of my experience, and the experience of many of the other teachers in the school. And knowing that and using those principles, I can understand that, while a teacher may see it one way, a lot of times, the student is totally seeing it a different way, simply based on the cultural experiences that they’ve had.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although social justice was a mindset and a value that was explicitly embraced by UI interns and novices, translating social justice into the content of instruction was too complicated to be realized as an achieved skill set to influence the content of instruction. Instead social justice was enacted as a mindset that guided teachers work with students. The examples of emerging leadership and advocacy described above are further indicators of this mindset and its potential to influence students and other educators.</p>

<title>Competent Urban Teachers</title>
<p>Often high poverty urban schools reflect the lack of economic resources and low literacy levels inherent in the communities they serve. Without adequate preparation, the challenges of teaching in urban schools can be daunting and discouraging for new teachers. The results of our research indicate that the daily responsibility of teaching a literacy class with consistent on-site support was a powerful tool for preparing UI-PDS interns to be competent urban teachers. We provided much more that the typical student teaching internship. The literacy class allowed interns to practice in all areas of professional responsibility with the support of intense and rigorous daily supervision. Teaching time for the literacy class alone provided more than 200 hr of instructional time focused on developing students’ literacy skills. Our research indicated interns and novices simultaneously learned how to design curriculum and student centered instruction, teach and manage diverse sets of students, and advocate for students. One mentor described the Literacy Lab as a protective womb in which emerging teachers learned how to function in an urban school. Constant access to the project director, literacy coordinator, GWU faculty, and/or UI staff fostered a sophisticated understanding of meeting students’ needs in demanding situations.</p>
<p>Both interns and novices demonstrated knowledge of systemic issues faced by the school system. They approached students’ low literacy skills as a systemic problem related to inadequate previous instruction and urban social problems, and avoided placing blame for this discrepancy on their students. Instead, they described their students as capable learners and accepted the responsibility of improving students’ literacy skills. This disposition advances interns’ and novices’ practice toward the leadership end of the spectrum. Leadership is evident as they foster their students’ achievement, seek supports for their schools, and interact with their school communities. Thus, rigorous, relevant and contextualized teacher preparation can foster emerging leadership.</p>
<p>Another key reason interns and novices were successful in urban schools was due to who they were and what they brought to the classroom. Interns and novices entered the UI-PDS as advocates for social justice. Personal attributes and prior experiences affected why they chose to participate in a teacher preparation program focused on special education and literacy in urban schools, and why they continued to work toward equity in education. Social justice as a disposition influenced how interns and novices worked with students who had complicated personal lives and arrived in the classroom with diverse sets of skills and knowledge. Interns and novices connected with their students and school communities in ways that demonstrated a willingness to advocate and improve instructional supports, especially relative to special education service delivery. As new teachers they used social justice as a lens for viewing the school context and their relationships with students, but were not as sophisticated in integrating social justice into classroom curriculum and instruction.</p>
<p>The end-of-the-year profile of our interns indicates that they are very much beginning teachers who will need to continue to develop their knowledge and skills to be effective teachers. The composite picture of the novices provided a positive picture of how this development may appear. These first year teachers were able to demonstrate competence and confidence across the five domains used to organize this study. Yet even with their extensive preparation they met challenges not well addressed by the UI-PDS in the form of students with unmet support for their behavioral and emotional challenges, high school students with basic reading needs, and special education services that did not support inclusion or manageable case load responsibilities. How well each of these novices is able to address these potential burnout areas will be important influences in their ability to continue positive teacher development and their decision to remain with the school system.</p>

<sec id="section30-0042085911427742">
<title>Contextual Teaching &amp; Learning as a Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>This research affirms the incorporation of the CT&amp;L framework into teacher preparation. Participation in a yearlong full-time internship with daily on-site support embodying the CT&amp;L framework, facilitated interns’ and novices’ ability to translate theory to practice in urban schools. Adhering to CT&amp;L promoted authentic and transferable learning, as evidenced by novices’ expressed concerns that were student focused rather than survival focused. Both CT&amp;L and Pathwise<sup>®</sup> helped focus UI-PDS work on reflection, collaboration, authentic assessment, and the development of teacher efficacy. Our research documented interns’ struggle and progress in developing these important abilities, whereas novices’ clearly demonstrated that they were able to actively engage in them.</p>
<p>The intense year-long internship facilitated interns’ learning of how to be student centered, but at the same time fostered learning that well-planned instruction is also a central responsibility of a competent teacher. Through daily collaboration with university and Cardozo personnel, interns were able to work through their initial confusion and misconceptions in a reflective setting. These interactions promoted student centered learning about the teaching process and the development of a basic set of literacy strategies necessary to teach high school students with varying literacy skills. By living the life, interns were prepared to accept the challenges urban schools offer. They were well equipped with teaching and management practices and had a working knowledge of school resources that supported them and their students. As novices who, in effect, had already experienced their first year of teaching as interns, they were equipped to meet diverse learning needs of students and to take on the non-classroom responsibilities the profession of teaching demands.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0042085911427742">
<title>Evaluation Research</title>
<p>Research is always time and resource consuming. Attempting to conduct evaluative research, while doing the work required in a PDS, is overwhelming. Work within PDS contexts already demands 110%. Adding a research component to roles and responsibilities is a challenge that often goes unmet. Our research was supported by a yearlong grant allowing us to invest in outside researchers. Even with added support to conduct and transcribe interviews and focus groups, our research work became exhausting. Being able to continually engage in evaluative and accountability research requires dedicated time, resources, and reconfiguring roles and responsibilities that affect the PDS personnel and context.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0042085911427742">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Many of the limitations of this research are common to qualitative studies with small sample sizes. The small sample size limited generalizability to other PDS research, while provided “thick description” of the UI-PDS program. However, UI-PDS historically prepared under 10 interns per school year. Therefore, the research sample represents a historically normal sample size. Within the sample of novices, all worked as special educators even though three out of five held dual licenses in special education and a content area. Their roles as dually licensed teachers working as special educators is indicative of the great systemic need for special educators and not necessarily reflective of the teachers themselves. Three novices accepted teaching positions at the same high school, thus only three high schools, in addition to Cardozo, were represented in the study.</p>
<p>Similar to small sample size, researcher positionality was a benefit and a limitation. The majority of the research team consisted of faculty and staff of the UI program. However, no members of the UI community who directly advised or taught interns or novices were involved in interviewing individuals or conducting focus groups. Involved research team members, however, did play significant roles in interpreting data and drawing conclusions. Great care was practiced on the part of researchers to be aware of and limit interpretation bias.</p>
<p>We intended to use standardized test results from DCPS as a measure of student outcomes. However, DCPS did not test the majority of students in the 2004 to 2005 school year. A new superintendent brought in new content standards so standardized testing was postponed. We also planned to have input from mentors of novices.

<title>Next Steps</title>
<p>This study is an attempt to untangle the multiple factors involved in PDS accountability. If PDSs are to remain viable, then continued attention to the interactional influences of teacher qualities and components of the PDS experience are necessary. Whether PDS work can sustain the monetary costs and time commitment that accountability measures require remains to be seen. Calls for education reform and accountability will continue. Existing research shows that teacher preparation through PDSs represents a rigorous multilayered approach that works, but continued research is needed to study relationships between and among teacher characteristics, teacher education, teacher practices, and student achievement that identifies “causal mechanisms that generate the treatment effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085911427742">Mantle-Bromley, 2002</xref>, p. 18).</p>
