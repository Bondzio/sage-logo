<abstract>
<p>This article argues that <italic>Avatar</italic> (James Cameron, 2009) is a key moment in the development of stereoscopy, cinematography and animation. On both an aesthetic/formal level and in terms of its narrative, <italic>Avatar</italic> talks back to the origins of Victorian stereography, American cinematography and the racist discourses of ethnography and ecocide that ensued. Echoing 19th-century stereographs of ‘natives’ and their resource-rich environments, together with DW Griffith’s <italic>Birth of a Nation, Avatar</italic> also attempts to negotiate the atrocities of the past and to relate them to our present. But this negotiation also takes place on a more subtle ontological level: originating within the structures of a ‘cybernetic empire’, Victorian stereographic imaging is strikingly indicative of <italic>Avatar’s</italic> contemporary position as a work of culture in the age of cybernetic systems. It has been argued that monographic imaging reputedly replaced stereographic forms in popularity because the latter disrupted the scopic regimes of modernity by emphasizing the role of the body in the process of vision. <italic>Avatar’s</italic> computer generated composite form circumvents this equation, however; while photography may have sought to minimize viewers’ awareness of their own bodies in the process of beholding the indexical form, such a framework is questionable in an age of fabricated CG composites. If the origins of stereography predated photography, and if its founding image was hand drafted, then what originally appeared a technical footnote in the history of stereography now becomes a key factor in understanding <italic>Avatar</italic> and the new ‘cybernetic regime of modernity’.</p>

<p>Charles Wheatstone announced the invention of stereoscopy in 1838. However, Wheatstone’s hand-drawn images did not gain mass popular attention, and it was only when David Brewster demonstrated a photographic version of the stereoscope at the great exposition of 1851 that stereoscopy became popular. In Wheatstone’s words:<disp-quote>
<p>At the date of the publication of my experiments on binocular vision, the brilliant photographic discoveries of Talbot, Niepce, and Daguerre had not been announced to the world. To illustrate the phenomena of the stereoscope I could therefore, at that time, only employ drawings made by the hands of an artist. (Wheatstone, quoted in Zone, 2007: 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With Wheatstone’s words in mind it is notable that the hand-drafted nature of stereoscopy’s early origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847712456255">Figure 1</xref>) has often been passed over in favour of its photographic equivalents. However, recent stereoscopic developments in our audiovisual culture, premised as they are upon computer generated imaging (CGI), have lately started to complicate the photo-centric determinism of this historical narrative.</p>

<p>Rendering perspectival space by hand and in stereo was technically possible before the photograph (as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847712456255">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates), but the resulting images could not go beyond the basic novelty of crude shapes mapped out in basic vectors – meaning that mass marketing them was next to impossible. As numerous scholars have pointed out, monoscopic photography and later cinematography subsequently overwhelmed stereography in popularity (Crary, 1998; Maxwell, 2000; Schiavo, 2003). Aside from difficulties of mass reproduction, it is also argued that stereography could not function adequately within 19th-century structures of vision, since they disrupted what Martin Jay (1988) has called the ‘scopic regimes of modernity’. That is, stereoscopic experiments and the stereographs that resulted drew attention to the subjectivity of vision by making the spectator aware of the body’s role in vision, while the photograph had the opposite effect. That is,<disp-quote>
<p>dioramas and stereographs all produced a visual experience that highlighted the body’s role in vision, [while] the photograph by contrast buried this knowledge beneath the seamless surface of purely mechanistic technique. (Maxwell, 2000: 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because it worked towards the effacement of its own apparatus (notably requiring no further optical intermediary with which to view photographic images),<disp-quote>
<p>the camera was mistaken for a ‘transparent and incorporeal intermediary between the observer and the world’… [such that] photography defeated the stereoscope as a mode of visual consumption because it recreated and perpetuated the fiction that the objective vision of the camera obscura was still possible. (p. 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the past two decades, however, the development of CGI and then digital stereoscopy has raised the possibility that the ‘fiction of objective vision’ attached to the camera obscura and its successors has been overstated. The development of CG imaged culture has allowed a historical circularity to emerge in which the indexical, mechanically reproduced image becomes an anomalous interlude in a history of visual culture premised predominantly on hand-crafted image forms (Manovich, 2001: 155). As such, the landscape in which contemporary stereoscopic production and consumption emerge differs from that in which stereography failed to maintain a dominant position in the image culture of the 1900s. In contrast to the photograph, which supposedly replaced early stereography by offering the indexical pretense of objective vision, the CG attractions often of contemporary cinema are underpinned by a very different mode of consumption. Given a movie culture in which non-indexical CG attractions often outweigh the live-action content sewn into it, the way has been paved for spectators to accept stereoscopic viewing positions as a fundamental aspect of that attraction. Regardless of this, however, the stereoviewer may have fallen out of favour less because it did not offer a fiction of objective vision than because its mode of consumption was fundamentally different from that of the photograph. I will argue in this article that the stereograph was a proto-cinematic attraction and was consumed on such terms. What no historian of stereoscopy’s decline seems to have pointed out so far is that its rapid decline happened to coincide with the development of the cinematic attraction. This suggests that stereoscopy fell out of favour in part because a new, more economically and culturally powerful attraction replaced it. In the contemporary context, digital technology has finally allowed the combination of cinematic and stereoscopic spectacle as a viable economic form. This brings us full circle to Wheatstone’s original stereoscopic hand drawings for, like Wheatstone’s first stereoscope images, contemporary CG stereoscopy is also non-indexically fabricated. At the same time, however, CG stereoscopy is capable of reaching the mass market that Wheatstone’s images failed to reach thanks to the capacity of digital reproduction to fuse aspects of handcraft with the economies of scale facilitated by mechanical reproduction: something that previously had prevented the commercial success of Wheatstone’s invention.</p>
<p>This article will therefore argue that contemporary stereoscopic cinema, with James Cameron’s <italic>Avatar</italic> (2009) as its most distinguished representative, is not a radical break with cinema and visual culture’s previous stereoscopic history but the product of stereoscopic history turning full circle. While <italic>Avatar</italic>’s stereoscopic images may appear photorealistic, ultimately they hold as much in common with Wheatstone’s original renderings as they do with Brewster’s subsequent and more successful stereo-photographs. I shall argue that <italic>Avatar</italic> negotiates what I shall call the ‘cybernetic regime of modernity’. Crucially, this is not a ‘new’ regime that has been unleashed by computer culture; rather, it is the culmination of a series of cultural effects put into process in the mid-19th century, long before the development of the computer, Charles Babbage’s infamous and unfinished difference engine notwithstanding.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, the term ‘cybernetic’ encompasses two concepts: that of the ‘cybernetic empire’ that both Thomas Richards (1993) and Simon Cook (2004) attribute to late Victorian culture, and that which is a paradigm for our visual and informational culture at the opposite end of the 20th century. With regard to the former, Cook argues that the British empire was cybernetic because it was ‘the first empire that was held together more by information than by mere physical power’ (Cook, 2004: 60). In other words, ‘cybernetic’ here describes the informational networks laid down during the Victorian era that were later to come to function as a cornerstone of contemporary new media culture. The printed book and the scientific article, the database-style organization of these print media that arose at the time, the organization of visual archives manifested within such media and the associated ‘investigation by physiologists of the material foundations of both vision and thought’ (p. 60), all underpinned the Victorians’ cybernetic empire. Indeed, one of the viewing technologies heavily implicated in this investigation was the stereograph, with its profoundly disruptive challenge to the ‘scopic regime of modernity’ embedded within its informational reorganization of (understanding) the body’s role in vision. The narrative of <italic>Avatar</italic>, its investigation of the nature of experienced reality, the virtual transference of physiology and the separation of body from vision that function under the auspices of new media forms, are indebted to this uneasy relationship between the scopic and cybernetic regimes of vision in the Victorian era.</p>
<p>In the second conception of the cybernetic, Bill Nichols (1988: 22) posits an understanding in relation to the computer as ‘more than an object’. In a fashion that recalls <italic>Avatar</italic>’s overarching theme, the cybernetic ‘is also an icon and a metaphor that suggests new ways of thinking about ourselves and our environment, new ways of constructing images of what it means to be human and to live in a humanoid world’. As the camera came to encompass the photographic and cinematic process, Nichols claims that the computer has come to encompass the range of networks and systems that exemplify our cybernetic cultural context. With this, Nichols declares that his intention,<disp-quote>
<p>is to carry [Walter] Benjamin’s inquiry forward and to ask how cybernetic systems, symbolised by the computer, represent a set of transformations in the conception of and relation to self and reality wrought by mechanical reproduction and symbolised by the camera. (p. 22)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Avatar</italic> can, then, be seen to operate as an early cinematic reflection of some of Nichols’s observations, although whether it can be upheld as the embodiment of culture in the age of cybernetic systems is another question.</p>
<p>These two conceptions of the cybernetic, reaching from opposite ends of the 20th century, provide a framework through which to address some of the philosophical and scopic dimensions of <italic>Avatar</italic>. It would be a mistake, however, to address this cybernetic duality only in terms of the ocular, informational, stereoscopic paradigm and the philosophical questions it raises concerning vision and humanity. <italic>Avatar</italic> is equally self-referential about its disruptive position within a scopic regime initiated at the inception of the Victorian empire and the role of that empire in the initiation of mass ecocide and genocide. Not only does the movie address the potentially dysfunctional relationship between the body, vision and the traditional scopic regimes of modernity at the heart of stereoscopic imaging, but it also tackles, and attempts to atone for the cultural politics of racist brutality inherent in the Victorian empire and embodied in the subsequent American imperialism that culminated in a founding text of American cinematic culture, <italic>Birth of a Nation</italic> (DW Griffith, 1915).</p>
<p>As well as talking back to the audiovisual past and stereography’s place in it, <italic>Avatar</italic> attempts to negotiate the future. Presenting a wheelchair-bound protagonist whose interactive status is remarkably reminiscent of a cinema viewer, the narrative speaks in relatively unsubtle metaphoric terms of the potential for new, cybernetic, gaming technologies to revolutionize our relationship to the audiovisual image. Colonel Quaritch self-reflexively recalls the <italic>Wizard of Oz</italic> at one point, stating that ‘we are not in Kansas anymore’, but the more apt comparison is that of the cybernetic network and the simulacrum. Not for nothing is the film called <italic>Avatar</italic>: Sully’s transition from wheelchair-bound spectator to hyper-mobile agent seemingly endowed with multiple lives (dying and coming back to life repeatedly) recalls the experience of a gamer (complete with skills upgrades, end of level creatures to battle, and a heroine to rescue in a fantasy environment). In this way, <italic>Avatar</italic> engages with the new, emergent modes of cybernetic consumption, modes that cinema must accommodate, even as it appears to pioneer. In this sense, as we shall see, <italic>Avatar</italic> negotiates a turning point in our audiovisual culture just as <italic>Birth of a Nation</italic> did a century before.</p>

<title>Ethnographic and ecological stereoscopy</title>
<p>Any evaluation of stereoscopic cinema’s past must, by necessity, turn to a consideration of the spectacular attractions that predated it in the Victorian era. Preceding early cinema, it has been suggested that stereographs were proto-cinematic in a number of ways (Michelson, 1989; Zone, 2007). Firstly, their visual function was profoundly embedded within the logic of the attraction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1746847712456255">Figure 2</xref>). Indeed, in describing the overlap between the stereograph and what he refers to as cinema’s ‘novelty period’, Ray Zone suggests that the stereograph laid the foundations for what Tom Gunning (1990) describes as the ‘cinema of attractions’, even though Zone makes no direct reference to Gunning:<disp-quote>
<p>Many of the genres, particularly Automobiles, Aviation, Comics, Disasters, Erotica, Exhibitions, Novelties, Theatrical, Railroads, and Wars, were borrowed and would become standard subjects for the nascent motion picture industry during its ‘novelty period’ from 1895 to 1905. (Zone, 2007: 15)</p>

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1746847712456255-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>Like early cinematic attractions, stereographs worked within the context of what Charney and Schwartz (1995) have described as a broader set of modernist cultural and technological transformations. Such transformations embedded the viewer within the emergent and intersecting spaces facilitated by new technologies, be it the cockpit of the plane, the front of the train, the rollercoaster, the department store, or the far-flung reaches of empire opened up by new capacities to explore.</p>
<p>Equally, however, stereographs looked forward to later cinematic forms through narratives that sought explicitly to relate their spectacular attraction to broader structures of dramatic meaning. For example, stereocards were often sold in sets that developed narratives across a number of spectacular tableaux. Like an early form of intertitle, such sets included explanatory captions on their reverse side that anticipated the negotiation that took place in its media successor after the cinema of attractions developed to encompass narrative form.</p>
<p>Stereographs provided the viewer with a proto-cybernetic visual experience on two counts: firstly, by drawing attention to the process of spectatorship through the stereographic spectacle, it made the viewer aware of the informational nature of the image. The stereograph was, after all, not perceivable mono-scopically, which is to say that it was only through a doubling of the visual information contained within two slightly different images (and received simultaneously) that its effect was perceivable at all. Secondly, stereographs also provided a protocybernetic experience by delivering to viewers the peoples, places, resources and even virtual spaces of empire. Describing the monoscopic photographs of empire, Anne Maxwell (2000: 11) argues that<disp-quote>
<p>for many people these images constituted a precursory glimpse into the world’s least traversed regions, an experience hitherto confined to intrepid explorers and those who could afford a Grand Tour. For others they were a part of the Victorian passion for collecting, an activity that strengthened colonialism because it enabled participants to possess the whole world, if not literally then at least visually.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What Maxwell describes of photography here can be applied to stereography. That is, stereographs of exotic people and places on the imperial periphery operated as a functional continuation of imperial practice, allowing Victorian spectators to glimpse the places that they could not necessarily travel to (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1746847712456255">Figure 3</xref>). They also fulfilled the Victorian desire to understand, categorize and own both information about the world and, by extension, the world itself (ideologically at least).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1746847712456255-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p>Maxwell’s assertion that the Victorians came to own the world visually fits with Richards (1993) and Cook’s (2004) assertions that this empire was a cybernetic one, based on information as much or more than on physicality. The difference between the photograph and the stereograph, however, is an important one: while the stereograph is said to have failed commercially because it was said to have foregrounded the human body in the process of visuality, this feature will have been precisely its advantage in advertising the empire’s cybernetic tendencies. Stereographic spectators beholding the natural wealth of the imperial periphery will not only have been made aware of their physical anchor in the imperial heart, they will also have been made aware of the cybernetic, informational nature of their empire. In emphasizing the body and its specific role in subjective visual perception the stereograph also emphasized the fact that such perception was an informational process.</p>
<p>Analysing <italic>Avatar</italic> in light of 19th-century imperial stereography reveals some striking parallels. As a narrative, the film is remarkably self-reflexive about the body and its relationship to processes of imperial cybernetic, immersive spectatorship. Indeed the problematic juncture of cybernetic imperialism, scopic technologies and bodily immersion/dislocation with such regimes is the film’s subject. The narrative revolves around the premise that Sully’s body must be separated from his consciousness: he cannot pass into the imperial ecological space without the violent disconnection of his mind from one biology to another. This metaphor functions on a number of levels. Sully’s bodily transference is reminiscent (if somewhat more extreme) of viewers throughout the past century who peered into stereoscopic apparatuses to be scopically immersed in a new, imperial space. Equally, Sully’s moment of transfer is reminiscent (though again more extreme) of the experience that viewers of <italic>Avatar</italic> itself undergo, and is curiously sophisticated in responding to the possibility that film’s stereoscopic trick might disrupt viewers’ attention and immersion within the narrative. For the narrative is about a self-aware spectator crossing the boundary between his own and another cybernetic imperial space.</p>
<p>If it seems here like the relationship I am drawing between Sully <italic>within the film</italic> and the spectator <italic>of the film</italic> functions is a conveniently over-extended parallel it is because that is precisely what it is. The film encourages a slippage between the fantastic technologies of the narrative and the emergent new-media forms that made the film’s stereoscopic spectacle of this narrative possible (however likely or otherwise the fantastic technologies are to become a reality). In other words, the film’s rhetorical address/promise to the spectator is premised upon an elision between the content of its spectacular attraction, the technologies deployed to materialize it and the newly hyped stereoscopic apparatus deployed to exhibit it. As we shall see shortly, DW Griffith also deployed a similar sleight-of-hand almost 100 years earlier.</p>
<p>Returning to notions of cybernetic imperial space, <italic>Avatar</italic> uses moments of stereoscopic spectatorship as a means of representing the kind of informational and representational nexus characteristic of past colonial adventures. Our introduction to the eco-politics of an extractive robber baron military industrial adventure in <italic>Avatar</italic> is through a holographic visualisation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1746847712456255">1</xref></sup> As Sully sits at the table watching the virtual reproduction of Pandora’s eco-wealth and the ‘home tree’ village of the Na’vi people, the content of this holographic attraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1746847712456255">Figure 4b</xref>) has striking echoes with the many thousands of past stereoscopic images made by Victorians and Americans of giant trees, captured as they expanded their zones of ecological exploration and extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1746847712456255">Figure 4a</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1746847712456255-fig4.tif"/></fig>
<p>Similarly, the moment that Sully is cybernetically disembodied and connected to his ‘avatar’, the film resembles the fleshing out of a cinematic attraction, storyboarded via early stereographs. Like a contemporary update of past imperial stereocards now residing in the silicon of the CG cybernetic empire, <italic>Avatar</italic> returns to the same subjects as its predecessors: peoples, spaces, resources of empire. Despite the blue skin colour and cat-like eyes, the Na’vi are reminiscent in their weapons, jewelry and dress codes, of a First Nation American/Papua New Guinean tribal mix and the parallels in visual culture are clear to see (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847712456255">Figure 5</xref>). While Tsu’tey’s weaponry and pictorial representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847712456255">Figure 5b</xref>) resemble that of the tribes people in what was the Belgian Congo when stereographers where gathering new commercial material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847712456255">Figure 5a</xref>), his Mohican/dreadlock hair style resembles a fusion of First Nation American and the Maasai people of North Africa, both of whom were stereographed in the mid to late 19th century to be sold on as attractions for the stereo-viewer collection (see especially Dinkins, 2009). Equally, the leader of the Horse People Akwey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847712456255">Figure 5c</xref>) bears a septum piercing found amongst tribes people from Papua New Guinea to India and the Americas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847712456255">Figure 5d</xref>).</p>

<caption>
<p>Resembling the fleshing out of a cinematic attraction, storyboarded via early stereographs <italic>Avatar</italic> echoes past imperial stereocards returning to the subjects of its predecessors: peoples, spaces, resources of empire. In this case, the subjects of empire: (a) <italic>Native Tribesman in the Belgan Congo</italic>; (b) <italic>Avatar</italic> (James Cameron); (c) New Guinea Tribesmen; (d) <italic>Avatar</italic>.</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1746847712456255-fig5.tif"/></fig>
<p>With this, we see how <italic>Avatar</italic>’s showcase of the fictional Na’vi people reflects the conventions of the late Victorian live ethnographer’s anthropological displays that both predated stereoscopic technologies and later came to share a platform with them at world fairs. In both cases, these exhibits made a spectacle of the same subjects: the peoples and bounty of imperial dominion (Maxwell, 2000: 2). <italic>Avatar</italic> more closely resembles the stereographs, however, which, like their photographic counterparts, stood in marked contrast to the live display in their depth and breadth of content:<disp-quote>
<p>By contrast to anthropological displays, photographs of the colonised encompassed a wide range of forms and genres. Photographic representations of colonised peoples included <italic>cartes-de-visite</italic> (sometimes referred to as cabinets), daguerreotypes, collotypes, postcards and stereocards, and spanned a wider range of registers, including ethnology, travel and portraiture. (p. 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Avatar</italic> inherits the wider gamut of its stereoscopic predecessors, literally taking its spectators on a journey through the range of registers. To ethnology, travel and portraiture we can add ‘eco-tourism’ and ‘new age mysticism’, although even these categories were arguably present already in the turn-of-the-century stereocards. Certainly, spaces in <italic>Avatar</italic> are mapped out in uncanny resemblance to their Victorian counterparts. As imperial explorers were represented daringly crossing treacherous ravines or negotiating awe-inspiring caverns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1746847712456255">Figure 6c</xref>), so, too, is Sully represented making his way through caverns on a climb up to his Na’vi initiation test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1746847712456255">Figure 6d</xref>). Once reached, the scene from the top (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1746847712456255">Figure 6b</xref>) would have seemed startlingly familiar to many a 19th-century stereoviewing enthusiast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1746847712456255">Figure 6a</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1746847712456255-fig6.tif"/></fig>
<p>We see, then, that late Victorian and early American stereoscope spectators were invited vicariously to participate in the dangers and wonders of the newly opened spaces of empire. Likewise, the awe of eco-wealth and resource exploitation went hand in hand with the display of the ‘natives’ who lived, and increasingly died, among such rapidly extracted wealth. Where early pioneers proudly photographed the fruits of their extraction labour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1746847712456255">Figure 7a</xref>), in <italic>Avatar</italic> the same images are presented to us but this time as a source of shame and a symptom of the occupying powers’ lack of moral legitimacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1746847712456255">Figure 7b</xref>). Likewise, where the mechanization of imperial extraction was once a triumphal source of awe and wonder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1746847712456255">Figure 7c</xref>), in <italic>Avatar</italic> it takes on the post World War II horror of a natural holocaust<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1746847712456255">2</xref></sup> only made possible by industrialization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1746847712456255">Figure 7d</xref>). Nevertheless, to return to the above suggestion that early stereocards functioned as protocinematic attractions, we can see in the commonalities of both spatial representation and aesthetic subject matter, an audiovisual impulse towards the spectacular representation of natural resources connecting <italic>Avatar</italic> to its predecessors.</p>

<p>Lest we are caught up in the specificities of the comparable spectacular images found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847712456255">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1746847712456255">6</xref> and 7, it is worth reiterating that these echoes are not necessarily direct visual quotes but the recurrence of an underlying spectacular imperative that formed the foundation of early stereography and which returns in <italic>Avatar</italic>. More accurately, this spectacular imperative should be understood as never having really gone away. The stereographic representation of waterfalls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1746847712456255">Figure 8a</xref>) that then resurfaced in early cinema as Edison’s <italic>Waterfall in the Catskills</italic> (1897) represents a tendency towards the spectacular that finds a renewed place in <italic>Avatar</italic> in the first chopper scene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1746847712456255">Figure 8b</xref>). Likewise, the thousands of ocean coves photographed by early stereographers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1746847712456255">Figure 8c</xref>) and recaptured by early cinematographers (<italic>Surf at Monterey</italic>, 1897) become the backdrop for a mountain banshee flight scene near the end of <italic>Avatar</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1746847712456255">Figure 8d</xref>). While these comparisons are striking, they are so not only because of a direct relation between each other but also because they mark a more general tendency towards what we have come to understand as a particularly cinematic form of spectacular imaging that was clearly a founding principle of early stills stereography.</p>

<p>Thus, beyond the direct comparisons, the logic of <italic>Avatar</italic>’s 3D CGI allows the cinema viewer to glimpse the extent of a newly cybernetic empire where the relationship between information and visualization again returns to prominence, facilitated by the binary code of the CG algorithm/s. It is not without irony that psychiatrists reported a huge (and much commented on) rise in the phenomenon of viewers claiming depression brought on by the fact that Pandora does not exist, in a manner reminiscent of what Steven Bottomore (1999) has described as ‘train effect’ hysteria in early cinema.</p>
<p>As with the ‘train effect’ of a century before, it is entirely likely that reports of <italic>Avatar</italic> viewers so overwhelmed by the immersive nature of the film that they had to seek medical help were a falsely overblown but useful marketing tool. More telling, however, is the fact that, although viewers of <italic>Avatar</italic> were allegedly grief stricken, no mention was ever made in these reports of the many cultures and peoples echoed in the film that also no longer exist. If we were to take such reports of grief on face value (and given Bottomore’s work in this area that would take a considerable act of faith), they could be understood on a number of levels. While the Victorians could own the cybernetic empire’s peripheral space visually, they could also actually travel there if they chose to (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1746847712456255">Figure 3</xref>). <italic>Avatar</italic>, on the other hand, reminds the viewer that the peripheral space of their empire is truly cybernetic: they can never actually visit it. Similarly, such strangely misplaced grief could also be the collective expression of mourning for the destruction of the cultures cleared for the white settlement of the Americas. Regardless of the veracity of reports of depressed viewers, what is pointedly notable is that, like the cybernetic spaces of <italic>Avatar</italic>, the Na’vi are an equally cybernetic echo of the 100 million indigenous peoples exterminated through European colonization, war and disease (Cosgrove, 1984; Stannard, 1992). Similarly, far more important than the veracity of reports of viewer despair is the fact that they took precedence over a consideration in news media of the way the film pointed to an all too real mass destruction of a people in our recent past.</p>
<p>Ironically, the world that viewers of <italic>Avatar</italic> can never access is a world that was destroyed during the rise of the very viewing practices that are still contained within <italic>Avatar</italic>. As James Ryan (1997: 140–181) points out, vast numbers of indigenous peoples and their homelands around the world were largely destroyed in the 200 years leading up to and during the invention of the photograph and its stereoscopic corollaries. Unsurprisingly, for the indigenous survivors not wiped out by accidental disease or deliberate biological warfare, the camera was an object to be treated with the same suspicion as the gun. Aside from the obvious analogies between the two devices (both are used to ‘shoot’, both were ‘loaded’ with cartridges and both pointed at the object or person they were to be focused upon), Ryan points out that the camera was likely as damaging as the gun in many instances. Two brief moments in <italic>Avatar</italic> underscore this. The first is during the caterpillar’s eco-destruction of the Na’vi forest when Sully’s immediate and knowing response is to climb upon the machine and to destroy the camera. The second is when Colonel Quaritch uses Sully’s video diary footage to justify military action upon the Na’vi village. In both cases, the camera and the ‘full spectrum dominance’ it offers to the invaders also betrays the indigenous people.</p>
<p>By extension, the camera’s betrayal (or that of the people who deployed it) of indigenous people was fully interwoven with the initiation of cinema history. From short actualities of indigenes representing their ‘primitive’ ways as grist for the cinema of attractions’ mill, to the development of feature-length films like <italic>Birth of a Nation</italic>, cinema’s history of indigenous representation has been ambiguous to say the least.</p>
<p>Cameron is clearly profoundly aware of his place in film culture and his relationship to cinematic history. As George Monbiot (an environmentalist rather than a film critic) stated at the time of the movie’s release:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Avatar</italic>, James Cameron’s blockbusting 3D film, is both profoundly silly and profound. It’s profound because, like most films about aliens, it is a metaphor for contact between different human cultures. But in this case the metaphor is conscious and precise: this is the story of European engagement with the native peoples of the Americas. It’s profoundly silly because engineering a happy ending demands a plot so stupid and predictable that it rips the heart out of the film … But this is a story no one wants to hear, because of the challenge it presents to the way we choose to see ourselves. Europe was massively enriched by the genocides in the Americas; the American nations were founded on them. This is a history we cannot accept. (Monbiot, 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Cameron’s metaphor is more conscious and precise than Monbiot realizes, however. For it constitutes both a general reflection on the nature of colonialism, genocide and the deployment of audiovisual technologies in such processes at the same time as it is very specific in its acknowledgement of, and apology for, DW Griffith’s role in ‘fathering’ film.</p>

<title>The birth of a stereoscopic nation</title>
<p>DW Griffith’s reputed role in making one of the first feature-length films and in innovating cinematography whilst negotiating the incorporation of the attraction into narrative cinema has been the subject of much scholarship (see, inter alia, Gunning, 1991; Mitry, 1982). This has led film encyclopaedias and textbooks to dub him the ‘single most important figure in the history of American film and one of the most influential in the development of world cinema as an art’ (Katz, 1998: 563). However, Griffith’s place as the ‘father of film’ has also led to an uncomfortable reckoning regarding the racism that underpinned both Griffith and his work (see Taylor, 1998).</p>
<p>For many filmmakers, this reckoning has taken the form of satirization of Griffith and the shadow that <italic>Birth of a Nation</italic>’s famous Wagner-inspired Ku Klux Klan horseback chase scene cast across modern movie history. Matthew Wilson Smith (2008) asserts that musical scores like Wagner’s alongside <italic>Birth of a Nation</italic> helped emphasize early narrative cinema’s homogeneity of form and content – as opposed to the cinema of attractions’ vaudeville form, with its heterogeneity of performance, audience agency and spectatorial attention. For Smith, Wagner, with <italic>Birth of a Nation</italic>’s use of <italic>Ride of the Valkyries</italic> as the major example, became a byword for the integration of a new cinema, founded upon the elevation of its content to the status of high art. Not simply the birth of a nation, then, but ‘the birth of a whole new aesthetic form’ (p. 231). Thus, for Griffith, the Wagnerian orchestral arrangement (the orchestra literally placed within the cinema space) functioned in the same way as the stereoscopic apparatus did for Cameron: both providing a means of eliding the boundary between the narrative content, spectacular attraction and the dual spectatorial space the viewer was therefore expected to inhabit. Likewise then, both provided a means with which the spectator could integrate seemingly heterogeneous form and content into an apparently homogeneous whole.</p>
<p>In many ways, <italic>Birth of a Nation</italic> acts as a textual bridge between the racist and colonialist logic that pervaded early live shows, stereographic stills and cinematic attractions, and that of later narrative cinema. Crucially, in his pre-narrative cinema period, Griffith made some 30 films that were based on representations of Native Americans. Gregory S Jay (2000) has convincingly argued that these apparently sympathetic representations of America’s first settlers actually betray the racist logic that eventually emerged in <italic>Birth of a Nation</italic>. With this in mind, it is intriguing that <italic>Avatar</italic> deliberately references both <italic>Birth of a Nation</italic> and <italic>Ride of the Valkyries</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1746847712456255">Figure 9a</xref>). When the marines move in for their final attack on the Na’vi, the representation of assembled military might resembles that of <italic>Birth of a Nation</italic> not only in terms of its shot construction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1746847712456255">Figure 9b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1746847712456255">9c</xref> and 9d) but also in the fact that the central command attack vehicle is pointedly named and referred to by a Southern general as ‘Valkyrie’. Whether consciously or not, Cameron refashions <italic>Birth of a Nation</italic> to make the ‘Birth of a Na’vi Nation’: a kind of wishful thinking in which past crimes can be cybernetically atoned for by the power of silicon. Equivalents of the Ku Klux Klan scene are played out not once but three times in <italic>Avatar</italic>: once involving the military (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1746847712456255">Figure 9b</xref>) and twice involving the Na’vi people both riding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1746847712456255">Figure 9c</xref>) and flying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1746847712456255">Figure 9d</xref>) to the rescue of their land.</p>

<p>Besides textual similarities between these films, however, there are broader parallels between the aims of both directors in making their respective films and the narratives they construct about themselves through their films. Like Griffith, Cameron attempts with <italic>Avatar</italic> to negotiate a new chapter in the relationship between the narrative and spectacle of contemporary cinematic vision. Like Griffith (see Gunning, 1991), it seems that Cameron deliberately sets out with <italic>Avatar</italic> to establish himself as the pre-eminent innovator of his industrial and aesthetic cinematic landscape. Where Griffith’s role was to incorporate spectacle within a newly emergent narrative form, Cameron presides over a considerable expansion in the nature of contemporary spectacle. With <italic>Avatar</italic>, Weta Digital’s fusion of live action and CG animation for the entirety of the movie marks a seminal (even if it is not the first) instance in which ‘live action’ is, to all intents and purposes, recognizably rationalized under the logic of the CG attraction for the full length of the movie. Here CG special effects are not set piece moments mapped briefly onto what is ostensibly a live action text, but instead <italic>they are the fabric of the movie into which the live action is stitched</italic>. In Manovich’s terms, cinema has in this film become the visible slave of the computer from start to finish. In his seminal article ‘The Cinema of Attractions’ (1990), Tom Gunning argued that the emergence of narrative cinema forced the attraction ‘underground’, surfacing in dance routines and spectacular landscapes. An interpretation of <italic>Avatar</italic>’s feature-length CG attraction might turn Gunning’s analysis on its head and ask if the movie marks the moment in which narrative goes underground, functioning in the lulls of a cinematic attraction that has expanded to fill every minute of the spectatorial experience. More reasonably, however, we might say that we can see in <italic>Avatar</italic> the balance/tension that Geoff King (1999) argues is the defining equilibrium of Hollywood cinema where spectacle and narrative have reached a symbiotic parity.</p>

<title>Stereoscopy in the age of cybernetic systems</title>
<p>While <italic>Avatar</italic> talks back to the proto-cybernetic origins of Victorian stereoscopy, it also attempts a redefinition and a redeployment of contemporary stereography as the function of a renovated cybernetic culture. Here an expansion of our understanding of the ‘cybernetic’ as it was outlined earlier bears fruit. To recap, just as the information networks laid down during the late Victorian empire came to function as a cornerstone of contemporary new media culture (see Cook, 2004; Richards, 1993), I have argued that the late Victorian stereograph was symptomatic of the informational reorganization of culture, space and time that took place during that period. The contemporary stereoscopy deployed in <italic>Avatar</italic> marks an echo of this imperial and visual past, at the same time as it constitutes something new: both the informational made concrete in visual form as per the Victorian period and, as we shall see, the post-mechanically reproduced, chip-based form of cybernetics described by Nichols.</p>
<p><italic>Avatar’s</italic> success as a stereoscopic film is based upon the redefinition of a tension inherent in early stereoscopy: the capacity to circumvent the pure mechanical reproduction of David Brewster’s photographic stereoscopy and to reformulate a new stereoscopy based upon the kind of non-indexical rendering of 3D objects that Charles Wheatstone originally produced. All of this is made possible by the recombinatory and simulative capacities of the computer chip, and in this sense <italic>Avatar</italic> demonstrates the growing impact of cybernetics upon cinema, based as it was for a century upon mechanical reproduction. <italic>Avatar</italic>’s contemporary stereoscopy is premised upon the non-indexical capacities that CG imaging has facilitated – specifically the capacity to fabricate a perspectival image that nevertheless appears photorealistic. This introduces a circularity to stereoscopy’s long and continued development, akin to that which Manovich (2001: 195) describes with the emergence of CG manipulation returning our image culture to hand-crafted forms after the anomalous interlude of mechanical reproduction.</p>
<p>Historians and visual theorists of stereoscopy’s past have often focused upon its eventual birth as a photographic form as simultaneously the reason for its triumph and the reason for its equally rapid failure to survive as a mass medium (see Crary, 1998; Maxwell, 2000; Schiavo, 2003). Photographic technology, they argue, might have allowed the mass proliferation of stereography, but its monoscopic alternative also challenged stereoscopy by offering the fiction of objective vision. Elsewhere I have argued that this historical account is problematic for a number of reasons (Gurevitch 2012), that aside however, with the emergence of contemporary cybernetic culture, the fiction of objective vision begins to dissolve (if it ever really functioned as powerfully as theorists of stereoscopy’s first demise have suggested). This is fact that <italic>Avatar</italic> addresses. Whereas past forms of cinematic consumption involved a degree of psychic immersion into the narrative, many spectators of <italic>Avatar</italic> are increasingly cognisant of the more active role that they play in the perception, manipulation, interaction and even creation of screen content. From game consoles and facial recognition systems in cameras, televisions and computer technologies, through to touch screens and voice interfaces, the boundaries between user, image, and even what constitutes the screen itself, have shifted.</p>
<p>In this sense, Sully, with his metaphorical transformation from cinematic spectator (immobile in his wheelchair in cinematic space) to participative gamer (highly mobile in his ‘avatar’ in CG animated space), finds analogues in the experiences of many in the audience. From this perspective <italic>Avatar</italic> is, via Walter Benjamin and Bill Nichols, a ‘work of culture in the age of cybernetic systems’: a metaphor for the current emergence of cybernetic technologies of vision and communication and the capacity to cross corporeal boundaries (Jones, 2007). In short, <italic>Avatar</italic> concerns itself with the ways in which computer technology is reshaping our visual culture and our understanding of ourselves.</p>
<p>The significance of <italic>Avatar</italic>’s cybernetic stereoscopy lies in its deployment as a visceral and spectacular grantor of the promise contained within the storyline: that the transference of consciousness from one body to another might one day be more than a metaphor. Regardless of its likelihood, <italic>Avatar</italic>’s cybernetic conjuring trick, materializing a seemingly photorealistic stereoscopic world that has little basis in indexicality, implies the promise of more to come. Nichols’s (1988: 33) description of our changing relationship to culture in a cybernetic age is therefore fitting:<disp-quote>
<p>The chip replaces the copy. Just as mechanical reproduction of copies revealed the power of industrial capitalism to reorganise and reassemble the world around us, rendering it as commodity art, the automated intelligence of chips reveals the power of post-industrial capitalism to simulate and replace the world around us, rendering not only its exterior realm but also its interior ones of consciousness, intelligence, thought and intersubjectivity as commodity experience.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Herein lies the crucial difference between Avatar’s stereoscopy and that of the Victorian predecessors it echoes. Avatar’s stereoscopy is premised upon the ‘automated intelligence’ of the chip and its capacity to ‘simulate and replace the world around us’. Thus, while <italic>Avatar</italic> is a cybernetic text insofar as the narrative contemplates the age of cybernetic systems, it simultaneously deploys the logic of cybernetics in full through its stereoscopic CG form.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1746847712456255">
<title>Stereoscopy and cybernetic systems as software patch</title>
<p>By way of conclusion, we will turn to a consideration of <italic>Avatar</italic>’s production process. For we risk misunderstanding the cybernetic implications of <italic>Avatar</italic> if we simply analyse the film as a final product to the exclusion of its production process. <italic>Avatar</italic> was not a one-off production laid down on a celluloid roll or even a digital hard drive for subsequent exhibition like Cameron’s earlier films. Instead, <italic>Avatar</italic>, like many of its contemporaries, and even some of its predecessors, is beginning to be rationalized under the logic of the updateable computer code (Manovich, 2008). With franchises such as <italic>Star Wars</italic> now just one of many coming to be treated in such a manner, contemporary CG spectaculars are increasingly subject to the ‘backward compatibility’ update of the stereoscopic ‘patch’. As with the predecessors so with the successors, films now heading into production increasingly function as the digital DNA of sibling sequels. Here the source code underpinning the special effect is forever potentially subject to the software update and <italic>Avatar</italic>, as a special effect stretched to feature length, functions within this logic more than most. In this sense, <italic>Avatar</italic> should be seen as a cybernetic project akin to the grand information gathering endeavours of the Victorian empire blended with the cut and paste capacities of contemporary software culture. When Cameron chose to base his project at Weta Digital, he was not simply buying animation skill; he was buying into the construction and conservation of a simulated biological archive. The hard drives of Weta Digital’s appropriately named server ‘farms’ could be described as a vast, digital arc of simulated content. Appropriately, then, the stereophotograph was not the only cybernetic cultural form showcased to Queen Victoria at the 1851 exhibition. Asserting that the zoo and the botanical garden were one of the emblematic precursors of the cyborg in their function as animate, self-regulating systems, Nichols (1988: 34) argues that:<disp-quote>
<p>Queen Victoria spoke of ‘the greatest day in our history [when] the whole world of nature and art was collected at the call of the queen of cities’. Those permanent exhibitions – the zoo and the botanical garden – introduced a new form of vicarious experience quite distinct from the aesthetic experience of original art or mechanically reproduced copies. The zoo brings back alive evidence of a world we could not otherwise know, now under apparent control. It offers experience at a remove that is fundamentally different as a result of having been uprooted from its original context. The indifferent, unthreatened, and unthreatening gaze of captive animals provides eloquent testimony to the difference between the zoo and the natural habitat to which it refers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By what seems like more than a twist of fate, Weta Digital has specialized in the global neo-colonial preoccupation with the simulated self-regulating system in numerous recent films. This is not simply the case for the objects and environments constructed, but also for the programmes that underpin the behaviour of these objects: Weta’s most commercially successful software spin-off to date now spans multiple industries. The <italic>Massive</italic> programme, as it is called, is accompanied on its website by a tagline that could scarcely better encapsulate Nichols’s articulation of the cybernetic as the self-regulating system: ‘simulating life’. Starting out as an algorithm created to describe the behaviour of biblical numbers of battling warriors in <italic>The Lord of the Rings</italic> films (Peter Jackson, 2001–2003), <italic>Massive</italic> has since been adapted to describe the behaviours of any number of biological crowd forms from humans and animals to androids. The <italic>Massive</italic> simulation acts as the very definition of a self-regulating cybernetic system. Crucially what is notable about this software is not just that it governs the behaviours of simulated life across multiple movies and is therefore decoupled from the specificity of individual films, it is that it is decoupled from the film industry as a whole, being deployed equally in game engines and architectural simulations and television effects to name just a few.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, <italic>Avatar</italic> is not the end of the road for this cybernetic system; with sequels rumored to be slated for production, the botanical content of the first movie will be brought out and digitally dusted off. This is <italic>Avatar</italic> as part of a greater cybernetic system: rather than being bound by the primacy of the celluloid production process as it would have been in the past, the digital pre and post production processes have swelled so that <italic>Avatar</italic> exists as much within a broader cybernetic ecosystem fittingly archived within the servers of a special effects company based in New Zealand. A sequel requires a return to the archives that demonstrates New Zealand’s success in capitalizing on its place in the history of the imperial network (both physical and informational).</p>
<p>Contemporary New Zealand’s current global position is in part based upon a renovated version of this logic. As an economy making a transition from ‘Wool to Weta’ (Callaghan, 2009), the imperial centre to which New Zealand sends its information back has shifted to Hollywood (a shift already underway in the material realm shortly after the first European settlers began shipping vast quantities of New Zealand timber to Los Angeles to fuel the construction boom).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1746847712456255">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Where the 19th-century expositions in London and Paris, Nuremburg and Amsterdam featured colonized peoples and the bounty extracted from their homelands as a spectacular testament to imperial success, today the CG output of effects-houses on the imperial periphery like New Zealand and Australia performs a similar function. Like the European powers of the past that would go to great lengths to gather and represent the raw materials of empire – the bodies of the ‘subjects’ who constituted the labour force and the products they mined and crafted – the raw materials of today’s de-territorialized global empire are similarly constituted. This time, however, the digital images exported back to the imperial centre and, often treated as if they were ‘weightless’, are representative of the labour that continues to constitute the raw material of global capital. This is an empire in which, as Beller (2006: 14) has argued, spectacle follows the flows of global capital, and the image constitutes the sum of its labour (the labour performed both in creating the image and again afterwards in spectating it).</p>
<p>With a digitized, stereoscopic, semi-simulated colonial environment built and animated by Weta Digital, the extent to which the making and distributing of <italic>Avatar</italic> had become an echo of Richards’ cybernetic empire becomes apparent when we consider the process from the perspective of its relative informational structures. Despite one of the world’s smallest populations of only four million people and a relatively miniscule economy of US$117 billion in 2010, New Zealand had the ninth largest share of supercomputing capacity in the world (figures from the CIA World Factbook and IMF World Economic Outlook). <italic>Avatar</italic> and its simulated systems constitute the development of a cybernetic empire writ large, and long after the original imperial centre has collapsed and been replaced. From Wheatstone’s first hand-drawn stereoscopic images and Brewster’s showcase of the imperial periphery’s ecological bounty to Queen Victoria, we have almost come full circle in <italic>Avatar</italic>. Reminiscent of Wheatstone’s first rendered images, <italic>Avatar</italic> is the product of human labour but this time combined with the processing capacities of the render farm: a cybernetic project if ever there was one. More importantly <italic>Avatar</italic> not only demonstrated the commercial possibilities of future stereoscopic spectacle, but it precipitated a wave of stereoscopic updates on a film culture previously lodged firmly in its history of mechanically reproduced celluloid. This is truly the birth of a stereoscopic nation and the emergence of the cybernetic regime of modernity.</p>
