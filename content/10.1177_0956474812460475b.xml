<p>Had Lord Justice Leveson the power to summon the ghosts of journalists past to his inquiry into the conduct of the Press, top of his list would surely be William Thomas Stead.</p>
<p>The scruffy, brilliant, erratic son of a Non-conformist parson, who talked and scribbled his way into high society (and prison), “WT” would have regarded the Royal Courts of Justice as just another pulpit from which to put right the wrongs of the world.</p>
<p>Stead may not have been Britain's first investigative journalist. That title surely belongs to Daniel Defoe, or even Jonathan Swift. But the boy who told his father that God had given him a big whip to “go round the world and whip the wicked out of it,” was certainly the first to claim a divine right to scourge the mighty through the columns of a daily newspaper.</p>
<p>From humble beginnings in a Northumberland pit village, schooled at home amid penury, he rose to be the star of London journalism, the confidant of aristocracy, Prime Ministers, the Tsar, Cecil Rhodes, Cardinal Manning and the top brass of the Salvation Army. He wasn't fussy. They all talked to him, though they very often regretted it. The self-styled “father confessor” of mankind wrote everything down, even things they probably should have said rather than did say, and put it in the paper.</p>
<p>This was new, as was the fierce campaigning zeal he brought to the task. His first article, on the folly of indiscriminate alms-giving, written in wrath after being tricked by a vagrant, appeared in the <italic>Northern Echo</italic>, Darlington, in February 1870. The editor, Jonathan Copleston, refused to pay him, but promised to publish his articles. He was duly supplanted by “young Willie” within nine months, who took the editorial chair on £150-a-year, seized with “a glorious opportunity of attacking the Devil”.</p>
<p>Stead hated the town, with its “rows of slated hideousness” (I lived in one of them as a trainee journalist on the <italic>Echo</italic>'s sister paper) but over the next nine years he turned the paper into a must-read for politicians in London, campaigning on issues such as Disraeli's weak handling of the 1876 Bulgarian Atrocities. With the help of an émigré Russian aristocrat, Madame Olga Novikov (and probably of her friend Gladstone), he secured the deputy editorship of the <italic>Pall Mall Gazette</italic> in 1880, and quit his provincial roots.</p>
<p>Three years later, this “proud barbarian of the north” was editor of the PMG, harassing the government with attacks on the Navy Estimates and war in “a miserable little State in Central Asia” — Afghanistan. But his crowning glory, and ultimately, downfall, was a campaign to save “fallen women”. Stead paid money for an innocent child, Eliza Armstrong, to prove that rich men could buy girls and debauch them.</p>
<p>The ensuing scandal brought him international notoriety, but also a three-month jail sentence for abduction. He continued to edit the <italic>PMG</italic> from Holloway prison, appointing himself “the uncrowned king of an educated democracy”. English law was changed, raising the age of consent for girls from thirteen to sixteen.</p>
<p>Inflated with this success, Stead ruined the Liberal statesman, Sir Charles Dilke, with revelations of his private life, demanding his resignation (a newspaper novelty) and pleading “the public interest” (another innovation). He anticipated modern tabloid assumptions of moral jurisdiction — at one time calling for a “Court of Conscience” of editors.</p>
<p>His rumbustious editorship of the <italic>PMG</italic> failed, not over scandal, but the editor's oldest enemy: falling circulation. Having failed to secure the backing of the Vatican to start up a rival London paper, Stead moved on to found, with <italic>Tit-Bits</italic> proprietor George Newnes, the <italic>Review of Reviews</italic>, offering “the scattered wisdom and opinion of the civilised world” (ie reprints).</p>
<p>This was a success, and Stead resumed his war against the Devil, in as many convenient forms as he could find, including a public denunciation to their faces of the immoral bourgeoisie of Chicago. He was all for naming and shaming, on a “social pillory”. But his quixotic appeal was palling, and his final venture into publishing, the <italic>Daily Paper</italic>, lasted only five weeks.</p>
<p>Stead could still charm, and wealthy Americans who shared his zeal invited him on a lecture tour of the USA, generously, but tragically, paying for his first-class passage on a new luxury liner, the Titanic. When she struck the iceberg, he gave his lifejacket to a fellow passenger, helping women and children into the lifeboats. He perished on deck “alone, in silence and a prayerful attitude of profound meditation”.</p>
<p>Stead had much to think about. A man obsessed with women (he once suggested special newspaper clubs all over London staffed by smartly-uniformed schoolgirls), he was a classic Non-conformist yearning to be corrupted. But he invented the cross-head, professionalised the long lunch, dreamed up the first Stop The War Committee and pioneered a new form of journalism that revolutionised both politics and newspapers.</p>
<p>Sydney Robinson concludes that “The tabloid press he [Stead] inspired has not lived up to his ideal, but some of the greatest journalists can still be found among the cussed and lonely figures of the ‘red-tops’.” Lord Leveson would never have understood.</p>
