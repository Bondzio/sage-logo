<sec id="sec1-0022185612466625a"><title>Peter Fairbrother, John O’Brien, Anne Junor, Michael O’Donnell and Glynne Williams, <italic>Unions and Globalisation: Governments, Management, and the State at Work</italic>. New York, NY: Routledge, 2012, 238 pp., £80.00 (hbk).</title>
<p>The global financial crisis of 2008 ushered in an ‘age of austerity’, bearing down with particular severity on the public service sector. As governments around the world sought to reduce their deficits and control their debt, many chose or were forced to make savage cuts in public expenditure, reducing employment and undermining working conditions in the sector. This book by Peter Fairbrother, John O’Brien, Anne Junor, Michael O’Donnell and Glynne Williams, <italic>Unions and Globalisation</italic>, provides a timely reminder that these developments represent only the most recent manifestation of long-standing global pressures that have encouraged sustained attempts to restructure the role of the state in the delivery of public services. This restructuring has had profound implications for the organisation and treatment of public service workers over at least the last 30 years or so, and in this book, the authors explore these consequences and, in particular, how trade unions have responded to them. The study continues Peter Fairbrother’s long-standing interest in debates on the changing nature of public service trade unionism, but deepens it through a comparative analysis of developments in Britain and Australia.</p>
<p>While a number of texts have previously brought together collections of papers examining public sector industrial relations in a range of countries, as an integrated monograph, the book makes a distinctive contribution. Using the matched country cases of Britain and Australia, the authors are able to adopt a tight analytical approach, not least engaging debates on institutional convergence and divergence in approaches to public service reform and union responses. Indeed, in highlighting similarities between the two countries in these respects, despite differences in the party-political cycles of governments, the authors are able to reveal the potency of global forces.</p>
<p>The book comprises six substantive chapters. These are preceded by an opening chapter giving an overview of the arguments, and a concluding chapter summarising the themes and considering future potential developments. The first of the six substantive chapters sets out the analytical framework for the study. This positions the book to explore how trade unions interact with the state’s emergent managerialism, driven in turn by the principles and practices of neoliberalism and new public management, and underpinned by a process of ‘depoliticisation’. This interest is reflected in the balance of the book. While a third chapter explores pathways to structural and administrative change in the public services, particularly in the civil service, across the respective countries, the three succeeding chapters focus on key aspects of industrial relations. A chapter on the ‘remoulding of the state labour process’ examines the changing nature of work in the sector: not only the downward pressure on employment terms wrought by the introduction of competitive pressures into public service provision, but also the attempt to tighten managerial control. This is followed by a chapter considering government steps to reorganise formal collective industrial relations institutions, with moves to undermine national systems and introduce more individualised employment practices such as performance-related pay (PRP) in Britain and individual workplace agreements in Australia.</p>
<p>This provides the basis for the final substantive chapter: a detailed consideration of union responses to the restructuring of the state and the concomitant reorganisation of the sector’s industrial relations, focusing in particular on the two main civil service unions in the respective countries: the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) in Australia and the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) in Britain. The authors highlight the challenges faced by these unions in responding to an emergent state that combines elements of operational decentralisation with a continuing central control over policy and practice through funding and performance management systems. However, the authors emphasise union capacity to resist change and moderate its detrimental impact. Indeed, while marked differences in union responses are noted – the CPSU becoming a much more centralised union as the PCS sought new and different means to engage members at different levels – the authors emphasise union renewal and resilience in both countries.</p>
<p>A couple of limitations with the book might be noted. First, it is an ambitious piece of work and some elements work better than others. The book provides strong insights into the relationship between public service reform and industrial relations, but as a research monograph, at times it works less well. By comparing developments in two state agencies – JobCentre Plus in Britain and Centrelink in Australia – undoubted richness is added; however, the processing of primary research data from these cases is unclear and its use uneven. This is particularly reflected in the use of quotations, deployed in rather an unsystematic way. Second, the book is very much predicated on the assumption of union renewal and resilience, reflected for instance in the conceptual framework presented at the outset of the book (p. 43). One would have thought, however, that the impact of state restructuring on trade unions and their responses to it remains an open, empirical question: certainly, renewal and resilience are potential outcomes, but surely less positive union outcomes remain plausible and in need of theorisation.</p>
<p>These limitations should not, however, detract from the value of the book or its appeal to a wide audience. As a tightly argued, well-designed piece of work, it makes a distinctive contribution to debates on public management and industrial relations. Indeed, in so doing, it should be of interest to policymakers, practitioners and scholars across both domains.</p>
