<p>Since Antoine Prost’s <italic>Les anciens combattants et la société française, 1914</italic><italic>–</italic><italic>1939</italic> (1977), subsequent histories of the period have largely accepted the benign role of French Great War veterans during the interwar period. In focusing on the period between the riots of 6 February 1934 and the Daladier government in 1938, this article re-examines the history of the veterans from the perspective of their movement for state reform. The two largest associations, the Union nationale des combattants (UNC) and the Union fédérale (UF) undertook a campaign for an authoritarian reform of the Republic. Though united in their belief in reform, the associations’ motives differed starkly. Furthermore, activists and moderates fought for the meaning of their groups’ policies and for the meaning of their very associations. Circumstances dictated the strength of each faction. With a focus on the UNC and the UF, this article argues that neither their alleged Republicanism, nor their shift to authoritarianism were governed by an inherent nature. The article demonstrates that the political culture of the late Third Republic was complex and dynamic, with the politics of groups subject to internal and external influences and fluctuations.</p>

<p>Scholars have largely considered French Great War veterans’ associations to be supportive of the Third Republic. The first associations were founded before the end of the Great War when those men who had been invalided out of the army came together to confront the injustices of the pensions system. Based mainly on the middle class and with a strong presence in rural France, no other formation at the time came to possess such a dense associational network.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265691411428032">1</xref></sup> For many veterans the decision to join an association depended little on their social status or politics. In fact, the choice of association seems not to have been governed by any particular logic. Working-class veterans joined conservative groups as much as any other. Left-wing associations counted middle-class veterans among their members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265691411428032">2</xref></sup> In this respect, Antoine Prost argues that the veterans’ movement was inherently Republican and impervious to extremist politics: it was ‘one of the major obstacles to the development of fascism in France’. The Republicanism of veterans’ associations and their extensive implantation throughout France therefore testified to the democratic nature of French society at large.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265691411428032">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The benignity of veterans’ associations is questionable. They regarded themselves as different to other social pressure groups. Their members had shed their blood for France and thus the associations claimed a privileged status in society. From this perceived moral authority stemmed a robust anti-parliamentarianism that pitted the selfless and national-minded veterans against corrupt politicians. Consequently the associations ostensibly rejected all political involvement with the exception of the Communist Party’s Association républicaine des anciens combattants (ARAC). Yet it is not true that they were ‘an apolitical, unanimous and indistinct group’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0265691411428032">4</xref></sup> Rather, some veterans chose to express their politics through membership of political parties and leagues and not their veterans’ association.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0265691411428032">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the interwar years, two associations dominated the movement. The Union fédérale (UF) was the largest veterans’ association during the 1930s. Founded at Lyon in February 1918, the provincial groups responsible for its creation ensured that the UF had a democratic organization and structure. The association’s politics lay on the centre-left and it became close to the centrist Radical party. The UF was strongest in the south east and the Nivernais as well as other areas where strong personalities dominated such as Henri Pichot in the Loiret. The UF’s main rival was the Union nationale des combattants (UNC), founded in Paris on 11 November 1918. Unlike the UF, the UNC received a grant from Clemenceau and benefited from the support of the army, the Church and several business interests. It spread throughout traditionally conservative areas, and was strongest in the Breton and Aquitaine west, north and east of the Parisian basin, the Ardennes and the Nord. In terms of its structure, the UNC was less democratic than the UF. Section presidents were selected on the basis of military rank and officers were numerous among its departmental and national leadership. At the height of their membership in 1932 the UF and the UNC counted approximately 900,000–950,000 members each. In total, 3 million veterans belonged to an association.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0265691411428032">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UF was instrumental in founding the Confédération nationale des anciens combattants et victimes de la guerre, an inter-associational body, in March 1928. The UNC’s reception of the Confédération was lukewarm. Its relatively low number of provincial groups meant that the UNC’s delegates were outnumbered by those of the UF. The Confédération met throughout the 1930s. Its principal purpose was to act as a forum in which representatives of myriad associations could debate matters affecting veterans. After 1934 the UNC and UF increasingly sidelined the inter-associational body in favour of independent action.</p>
<p>In foreign policy, the UNC and the UF differed throughout the 1920s. Unlike the UF, the UNC was steadfastly hostile to Germany. It rejected Wilsonian ideas on peacemaking and regarded the League of Nations with suspicion. UNC leaders and members alike rebuffed any notion of contact with the wartime adversary from the end of the Great War until 1934. In 1925, when the UF pursued rapprochement with German veterans’ associations, the UNC was unreceptive. Though the UNC was unwilling to accept Briandism throughout the 1920s it eventually adopted this approach to foreign policy in the Confédération’s motion of June 1931, which called for the international organization of world and European financial affairs. Hitler’s gains in the elections of 1930 and growing <italic>revanchisme</italic> in Germany appear to have motivated the UNC’s change of heart.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0265691411428032">7</xref></sup> Nevertheless, old suspicions persisted. Soon after Hitler’s accession to the chancellery, UNC executive member Paul Galland advised veterans to be wary of Germany’s newfound pacifism. Early acts of persecution against the German Jewish population had revealed once again Germany’s ‘natural brutality’. Such violence, met with mute passivity from the population, underscored the continued predilection for force of France’s eastern neighbour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0265691411428032">8</xref></sup> Whipped up into a frenzy, Germans had rediscovered their ‘insolent atavism and contempt’ for perceived inferiors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0265691411428032">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the 1930s, the UNC became more prominent not only in the veterans’ movement but also in domestic politics. On 6 February 1934 the association joined nationalist groups on the streets of Paris in a protest that toppled the centre-left government of Edouard Daladier. The night soon descended into a riot as violent charges towards the Chamber of Deputies drew gunfire from police. Thirteen people died from gunshot wounds and hundreds were injured, including 53 UNC members. Subsequently UNC presidents Georges Lebecq (February 1934–December 1935) and Jean Goy (December 1935–autumn 1940) took the association in a political direction. They endorsed the extra-parliamentary leagues and encouraged co-operation with their members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0265691411428032">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>A fervent propagandist, Lebecq was a familiar figure in political circles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0265691411428032">11</xref></sup> Vice-president of the Parti démocrate populaire’s Parisian federation and a member of the Jeunesses patriotes (JP), he won a seat on the Parisian municipal council in 1929 with the backing of the right-wing Fédération républicaine (FR). Lebecq led the UNC march in February 1934 and was instrumental in its organization. His connection to the JP paid dividends after the loss of his council seat to a Popular Front candidate in May 1935. Lebecq quickly found a post as <italic>conseiller général</italic> of the Seine in Neuilly, where the local JP leader was forced to withdraw his own candidature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0265691411428032">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lebecq’s successor to the UNC leadership, Jean Goy, was a deputy. He also held membership in the extreme right-wing league, the Croix de Feu. Yet Goy was hardly an assiduous activist. By 1931 he had attended only one meeting. Nevertheless, the Croix de Feu recognized that as mayor of Perreux, Goy’s attitude had always been ‘correct’. He had consistently invited the local section to patriotic ceremonies. For this reason, Croix de Feu activists supported Goy’s candidacy in the elections of 1932.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0265691411428032">13</xref></sup> Under Goy’s leadership, the UNC entered into collaboration with political groups, notably the Parti social français (PSF), the Croix de Feu’s successor after Popular Front prime minister, Léon Blum, dissolved the leagues in the summer of 1936. This collaboration benefited Goy in 1937 when the PSF withdrew its electoral candidate in Falaise and advised members to vote for the UNC president in the name of anti-communism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0265691411428032">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is the underlying thesis of this article that the veterans’ movement cannot be understood by reference to its allegedly Republican essence. Examination of the veterans’ associations reveals the complex nature of late Third Republican politics. Recent research has shown that in interwar France the doctrines of political groups were not monolithic. Divisions over policy existed within extreme right-wing groups during the 1920s and 1930s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0265691411428032">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, the political climate of the late Third Republic was dynamic and creative. The boundaries between left and right were not easily defined.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0265691411428032">16</xref></sup> Similarly, the UF and the UNC were diverse associations. Members competed over the meaning of their groups’ policies, actions and external relations. Though it will be argued that the UF and the UNC eventually embraced authoritarianism, this move to the right was not inevitable. Throughout the 1930s, political positions shifted. In the case of the UNC, the executive committee was sometimes split between an activist tendency, which advocated political intervention, and a more moderate faction that favoured concentrating solely on veteran-specific issues such as pensions. The mass membership too was split by similar concerns. At different times and in different circumstances, a particular tendency could gain the upper hand but could also be subject to reversals. It is wrong to assume that a historically conditioned Republican nature, common to all ex-servicemen and unwavering throughout the period, existed at all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0265691411428032">17</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec1-0265691411428032"><title>1934: The Veterans and Reform of the Republic</title>
<p>The riot of 6 February 1934 witnessed the outbreak of an undeclared civil war in France.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0265691411428032">18</xref></sup> Nascent co-operation between the socialists and communists, in reaction to the failed ‘fascist coup’ of February, resulted in the formation of the Popular Front the following year. Meanwhile, the extreme right-wing National Front coalition called for battle in the street against the left.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0265691411428032">19</xref></sup> The Croix de Feu, a paramilitary league led by Colonel François de La Rocque, attracted hundreds of thousands of men and women to its various auxiliaries. Supporters of the left and right took to the streets of France as the self-appointed representatives of the French people. What followed was a conflict between popular sovereignty as expressed in street demonstrations and the legal representation of this sovereignty in parliament.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0265691411428032">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Only the Parisian section of the UNC took part in the riot of 6 February. Some provincial UNC sections were unhappy at their Parisian counterparts’ involvement in the violence, yet reactions were diverse and one cannot state that one opinion prevailed over another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0265691411428032">21</xref></sup> In the aftermath of the violence, the UNC challenged the right of parliament to represent the national interest. It framed its protest as an expression of the will of the entire population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0265691411428032">22</xref></sup> In its role as the voice of public opinion, the UNC asked:<disp-quote>
<p>Has the divorce between parliament and the nation ever been as flagrant as on 7 February? Parliament can no longer say that it reflects the opinion of the country since, the day before, it accorded a majority to a government that public opinion drove out the next day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0265691411428032">23</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The association’s participation in a protest allegedly sanctioned by the people of France legitimized the street as the repository of popular sovereignty, embodied in conservative veterans and not in parliament.</p>
<p>The UF immediately disavowed the UNC’s participation in street violence. It would later claim that the rioters had wanted to ‘shake the legal order’, rather than protect it, as the UNC claimed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0265691411428032">24</xref></sup> Association president Henri Pichot argued that it was not on 6 February 1934 that the people of France had defended the regime, but on 12 February, when the left had mobilized its activists throughout the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0265691411428032">25</xref></sup> The UF could not accept that street action had removed the government, and a Radical government at that.</p>
<p>After the fall of Daladier’s administration the conservative former president Gaston Doumergue formed a government of national union. Ministerial stability was considered the key to confronting a resurgent Germany and the perceived menace to French security that this entailed. Yet the regime had apparently failed to provide this stability. Following the spectacle of deputies entangled in financial scandals, government instability and the violence of the riot, many in French society, including those who had previously simply paid lip service to reform projects, now became convinced proponents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0265691411428032">26</xref></sup> The Chamber formed the Marchandeau commission to examine reform projects. Among the political parties reform programmes were ostensibly similar, advocating the right of the prime minister to dissolve parliament without the prior agreement of the Senate, the enforcement of limitations on deputies’ financial powers, the introduction of proportional representation and the reorganization of the premier’s office.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0265691411428032">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet differences lay in the method of reform. The centrist parties sought to effect change within the confines of the existing regime. For them, to grant the prime minister the right to dissolve the legislature was too great a threat to parliamentary sovereignty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0265691411428032">28</xref></sup> Reform, enacted by the Chamber and without revision of the constitution, would progressively improve the efficiency and competence of the system without straying from the Republican ideal. Proportional representation would also improve the quality of men entering parliamentary posts. Yet the reformist fervour of spring 1934 caused policy shifts, if only temporarily, in the parties of the centre. The Alliance démocratique’s manifesto of May 1934 adopted the idea of dissolution. The Radical party harboured revisionists in its right wing, including some who were prepared to call a constituent assembly to reform the Republic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0265691411428032">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the arrival of the Doumergue government, the UNC acquired a renewed sense of optimism. Galland wrote that at last the ‘abscess had been lanced’ and that the government imposed by the veterans could now begin the purification of parliamentary mores.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0265691411428032">30</xref></sup> The association had long been interested in matters of state reform. It favoured constitutional revision by means of a constituent assembly of extra-parliamentary figures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0265691411428032">31</xref></sup> The UNC’s plan differed from that of the Republican centre. With the parliamentary tactics of the left in mind, the UNC’s civic action programme stated that electoral reform would banish forever the ‘impotent spectacle’, ‘impasse’ and ‘paralysis’ that the socialists and the Radical party brought to the Chamber, as they tried to transpose their electoral alliance into a functioning government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0265691411428032">32</xref></sup> Its plan sought to reduce the number of deputies in parliament altogether. In March 1934, Paris UNC section vice-president Roux-Desbreaux suggested that the number of parliamentarians be limited to 200 deputies and 100 senators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0265691411428032">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UF saw things differently. Traditionally reticent on matters of state reform, it opposed discussion of the issue at the Confédération’s congress of March 1933. Like the centre parties, the UF feared that constitutional revision would threaten the Republican regime. Similar opinions were expressed in the provinces. The <italic>loiretaine</italic> UF agreed that the constitutional laws, although not perfect, should remain untouched. It was the politicians, not the regime, who were not fit for purpose. Until February 1934, the UF favoured the collaboration of the veterans’ associations with the public powers rather than the modification of the regime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0265691411428032">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>After February 1934 the UF reconsidered its position on state reform. The association now discerned a divorce between parliament and public opinion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0265691411428032">35</xref></sup> It could not accept that street violence had toppled an elected Radical government and brought the conservative Doumergue to power. If this was now the means by which governments were formed then the parliamentary system was discredited and reform of the regime was a necessity. Reform was only possible through extra-parliamentary means. The same UF section in the Loiret that had previously rejected state reform now recognized its necessity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0265691411428032">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UNC also modified its attitude to reform after the riot. Whereas it had favoured extra-parliamentary methods, the UNC now placed great hope in the Doumergue government: France had taken the first step on the road to salvation. With the right in power, the association believed that reform would come from <italic>within</italic> the parliamentary system. The UNC hoped that Doumergue would swiftly introduce proportional representation, dissolve parliament and then hold new elections. Both the UF and the UNC were in agreement on the need for state reform, but their positions were based on different political loyalties. Nevertheless, their apparent agreement gave new impetus to discussion of reform within the veterans’ movement. In March 1934, the Confédération’s own commission on state reform, the so-called <italic>commission des 19</italic>, agreed on a programme of reform similar to the UNC’s that supported proportional representation, female suffrage and the dissolution of the legislature after electoral reform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0265691411428032">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following month, in response to Doumergue’s request that the veterans accept a 3 per cent reduction on all pensions, the veterans’ movement made an audacious demand. On 12 April 1934, the Confédération’s council met to discuss the government’s offer. The organization accepted the reduction under the proviso that the government begin the process of national recovery defined according to the veterans’ reform programme of March, with a deadline of 1 July. The associations would review the government’s progress at the meeting of the Confédération on 7–8 July 1934 and pass judgement on whether or not the government had fulfilled their requirements. If the veterans decided that the government had not acted in a satisfactory manner, they would topple it by forcing Georges Rivollet, minister for pensions and head of the Confédération, to resign his portfolio.</p>
<p>Following the veterans’ demonstration in February and the Confédération’s ultimatum, the attention of the press fell on the veterans’ national congresses. <italic>Le Matin</italic> recognized the significance of the UNC’s meeting at Metz in May 1934. Moving beyond the concerns of a single association, the veterans were meeting to decide once again whether to respond to the call of the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0265691411428032">38</xref></sup> The left-wing press saw more sinister motives behind the UNC’s congress. <italic>L’Humanité</italic> warned that the ‘fascists’ in the UNC were using the congress to prepare another assault in the style of the February troubles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0265691411428032">39</xref></sup> Press reports devoted special attention to Goy’s statements on electoral and state reform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0265691411428032">40</xref></sup> Goy explained that 6 February had witnessed the initial stage of a revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0265691411428032">41</xref></sup> It was not the end of the UNC’s efforts. A revolutionary period was underway. The next step would be constitutional and state reform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0265691411428032">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>In May 1934, the UF’s congress at Vichy came under the spotlight. Henri Pichot was no less convinced of the need to reform the Republic than the UNC’s leader. He had previously rejected all political involvement, yet the events of 6 February 1934 influenced his decision to embrace reformism. At the Vichy congress he issued a warning to the Doumergue government. <italic>Le Matin</italic> reported:<disp-quote>
<p>If on this date [8 July] the government has neither curbed fraud, nor ended judicial scandals, nor reduced the cost of living, nor initiated fiscal reform, it will be the breaking point. A coalition team will get to work and take the helm. The audience, dumbfounded but dominated, applauded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0265691411428032">43</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Similar threats appeared in the UNC’s press. Désiré Tritsch, vice-president of the UNC’s Oise section, compared the 8 July deadline to the decision in 1792 to build the Republic on the ‘burning walls of a tired and impotent regime’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0265691411428032">44</xref></sup> Hubert Aubert, editor of the UNC’s national newspaper <italic>La Voix du combattant</italic>, warned of government dupery if the deadline was postponed. Yet he was aware of the consequences if the veterans decided to bring down the government: ‘In breaking brutally [with the government] we would commit a revolutionary act. Is it the right time?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0265691411428032">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ultimately, Doumergue failed to profit from the confidence he enjoyed among the population and parties alike, which would have forced the usually reticent Senate to accept dissolution of the Chamber.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0265691411428032">46</xref></sup> Doumergue himself was reluctant to initiate reform, which he considered a partisan issue, when his mission was to look after the national interest. In May, when the recommendations of the Marchandeau commission came before the Chamber, the government abstained from the vote on electoral reform as was traditional for incumbent administrations in such matters. The advocates of reform lost by 11 votes. The fever of February 1934 had passed and cool heads reasserted themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0265691411428032">47</xref></sup> Although hailed by some as a national saviour, for the left Doumergue was still a man of the right. He had come to power through the action of leaguers and fascists, a fact that undermined the perceived legitimacy of his government. For the centre parties, their concern lay in preserving the parliamentary regime. The question of constitutional revision remained the <italic>bête noire</italic> of the centrist camp.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0265691411428032">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>With electoral reform part of the veterans’ agenda, it seemed unlikely that they would now support the government on 8 July. The Popular Front and the Croix de Feu announced public gatherings for the same day, so heightening public anticipation of the veterans’ deadline. Additionally, a UNC ceremony at the inauguration of a war memorial in the fourth <italic>arrondissement</italic> would be preceded by a parade at Place de la Bastille. With the forces of the left and right taking to the streets, a revolution appeared likely to some. Rumours spread throughout France. <italic>La Croix</italic> reported that the veterans had caused some fear in ‘high places’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0265691411428032">49</xref></sup> This was not only true of those in government. Police reports show that the public feared violence if the veterans pronounced themselves dissatisfied with the administration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0265691411428032">50</xref></sup> <italic>Le Populaire</italic> reported: ‘Everyone is talking about the 8 July’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0265691411428032">51</xref></sup> Colonel de La Rocque warned his followers to maintain their sang-froid, amid stories of ‘mysterious meetings’ and ‘interchangeable and sensational alliances’ that threatened bloodshed in the capital.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0265691411428032">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Opinion was divided over the veterans’ intentions. Referring to the recent congresses, <italic>Le Matin</italic> concluded that the policies outlined at these meetings demonstrated that the veterans were not just ‘talking hot air’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0265691411428032">53</xref></sup> Gustave Hervé of <italic>Victoire</italic> was more sceptical: ‘A Constituent Assembly called by the veterans’ associations? … What a shambles! What a Tower of Babel! A new Chamber of Deputies!’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0265691411428032">54</xref></sup> Revolutions, Hervé wrote, did not occur on fixed dates. <italic>Le Temps</italic> warned that the veterans would become simply another political formation if they took up politics. They had defended the entire nation during the war and not their individual conception of this nation that now threatened to split the movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0265691411428032">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the event, at the meeting of 7–8 July, though the government had plainly failed to meet the veterans’ demands, the movement could not decide what to do about it. A motion intended to oblige Rivollet to resign was defeated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0265691411428032">56</xref></sup> On this matter, the UF and the UNC were split. The UNC supported the Doumergue government and so refused to topple Rivollet. Still hostile to the incumbent administration, the UF voted in favour of forcing Rivollet to resign. The UF’s reaction indicated just how far it had moved into the reformist camp. The association delivered a stinging criticism of the Confédération for failing to follow through with the veterans’ threat to bring down the government. The UF was now prepared to accept reform through a constituent assembly. This was a remarkable turnaround for an association that had once shunned all discussion of extra-parliamentary reform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0265691411428032">57</xref></sup> Yet divisions existed amongst provincial UF sections. In the Loiret, the section in Tigy deplored the ‘political’ action of the federation. In Cravant and Coulmiers, veterans expressed the desire to leave the UF for it no longer offered the political neutrality that they believed it once had. Conversely, the section in Bernon backed the UF’s programme.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0265691411428032">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UNC did not believe that Doumergue had satisfied the veterans’ demands but it favoured the postponement of the deadline. Goy made it clear that the association did not want to cause another ministerial crisis. One should not regard the UNC’s action as a conversion to parliamentary democracy. The value and legitimacy of the Republic in the eyes of the UNC was dependent upon the political colours of the incumbent government. A right-wing administration was more acceptable than one of the left. Provincial UNC groups did not unanimously support the national association’s decision. The Limousin group voted against granting the government an extension, in opposition to the vote of the national UNC.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0265691411428032">59</xref></sup> Gérard de Cromières, the section president, criticized the Parisian leadership for its ignorance of provincial opinion and its vulnerability to government intrigue.</p>
<p>The conservative press praised the UNC for its decision. Henry de Kérillis of <italic>Echo de Paris</italic> thanked UNC luminaries Goy, Lebecq and Victor Beauregard for defeating a politically motivated motion against the government. <italic>Le Figaro</italic> expressed relief at the veterans’ decision, as did <italic>La Croix</italic>, which claimed that the veterans had avoided being drawn into the revolutionary plans of the neo-socialists and <italic>syndicalistes</italic>. While affording the veterans the right to judge the acts of the national government, <italic>Le Temps</italic> nevertheless required that this judgement be moral and not political.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0265691411428032">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UF and UNC’s campaign for state reform reveals the extent to which circumstances weighed on the associations’ policies. The urgency of the moment caused adaptations and reversals in both associations. Though inherently anti-parliamentarian, the UNC was now prepared to support a government that had been installed through direct action, of which it had been a part. The UF moved closer to the UNC’s position, abandoning its neutrality when it feared that the regime had finally broken down. With Doumergue’s failure to transform the Republic, the UNC again confronted a regime that could not reform itself. The UF did not share this pessimism. It was satisfied to see the centre reassert itself in Pierre-Etienne Flandin’s government. In spite of Pichot’s warning to Flandin that his government was the last chance for parliament, the UF’s more extreme demands now faded. Tellingly, no motion on state reform was published in the motions of the national congress in 1935.</p>
<p>Ten days after Doumergue fell in November 1934, Lebecq spoke at a meeting of the Lyon UNC. He claimed that the state of France before and after February had remained the same.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0265691411428032">61</xref></sup> Etienne Bourrut-Lacouture of the UNC wrote: ‘If electoral reform … does not happen with parliament, then it will happen without it’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0265691411428032">62</xref></sup> Aubert suggested a radical treatment:<disp-quote>

<sec id="sec2-0265691411428032"><title>1935–1937: Between the Extreme Right and the Popular Front</title>
<p>In the years following the February riot, the manoeuvres of the Popular Front and the nationalist leagues split France. Recent research has shown that left and right competed for leadership of ‘the people’ of France and the right to be recognized as the mouthpiece of the populace. Yet political boundaries were not fixed to the traditional constituencies of left and right: the leagues and the right laid claim to the workers while the Popular Front took up national celebrations such as Armistice Day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0265691411428032">64</xref></sup> The veterans took part in this symbolic battle. On 11 November 1934, when nationalist associations planned to commemorate the armistice with a large procession, 28 veterans’ associations decided to parade from the Place de la Bastille to the Place de la Nation. This show of unity was intended to wrest the claim to the <italic>anciens combattants</italic> from leagues such as the Croix de Feu.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0265691411428032">65</xref></sup> The UNC did not take part. In fact, the association moved <italic>closer</italic> to the Croix de Feu.</p>
<p>Founded as a veterans’ association and steeped in the language of the veteran mystique, the Croix de Feu attracted not a few UNC veterans who accepted the league as part of the veterans’ world. In certain cases, veterans even abandoned the UNC for La Rocque’s league.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0265691411428032">66</xref></sup> Lebecq’s appearance at the side of the colonel at a public ceremony on 14 July 1935 appeared to cement collaboration between the two groups, though the UNC president claimed to have attended in a purely personal capacity.</p>
<p>Lebecq’s action angered some on the UNC’s executive committee. Several committee members, and especially UNC president of honour Humbert Isaac, were less inclined to political activism. They rejected the co-operation with the extreme right that some of their comrades endorsed. Isaac was closest to what one may identify as a conservative Republican trend in the movement. He denounced the Croix de Feu’s violent tactics for he feared that the division of France between left and right would end in civil war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0265691411428032">67</xref></sup> Discontent arose among provincial sections too. Some feared that the cohesion of their association was under threat.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0265691411428032">68</xref></sup> Indeed police reported that at the heart of the UNC a scission between the left and right wings of the movement seemed likely. In this eventuality, Lebecq and his followers would join the Croix de Feu.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0265691411428032">69</xref></sup> Goy took advantage of provincial discontent to instigate a campaign against Lebecq that would contribute to his own succession to the association’s presidency in December 1935.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0265691411428032">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UF, officially neutral but sympathetic to the Popular Front, was also concerned about the UNC’s apparent politicization and its relationship with the Croix de Feu. In December 1935, Pichot warned that if the Croix de Feu was successful in recruiting local veteran leaders it could gain a foothold in their associations without the knowledge of members. He claimed that the veterans of a district could wake up one day and find they were Croix de Feu.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0265691411428032">71</xref></sup> In July 1936, relations between the UNC and UF hit a low when Pichot demanded that the UNC declare itself a political association, a political league even, and leave the Confédération.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0265691411428032">72</xref></sup> He repeated the accusation a month later despite Goy’s response in defence of the UNC.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0265691411428032">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the electoral victory of the Popular Front in May 1936, the UNC despaired of the situation in France. The association attacked the government with unprecedented ferocity. <italic>La Voix du combattant</italic> claimed that France was now a ‘sovietized country’ under a ‘Republic of Soviets’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0265691411428032">74</xref></sup> The UF reacted differently. Though the federation repeated the call for veterans to replace the ‘old men’ of politics, the UF recognized that the parliamentary regime had found some stability under the coalition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0265691411428032">75</xref></sup> Pichot expressed a renewed optimism, stating in January 1937 that there was still life to be found in democracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0265691411428032">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UNC was not alone in its anti-communism. The parliamentary right moved closer to the extremes as anti-communism came to dominate its political concerns. The FR, once a party of conservative republicanism, now counted extremists Xavier Vallat and Philippe Henriot amongst its leading activists. Anti-communism was not unique to the right. From the outset, neither right-wing Radical deputies nor the party’s supporters were unanimously in favour of a left-wing coalition. Furthermore, among sectors of the left the industrial unrest of summer 1936 planted the seeds of disquiet, and some radicals, socialists and trade unionists began to question the alliance with communism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0265691411428032">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>Anti-communism dictated the UNC’s action throughout the following two years in its foreign and domestic outlook. Its campaign for rapprochement with Germany gained new impetus. Despite the growing threat from Germany following the remilitarization of the Rhineland and the agreement of the Rome–Berlin axis, the UNC perceived communism to be the more immediate danger.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0265691411428032">78</xref></sup> Certain voices in the association came to view German plans in the East with indifference. Leader of the UNC’s youth groups, Jacques Raudot, argued that if France could appear militarily strong Hitler would perhaps look east to satisfy his ‘expansionist dreams’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0265691411428032">79</xref></sup> In 1937, <italic>La Voix du combattant</italic> featured a series of interviews on the subject of Franco-German rapprochement with Drieu La Rochelle, senator Henry-Hae and deputy Victor Bataille, all of whom endorsed closer co-operation with Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0265691411428032">80</xref></sup> The UNC’s youth movement was keen to establish relations with its German counterparts. In August 1937 the heads of German youth organizations met with the Jeunes de l’UNC (JUNC) in Paris. In early 1938, 25 JUNC members visited Munich in response to an invitation by the Hitler Youth.</p>
<p>Concerning domestic politics, the UNC’s executive committee decided to launch a new initiative, the Rassemblement français, which would be open to all Frenchmen, not just the veterans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0265691411428032">81</xref></sup> Ostensibly, the Rassemblement was intended to encourage national reconciliation at a time of conflict and division in France. Yet it excluded groups deemed to be working contrary to the national interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0265691411428032">82</xref></sup> It was a political initiative aimed at uniting the nationalist right. The new policy split the UNC’s leadership. President of the Nord section, Aimé Goudaert expressed concern that in his region any campaign against the Popular Front would alienate the 10,000 socialists and communists in his group. Nationally, he feared that the association would lose a third of its members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0265691411428032">83</xref></sup> Isaac favoured a moral campaign for national reconciliation rather than a political programme.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0265691411428032">84</xref></sup> Conversely, UNC section president Morizot wholly backed a political campaign against communism. He was prepared to accept a ‘thinning out’ of the UNC’s ranks as long as those who were ‘to march’ remained committed to the cause.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0265691411428032">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Blum devalued the franc in September 1936, an action that Goy claimed proved the Popular Front’s desire for ‘revolution, bankruptcy and war’, the UNC instructed all departmental sections to establish relations with groups on the left and right in the offensive against Moscow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0265691411428032">86</xref></sup> For the first time, formal links with political groups, the Radical party, the PSF, the Parti républicain national et social (formerly the Jeunesses patriotes) and Jacques Doriot’s Parti populaire français (PPF), were openly encouraged rather than tacitly endorsed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0265691411428032">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>Led from Paris, the Rassemblement found support amongst provincial UNC veterans, yet this was not unanimous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0265691411428032">88</xref></sup> As in the past, moderates and activists came into conflict over the meaning of the UNC’s civic action. In January 1937, Goy told the executive committee that each day the Rassemblement was making progress, yet this was not without difficulties. In some departments there had been strong reactions against the idea. Some members of the committee were not pleased with the PSF’s participation. Maillard of the Manche UNC feared that La Rocque’s followers would infiltrate the UNC. Patay, responsible for the UNC in the Ille-et-Vilaine, objected to the recruitment of veterans into political parties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0265691411428032">89</xref></sup> La Rocque’s movement was no longer a league but a political party, yet, unlike Patay, some UNC veterans did not draw a distinction between the two. The PSF continued to recruit veterans. In fact some UNC veterans chose to join the PSF where they had previously rejected co-operation with the Croix de Feu. The UNC’s Senlis (Oise) section took this course of action in late 1936, offering to combine with the local PSF section.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0265691411428032">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>In May 1937, the leadership decided that the Rassemblement would become a ‘campaign of ideas’ rather than a political action. Maillard demanded that the association renounce politics and concentrate solely on the veterans’ material demands. He said that the Rassemblement had failed because it had divided provincial groups. For the activists in the UNC, this change of tactic amounted to a defeat. The reluctance and relative moderation of some UNC members had reined in the political ambitions of sections of the leadership. Former UNC president Henry Rossignol alleged that certain members had undermined the campaign from the start.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0265691411428032">91</xref></sup> In spite of this reversal, anti-communism continued to mark the UNC’s discourse.</p>
<p>With the fall of Doumergue, the UNC’s high hopes for reform were dashed. Certain members of the association’s leadership and membership now pursued their goals by extra-parliamentary means. The UNC sought collaboration, officially and unofficially with groups that did not support the parliamentary Republic. Collaboration with the leagues existed from the highest to the lowest level of the UNC. Undoubtedly an admirer of La Rocque’s league, Lebecq wanted to take the UNC in a new, more openly political direction. This view found echo among section members throughout France. Some UNC veterans did not reject the Croix de Feu as ‘a foreign body’, something different and otherworldly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0265691411428032">92</xref></sup> In fact, they perceived the Croix de Feu to be an association with which co-operation could be pursued. Nevertheless, one must be cautious about the scale of UNC collaboration with the Croix de Feu. Many members rejected political involvement. Like his predecessor, UNC president Goy engaged the association in politics. He expanded links with nationalist groups and was supported in this by sections of the membership. Yet opposition to the Rassemblement among his comrades succeeded in changing the strategy of the UNC’s initiative.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0265691411428032"><title>1938: The Campaign for Public Safety</title>
<p>In 1938, the Popular Front entered its final months of existence. Its tenure in power had not been easy. In foreign policy, Blum refused to engage France in the Spanish Civil War, much to the anger of the communists. Domestically, the flow of capital from France was steady and unrelenting. Able to satisfy neither the left nor the right in his attempts to shore up the French economy, Blum announced a pause in reform in February 1937 and requested decree powers in June. When the Radical-controlled Senate refused, the premier resigned. By 1938, after the unsuccessful attempts of two governments to regain some momentum, divisions in the left-wing alliance seemed irreconcilable. Dissenting Radical deputies found support among the largely conservative body of Radical senators and the <italic>jeunesses radicales-socialistes</italic>. The right of the party feared further social disorder and labour legislation as the Popular Front neared two years in office.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0265691411428032">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>Blum’s second term as prime minister, which began on 9 March 1938, lasted barely a month and sealed the coalition’s failure. The government of his successor, Edouard Daladier, would eventually allay the fears of conservatives. In August, Daladier announced the end of the 40-hour week. France would be put back to work. In October, the communist party voted against the government, angry at the Munich agreement and the Radicals’ increasingly conservative policies. After he crushed a general strike on 30 November, the course that Daladier took resulted in the complete defeat of the left. Framing his actions as in the interest of national and moral renovation, Daladier profited from the widespread feeling that France needed a return to authority. Where Blum had attempted to strengthen the prime minister’s office in co-operation with parliament, Daladier considered the office as in opposition to the Chamber. He ruled largely with decree powers and used the radio to establish a direct link with the people. The approval of parliament became a largely symbolic gesture. In July 1939, Daladier postponed the parliamentary session until 1942.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0265691411428032">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>The veterans’ associations could not escape the climate of authoritarianism in France. During 1938, the UF and the UNC embarked upon a period of unprecedented co-operation around a programme for a government of public safety. The programme originated in the UF in March 1938, soon after Germany’s annexation of Austria. Hitler’s move, unchallenged by France, outraged the UF’s leadership. Pichot placed the date February 1938 alongside those of historic French defeats: 1815, 1843 and 1871. UF activist René Cassin wrote that France had capitulated in the face of the dictators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0265691411428032">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>After Blum’s second fall from office, Pichot urged President Lebrun to appoint Marshal Pétain as leader of France. When Lebrun refused, the UF presented a motion for a public safety government to the press on 17 March 1938. The new administration would operate without the input of parliament. Parliamentary democracy had momentarily ‘exhausted its virtue’ and would need to ‘take its medicine’ if it was not to become defunct. Pichot warned that if the parties refused to accept the truce outlined in his plan then they would find the country ranged against them, with parliament as a new ‘Bastille’ and a ‘feudal tower’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0265691411428032">96</xref></sup> Considering Pichot had still believed democracy was full of life in January 1937, this represented a stark reversal for the UF.</p>
<p>On 2 April 1938, the UNC declared its support for the public safety campaign. Raudot refused to see an answer in parliamentary democracy. He argued that legality lay with the people of France, and only the people, and not the political parties, could save the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0265691411428032">97</xref></sup> The veterans hoped that Lebrun would respond to their calls. The UNC circulated petitions, intended to arouse public pressure, which would then be presented to Lebrun.</p>
<p>In October 1938, the UF and the UNC renewed their plea for a public safety government. They now specified that the government should be given full powers for one year or even until the elections in 1940.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0265691411428032">98</xref></sup> The new plan found support in the veterans’ movement and beyond. In <italic>La Voix du combattant</italic>, André Gervais, a UF veteran and prolific author within the movement, claimed that six million men were willing to join the ‘last battle’ of the veterans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0265691411428032">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>One <italic>can</italic> argue that the veterans’ plan was more moderate than those of other groups. Though it advocated an authoritarian government, the plan did not support the establishment of a dictatorship like some of the leagues did. Veteran leaders such as Goy and Pichot did not envisage taking power for themselves. Nevertheless, the plan was not Republican or democratic. Concern for political pluralism in both associations was slight.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0265691411428032">100</xref></sup> Raudot stated that all parties should disband. If they refused, the government should forcibly dissolve them. During the period of reform, parties would not be allowed to operate. The government would ‘adopt parliamentary methods without parliament’, ‘liberated’ from the encumbrance of elections and able to act with complete independence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0265691411428032">101</xref></sup> UNC activist Gabriel Berthau supported the idea that no one in the new government should be a member of a political party. Similarly, Pichot insisted that the parties ‘suspend themselves’ (<italic>se mettre en vacances</italic>) and that parliament should resign. Paul Patou of the UF advocated ‘putting the parties on ice’ (<italic>mise en sommeil</italic>) as the only way to get to the root of the evil in parliament.</p>
<p>A leading ‘national’ personality, probably from the armed forces, would lead the government. Around him, a group of honest, competent and unelected men (such as the veterans) would form the government. Parliament, reduced in size and disarmed of its obstructive powers, would ratify the decisions of the executive. Enemies of the state, that is to say those deemed to be in opposition to the single national interest, would be punished. The veterans would make the regime more ‘efficient’, but only according to their own definition of efficient government: a permanent authoritarian government of veterans, under a military personality, which would restore order and reduce the role of parliamentary democracy. Close to the ideas of the right and extreme right, the plan for a government of public safety was not of the Republican centre.</p>
<p>Perhaps the UF’s rapprochement with the UNC was part of a shift to the right of the middle classes and the Radical party, to which the association was still close. Significantly, the UNC had neither softened its stance nor its rhetoric. It had not moved to the centre. During the course of 1938, members of the UNC’s executive committee discussed the scale of support within the UF for the associations’ joint action. Though Pichot’s politics now resembled those of the UNC it was unclear whether he reflected the opinion of his association. On the one hand, the president of the UNC’s Corrèze group, Lacoste, informed his colleagues that the vast majority of UF members were ‘UNC 100%’. On the other hand, Lacoste had encountered opposition from the association’s leadership. This was not the case in the Nord, Goudaert explained, where he had made every effort to co-operate with the UF without success. In fact, certain UF members had attempted to entice UNC veterans away from their sections.</p>
<p>By February 1939, the UNC was surer of the UF’s stance. Pichot’s association had consulted the UNC on everything since the public safety campaign.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0265691411428032">102</xref></sup> Furthermore, the UNC noted that it had given little ground: it was the UF that had come round to its position. Both associations had put aside their long-standing reservations about their rival. Isaac recognized that there was now no divergence between the two groups’ doctrines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0265691411428032">103</xref></sup> Notably, Isaac supported the veterans’ authoritarian plan. Though he was certainly less polemical than some of his colleagues, Isaac’s move from moderation to authoritarianism followed a path that many conservatives took when the established order appeared threatened.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0265691411428032" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>On 17 June 1940, in his first address to the nation, Marshal Pétain invoked the support of the veterans. On 28 August 1940 Vichy’s council of ministers adopted a law that merged all veterans’ associations into the Légion des combattants. Intended to be ‘the eyes and the ears’ of the Marshal, the Légion would collaborate with the government in spreading the principles of the National Revolution. Of the 15 members on the directorate of the Légion, four were former UNC veterans and four previously belonged to the UF. In the choice of departmental presidents, where the selected candidate had belonged to an association before the war, former UNC members held the largest share (13/45). Georges Lebecq was chosen as president of the movement in the occupied zone, although the German authorities soon prohibited it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0265691411428032">104</xref></sup> The veterans supported the foundation of the Vichy regime because, in their opinion, it was moral and national. In Pétain they found a leader whom they believed could represent their views and address their concerns.</p>
<p>During the 1930s the policies of the UF and the UNC were subject to struggles within each association over their meaning, and sometimes over the purpose of the association itself. External events also engendered reactions, adaptations and reversals. In 1934, men such as Lebecq and Goy sought to use the UNC for political ends. Profiting from the reformist fervour in France, Lebecq hoped to turn the UNC onto a political path. For different reasons, the UF embraced reformism and an authoritarian programme akin to that of the UNC. Yet once Doumergue was out of power, the associations moved apart again, divided over traditional political differences and the UNC’s close relationship with the extreme right. In fact, though they had been united in the campaign for state reform, their motives had differed greatly. In 1936, Goy took advantage of a sense of emergency on the right after the election of the Popular Front. He attempted to use the anti-communist Rassemblement to reorient the UNC towards politics. Other members of the UNC had different ideas. They shunned political intervention and desired that the UNC concentrate solely on issues specific to the veterans. To this end they succeeded in halting Goy’s political Rassemblement. Though the UNC’s presidents failed in making the association into a political force, they exposed members to ideas that were not Republican. When Germany annexed Austria in March 1938, even the relatively moderate voices within the UNC rallied to Pichot’s plan for the public safety government. Similarly, the UF now moved closer to the UNC and the right.</p>
<p>The analysis of the two largest veterans’ associations reveals a complex story of political fluctuations that defies simple explanation. The responses of the UF and the UNC to the events of the 1930s were not fixed. To categorize the veterans’ movement as Republican ignores the intricacies and convolutions of its history. In the politics of the late Third Republic, classifications were unclear. One may argue that French political culture was inherently democratic. Yet such an essentialist approach makes it too easy to dismiss the parties, leagues and movements that challenged French democracy. However, French society’s growing authoritarianism was not a linear and ineluctable process either. An essential nature did not govern the French veterans’ associations. We should not expect the same of French society.</p>

Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker claim that, unlike in Germany and Italy, once the material demands of the French veterans were satisfied they faded into the background. Albert Kéchichian states that the extreme right-wing Croix de Feu, although founded as a veterans’ association, was unrepresentative of the combatants’ world. Samuel Kalman does question Prost’s conclusion on the benignity of veteran rhetoric but makes no assertion on its effect on ordinary veterans.
