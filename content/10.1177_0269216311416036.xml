<title>Background:</title>
<p>Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disease with a sudden onset, a rapid progression, a profile of complex disabilities and fatal consequences. Caring for a person with MND is an unremitting commitment, yet little research has examined the experiences and needs of carers for palliative care and bereavement care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216311416036">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>This study explored the experiences of MND family carers, both during their time as carers and following bereavement. Particular attention was paid to the carers’ prolonged grief status and to the implications for service delivery, including palliative care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216311416036">
<title>Design:</title>
<p>A qualitative approach consisted of interviews with 16 bereaved family carers. The Prolonged Grief tool (PG-13) measured the carers’ prolonged grief.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216311416036">
<title>Setting/participants:</title>
<p>sixteen family carers participated in the study, between one and four years after the death of their spouse from MND in Western Australia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216311416036">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The thematic analysis of the interview transcripts revealed five themes – the work of family carers, the change in relationship from spouse to family carer, family caring as a series of losses, coping mechanisms of family carers and supportive and palliative care experiences of family carers. The six participants who met the criteria for prolonged grief disorder accessed palliative care at a later stage in the disease trajectory.</p>

<sec id="section6-0269216311416036">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The study provided a basis for more research into the role palliative care services has in supporting MND carers before and after the death of their spouse and in particular the provision of more tailored respite and bereavement support.</p>

<title>Background and introduction</title>
<p>Motor Neurone Disease (MND), also known as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a neurodegenerative disease with a sudden onset, a rapid progression, a profile of complex disabilities and fatal consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311416036">1</xref></sup>. There is no cure, no known cause and no effective treatment for MND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311416036">2</xref></sup> The average time between diagnosis and death is two to three years, with very few people surviving more than five years. Initial symptoms of MND may be weakness in the hands or feet, swallowing difficulties or slurred speech and muscle twitching and/or cramps. The disease leads to progressive muscle paralysis of the trunk and limbs and the inability to speak or swallow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311416036">1</xref></sup> In most cases, the senses and intellect are not affected.</p>
<p>The progression of MND is rapid, with the level of disability for the affected person changing over months and days, rather than years. The psychosocial impact of MND is amplified by its multifaceted nature, the speed of deterioration and the spiralling series of losses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311416036">2</xref></sup> These factors pose huge problems of adjustment for people who have MND, a challenge to health professionals involved in meeting the variable and complex care needs and an escalating burden on carers and families of people living with the disease.</p>
<sec id="section8-0269216311416036">
<title>Family carers of people with MND</title>
<p>The primary carer of a terminally ill person with MND is usually a family member and mainly a spouse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311416036">2</xref></sup> Although the role of caring can be rewarding, caring for a person with MND is an unremitting commitment, involving responsibilities such as providing emotional support, controlling feeding and fluids, learning new strategies for communication as speech deteriorates, striving to plan ahead in a situation of constant change, managing medical equipment and transferring and repositioning the person with MND as he or she becomes increasingly disabled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311416036">3</xref></sup> Approximately half of all MND family carers report spending 12 hours per day caring for the care recipient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311416036">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general, family carers who are fortunate to have sufficient support mostly feel positive about their caring experience, while those less fortunate undertake caring responsibilities at the expense of their physical, emotional and financial wellbeing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311416036">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311416036">6</xref></sup> In an Australian study of MND family carers and their care recipients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311416036">7</xref></sup> the carers were more depressed than their respective care recipients. When compared with family carers of care recipients with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease, MND family carers reported the lowest quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311416036">8</xref></sup> Further, MND carers of care recipients with high dependency needs exhibited higher anxiety, more insomnia, less service satisfaction with information giving and physical care and a poorer quality of life than carers of people requiring less support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311416036">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311416036">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The psychological needs of carers tend to become obsolete as their days increasingly comprise the physical tasks that are required to support their care recipient,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311416036">7</xref></sup> which might explain why more than 70% of family carers of people with MND score below the population norm on mental health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311416036">10</xref></sup> As the care recipients with MND become more dependent on others towards the end of their life, the total burden on the carer increases with the hours per day of care given<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311416036">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311416036">11</xref></sup> and carers tend to report more health problems with the increasing number of hours spent caring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311416036">4</xref></sup> One study of bereaved MND family carers revealed that 37% felt they were coping poorly, sometimes years after the care recipient’s death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311416036">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several social and economic difficulties for MND carers have been identified,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311416036">3</xref></sup> including the following: the level and intensity of care; inability to sustain employment; complexity of service provision; inequity of access to essential services; short fall of professional workforce available on the ground; lack of awareness and understanding of best practice care in MND and in ‘caring for carers’; inequity in the resource base of MND associations; failure to access aids and equipment in a timely manner, including access to non-invasive ventilation; lack of meaningful reimbursement through private health funding; and limited awareness on the part of the carers regarding the system of service provision. Many of these difficulties are the core unmet needs of family carers of people with neurodegenerative conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311416036">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311416036">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311416036">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>MND carers, palliative care and bereavement services</title>
<p>The needs of people with neurodegenerative conditions, such as MND, and their family carers are often poorly met by existing statutory services, both in Australia and elsewhere. Service provision is fragmented, communication is poor, goals are often not shared, early symptoms are not detected effectively and there is an unacceptable delay in access to services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311416036">8</xref></sup> The provision of services for family carers, regardless of the illness or disease of the care recipient, has often been described as ‘crisis intervention’, as it is only in crises of imminent or apparent breakdown that services respond.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311416036">14</xref></sup> Problematically, carers who do not request services are assumed to have no unmet support needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311416036">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>An Australian study suggests that involvement of palliative care providers in end-stage MND is limited and inconsistent for both the patient and the family carer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311416036">1</xref></sup> Indeed, palliative care is usually not offered nor available to individuals with chronic and progressive conditions, such as MND, or to their families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311416036">1</xref></sup> and, when it is available, the focus tends to be on the medical and physical needs of the patients; as a result, their carers receive minimal guidance or support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311416036">15</xref></sup> Even with a high level of formal service provision, there is still evidence of ill health of MND family carers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311416036">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>An essential component of palliative care is the provision of bereavement support for caregivers and their families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311416036">17</xref></sup> While most people are able to adapt to the experience of bereavement without professional intervention,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311416036">18</xref></sup> approximately 10% to 20% of bereaved people experience grief-related symptoms beyond a point thought to be adaptive,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311416036">19</xref></sup> known as prolonged grief. Prolonged grief has been defined as:<disp-quote>
<p>…a deviation from the normal (societal and cultural) grief experience in either time course, intensity, or both, entailing a chronic and more intense emotional experience or an inhibited response, which either lacks the usual symptoms or in which onset of symptoms is delayed (Stroebe et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311416036">18</xref></sup> p.1965).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The nature of care provided, the trajectory of illness, experiences of caring and a close relationship to the deceased, have been identified as risk factors for prolonged grief disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311416036">19</xref></sup> Given that the literature suggests that carers of terminally ill people may be susceptible to developing prolonged grief outcomes, it is critical to identify those persons who are likely to experience the more severe consequences of bereavement so that professional help may be channelled to those who need and will benefit from it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311416036">20</xref></sup> A key mediator of bereavement risk and outcome may include the carers’ coping style.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311416036">21</xref></sup> However, within the context of palliative care, there is a dearth of empirical work to guide the identification of specific populations, such as MND family carers, that may benefit from additional support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311416036">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Very little research has examined the psychosocial experiences and needs of MND family carers, from their time as a carer through to their bereavement. Most studies of MND family carers focused solely on service provision or attempt to assess wellbeing through more general means, such as ‘quality of life’ measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311416036">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311416036">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311416036">10</xref></sup> The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of MND family carers from their time as a carer of their spouse through to their bereavement. A qualitative approach was taken to enable the views of the participants to be at the forefront of the research. Data were drawn from face-to-face interviews with a sample of MND family carers and were supplemented by a measure of prolonged grief. The research questions were: What are the caring and bereavement experiences of MND family carers? Do these experiences differ according to prolonged grief status and if so, how? What are the implications for service delivery, including palliative care?</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269216311416036" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>An exploratory, qualitative approach was utilised to capture the experiences of the MND family carers. The research team was multidisciplinary (counselling psychology, medical demography, public health, palliative care, bereavement care, organisational behaviour and management) and comprised MND researchers, as well as service providers. One member had previously cared for a spouse with MND who passed away in 2003. The materials for this study included a demographic questionnaire, a semi-structured interview schedule and a measure of prolonged grief. The demographic questionnaire was used to collect information on each participant’s level of involvement in care (day-to-day hands-on care, intermittent hands-on care, rare hands-on care or no care),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311416036">21</xref></sup> as well as the participant’s age, relationship to the care recipient, the period of time spent as a carer and the age of the care recipient at their time of death. The semi-structured interview schedule was designed to allow the participants to describe their experiences, as a carer through to their bereavement, in their own words. All interviews began with an open-ended question, such as ‘please tell me about your experience as a carer’. Topics included the diagnosis, how it was relayed and reaction to it, experiences of palliative care (if offered/available), day-to-day coping as a carer and coping following bereavement and what else would have helped them in their role.</p>
<p>Prolonged grief was measured by the PG-13,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311416036">22</xref></sup> a 13-item tool designed to identify individuals who are exhibiting ‘prolonged’ grief reactions. The PG-13 does not measure symptoms of grief in general (i.e. both normal and pathological); rather, it alerts the user to maladaptive symptoms of grief. In order for an individual to be assessed as having prolonged grief, they must meet each of five criteria: the death of a loved person; separation distress (feelings of longing and yearning, or feelings of intense pain relating to the loss, at least daily); duration criterion (symptoms of separation distress must be present at least six months after the loss); cognitive emotional and behavioural symptoms (e.g. preoccupation with thoughts of the deceased, searching and yearning for the deceased, disbelief about the death, crying, being stunned by the death and inability to accept the death); and significant impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning (e.g. domestic responsibilities). The PG-13 demonstrates specificity, reliability, validity and the ability to predict a variety of measures of physical and mental health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311416036">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following ethics approval from Curtin University Ethics Committee, the MND Association of Western Australia sent its members an information flyer inviting participation in the study. Interested respondents were invited to participate in an interview with the second author. These occurred at the participants’ homes or at an alternate location most convenient to them. Participation in the study was voluntary. The nature of the study was explained, each participant was asked if he or she had any further questions and each signed a consent form. The interviews lasted approximately 60–90 minutes. If participants felt unsettled after the interview, they were encouraged to contact a counselling service provided on the study’s information sheet; such services were free or low cost. The audio recordings of interview files were labelled numerically so that they were unable to be linked to the participants and each completed transcript was de-identified using a code in order to preserve confidentiality. The recordings were erased following data analysis. All participants were telephoned a week after their interview to check on their wellbeing and were sent a ‘thank you’ letter approximately one month later.</p>
<sec id="section11-0269216311416036">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Each interview was transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311416036">23</xref></sup> guided the process. The first phase of the analysis involved familiarisation with each interview transcript. Frequent ideas and experiences were marked on each transcript and a summary of each transcript’s themes and sub-themes was recorded. Next, each transcript’s themes and sub-themes were cross-checked with those identified in each remaining transcript and then developed, refined and collapsed. For example, the sub-themes of ‘constant loss’ and ‘hopelessness’ were both collapsed into the theme labelled ‘MND family caring as a series of losses’. Three authors independently reviewed the transcripts and a summary of the data was forwarded to three participants to further check for accuracy of interpretation and to provide validation of the analysis. Any differences in interpretation were considered and the transcripts were further examined until the authors were confident that the themes and sub-themes were representative of the data. Finally, quotes from the participants were chosen to illustrate the identified themes. An alphanumeric code indicating gender (M or F) and participant number is presented alongside quotes.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The recruitment strategy yielded 16 participants. The participants were 13 women and 3 men; all were bereaved family carers of a spouse who had MND. All participants were married to their care recipients. The family carers (the participants) ranged in age from 53 to 81 years (<italic>M</italic> = 65.25; SD = 10.27) and the care recipients ranged in age from 50 to 82 years (<italic>M</italic> = 65.19, SD = 9.28). At the time of data collection, the participants had been bereaved for a period of between one and four years (<italic>M</italic> = 27.5 months, SD = 13.6). All reported that they provided ‘day-to-day hands-on care’ for their spouse. The length of time to obtain a diagnosis from initial symptoms ranged from 1 to 12 months (<italic>M</italic> = 5.81 months, SD = 3.95). The length of time from diagnosisto death ranged from three months to six years (<italic>M</italic> = 22.06 months, SD = 19.07). All 16 participants reported that their spouse was offered palliative care. The results from the PG-13 assessment indicated that six participants (37.5%) met the criteria for prolonged grief and had the following concurrent and/or predisposing factors – three provided care to their spouse for more than two years, one participant recounted past trauma and two participants reported the death of another family member during the time of their spouse’s illness.</p>
<p>The thematic analysis of the transcripts yielded five themes – the work of MND family carers, the change in relationship from spouse to family carer, family caring as a series of losses, coping mechanisms of family carers and supportive and palliative care experiences of family carers. The ways in which these experiences differed according to prolonged grief status are also discussed.

<title>The work of MND family carers</title>
<p>Providing care to a dying loved one is a demanding and often overwhelming experience. The carers reported being confronted with the changes in their spouse’s level of disability on a daily basis. The participants in this study described the many practical tasks and emotional concerns for which they were responsible, such as making appointments, arranging medical needs of their spouse and attending to other daily tasks of caring (e.g. preparing food, daily cleaning duties, helping with showering and shaving). The participants also noted their responsibility for transferring and repositioning the person with MND, often throughout the night, which resulted in very little sleep for the family carer. These duties were taken up by each carer without personal regard to their own needs for sleep, recreation or exercise and were maintained even when the carer was unwell or exhausted. One participant described:<disp-quote>
<p>I think you’re traumatised, quite frankly, I think you’re traumatised. All the symptoms of trauma – numb[ness] and shock and all of those things. (F3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>

<sec id="section15-0269216311416036">
<title>The change in relationship from spouse to family carer</title>
<p>The participants described the impact that being a family carer had on their intimate relationship. Some participants indicated a sense of regret when they reflected on their change of role as going from a wife/husband to a ‘nurse’ or ‘carer’, whilst others spoke about the role change in a factual tone, suggesting that is was just ‘what you had to do’. One participant stated, ‘The wife role was gone and I was a nurse and that’s what I regret’ (F1) while another declared, ‘It ruined our marriage; you’re no longer a wife, you’re a carer’ (F5). This change was often a sudden shift, with one participant noting, ‘One minute I was working, the next I was a full-time carer’ (F9).</p>
<p>The change in role also brought the opportunity to learn new tasks and duties that previously were the realm of the care recipient. For instance, one carer proclaimed, ‘I’ve learnt some new skills, like washing up!’(M1) and another stated, ‘He always made the major decisions [so] I had to learn the finances’ (F10). The participants also described how their days became busier and longer as they undertook more of the responsibilities that were once their partners’. All of the participants described how the change from spouse to carer had a negative impact on the level of relationship intimacy. For instance, one participant recalled the following incident:<disp-quote>
<p>I turned around and I said, ‘Give me a kiss’ and I thought at the time he was denying me a kiss, but I realise now he had no muscles in his face to kiss me with. I backed off and thought, oh hello, it’s not that you’ve lost feelings for me; it’s just that you can’t. (F1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This decrease in intimacy was often attributed to not only being a carer but also feeling exhausted from all the duties this new role required. One participant stated:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t feel guilty about it but I do think maybe I could have shown him a little bit more love. But maybe my way of attending to him was my love. (F6)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>

<title>Family caring as a series of losses</title>
<p>There was a clear sense that participants thought MND presented a constant series of losses for the care recipient, with changes occurring on a daily basis. One carer described the progression as, ‘it was just all bang, bang, bang, because every day [it was] something else’ (F10) and another stated her husband ‘was in a wheelchair within about four, five weeks, then he was in an electric wheelchair [and then] his breathing went’ (F2). As a result, the carers recounted that they did not have the time to recognise the increasing amount of time they were dedicating to their role.</p>
<p>Feelings of hopelessness were reported by 11 carers, including all who met the criteria for prolonged grief. The hopelessness was described by one participant as‘the most defeating thing’. The sense of hopelessness that participants felt seemed to be compounded further when they contrasted MND to cancer. For example, one stated, ‘With cancer there is hope; with MND, there is nothing’ (F4) while another declared, ‘if it had to be a choice between cancer and MND, I’d say cancer any day’ (F7).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0269216311416036">
<title>Coping mechanisms of family carers</title>
<p>The prospect of a dying partner was frightening for all of the participants and the coping mechanisms they reported differed according to their PG-13 scores. Those participants who did not meet the criteria for prolonged grief generally indicated in their interviews that they accepted the notion of their partner dying, right from their diagnosis. For instance, one stated, ‘From the start, definitely, yes. Had no problem with that in the sense of accepting, you know, we’d had a really good life, we were both in our sixties’ (F2) while another commented, ‘It’s a death sentence, and it was how long it was going to be, and what sort of course it was going to take’ (M1).</p>
<p>In contrast, five out of the six participants with prolonged grief described difficultly in accepting their partner’s illness as terminal. These participants tended to reject all notions of their spouse dying, with some describing it as their only way of coping. For instance one recalled, ‘I didn’t accept that. I just kept thinking, oh, they’re all wrong’ (F6) and another commented, ‘We didn’t talk about dying or what was going to happen’ (F8). For these participants, the prospect of their spouse’s progressive illness and impending death was simply too terrifying:<disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t want to know that tomorrow he might lose all power in his right arm or the next day I would have to brush his teeth. I didn’t want to know that, and I just coped with it as it came along. (F7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The participants who met the criteria for prolonged grief minimised their emotional reactions to their partner’s illness by ‘switching off’ their emotions in order to manage the day-to-day responsibilities of care. One participant described becoming ‘robotic and mechanical’ (F10), while another described trying to ‘keep busy, not think about it, avoid any discussion, avoid any acknowledgment [and] just keep going’(F7). The outcome from the PG-13 assessment also appeared to be related to whether or not the participants had accepted the death of their spouse. Four of the six participants who met the criteria for prolonged grief avoided thinking about and re-experiencing the painful emotions associated with the death of their partner. For instance, one described having ‘a complete shutdown’ and another stated, ‘There are things I’ve left undone because I haven’t been able to face them’ (F8). These avoidant coping strategies appeared to affect the participants’ memories and recall of events around the time of their spouse’s death, with one asserting, ‘I’m struggling to even remember his funeral’ (F7).</p>
<p>In contrast, the remaining participants described having accepted the death of their spouse and accommodating the associated losses. Although most still reported grieving for their deceased spouse, the grief was not described as affecting their daily life in a negative way. To illustrate, one carer remarked, ‘You don’t have to label things as being good or bad or anything, they just are, and acceptance of what is and doing whatever you can at the moment’ (F3) and another asserted, ‘You just sink or swim, and I swim’ (F2). These participants were able to describe how the overwhelming feelings they experienced early in their bereavement were now more tempered, even though it was not unusual for them to still feel upset and to miss their spouse. One participant shared, ‘You don’t forget people. I don’t think the pain goes away but it’s eased; it’s like you live with it’ (F3).</p>

<sec id="section18-0269216311416036">
<title>Supportive and palliative care experiences of family carers</title>
<p>For the participants, the typical referral pathway and diagnostic process involved a doctor, neurologist/s and other medical professionals. Ten of the participants indicated problems with this process. For example, one participant reported seeing three neurologists before the diagnosis was confirmed. It was clear that the way in which the diagnosis was relayed had a considerable emotional impact on each participant. The participants consistently reported on the absence of compassion conveyed by medical professionals, both at the time of diagnosis and throughout their partner’s illness trajectory. One participant stated a doctor treated her husband, ‘without any dignity, respect, nothing’ (F9). The lack of empathy from medical professionals left the participants feeling shocked, bewildered, angry and devastated. One participant recalled:
<disp-quote>
<p>The neurologist told us that he knew someone with MND and that they shot themselves right away. Hearing that was just terrible ‘cause here I am thinking we will beat this. Nah, we didn’t go to that neurologist again. (F11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, the participants reported various issues in service provision relating to perceived poor quality of care. For example, while recalling their experience in hospital, one participant said her husband, ‘nearly died twice because there was one guy in particular who hadno idea what to do with the trachea. He couldn’t clear it so [my husband] virtually choked’ (F5). Another reported, ‘In the end it ended up with him having a twisted bowel, going in to hospital and having a bag and, oh, the things he went through in the hospital. They need a stiff kick up the bum’ (F6).</p>
<p>On the whole, the participants’ experiences with palliative care services were reported in positive and appreciative terms, with 11 reporting satisfaction with the services they received. However, the timeliness of, and access to, palliative care was a common issue. Only one participant indicated that palliative care services were offered and accessed right from the point of diagnosis, with the other participants reporting that services were accessed from 2.5 to 15 months before the death. On average, the participants’ spouses received palliative care services less than two months before their deaths. Two participants reported feeling unclear at the time about what help was actually available from palliative care services. One stated, ‘Unless you know the services are there, you don’t get them’ (F11).</p>
<p>Although participants acknowledged that they could have used more support, the issue of primary importance was caring for their loved one. One carer described, ‘I don’t think any of us really got a chance to even think about when we needed help’ (F1). However, two participants expressed dissatisfaction with the inadequate level of respite services available to high needs patients with MND. In addition, bereavement support was not always offered following the death of the care recipients. Participants described the immediate time after the death of their spouse as chaotic, as they were often busy with arranging the funeral and attending to other matters of concern. Eight participants reported being offered bereavement support and of them six utilised the support that was offered. The remaining eight did not recall any offer of support, with one explaining, ‘You go from having a whole army of people; then it is just you’ (F6) and another stating, ‘You’re just left alone’ (M3).</p>
<p>There appeared to be an association between the time palliative care was accessed by the care recipient and the grief experiences of the carers. Three of the five participants who demonstrated prolonged grief had accessed palliative care services less than one month before the death of their spouse. In addition, four out of the five participants who had prolonged grief and had used palliative care services reported gaining access to home-based services later than they would have liked. The carers who experienced a well-developed rapport with their service provider and who received more consistent services earlier in the disease trajectory tended to be the most satisfied with service provision.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of MND family carers from their time as a family carer of their spouse through to their bereavement. The data revealed that a diagnosis of MND has a profound effect on the family carer of the person with the disease. The carers reported engaging in physically and psychologically demanding care that often left them exhausted. Consistent with previous findings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311416036">3</xref></sup> these tasks often included emotional support, feeding and liquid control, learning new strategies for communication as speech deteriorated and managing medical equipment; the experience was intense,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311416036">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311416036">5</xref></sup> with implications for the carers’ quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311416036">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311416036"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311416036"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311416036"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311416036"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311416036"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311416036">12</xref></sup> This carer role was compounded by diminished intimacy in the spousal relationship, as well as various losses triggered by their partner’s diagnosis.</p>
<p>For some participants, coping mechanisms founded on the inhibition of affect, along with feeling a pervading sense of hopelessness, may have played a crucial role in the development of their prolonged grief.</p>
<sec id="section20-0269216311416036">
<title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>
<p>This small Australian study highlighted the experience of caring for a person with MND, both during their time as a family carer and during their bereavement. The findings are not likely to be generalizable to all contexts and the sampling process of self-selection was a key limitation. Over one-third of the sample met criteria for prolonged grief. This is considerably different to estimates that 10% to 20% of the population is susceptible to complicated forms of grief.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311416036">19</xref></sup> This difference between sample and population incidence of prolonged grief, along with the small size of the sample, means that the findings of the study may not be generalised to all MND family carers. It may well be that carers who experienced prolonged grief self-selected to contribute to this study, while those who accommodated their losses were not interested to take part, hence the over-inflated proportion in this study.</p>
<p>An additional limitation was our reliance on each participant’s ability to accurately recall details of their experiences. While the passage of time affects the accuracy of information recalled in an interview,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311416036">24</xref></sup> we were not relying on the informant’s memory <italic>per se</italic>; rather, we were interested in how they reflected upon their experiences of caring, bereavement and receipt of services, such as palliative care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0269216311416036">
<title>Implications for supportive and palliative care</title>
<p>There are four implications for Australian health professionals to consider in offering supportive and palliative care, and these may be applicable in other countries. Firstly, MND patients need to be linked to palliative care service from diagnosis, even if they do not access it for some time, as palliative care is about symptom management (physical and psychosocial) and not just end-of-life care. Concurrently, psychosocial support needs to be routinely offered to MND family carers throughout the illness trajectory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311416036">11</xref></sup> Given that exhaustion is a leading reason why family members need to seek out formal services, efforts may be directed towards helping family carers recognise and attend to their own needs and the provision of carer respite. The support could be offered by professionals able to empathetically attend to the unique needs of the MND family carer. An evaluation of an educational intervention for health professionals in Australia, on palliative care and MND care, showed improvements in participants’ understanding of physical and psychosocial needs, ability to promote dignity and quality of life and better communication with MND patients and their carers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311416036">25</xref></sup> Although further research is needed to clarify the relationship between the provision of palliative care and adverse outcomes for carers, advanced preparation for the loss by way of early involvement in palliative care may help to reduce carers’ risk of developing prolonged grief.</p>
<p>Secondly, MND family carers with, or at risk of developing, prolonged grief would benefit from early identification by palliative care services and the offer of more intensive support. Specifically, the information required to assess for risk of prolonged grief for MND family carers needs to be gathered at least from the point of referral to palliative care (if not earlier) and continue over the course of the admission to the palliative care service and extend into bereavement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311416036">26</xref></sup> This is especially important, as the provision of psychological support to family carers has a clear association with their bereavement outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311416036">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thirdly, access to appropriate and timely support and information is crucial for family carers of MND patients who have passed away. The offer of post-bereavement follow-up should be appropriate to risk status and need<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216311416036">28</xref></sup> as a fundamental component of palliative care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311416036">17</xref></sup>. The follow-up may include bereavement information, offers of condolences and psychological support (via a letter, telephone or in person), memorial services and access to bereavement counselling services, according to the needs of the carer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311416036">29</xref></sup> as well as assessment of risk for prolonged grief. Furthermore, given that bereavement reduces the chances of a family carer appealing for assistance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311416036">30</xref></sup> and that those most in need of support tend to provide more intense care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311416036">21</xref></sup> services need to be proactive in identifying those in need of support rather than reactive to support requests.</p>
<p>Finally, the data revealed that the way in which the diagnosis is relayed may hold serious emotional consequences, not only for the patient with MND but also for the family carer. Currently, there is an absence of guidelines specific for the delivery of an MND diagnosis, although there are more general guidelines for prognostic and end-of-life communication with patients with progressive life-limiting illnesses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311416036">31</xref></sup> This is despite research demonstrating the life-changing and ongoing impact a MND diagnosis and its delivery has on patients and their carers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311416036">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311416036">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269216311416036">33</xref></sup> Medical professionals, including specialist neurologists, might consider the impact a diagnosis of MND has on patients and their carers and break the news in an appropriately empathetic and supportive manner, similarly to what has been achieved in breaking the news for cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269216311416036">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269216311416036">35</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0269216311416036">
<title>Implications for research</title>
<p>The study provided a basis for more research into the experiences of MND family carers and the role of palliative care services, before and after the death of their spouse, and in relation to bereavement outcomes. Within the palliative care framework, further research should be directed towards developing clearer, more targeted bereavement support for this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311416036">27</xref></sup> Investigation into the identification of risk factors for prolonged grief would also be an area worthy of consideration. Providing more consistent, tailored, earlier and responsive palliative care services is vital for better carer outcomes.</p>
