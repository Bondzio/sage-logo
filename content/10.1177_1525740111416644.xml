<abstract>
<p>Parents and their children with severe expressive impairments may have limited successful communicative exchanges due to each partner’s difficulty in recognizing and responding to communicative behaviors of the other. This study examined the communicative functions and modes of communication that received contingent responses in 20 dyads of parents and young children with severe expressive impairments. Parents responded more often to children’s nonvocal behaviors and adult-directed behaviors than vocal behaviors and non-adult-directed behaviors (i.e., child gestures or vocal behaviors that were not conveyed toward the direction of the adult). The children responded more often to parent communication about goal-directed than non-goal-directed tasks. Implications of these results for communication intervention are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Contingent parent responses to child behaviors have been associated with a wide variety of positive outcomes in children’s language and academic development. Contingent responses (i.e., high responsivity) involve immediate and consistent parent responses that are meaningfully related to a child’s behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1525740111416644">Yoder &amp; Warren, 1999</xref>). High parent responsivity to meaningful behaviors of typically developing children was associated with expanded language development and predicted higher vocabulary scores in their children by the 2nd year of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525740111416644">Akhtar, Dunham, &amp; Dunham, 1991</xref>). Parents who were contingently responsive to their children tended to also elicit more engaged behavior from their children than parents who were more directive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525740111416644">Lussier, Crimmins, &amp; Alberti, 1994</xref>). If parents recognize communicative or potentially communicative attempts and respond to those attempts in a contingent, appropriate, and consistent manner, children can learn that their behaviors have an effect on their environment.</p>
<sec id="section1-1525740111416644">
<title>Parent Factors That May Influence Responsivity</title>
<p>Parents of children with disabilities have been reported to produce relatively more directive than responsive behaviors compared with parents of typically developing children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525740111416644">Floyd &amp; Phillippe, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740111416644">Hanzlik &amp; Stevenson, 1986</xref>). For hearing parents of children who were deaf and without cognitive impairments, parents tended to actively elicit child attention and gaze, and respond less contingently to children’s independent behavioral signals than parents of typically developing children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1525740111416644">Spencer &amp; Gutfreund, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1525740111416644">Waxman, Spencer, &amp; Poisson, 1996</xref>). Parents of children with cerebral palsy (with or without cognitive impairments) initiated interactions more frequently and were more directive with their infants during free play than mothers of typically developing children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525740111416644">Hanzlik, 1990</xref>). However, parent responsivity and directiveness have been evaluated in most research using goal-directed play tasks such as puzzles and push-button toys that have specific targeted end results (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1525740111416644">Tamis-LeMonda, Bornstein, &amp; Baumwell, 2001</xref>) that are likely to motivate parents to maximize task success (e.g., finish the puzzle, light up the toy). If observed in naturally occurring play interactions without experimentally suggested play goals, parents of children with physical impairments (with or without cognitive impairments) were no more directive or less responsive than expected for typically developing parent–child dyads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525740111416644">Cress, Moskal, &amp; Hoffmann, 2008</xref>). Similar contrasts in parent responsivity between free play and teaching tasks have been reported in children with cognitive impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525740111416644">Becker &amp; Kane, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525740111416644">Guralnick, Neville, Hammond, &amp; Conner, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Child Factors That May Influence Parent Responsivity</title>
<p>Child-related factors that have been reported to influence responsivity in parents of children with disabilities include the child’s physical or cognitive skills as well as frequency and type of child communicative behaviors. Degree of physical and/or cognitive impairment in children has been negatively associated with parent responsivity and contingent interaction in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740111416644">Hanzlik &amp; Stevenson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525740111416644">Slonims, Cox, &amp; McConachie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1525740111416644">Wasserman, Allen, &amp; Linares, 1988</xref>). Children with developmental disabilities were less responsive and predictable communicators when interacting with the parent than children without disabilities, which provided fewer opportunities for the parent to be responsive in turn to the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1525740111416644">Wilcox, Kouri, &amp; Caswell, 1990</xref>). Two child factors that have been reported to affect the degree of contingent parent responsivity in children with disabilities include the intentionality or function of the child’s communication actions and the type or mode of communication behaviors used.</p>
<sec id="section3-1525740111416644">
<title>Communicative Function (Intentionality)</title>
<p>Variations in the child’s range of intentional behaviors greatly influence the dyadic interactions with parents by altering the difficulty for parents to interpret and respond contingently to the child’s communication attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740111416644">McCollum &amp; Hemmeter, 1997</xref>). The standard definition of an intentional communication act, derived from research with typical and atypical communicators, is a child’s production of a hand/arm gesture, vocalization, or spoken word directed toward an adult to convey a communicative message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1525740111416644">Wetherby &amp; Prizant, 1993</xref>). Preintentional behaviors are child actions that are not explicitly directed to an adult or do not convey a specific message. Preintentional behaviors can be unclear to observers because their interpretation requires more subjective judgments by the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740111416644">Iacono, Carter, &amp; Hook, 1998</xref>). Child intentional communication elicited more contingent parent responses than preintentional behaviors in children with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1525740111416644">Yoder &amp; Warren, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1525740111416644">2001</xref>). However, even when children produced low levels of intentional communication, parents attributed meaning to children’s subtle cues as a basis for responsive interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1525740111416644">Yoder, 1987</xref>). Intentional communication in the context of play, particularly the rate of child communicative acts, supports the development of later language and symbolic acts to which parents can respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1525740111416644">Wetherby, Cain, Yonclas, &amp; Walker, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Communicative functions that can be expressed through intentional gestures in the 1st year of life include requesting for objects, actions, and/or comments; protesting; seeking attention; commenting; and playing social routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525740111416644">Crais, Douglas, &amp; Campbell, 2004</xref>). Some types of communicative functions such as requesting objects, actions, or social routines are goal-directed interactions in the sense that they result in immediate tangible results for the child beyond the communicative act itself (e.g., the child receives a desired object or turn of a social routine). Other communicative functions such as greeting, showing, or commenting serve as complete actions in themselves and are non-goal-directed interactions in the sense that the child receives no further tangible results beyond a confirmation or expansion of the child’s message. There are developmentally different trajectories for these types of communicative functions, such that goal-directed actions such as requesting are produced earlier and more often in infants than non-goal-directed actions such as showing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1525740111416644">Wetherby et al., 1988</xref>). For children with severe expressive impairments, communicative functions were often more limited and children tended to produce fewer commenting behaviors compared with typically developing peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525740111416644">Cress et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1525740111416644">
<title>Communication Mode (Type of Communication Behavior)</title>
<p>The mode, or type, of communicative behavior produced by the child has also been associated with the relative amount of parent responsivity in play interaction. Children with severe expressive impairment make more extensive use of communication modes such as facial expression, posture, or eye gaze, to communicate with their partners than typically speaking children, who typically rely more frequently on hand/arm gestures and vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525740111416644">Sigafoos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1525740111416644">Wetherby et al., 1988</xref>). Vocal behavior initiations tended to elicit more parent responses than gestural or facial behaviors because of the conventional and attention-gaining nature of infant and toddler vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525740111416644">Baird, Peterson, &amp; Reilly, 1995</xref>). However, vocal behaviors are less accessible as a communication mode during parent–child interaction for children with severe expressive impairments than for typical toddlers; children with physical impairments produced fewer vocalizations during parent interactions than typically developing peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740111416644">Hanzlik &amp; Stevenson, 1986</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740111416644">Iacono et al. (1998)</xref> found that children with severe-profound mental retardation used gestures more often than vocalizations or verbalizations to communicate with partners and that children’s communication attempts were the clearest when they used shared attention signals such as coordinated gaze to a partner. For children with severe expressive impairments, it is not known whether parents choose to focus on particular behaviors to promote in their children or whether parents tend naturally to respond to the most clearly interpretable types of behaviors in their children, such as intentional gestures and vocalizations.</p>
<p>When assessing child communicative behaviors, research and clinical practice for children with severe expressive impairments have broadened the types of behaviors considered relevant for communication from those used in assessment of typical communication. For children with restricted hand/arm and vocal control, traditional hand/arm gestures, verbalizations, and vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1525740111416644">Wetherby &amp; Prizant, 1993</xref>) may not be accessible forms of communication to direct toward listeners. Although it is possible to score intentional communication for children with severe expressive impairments using the traditional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1525740111416644">Wetherby and Prizant (1993)</xref> definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525740111416644">Cress et al., 1999</xref>), more recent researchers have instead measured potentially communicative acts for children and adults with severe disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525740111416644">Sigafoos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1525740111416644">Thiemann-Bourque, Brady, Olswang, &amp; Dowden, 2009</xref>). Potentially communicative acts include behaviors in any modality (including eye gaze, body orientation, or head movements) that are directed toward a listener and can be interpreted by the partner for communicative intent. As these behaviors can be produced by the child for either communicative intent (e.g., vocalizing to request more) or noncommunicative intent (e.g., looking at an adult to check for attention), the extent to which potentially communicative acts are considered intentional communication depends on partner perception and response to the signal.</p>

<title>Rationale for the Present Research</title>
<p>Previous research has observed the frequency of parent and child behaviors in children with physical impairments but did not address which behaviors successfully continue the interaction and elicit parent responses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525740111416644">Hanzlik, 1990</xref>). Additional research is needed to understand the interaction of the behaviors of parents and children with severe expressive communication disabilities. There is a clear clinical as well as theoretical need to understand the nature of successful parent–child interaction for children with severe disabilities, to therapeutically target child behaviors that are the most likely to receive meaningful responses from the partner. The present study examines how parents responded to the behavior of children with severe expressive impairments and how the children responded to parent behaviors. Specifically, this study compares which parent and child behaviors elicit more responses from partners during free-play interactions with parents and children with severe expressive impairments. The following research questions were addressed:</p>

<sec id="section7-1525740111416644">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 20 participants (10 girls and 10 boys) were randomly sampled from a 50-participant longitudinal data set addressing communication development in children with severe expressive communication impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525740111416644">Cress, 1995</xref>). The present exploratory analysis was conducted on a subset of the complete data set because of the time intensity involved in moment-by-moment, bidirectional communication coding. Children had a mean age of 22.1 months (range = 15-30 months), with ages corrected for number of months premature for any children born before 37 weeks gestation; all premature children had been corrected for prematurity before 24 months when beginning the longitudinal study, and maintenance of corrected ages was necessary to retain relative age intervals across sessions and children. All participants had expressive communication disabilities associated with the following disorders: cerebral palsy (<italic>n</italic> = 8), acquired brain injury/illness (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, glutamic acidurea, and traumatic brain injury; <italic>n</italic> = 6), congenital conditions (spina bifida with Arnold Chiari malformation, achondroplasia, and microcephaly; <italic>n</italic> = 4), or oral/motor dysfunction (<italic>n</italic> = 2).</p>
<p>On the <italic>Battelle Developmental Inventory</italic> (BDI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525740111416644">Newborg, Stock, Wnek, Guidibaldi, &amp; Svinicki, 1984</xref>), the 20 participants had a mean developmental age of 9.87 months (range = 4-19 months), a mean receptive communication age of 13.33 months (range = 5-19.5 months), and a mean expressive communication age using traditional BDI scoring of 9.23 months (range = 1-14 months). All children demonstrated developmental ages and expressive language scores at least one standard deviation below the mean for their corrected age, when scored using published BDI criteria. Alternative expressive language scores are reported in parentheses on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1525740111416644">Table 1</xref> for children whose expressive language scores were higher when augmentative communication methods were included (e.g., voice output and picture symbol use). None of the parents in the play samples interacted with their children using aided methods such as pictures or voice output.</p>

<p>Children had primary diagnoses of severe expressive speech impairments associated with physical and/or neuromotor deficits and demonstrated at least two of the following characteristics of risk for vocal expressive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525740111416644">McDonald, 1980</xref>): (a) prematurity, birth anoxia, or other prenatal risk factors; (b) feeding difficulties or persistent oral/motor control problems; (c) delayed onset of vocalizations and/or speech relative to same age peers; or (d) evidence of neuromotor deficits that may be related to speech development. All children demonstrated sufficient hearing and vision for communication on a battery of tests including the <italic>HearKit</italic> screener for response to calibrated noisemakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525740111416644">BAM World Markets, 1991</xref>), <italic>Baby Screen Kit</italic> for preferential looking to acuity card and materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1525740111416644">Vision Associates, 1996</xref>), and a <italic>Functional Vision Assessment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1525740111416644">Vision Associates, 1996</xref>) for expected responses to visual information in the environment.</p>
<p>Children had been receiving services for their disabilities for an average of 12.7 months (range = 1-22 months). All but 3 of the children received early childhood special education services, addressing child skills such as toy play and cause/effect behavior. A majority of the children (12 out of 20) received speech/language pathology services, addressing child skills such as intentional gestures, speech sound production, and use of picture symbols or voice output switches. All of the therapeutic goals on children’s Individualized Education Programs as reported by parents addressed child skill outcomes; none of the children had therapeutic goals established by any service provider addressing parent behaviors such as responsivity.</p>
<p>Participants lived in both urban and rural areas; 40% were from racial minority groups and 35% were living in single-parent households. Parents of the participants represented a full range of educational backgrounds and occupations: 40% of the head-of-household parents reported having a high school degree or less, 20% reported completion of some college courses, and 40% had college degrees. Occupations of parents were rated using the <italic>International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status</italic> categories established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525740111416644">Ganzeboom and Treiman (1996)</xref>. The midpoint of the ranked occupational categories in their standardization scale was just above 40 points and represented supervisory labor positions. The average occupation score for the parents in the present study was 44.4, suggesting supervisory labor positions, with 12 parent’s occupations scored 40 or higher (independent employers, supervisors, professional positions) and 5 occupations scored below 40 (skilled and semiskilled laborers, farmers). Two single parents were students, considered not codable for occupation. A summary of the demographic and developmental information for the 20 participants is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1525740111416644">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The data were derived from one data collection visit in a 5-year longitudinal grant to study communicative development in young children with physical impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525740111416644">Cress, 1995</xref>). Throughout the course of the longitudinal study, children and parents received 2- to 4-hr visits in their homes to conduct a variety of measures of cognitive and communicative development over a period of 18 months for each family (six visits at 3-month intervals). The play samples analyzed in the present study were taken from the data collected on the second visit only, 3 months after the initial visit; the second visit was chosen over the first visit to increase the likelihood that most of the children would be able to demonstrate some intentional communication behaviors. Standardized BDI scores (used as descriptive information for participants) were only collected at Visits 1, 4, and 6 because of limitations in test–retest reliability for that measure. The interval of 3 months between the standardized BDI assessment and coded play samples is still within the range of test–retest reliability for the BDI, such that resampling within that interval would not be reliably expected to be consistently distinguished from the previous 3 months.</p>
<p>Free-play samples between parents and children were collected at naturally occurring opportunities during the 2- to 4-hr visits, in between administration of formal and informal developmental and communication assessments. During the home visits, parents and children were encouraged to explore a large bag of toys and play together while the experimenter arranged other paperwork and materials. In addition, if the parents or children spontaneously began a social routine or play activity together, experimental tasks were paused until they completed this period of play. In both of these situations, the goal was to remove the experimenter from the play interaction and reduce the likelihood that play episodes were deliberately constructed for display. In addition, families were asked about their children’s favorite toys and familiar routines and encouraged to try these activities as they normally would, at naturally occurring breaks in other experimental activities (particularly if parents were hesitant to initiate play with more casual prompting).</p>
<p>The free-play interactions were videotaped in S-VHS format with a Panasonic AG 456 video camera and a character generator model number VW-CG5P. All segments of parent–child free play were dubbed onto coding tapes, averaging 15.52 min total play for each dyad (range = 9.0-22.5 min, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.44). Although there was moderate variability in the length of play sample that was inevitable given the naturalistic and unprompted nature of the play episodes, all parents and children had equal opportunities during their given play sample to respond to relevant partner behaviors. The two outliers for longest and shortest play samples were equally far above or below the average play sample length. The children in these samples played primarily with their mothers, with the exceptions that Participant 14 interacted with both mother and father, Participant 11 interacted with the father, and Participant 2 interacted with the mother and two other adults. For the two-parent interactions, parent behaviors and responses were coded for either parent. For the interaction with the mother and other adults, child and parent behaviors and responses were only coded for interactions involving the mother and child.</p>

<title>Data coding</title>
<p>Coding tapes were viewed in S-VHS format on a Panasonic AG-1980P video deck with a 20" JVC AB200BP6 or 27" JVC AB AV27020 monitor. The coding scheme was developed independently by the authors for this study, although principles involved in this coding scheme have been reflected in the work of other researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525740111416644">Sigafoos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1525740111416644">Thiemann-Bourque et al., 2009</xref>). Its purpose was to analyze parent–child interactions during the free-play samples, looking specifically at the functions and modes used by both partners during the play interactions that received contingent responses by the other partner. Given that parents of children with severe disabilities tend to respond to both intentional and nonintentional behaviors of their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1525740111416644">Yoder &amp; Warren, 2001</xref>), it would not be possible to account for all possible behaviors produced by children that could have been considered communicative by the partner, in contrast with the child behaviors that received contingent responses. For instance, all children looked at something at every moment of the play interaction (resulting in a constant and practically unlimited number of potential child actions) and the parent could choose to interpret any of those looks as if they were meaningful to the interaction, regardless of the child’s apparent intent or play actions. Therefore, an ongoing or ambiguous child action such as a look or posture shift was counted as a child behavior only if it received a response from the parent, as consistent with behavior frequency counts used in single-case research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525740111416644">Kazdin, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Two coders (the second and third authors) were trained by the first author in the coding system and scored all videotapes. Each 15-s interval of parent–child interactions was observed by both coders, and all of the parent and child behavior samples were coded separately by each coder corresponding to the elements of the coding scheme. This process of double coding 100% of the samples exceeds the typical rigor of 20% reliability coding expected for most observational research; however, given the high potential variability of both behavior mode and functions judged as communicative for dyads with children who have severe impairments, this additional rigor was considered necessary. Disagreements were resolved after coding was completed by discussion among coders and/or consultation with the first author. All relevant behaviors occurring in a 15-s interval were recorded and counted. The time code generator on the videotaped recording allowed the coders to identify coding intervals accurately and precisely.</p>
<p>A sequence of coding decisions was made for each observed parent or child behavior. First, child and parent behaviors were identified that successfully elicited contingent partner responses. To be considered a contingent response, the child or adult’s behavior had to successfully receive partner response related to the apparent meaning or intent of the behavior within 3 s of the completion of the initiated behavior. Next, the child behavior was judged to be adult directed (directed to the communicative partner) or non–adult directed (not directed to the communicative partner), based on criteria for intentionality from the <italic>Communicative and Symbolic Behavior Scales</italic> (CSBS)<italic>–Normed Edition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1525740111416644">Wetherby &amp; Prizant, 1993</xref>). Adult behaviors were coded as child directed or non–child directed using the same criteria. The only modification to the CSBS criteria was to expand the types of child communicative behaviors beyond vocalizations and hand/arm gestures, to include a broader range of possible communicative acts (e.g., look, body orientation, head movement). At this point, behaviors that received contingent responses were categorized into one of the following four categories: adult initiated–child directed, adult initiated–non-child-directed, child initiated–adult directed, and child initiated–non-adult-directed.</p>
<p>Parent and child behaviors were coded on one of four scoring grids corresponding to the appropriate category (e.g., child initiated–adult directed). Behaviors were tallied within each 15-s interval by entering the mode or multiple modes of the behavior under the relevant communicative function for that time interval. The modes of communication addressed in the coding scheme were gesture, vocalization, eye gaze, body movement, and facial expression. Behaviors that used combinations of modes were scored as multiple mode behaviors, such as eye gaze and vocalization (EV) or body movement and eye gaze (BE). The communicative functions were determined by apparent communicative intent expressed or interpreted for an initiated behavior, whether or not the behavior was intentionally directed toward a partner. Communicative functions were grouped into two subsets to distinguish functions associated with goal-directed interactions (request/prompt, initiate social routine, and functional action) or non-goal-directed interactions (indicate state, share attention, comment, and imitate). See the appendix for the complete coding scheme and definitions.</p>
<p>To check independent interrater reliability, each coder separately rescored 20% of the parent–child interactions and compared the results with those completed by the other coder. Interrater agreement ranged from 67% to 83%, and Cohen’s kappas ranged from .63 to .77 for the four types of coding as follows: adult modes (76%, κ = .68), adult functions (83%, κ = .77), child modes (71%, κ = .64), and child functions (67%, κ = .63). The codes for child functions received greatest variability because children’s communicative functions had to be interpreted from relatively ambiguous behaviors such as eye gaze and body movements. Although direct interrater agreement was modest on individual coding schemes, given the high number of possible codes, the kappas are considered high for observational research and indicate a low probability that these agreements occurred by chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525740111416644">Kazdin, 1982</xref>). Primary discrepancies in agreement were compensated for to a large extent in analyses by combining subcategories of behaviors; for instance, a majority of discrepancies were between subcategories of communication function or mode (e.g., discriminating vocal + eye gaze from vocal + eye gaze + body movement), and these kinds of differences disappeared when original coding categories were collapsed into categories for analysis, such as vocal versus nonvocal.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The first research question asked whether parents would respond more often to child vocal or nonvocal behaviors. A paired samples <italic>t</italic> test compared numbers of child vocal versus nonvocal behaviors that received contingent parent responses, grouping counts of any behaviors that included vocalizations into the vocal category (including nonvocal + vocal categories) and remaining individual or combinations of nonvocal behaviors (gesture, body movement, eye gaze, and facial expression) into the total nonvocal behavior category (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1525740111416644">Table 2</xref>). Results indicated that the parents of children with severe expressive impairments produced significantly more contingent responses to nonvocal child behaviors than to vocal behaviors, <italic>t</italic> = 2.61, <italic>df</italic> = 19, <italic>p</italic> = .017. Parents responded to almost twice as many nonvocal behaviors (<italic>M</italic> = 14.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.65) compared with vocal behaviors (<italic>M</italic> = 8.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.13), even when all combined vocal and nonvocal behaviors were grouped within the vocal category. Only 23 of the 160 total child vocal behaviors in goal-directed interactions (14%) were vocal-only behaviors that received parent responses, whereas 51 of 78 children’s total vocal behaviors (63%) that received responses in non-adult-directed contexts were vocal only.</p>

<p>The second research question asked whether parents would respond more often to child adult-directed or non-adult-directed behaviors. A paired samples <italic>t</italic> test compared numbers of child adult-directed with non-adult-directed behaviors that received contingent parent responses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1525740111416644">Table 3</xref>). Parents responded significantly more times to adult-directed child behaviors rather than non-adult-directed behaviors, <italic>t</italic> = 3.07, <italic>df</italic> = 19, <italic>p</italic> = .006. Parents responded to over twice as many adult-directed communication acts (<italic>M</italic> = 22.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 13.40) as non-adult-directed acts (<italic>M</italic> = 10.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.61).</p>

<p>The third research question asked whether children would respond more times to parent goal-directed or non-goal-directed behaviors addressed to the children; parents only produced four behaviors across all samples not directed to children that received contingent responses, and these data are not tabled. A paired samples <italic>t</italic> test compared numbers of parent goal-directed with non-goal-directed behaviors that received contingent child responses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1525740111416644">Table 4</xref>). Children with severe expressive communication impairments responded significantly more times when the parent provided goal-directed communication rather than non-goal-directed communication, <italic>t</italic> = 5.55, <italic>df</italic> = 19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. Children responded almost 3 times as often when the parent communicated in a goal-directed interaction (<italic>M</italic> = 18.35, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.87) than in a non-goal-directed interaction (<italic>M</italic> = 6.90, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.94). Raw numbers of child responses to parent behaviors from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1525740111416644">Table 4</xref> were collapsed by modality, to distinguish numbers of child responses that were only vocal (i.e., single vocal or two sequenced vocal acts) or only nonverbal (i.e., gesture, eye, body, face, or two-combined nonverbal modes). Children produced almost exactly as many total vocal-only responses to adult behaviors (<italic>n</italic> = 175) as nonverbal-only responses to adult behaviors (<italic>n</italic> = 178), with an additional 152 combined vocal and nonverbal modality responses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Parents and children with severe expressive impairments showed significant patterns of differences in the types of behaviors they responded to within play interactions. For Research Question 1, parents responded to more children’s nonvocal behaviors than vocal behaviors. Literature suggests that parents are particularly focused on vocalizations during communicative interactions with infants and young children with typical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525740111416644">Goldstein &amp; West, 1999</xref>). Even for typical and preterm infants below 6 months, parents tended to rely on vocalizations for interpretations of preferences, emotional states, and physical needs, and only relied on behaviors such as gaze for interpreting infant attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525740111416644">Baird et al., 1995</xref>). However, the extent to which parents are able to respond to children’s vocalizations depends on the extent to which children produce vocal behaviors that are candidates for parent responsivity.</p>
<p>One logical interpretation of a high parent response to nonvocal behaviors might have been that children with severe expressive impairments would be expected to produce relatively fewer vocal behaviors to which parents could respond, and parents were reacting appropriately to the available communication signals. Children with severe impairments tend to rely on a broad range of behavioral signals to communicate with partners when more conventional signals such as speech and gestures are unavailable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525740111416644">Sigafoos et al., 2000</xref>). Previous research has suggested that children with severe impairments such as cerebral palsy produce fewer vocal and nonvocal behaviors in interaction with parents than expected for children with intellectual disabilities or for typically developing peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740111416644">Hanzlik &amp; Stevenson, 1986</xref>). Because of the focus of this study on contingent responses, there was no information gathered on numbers of child behaviors or vocalizations that did not receive parent responses. However, although the participants in this study had significantly delayed expressive skills for their ages, all of the children could produce at least one vowel-like or quasivowel vocalization. Furthermore, the children produced equivalent numbers of vocal and nonvocal responses to parent behaviors; if children could equally access vocal and nonvocal modalities when responding, it is logical to assume that both types of modalities were equally available to children when initiating with parents. Therefore, children were theoretically able to produce vocalizations as often as nonvocal behaviors to elicit parent responses, although those vocalizations would likely be fewer and less complex than expected for their ages. A higher parent response to nonvocal behaviors by children in this study may have reflected an interaction between the types of vocal and nonvocal behaviors produced by the child, and the extent to which the behaviors or vocalizations produced were interpretable to the parents.</p>
<p>Differences in the complexity of child vocal behavior patterns between adult-directed and non-adult-directed contexts provide further support for the deliberate use of vocalizations and reliance on nonverbal strategies by children with severe expressive impairments in this sample. When children vocalized in adult-directed interactions, they tended to combine the vocalizations with other adult-directed behaviors such as body movement or facial expression (only 23 of a total of 160 total vocal behaviors in adult-directed context were vocal only). In contrast, a majority of children’s vocal behaviors unaccompanied by any nonverbal behavior that received parent responses occurred in non-adult-directed contexts (51 of 78 total vocal behaviors in this context were vocal only). In other words, children tended to support their adult-directed vocalizations with other nonverbal behaviors that would potentially enhance the ability of the adult to interpret their intent. This pattern suggests deliberate production of vocalization by children, but with a limited reliance on vocalization as an independent means of conveying messages to partners in communicative contexts that is appropriate for children with limited vocal repertoires.</p>
<p>For the second research question, more parent responses were produced to children’s adult-directed communication than non-adult-directed behaviors. This finding is consistent with other research, in which parents found it easier to recognize and interpret intentional communication than preintentional behaviors even for children with severe impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1525740111416644">Yoder, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1525740111416644">Yoder &amp; Feagans, 1988</xref>). If a child’s behavior is not clearly directed to an adult to convey an intent, the parent may not be able to expand on the meaning of the behavior but rather may comment on the behavior production itself (e.g., “Yes, you’re looking at the ball”). However, in the present study it is notable that parents also consistently responded to child behaviors that were not clearly intentional or adult directed as well as those that are more typically conventional and interpretable. This pattern of natural parent responses to children that includes preintentional or non-adult-directed behaviors provides encouraging support for the feasibility intervention strategies that rely on parent training to promote child intentional and symbolic communication, such as the Hanen intervention model (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525740111416644">Girolametto, Hoaken, Weitzman, &amp; van Lieshout, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Although parents can expand or comment on any child behavior, whether or not it is directed to the parent, children at early stages of communication development may not be able to benefit from as many kinds of parent responses as older children; parent comments were positively associated with vocabulary development when contingently provided to children with developmental delays who were symbolic communicators, but comments were negatively associated with vocabulary development for prelinguistic children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740111416644">Kim, Wilcox, &amp; Carnahan, 2008</xref>). Treatment research suggests that the most effective types of partner responses to promote the development of symbolic skills in preintentional children provide contingent responses that follow the intent of the child’s message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525740111416644">Girolametto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1525740111416644">Yoder &amp; Warren, 1999</xref>). The reciprocal nature of parent–child interaction suggests that children play a role in eliciting effective facilitative responses from partners; parent increases in appropriately responsive behaviors to children with developmental disabilities after treatment were at least partly attributed to increases in child intentional communication behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1525740111416644">Yoder &amp; Warren, 2001</xref>). Therefore, interventions that increase child intentional initiations should also be associated with an increase in the kinds of contingent responses to adult-directed communication demonstrated in this study that support the further language development of children with severe expressive impairments.</p>
<p>Results for the third research question suggest possible contexts in which parents may be able to elicit more interpretable or intentional behaviors from their children with severe impairments. Children responded more frequently to parents in the context of a goal-directed interaction (e.g., initiating a routine, requesting) than in a non-goal-directed interaction (e.g., commenting, shared affect). Interactions that were goal directed were not necessarily imposed in a directive fashion to the child; rather, the dyad was sharing an activity with observable or tangible results that included responding to the kinds of open-ended opportunities for play or social routines often associated with low parent directiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525740111416644">Girolametto et al., 2000</xref>). Shared activities have been shown to not only increase child responses but also increase parent recognition of intent for children with difficult-to-interpret behaviors. When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1525740111416644">Wilcox et al. (1990)</xref> observed short samples in which parent and child were both actively engaged in a shared activity, there were no significant differences in the interpretability of children’s behaviors between children with and without movement impairments, or preintentional and intentional communicators. The shared activity may constrain the possible interpretation of meanings for both the child and the adult in play interactions, and elicit more contingent responses from children to which parents can meaningfully react.</p>
<p>Relatively few non-goal-directed parent communicative acts such as commenting successfully elicited child responses in this sample, which may reflect concerns reported elsewhere about joint attention function development for children with severe expressive impairments relative to other communicative functions. In previous research, children with severe communication impairments produced significantly fewer joint attention acts than expected for communication-stage peers on the CSBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525740111416644">Cress et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast, children with Down’s syndrome have been reported to produce significantly more joint attention behaviors and fewer requesting behaviors relative to their cognitively matched peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1525740111416644">Mundy, Sigman, Kasari, &amp; Yirmiya, 1988</xref>). An interpretation proposed for this discrepancy is that children with physical and communicative impairments are less likely to perform non-goal-directed actions such as commenting than children with only cognitive or communicative impairments, because of the limited tangible benefit resulting from the high motoric “cost” of controlling refined hand/arm movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525740111416644">Cress, Andrews, &amp; Reynolds, 1998</xref>). If children with severe expressive impairments are less likely to produce joint attention acts than expected for their communication age, and also do not respond contingently as often to parent joint attention acts, then communicative functions such as commenting are at high risk for long-term impairment relative to functions such as requesting. Therapeutic implications of this imbalance of commenting functions in early parent–child interaction for children with severe impairments include encouraging parents to embed comments within requesting or social routines, and providing access to simple joint action routines in which comments or showing behaviors achieve practical purposes for the child (e.g., looking or pointing to show leads to a social play routine with the labeled object).</p>
<p>The focus of this study was on the types of parent–child interactions that successfully elicited contingent responses from partners and not the relative percentage of total child or adult behaviors that received contingent responses. Clearly, the amounts and types of child behaviors produced are presumed to have influenced the absolute numbers of parent responses, and parent behaviors and elicitation strategies similarly would have influenced the absolute numbers for various child responses. However, by looking at both sides of the parent–child interaction within the same study, the behaviors of each member of the dyad were consistently dependent on each other within the same context, and the relative patterns of parent and child behaviors that received partner responses in this study should be indicative of the overall communication patterns for those dyads. For instance, if a parent tends to respond more often to child adult-directed than non-adult-directed behaviors, this pattern should be consistent whether the child produces relatively few or many adult-directed behaviors in that particular interaction sample.</p>
<p>As parents could have responded to any form of child behavior whether it was produced with communicative intent, including ongoing subtle changes in gaze direction or body position, it was not possible to calculate exactly how many potentially interpretable child or adult behaviors were not responded to by partners. However, anecdotal observations suggest that the most frequent modalities in which coders noticed child behaviors that the parent missed were eye gaze, slight body movements, and facial expression. These forms of communication are smaller movements and less obviously intentional than combinations of vocalizations, gestures, or gross body movements, to which parents responded frequently (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1525740111416644">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, children were anecdotally observed to respond infrequently to parent behaviors that coders considered to be subtle or ambiguous, and children produced few responses to parent behaviors conveyed with eye gaze or gesture alone (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1525740111416644">Table 4</xref>). These latter behaviors could be easily missed if a child was not looking directly at the parent’s face, but parent vocal or body movements might be performed within the context of the play interaction to follow the child’s current focus of attention.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>The present study is limited by the exploratory nature of the single play sample from a relatively small number of 20 children with different etiologies; a larger repeated sample with a more homogeneous population would clarify distinctions between interaction behaviors in this population and other related populations, such as children with Down’s syndrome. The variety of etiologies also introduced variability in children’s receptive and expressive language scores that is characteristic of the population of children at risk for being nonspeaking; a larger sample would allow for subgrouping of children by language skills. In addition, collecting data in the home environment introduced unavoidable variability in video camera position, and quality of video and sound recordings. At some points in the video coding, it was difficult to detect specific eye gaze or facial expressions from one or both members of the dyad because they were facing away from the camera or obscured by other play events. Moreover, play samples differed in length between dyads because of the naturalistic methods of eliciting parent–child play, and any specific prompts to play in other contexts or for longer periods would have jeopardized the dyad’s usual transactional patterns. Future research could maintain the natural sampling of spontaneous play interactions and contrast these with more structured play interactions in an experimental setting.</p>
<p>Additional variability was introduced into judgments of parent and child initiations and responses because of multiple possible interpretations of behaviors produced. For example, when a child used eye contact as his or her primary mode of communication, it was difficult to determine if he or she was using eye contact to request, show, comment, or share attention, particularly if the behavior was not clearly directed toward an adult. Although parents were operating an object, it was sometimes difficult to determine whether the parents were prompting the child to participate or whether they were simply operating the object for the functional purpose of creating a play event. The interrater reliability was modest but acceptable for all categories, and it was highly unlikely to have reached this level of agreement by chance, given the drop of less than .05 from the percentage agreement to kappa calculations for any coding category. This research looked at differences in partner responses to various modalities or functions grouped into categories of behavior, which further compensated for reliability differences within subgroups of a category when those subgroups were collapsed for analysis. The effectiveness of eliciting communicative responses in subcategories of communicative modes or functions without collapsing categories could be addressed in future research with larger populations and play samples.</p>
<p>Future research could expand the behaviors coded for parents and children, and contrast behaviors that received contingent responses with those that did not. Additional research could also explore the interaction between children’s initiation of communicative functions such as commenting and their responses to parent initiations of those functions. Further research could also incorporate information on individual differences in child and/or adult communication skills. For instance, available information on parent responsivity training indicates different effectiveness of treatment depending on the degree to which parents were already responsive before beginning training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1525740111416644">Yoder &amp; Warren, 2001</xref>). Treatment strategies could be contrasted to determine appropriate strategies to improve child communication skills through a combination of partner responsivity and child skill facilitation.</p>

<title>Clinical Implications</title>
<p>Practitioners working with children who have severe expressive impairments can help communicative partners recognize and respond to children’s behaviors that convey information, including subtle or nonintentional behaviors, using strategies such as the <italic>Communication Signal Inventory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525740111416644">Blackstone, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1525740111416644">Cress, 2002</xref>). In this strategy, a running list is kept between all familiar partners interacting with a child of the types of communication behaviors (or signals) produced, how those signals are interpreted, and how the partners plan to respond. For instance, a child might look back and forth between an adult and an object they are holding, which might be interpreted as indicating interest in the object, checking the adult’s attention, or an early attempt to comment or draw adult attention to the object. If adults were to respond as if the child intended to comment on the object (e.g., “Wow! Look at the ball!”), it would create a routine in which the child received consistent feedback for idiosyncratic behaviors that could develop into more conventional adult-directed commenting or showing behaviors (e.g., pointing to an object and looking to the adult).</p>
<p>Parents and service providers can also elicit and utilize existing routines and situations that elicit child vocalizations to support continuing development of complexity and diversity in vocal as well as nonvocal behaviors in this population. Children and adults who rely on nonspeech methods of communication still use a variety of speech and vocal behaviors as part of a multimodal communication system, and intervention should continue to address ways to make an individual’s available vocal repertoire richer and more interpretable to listeners while expanding the expression of intent with children’s available nonvocal behaviors. If parents routinely elicit a child’s vocalization in response to a particular goal-directed activity (such as bouncing the child or anticipating tickle), then the parent could interrupt that routine periodically to encourage more frequent or varied child vocalization in response to that activity.</p>
<p>Although standard therapeutic recommendations for interactions with prelinguistic children are consistent with the parent behaviors in this study, to contingently respond frequently to intentional child communication, it is also necessary to consider interactional adaptations for children who are infrequently addressing intentional communication toward partners. Children who are not yet intentional communicators may not naturally receive as much reinforcement of their behaviors as children who are already intentional, yet partner responsivity is one of the most important elements influencing the development of communicative intent. Partners may need additional support in recognizing and responding to preintentional behaviors in ways that explicitly mark their functional impact within the interaction. In particular, partners may need to provide specific focus on responding contingently to preintentional behaviors such as gaze or body movements that are not requests or social routines, to facilitate development of joint attention actions that convey functions such as commenting.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, this research provided significant comparisons of child and adult responses to partner behaviors in dyadic interactions for children with severe expressive communication impairments. Results showed that parents responded more often to children’s nonvocal behaviors and adult-directed communication than vocal or non-adult-directed behaviors. Children responded more often to communication in goal-directed interactions (such as requesting) than non-goal-interactions (such as commenting) with their parents. These results have implications for communication assessment and intervention for children with severe expressive communication impairments.</p>
