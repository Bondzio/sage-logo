<abstract>
<p>Spontaneous adrenal artery aneurysm rupture is an exceedingly rare but life-threatening condition that requires emergent treatment. We report on an 80-year-old male who underwent an emergent exploratory laparotomy and repair of a ruptured adrenal artery aneurysm and highlight the role of both vascular surgery and interventional radiology in the management of this scenario.</p>

<title>Case</title>
<p>An 80-year-old male well known to the vascular surgery and interventional radiology service presented to the emergency department with sudden and severe onset of right abdominal pain that radiated to the back. There was no history of trauma. His heart rate was elevated at 112 beats per minute and his blood pressure was initially 138/91 mm Hg. The pain was associated with a syncopal episode and 4 episodes of vomiting. On physical examination, the patient had diffuse abdominal tenderness and cool extremities to touch. Three liters of ringers lactate were subsequently required while in the emergency room to maintain a systolic pressure above 100 mm Hg. His hemoglobin was 67 g/L with other parameters normal. His urinalysis was negative. His past medical history was significant for previous abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair 8 months prior using a Talent (manufacturer) bifurcated endovascular stent graft (EVAR). Of note, there was never any documented wire or catheter cannulation of the renal arteries during this procedure. This procedure was complicated by a type II endoleak treated 5 months post AAA repair with polyvinyl alcohol and coil embolization of lumbar arteries and the inferior mesenteric artery due to interval aneurysm sac expansion. A computed tomography (CT) scan at the time of this presentation revealed a large hematoma in the right retroperitoneum. Given his history and the massive retroperitoneal hematoma, it was initially thought to represent AAA rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412470740">Figure 1</xref>). However, the epicenter and the largest component of the hematoma was centered around a tiny hyperdensity above the laterally displaced right kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412470740">Figure 2</xref>). In retrospect, incidental note had been made of a tiny aneurysm originating from the right inferior adrenal artery on angiogram performed during the type II endoleak coiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574412470740">Figure 3</xref>). This was also seen on the most recent follow-up CT post EVAR measuring 9 mm and, in retrospect, measuring 5 mm on the first post EVAR CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1538574412470740">Figure 4</xref>). It is not seen on the only available CT prior to EVAR from 2003.</p>

<p>The patient was taken to the operating theater where an exploratory laparotomy was performed to identify the source of the bleed. The aortic aneurysm sac was found to be intact and there was no evidence of hematoma surrounding it. Attention was then paid to the right upper quadrant where a large hematoma was visualized originating from the suprarenal fossa. The hematoma was evacuated and the feeding vessel was clipped, which appeared to stop all bleeding. The distal end of the adrenal artery could not be identified. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit in stable condition. Interventional radiology was contacted and an aortogram, right renal angiogram, and selectives for the inferior and superior adrenal artery were performed to ensure that the hard to identify aneurysm and its feeding vessel had indeed been clipped. The branch thought to be previously feeding the adrenal aneurysm was seen to end abruptly with no filling of aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, or contrast extravasation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1538574412470740">Figure 5</xref>). No further bleeding was identified, therefore no intervention was required. The patient did well and was discharged on postoperative day 12.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs) are rare but are most commonly found in the celiac, superior mesenteric, hepatic, or splenic arteries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412470740">1</xref>
</sup> The true incidence of VAA is unknown due to their asymptomatic nature although VAA rupture is associated with a high mortality.<sup>

</sup> Many go undiagnosed until autopsy, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis and aggressive treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412470740">3</xref>
</sup> Fortunately, VAAs are being diagnosed more frequently due to advances in diagnostic imaging.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412470740">4</xref>
</sup> The VAAs are classically divided into true (all 3 layers intact) and false aneurysms (only adventitia and/or perivascular tissue standing).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412470740">1</xref>
</sup> The exact mechanism of visceral artery aneurysm formation is unknown; however, atherosclerosis, inflammatory change, trauma, connective tissue disorders, vasculitis, medial fibrodysplasia, and congenital etiologies may all play a role.<sup>

</sup> Kawashima et al classified the causes of nontraumatic hemorrhage of the suprarenal gland into categories including idiopathic disease, adrenal tumors, neonatal stress, hemorrhagic diathesis, and stress.<sup>

<p>Common sites for arterial aneurysm rupture include the cerebrovascular bed, the splenic, renal, and other visceral arteries. Spontaneous adrenal artery ruptures are exceedingly rare but have been reported in association with uncontrolled hypertension and increased blood flow.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412470740">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412470740">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412470740">9</xref>

</sup> Due to their rare incidence and nonspecific presentation, adrenal artery ruptures are commonly misdiagnosed as renal colic at first presentation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412470740">5</xref>
</sup> The first indications of rupture are usually abrupt onset of abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412470740">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412470740">5</xref>
</sup> To our knowledge, there have been only 7 reported cases of ruptured adrenal artery aneurysms in the literature, 2 of which occurred in pregnant women.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412470740">3</xref>

</sup> The middle adrenal artery was involved in both the pregnancy-related cases. The remainder involved the inferior adrenal arteries with 1 occurring in the right and 4 in the left.</p>
<p>In contrast to infrarenal AAA, there is currently no known consensus among vascular surgeons regarding size criteria for treatment of adrenal artery aneurysms. Vascular surgeons at our institution were surprised that such a small aneurysm (less than 1 cm) ruptured. However, due to the risk of rupture, some surgeons recommend that VAAs should be treated regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms especially in women of childbearing age.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412470740">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412470740">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412470740">13</xref>
</sup> Among the aforementioned case reports involving adrenal artery aneurysm rupture, 2 cases were treated surgically and 5 were treated with transarterial embolization (TAE). Participants in all cases had comparable postoperative courses. Immediate surgical operation versus a TAE remains controversial in spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage. It is generally accepted that surgical operation should be performed promptly in cases involving extensive bleeding and uncontrollable hypotension; however, if the diagnosis is clear and endovascular therapy is able to control retroperitoneal hemorrhage, interventional techniques are accepted at the top of the treatment algorithm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412470740">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In most centers, interventional radiology techniques are the first-line treatment for VAAs. The success of the treatment depends on high-quality cross-sectional preprocedural imaging and adequately trained interventional radiologists with experience in complex embolization and stenting procedures. Procedures for transcatheter treatment of VAA involve embolization of the efferent and afferent arteries that supply either side of the aneurysm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412470740">1</xref>
</sup> A minority of aneurysms may also be treated by exclusion (placement of a stent graft across the aneurysm). The treatment of aneurysms occurring at bifurcations or trifurcations is now facilitated by newer products such as Onyx (ev3, Plymouth, Minnesota) that allow more precise occlusion without occluding important branch arteries. Newer technologies such as flow-diverting bare stents are under evaluation for the treatment of VAA. These are designed to exclude aneurysms and contain multilayered stents, therefore, improving laminar flow across the aneurysm and decreasing flow within the aneurysm vortex. Flow-diverting stents have been available in Europe since 2009, but their evidence is limited to a few case reports and short series.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412470740">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The possibility that the aneurysm was iatrogenic must be acknowledged. With a history of catheter cannulation for EVAR, inadvertent cannulation of the renal and inferior adrenal artery cannot be excluded. Additionally, the aneurysm was visible in the CT and digital subtraction angiography in the period after EVAR procedure. Its rupture, however, was not suspected when the patient presented to the emergency with a large retroperitoneal hematoma. Had the diagnosis been suspected presurgery, the patient could have received a CT angiogram prior to being taken directly to the operating room and could have received an embolization, which may have been more appropriate.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our case supports previous recommendations that exploration and repair of ruptured adrenal artery aneurysms may be a safe and effective treatment for cases of adrenal artery rupture associated with large retroperitoneal hematomas and hemodynamic instability. Endovascular techniques have been reported to be successful; however, these should be reserved for select cases where the bleeding source is well identified and clear cut. The interventional radiology team plays a pivotal role in establishing the source of bleeding and initiating subsequent management.</p>
