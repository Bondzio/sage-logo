<p>In this short, elegant and suggestive book, Professor Darnton reopens the case of the so-called ‘Affair of the Fourteen’, a 1749 Paris police round-up and incarceration in the Bastille of students and clerics ‘participating in unauthorized poetry recitals’ (3). Their crime was not one of poor scansion, but the dissemination of poems critical of King Louis XV. Although geographically and socially distant from the Versailles court, the political import of such verses was deemed serious enough to attract the attentions of the Paris police’s web of spies, whose efficiency in investigating and recording the correspondence and discussions of everyday life has delivered to Darnton a historical gift: a detailed ‘jumble of interrogation records, spy reports, and notes’ (12) that allows him, through deft archival detective work, to recreate something of the oral culture that is so often lost to the historian. Darnton does this through a careful investigation of the Fourteen, detailing their social status, political outlook and relationships to one another. By means of a diffusion chart, he plots the passage of the various texts through the group and within the context of the Old Regime street. In many ways, the Fourteen were doing nothing particularly out of the ordinary; ‘mauvais propos’ may have been illegal, but it was far from uncommon and was a popular indulgence among the educated classes of the Left Bank. The Fourteen were unfortunate, Darnton argues, to play such amusing games at a time of an unpopular peace treaty and an unwelcome tax increase, and when discontent was amplified through unhappiness with the role of the king’s mistress, Madame de Pompadour, and anger at the expulsion of the Pretender to the English throne, Prince Edouard. Even Maurepas was exiled from court for penning critical lines (indeed, Dartnon notes that numerous satirical verses originated at Versailles and formed part of courtly politics). Taking their cue from such action, the Paris police, their fingers never far from the popular pulse, sought out seditious verse which otherwise may have been allowed to pass as mere naughtiness. At least six poems and songs were distributed by the Fourteen, all of which went through several iterations as they passed among their friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>As such, <italic>Poetry and the Police</italic> offers its readers several pleasures and insights. Firstly, it provides a window onto historical procedure, and allows students to follow how a master historian sets about his work, framing a question and then tracing and testing it through a range of source material. It also helps that the book is deftly written, with an almost conversational tone, and divided into short, well-focused chapters. Quotations are well chosen, and given in the original as well as translation. Secondly, Darnton uses the Affair of the Fourteen to reprise some of his best tunes, using an unknown, or largely forgotten, minor incident to cast light on the tensions in wider society, much as he did in his famous study of the ‘Great Cat Massacre’. The Affair also reveals much about communication networks, not in this case one of print, but of song and orality, and one that continually changed and adapted its material (Darnton traces how the poems changed the words of popular songs) for amusement and political purpose. In the salacious words of such verses the nascent public sphere demonstrated something of its potential power and the extent to which it might unnerve authority. There is also a timely nod to the possibilities of current social media.</p>
<p><italic>Poetry and the Police</italic>, however, rarely explicitly engages with the debates about the nature and scope of the public sphere. The historiography and theoretical contributions are left safely to the endnotes, except for an initial discussion about communication, power and the public sphere. Darnton quibbles with both Michel Foucault’s and Jürgen Habermas’s conceptualizations of the public sphere. The Frenchman stresses power and epistemology, while the German uses the term sociologically ‘as reason operating through the process of communication’ (13). Darnton suggests that ‘neither of them works when I try to make sense of the material I have turned up in the archives’ (14). The meaning of the communication delicately unpicked in <italic>Poetry and the Police</italic> instead depends on the people involved, the historical moment and social setting, a ‘force that welled up from the streets’ (139) and had little in common with philosophical discourse. Not yet ready for a ‘French Spring’, the machinery that would unleash the anger of the later 1780s was in place in the mid-eighteenth century – ‘an information society … when information spread by word of mouth, and poetry carried messages among ordinary people, very effectively and long before the Internet’ (145).</p>
<p>Finally, the title of the book is something of a misnomer. The police did round up versifiers, but the materials in question were songs, rather than poetry. The oral culture that Darnton revives was one that sang, and he links the illicit poems produced by the Fourteen to the chansons to which they would be sung, suggesting that the original song’s words and melody also gave meaning to the Fourteen’s seditious activities. Recordings of the performances of the songs, which are included in textual form in the generous appendixes, are available online as an ‘electronic cabaret’ to accompany the book.</p>
