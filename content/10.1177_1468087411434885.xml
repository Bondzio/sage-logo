<abstract>
<p>The engine performance and emissions from a 3 l diesel engine equipped with a mechanical supercharger are investigated experimentally, and the advantages and disadvantages of the mechanical supercharger system are discussed in a comparison with performances and emissions from a corresponding 3 l diesel engine equipped with a turbocharger. An experiment conducted under steady-state conditions shows that the mechanical supercharger delivers higher boost pressures than the turbocharger under steady-state low- and middle-load operating conditions, and that the higher boost pressure allows the application of higher amounts of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), which leads to lower NOx emissions. In a transient test, the fuel flowrate is increased instantly from a low to high rate at a constant engine speed, and T<sub>90</sub>, which is the time required for the mechanical supercharger to achieve 90 per cent of the steady-state boost pressure, is found to be considerably shortened as compared to T<sub>90</sub> obtained in a similar test with a corresponding turbocharged engine. In addition, the Japanese JE05 test result shows that NOx emission from the 3 l engine equipped with the mechanical supercharger is lower by 50 per cent than the engine with the turbocharger at a common level of soot emissions. However, the fuel consumption rate is worsened by 5.5 per cent due to the drive loses of the supercharger. Further study for reducing the fuel penalty is necessary to apply the mechanical supercharger to practical diesel engine systems.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Tremendous improvements in exhaust emissions and noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) without increased fuel penalty have been recently achieved by advanced diesel engine technologies. Key technologies for the improvements include intercooled turbocharging, electrical exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) control and common rail fuel injection systems. However, to meet tightened future emission regulations, further development of low-emission technologies is a pressing need. Almost all of the present diesel engine systems are designed in combination with turbochargers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087411434885">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087411434885">2</xref>]. However, the isentropic efficiency of the compressor of the turbocharger is relatively low under a low-speed and low-load engine operation when the exhaust gas energy for boosting the intake air is not sufficient.</p>
<p>During acceleration at low engine speeds, the time lag for the turbocharger is significant. Generally, the boost pressure in transient conditions is lower than the boost pressure set in steady conditions. Thus, if the air flowrate is tuned to suppress the increase in smoke emissions during transient operation, the EGR rate has to be dropped, and this results in an increase in NOx emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087411434885">3</xref>]. If the EGR rate is increased to reduce NOx emissions, the decreased air flowrate causes an increase in smoke emissions. Therefore, there exists a tradeoff between smoke and NOx emissions with the EGR rate as a parameter. If the fuel injection timing is retarded to reduce NOx emissions without increasing the EGR rate, fuel consumption will be worsened.</p>
<p>An improvement of the supercharging characteristics in the transient operation is an important issue to improve emission performance and fuel consumption performance. Meanwhile, gasoline engines for passenger cars tend to be down-sized using turbocharger systems to improve fuel consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087411434885">4</xref>]. However, the turbocharger suffers from slow boost response as a result of low exhaust gas flowrate, causing non-linear drivability to be of concern. To solve this problem, some new vehicles have been engineered in combination with the mechanical supercharger to secure both improved fuel consumption and engine performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468087411434885">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087411434885">6</xref>].</p>
<p>In diesel engines, turbocharger systems are mainly used to improve emissions. Several examples of the application of multi-stage turbocharger systems to improve the transient performance of diesel engines have been reported. The application of a two-stage turbocharger for a passenger diesel vehicle was investigated by Choi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087411434885">7</xref>]. They reported that low-end torque and rated power were improved simultaneously with a two-stage turbocharger, and the transient response of the two-stage turbocharger system was found to be faster than a conventional turbocharger. Meanwhile, a three-stage turbocharger system application was reported by Nitta <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087411434885">8</xref>]. The three-stage turbocharger system was examined using numerical simulations and engine experiments. The results showed that the boost pressure response, fuel consumption and NOx emissions could be improved by the use of a three-stage turbocharger. The turbo lag was shortened with the three-stage turbocharger, but it still remained. The turbo lag is still an issue of concern with the turbocharger system.</p>
<p>The application of mechanical supercharger systems to diesel engines was investigated previously as a means to improve transient torque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087411434885">9</xref>]. However, the systems were not able to satisfy the demand for low fuel consumption rate. Ueda <italic>et al</italic>. proposed a multi-stage supercharging system combining a turbocharger and a mechanical supercharger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087411434885">9</xref>]. They reported that that the engine system was comparable to a naturally aspirated (NA) engine with a displacement three times as large as the engine in terms of acceleration performance and fuel consumption. However, the engine system suffered an increased fuel consumption rate. The reduction of emissions via EGR was not sufficiently discussed because the authors focused only on the improvements of torque and fuel consumption in the study. In the mechanical supercharger system layout, the EGR control under transient mode operation faces difficulty because exhaust gas has to be re-circulated from the outlet of the diesel particulate filter (DPF) to the supercharger inlet. Thus, the application of the mechanical supercharger system that cooperates with EGR systems needs to be studied further because much stricter emission regulations under transient test cycles are expected in the future.</p>
<p>In this study, a mechanical supercharger is applied to a diesel engine to reduce emissions, and an EGR control scheme is developed for the mechanical supercharger to be able to meet future emission regulations under transient test cycles. The performance of the mechanical supercharger in terms of exhaust emissions and fuel consumption under the Japanese JE05 transient test cycle will be presented by comparison with that of a corresponding turbocharging system.</p>

<p>The mechanical supercharger shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411434885">Fig. 1(b)</xref> is driven by the engine crank shaft via a V-ribbed belt at a rotating speed of seven times the engine speed. The EGR gas is cooled through an EGR cooler and then mixed with fresh air after particulate matter in the exhaust is removed in a catalyzed DPF. The EGR system is a low-pressure EGR system in which exhaust gas is re-circulated to the low-pressure side of the compressor. The intake throttle valve is located upstream of the EGR gas inlet for controlling the EGR gas flowrate. The mechanical supercharger has a bypass path connecting the inlet and outlet of the compressor. A bypass valve installed in the bypass path is used to control the boost pressure.</p>
<p>The exhaust gas components such as NOx, THC, CO, and CO<sub>2</sub> were measured using an exhaust gas analyzer (MEXA-1600DEGR: HORIBA, Ltd.), and were used to calculate the EGR rate and excess air ratio (lambda). A paper filter smoke meter (Model 415S: AVL List GmbH) and a micro soot sensor (Model 483: AVL List GmbH) were used to measure soot emissions under steady-state and transient operation, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087411434885">10</xref>]. The smoke mass concentration (mg/m<sup>3</sup>) was obtained from the reading of the smoke meter instrument using a conversion formula installed in the control box. Exhaust gas flowrate was calculated from the intake air flowrate measured by a laminar air flow meter (Model LFE-200B:Tsukasa Sokken Co., Ltd.) and fuel flowrate measured by a fuel flow meter (Model FP-215: Ono Sokki Co., Ltd.). Category no. 2 diesel fuel, as defined in the Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS), was used as the test fuel.</p>

<title>2.2 Mechanical supercharger</title>
<p>The mechanical supercharger used in this study is a new twin vortices series (TVS) supercharger manufactured by EATON Corporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087411434885">11</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087411434885">Figure 2</xref> shows a photograph of the Roots-type supercharger. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087411434885">Figures 3(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087411434885">3(b)</xref> show the rotors of the old and new superchargers, respectively. The air in the housing is scavenged by rotation of the lobes formed around the rotor. In the new type mechanical supercharger, the number and the twist angle of the lobes have been modified to improve the isentropic efficiency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087411434885">Figure 4</xref> shows a comparison between the isentropic efficiencies for the turbocharger on the left and the superchargers on the right. The specifications of the new and old type superchargers are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468087411434885">Table 2</xref>. It is seen in the diagram that the mechanical supercharger has a wider operation domain for over 60 per cent isentropic efficiencies than the turbocharger under low air flowrates. It is expected from the figure that the mechanical supercharger delivers an improvement of the boost pressure ratio as high as 2.5 at low engine speeds. Furthermore, as shown in the figure, the maximum isentropic efficiency of the compressor of the new mechanical supercharger is over 70 per cent, which is comparable to that of the turbocharger.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087411434885">Figure 5</xref> shows the flow characteristics of the mechanical superchargers measured using a flow test rig. The new type supercharger obtained higher pressure ratios and higher flowrates by means of improvement of the isentropic efficiency of the inner rotor. Additionally, the driving power was decreased with the new type supercharger. Since the Roots-type blower has no internal compression, the power required to drive the supercharger is reduced by opening the bypass passage and lowering the pressure ratio. Taking advantage of this characteristic, if the optimal boost pressure is set for each rotation and load, this will make it possible to minimize drive loss of the mechanical supercharger. Considering corrosion by EGR gas, a corrosion-resistant coating developed for marine engines was applied to the housing and the rotor of the mechanical supercharger.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087411434885">Figure 6</xref> shows the variations of intake air conditions, smoke and torque with NOx emissions at an engine speed (Ne) of 1600 r/min and at a fuel flowrate (Ff) of 40 mm<sup>3</sup>/stroke. The operating condition in this test is the same as that in the exhaust gas test cycle (JE05). The fuel injection parameters, such as fuel injection pressure, fuel injection timing, and pilot injection pattern, have been fixed at values set for meeting the Japanese new long-term emission standards. Meanwhile, the intake air management parameters such as EGR rate and boost pressure have been changed. The target mass air flowrate (MAF) has been fixed to keep the excess air ratio (lambda) constant, and the EGR rate was changed by varying the boost pressure. In the turbocharger system, the boost pressure was changed by altering the variable vane angle in the turbine.</p>

</fig>
<p>It is found from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087411434885">Fig. 6</xref> that lower NOx and higher soot emissions are achieved with the mechanical supercharger because of the higher EGR rate at higher boost pressures. The VGT vanes in the turbocharger are fully closed at around 1.7 g/kWh of NOx emissions (vertical dotted line), and this makes it impossible to attain higher EGR rate and lower NOx emissions. In the case of the mechanical supercharger, engine torque decreases due to the increased drive losses when the boost pressure is increased, although torque is kept nearly constant against the changes of NOx emission level. With the turbocharger, engine torque decreases due to the increased exhaust back pressure when the vane is closed to achieve a higher EGR rate for reducing NOx emissions. The trade-offs between NOx and soot shown in the figure are nearly the same for both systems, as the data plots from two systems lie on a single line.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087411434885">Figure 7</xref> shows the variations of intake gas temperature and EGR rate with boost pressure for the two systems. With the mechanical supercharger, the EGR gas is cooled by not only the EGR cooler but also the intercooler, and this leads to lower intake gas temperatures than those for the turbocharger system. This is the reason why the mechanical supercharger permits higher EGR rate than the turbocharger under the same boost pressure. The benefit of low NOx emissions achieved by the EGR gas cooling seems to be cancelled out by an increase in supercharger drive losses.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087411434885">Figure 8</xref> shows a comparison of two sets of full load performance for the two supercharger systems. The solid line on the full load torque map stands for the full load torque of a 4.8 l NA diesel engine. It is seen that the engine torque for the mechanical supercharger system is higher than the turbocharger at low engine speeds below 1500 r/min because of the higher boost pressures for the mechanical supercharger. The 3 l engine equipped with the mechanical supercharger is found to be superior to the 4.8 l NA engine in engine torque over the entire engine speed range. However, the mechanical supercharged engine has a disadvantage of higher brake fuel consumption rate (BSFC) amounting to around 20 g/kWh more consumption rate compared to the turbocharged engine due to the higher drive losses. The BSFC of the mechanical supercharged engine is declined by up to 10 per cent due to an increase in drive losses.</p>

<title>3.2 Emissions from the engine system with mechanical supercharging under transient operation</title>
<p>Transient performance of the mechanical supercharged engine was investigated in a comparison with the corresponding turbocharged engine. In the transient test, the control parameters of the turbocharger systems that were set to meet the Japanese new long-term emission regulations were used. In the mechanical supercharger, an algorithm for controlling the boost pressure and EGR rate was developed and the control parameters were adjusted in advance.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411434885">Fig. 1</xref> showed, the mechanical supercharger system adopts the low-pressure EGR loop in which EGR gas flows from the outlet of the DPF to the inlet of the supercharger through an EGR cooler. The distance from the engine exhaust manifold exit to the inlet of the supercharger is long enough to impose a time delay on the EGR system when the engine is accelerated or decelerated. To solve this problem, a calculation method of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) concentration in the intake manifold was developed to control the EGR rate under transient operation. Since the oxygen concentration changes on a real time basis depending on the changes in the fuel flowrate, it is difficult to precisely control the oxygen concentration only by adjusting the EGR valve. A control algorithm for replacing the target oxygen concentration ([O<sub>2</sub>] target) with the target mass air flowrate (MAF <sub>target</sub>) has been developed by using a simple model that can use the conventional MAF feedback control for the EGR gas flow. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087411434885">Figure 9</xref> illustrates the flow diagram for controlling the intake manifold O<sub>2</sub> concentration. The molecular number (N<sub>target</sub>) of the mass air flow necessary to attain the target oxygen concentration was calculated from the molecular number (N) of the in-cylinder gases and the EGR gas oxygen concentration ([O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>EGR</sub>). The [O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>EGR</sub> was calculated from exhaust O<sub>2</sub> concentration in consideration of a re-circulated delay of a gas volume of low-pressure EGR circuit. Finally, the target MAF was calculated from the N<sub>target</sub>. The algorithm developed permits the mechanical supercharger to have a controllability of the EGR flowrate comparable to that of the turbocharger. In the test of the mechanical supercharger, the same control parameters as those in the turbocharger system were used, except for the boost pressure and the EGR control strategy. The control map of target oxygen concentration at each engine speed/fuel flowrate was constructed based on a preliminary engine test under steady-state conditions.</p>

It is obvious that the T<sub>90</sub> for the mechanical supercharger is considerably shortened to 0.18 s from the T<sub>90</sub> of 2.29 s in the case of the turbocharger. In the mechanical supercharger system, the bypass valve opening angle is simply changed to quickly control the boost pressure while the rotor keeps rotating.</p>

<p>Next, exhaust gas emissions were measured in the JE05 emission test cycle for heavy-duty commercial vehicles in Japan, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087411434885">Fig. 11</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1468087411434885">Figure 12</xref> shows the test result from the JE05 test mode during a time from 1410 to 1470 s, which includes idle operation. In the figure, boost pressure, EGR rate, excess air ratio, NOx concentration and soot concentration are presented for both systems for comparison. The control parameters in both systems were adjusted to make the excess air ratio, lambda, to be equal in both systems as the lambda records in the figure show. It is shown that the mechanical supercharger delivers higher responsiveness and higher boost pressures than the turbocharger system during the acceleration period. Due to the faster response of the boost pressure and lower EGR gas temperature with the mechanical supercharger, the NOx emissions curve does not exhibit a spike, which is observed in the turbocharger system when the engine is accelerated. In addition, a 10 per cent higher EGR rate, which is attained by the higher boost pressure, accounts for the reduced NOx emissions. Soot emissions are the same levels in both systems because the excess air ratio is controlled to be common in both systems.</p>

As seen, NOx emissions for the mechanical supercharger are dropped by 50 per cent at an identical soot emission level common to both systems, but BSFC is worsened by 5.5 per cent due to the increased drive losses.</p>

<title>3.3 Application of mechanical supercharger to diesel engine</title>
<p>In the previous sections, the impact of the application of mechanical supercharging on the test engine and emissions, particularly under transient operation at low engine speeds, has been investigated. The advantage of the strategy to control the intake oxygen concentration using an algorism that takes into account the recirculation delay of the EGR system has been confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, the mechanical supercharger was found to deliver low-speed torque comparable with a 4.8 l NA engine. However, in the mechanical supercharger, fuel consumption rate is worsened due to an increase in drive losses, and the boost pressure is lowered under the full load range at mid to high engine speeds. In the case of gasoline engines for passenger cars equipped with the mechanical supercharger, the fuel consumption is improved in combination with various measures given below:</p>
<list id="list1-1468087411434885" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>downsizing of engine: reducing engine friction by using smaller displacement engines, and using the mechanical supercharger to compensate for low-speed torque;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>down speeding at engine operation points: each gear ratio is modified to reduce engine friction thereby improving total fuel consumption of vehicle;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>multi-stage supercharging by using a combination of the supercharger and the turbocharger: improving the weak points as well as keeping advantages of the mechanical supercharger.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The strategies taken for gasoline engines may be similarly applied to diesel engines, although the operating conditions of heavy-duty diesels are different from those for passenger cars. These differences need to be taken into account when the application of supercharging to heavy-duty engines is considered.</p>

<title>4 Summary</title>
<p>An experimental study has been performed on a diesel engine equipped with a mechanical supercharger to investigate its impact on emissions and fuel consumption. As a result, the following findings have been obtained.</p>
<list id="list2-1468087411434885" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A time delay is not present in the mechanical supercharger, and its effect on improving transient engine performance has been confirmed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The mechanical supercharger delivers higher boost pressures than the turbocharger under steady-state low- and middle-load operation. Higher boost pressure allows the application of higher amounts of EGR, which leads to lower NOx emissions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The JE05 test result shows that the improved transient performance of the supercharger system allows the mechanical supercharger to reduce the NOx emissions by 50 per cent under the same soot emissions level as compared with the NOx emissions in the turbocharger system, which meets the Japanese new long-term emission regulations. However, the fuel consumption rate was worsened by 5.5 per cent due to its higher drive loses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A 3 l diesel engine equipped with a mechanical supercharger delivers high torque that is comparable with that of a 4.8 l NA engine in the low-speed range.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For practical applications of the mechanical supercharger to diesel engines, further study is necessary to compensate the increased fuel penalty whilst retaining the superior transient performance of the mechanical supercharger to that of the turbocharger.</p></list-item>
