<abstract>
<p>There is pressure for surgical departments to introduce new and innovative health technologies in an evidence-based manner while ensuring that they are safe and effective and can be managed with available resources. A local health technology assessment (HTA) program was developed to systematically integrate research evidence with local operational management information and to make recommendations for subsequent decision by the departmental executive committee about whether and under what conditions the technology will be used. The authors present a retrospective analysis of the outcomes of this program as used by the Department of Surgery &amp; Surgical Services in the Calgary Health Region over a 5-year period from December 2005 to December 2010. Of the 68 technologies requested, 15 applications were incomplete and dropped, 12 were approved, 3 were approved for a single case on an urgent/emergent basis, 21 were approved for “clinical audit” for a restricted number of cases with outcomes review, 14 were approved for research use only, and 3 were referred to additional review bodies. Subsequent outcome reports resulted in at least 5 technologies being dropped for failure to perform. Decisions based on local HTA program recommendations were rarely “yes” or “no.” Rather, many technologies were given restricted approval with full approval contingent on satisfying certain conditions such as clinical outcomes review, training protocol development, or funding. Thus, innovation could be supported while ensuring safety and effectiveness. This local HTA program can be adapted to a variety of settings and can help bridge the gap between evidence and practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>New surgical technologies, including devices and procedures, are emerging at an ever-increasing rate. Surgeons are eager to provide the best and most up-to-date care for their patients; hence, they often drive the demand for new technologies that purport to deliver better outcomes and shorter hospital stays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611421916">1</xref></sup> Consequently, there is pressure for surgical departments to evaluate and introduce new and innovative health technologies in a timely manner while also ensuring that these technologies have adequate scientific evidence for their safety and effectiveness and can be managed in a climate of scarce resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611421916">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611421916">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Health technology assessment (HTA) is a multidisciplinary field of applied research aimed at providing high-quality information about the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and broader impact of drugs, medical technologies, and health systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611421916">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611421916">5</xref></sup> Canada has a strong history of HTA at the federal and provincial levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611421916">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611421916"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611421916">8</xref></sup> However, whereas HTA reports produced by academic institutions and HTA agencies are valuable tools for evaluating the efficacy of new technologies, these reports are not always translated into clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611421916">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611421916">10</xref></sup> Part of the reason for this is because decision makers must also acknowledge complexity and consider context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611421916">11</xref></sup> by integrating different forms of information—experience, context, and research—to determine whether the technology is appropriate for their local setting. For example, is there adequate infrastructure? Will the technology require specialized training? Is adoption of the technology justified on the basis of local patient needs? Will the technology be compatible with existing equipment? Is there room in the budget? Will the technology provide a significant advantage over the existing standard of care and current practices in the local setting? In other words, whereas HTA reports can inform a decision on the basis of efficacy and sometimes cost-effectiveness, other factors such as local population needs, local effectiveness, and local resources also need to be considered in a systematic manner. Furthermore, technological innovations in the field of surgery can be particularly challenging to evaluate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611421916">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350611421916">13</xref></sup> and the world of surgical devices changes so quickly that HTA reports are often outdated or nonexistent, forcing the surgical department to make its own best judgment about the appropriateness of new technology. In short, the surgical department needs to be able to integrate research evidence about a technology with local operational management information and make a decision about whether and under what conditions the technology will be used.</p>
<p>In 1997, the Department of Surgery &amp; Surgical Services within the Calgary Health Region (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) recognized the need to have a systematic, consistent, and transparent process for evaluating requests for new technologies from its members. The department created an “Introduction of New Technology” form and process, which were designed to bring available research evidence together with local information in order to assess new technologies. From 1997 through to 2005, this “Local HTA Decision Support Program,” as it came to be known, was used to review and make decisions on technologies requested by surgeons. Several revisions of the Local HTA Program were made between 2005 and 2009, which resulted in a more formalized review process.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to describe this Local HTA Program and to retrospectively examine its activity over a 5-year period from December 2005 to December 2010. We also describe the major lessons learned and how this Local HTA Program is uniquely positioned to put HTA research evidence into action to help bridge the gap between evidence and practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350611421916">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350611421916"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611421916">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Program Setting and Time Period</title>
<p>The Department of Surgery &amp; Surgical Services comprises 286 surgeons in 14 Divisions within what was known as the Calgary Health Region. This was restructured as part of a single provincial health services organization (Alberta Health Services) in May 2008. This article is a retrospective analysis of the last 5 years from December 2005 to December 2010. Of the authors, PP is a member of the Local HTA Advisory Committee, LA is the Physician Leader and Chair of the Local HTA Advisory Committee and sits on the Surgical Executive Committee, and JK is the current and RL was the past head of the Department of Surgery &amp; Surgical Services and Chair of the Surgical Executive Committee.</p>

<title>Program Description</title>
<p>From its inception in 1997, the Local HTA Program has undergone 4 revisions. A major revision occurred in December 2005, resulting from participant feedback from an HTA education initiative within the Department of Surgery &amp; Surgical Services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611421916">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611421916">18</xref></sup> Subsequent revisions occurred in August 2007, January 2008, and January 2009, based on the “Framework for Regional Health Authorities to Make Optimal Use of Health Technology Assessment”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350611421916">19</xref></sup> and consultation and engagement with other departments within the Calgary Health Region: 4 clinical departments (Cardiac Sciences, Anesthesia, Internal Medicine, Pharmacy, and Critical Care) and 3 nonclinical departments (Research, Professional Practice &amp; Development, and Medical Device Safety &amp; Risk Management). A description of this adaptation and revision process has been given elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350611421916">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350611421916">21</xref></sup> However, all the major elements of the Program were present from 2005, with the revisions refining forms and procedures. For simplicity, we will describe only the latest version of the Program (released in January 2009).</p>

<title>Decisions Based on Local HTA Advisory Committee Recommendations</title>
<p>We reviewed documents held by the Department of Surgery Health Technology and Innovation Office pertaining to technology requests received between December 2005 and December 2010 to produce descriptive statistics regarding which Divisions in the Department of Surgery &amp; Surgical Services submitted the requests, how many technologies were evaluated, how many technologies required minor or significant review, and what kinds of decisions were made based on Local HTA Advisory Committee recommendations. For the latter, decisions were grouped into 1 of 7 categories: (1) Rejected (not approved for purchase or implementation), (2) Approved (approved for purchase and implementation), (3) Conditional: Single Case (urgent/emergent approval of a single case where options are limited; approval for additional cases conditional on positive outcomes of the first case), (4) Conditional: Clinical Audit (approval for a limited number of cases in clinical practice; full approval conditional on satisfactory outcomes or satisfactory completion of other conditions), (5) Research: Clinical Trial (approval under clinical trials research protocols only), (6) Research: Support of Project (approval for innovative research undertaken by the applicant), and (7) Referral (technologies having potential impact beyond the scope of surgery and/or requiring government funding). For each decision, we tabulated the criteria or concerns (ie, failure to meet criteria) surrounding the technology that led to this decision. For decisions made prior to January 2009, we reviewed the documentation on the decision and retrospectively cross-matched the concerns noted in the decision letters with a list of technology evaluation criteria that was developed in the January 2009 version of the Program. For decisions made after January 2009, we noted the evaluation criteria that were identified with the decision outcome. This process was done independently by 2 of the authors (PP and LA), and any differences were resolved by discussion.</p>

<title>Program Description</title>
<p>The Local HTA Program was designed to provide a systematic, consistent, and transparent process to integrate research evidence about a technology with local operational management information in order to make a recommendation about whether and under what conditions the technology would be used. Thus far, the Program has been used to evaluate single technologies as the requests arise; it has not had the opportunity to be used to prioritize technologies for funding, although the tools to do so were added in the January 2009 version.</p>
<p>The Local HTA Program requires the appointment of a “Local HTA Advisory Committee” or health professional(s) who fill its role. The Local HTA Advisory Committee manages the evaluation process, reviews the application for suitability and completeness, determines whether the application can be approved as is, and for those technologies requiring further assessment, makes recommendations to the Surgical Executive Committee for subsequent decision. The Local HTA Advisory Committee for the Department of Surgery &amp; Surgical Services comprises 4 to 6 surgeons, 1 research scientist, 1 administrative assistant, 2 to 3 nurse patient care managers, 1 purchasing specialist, and 2 financial analysts.</p>
<p>The Local HTA Program itself consists of <italic>Policy</italic>, <italic>Forms</italic>, and <italic>Appendices</italic>. The <italic>Policy</italic> sets the guidelines for introduction of new technologies, the <italic>Forms</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350611421916">Table 1</xref>) collect relevant information about the technology and the environment in which it is intended to be used, and the <italic>Appendices</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1553350611421916">Table 2</xref>) provide tools for evaluations, decision making, and submitting reports in a systematic and consistent manner.</p>

<p>The <italic>Policy</italic> for the Local HTA Program states that “all new technologies introduced by the Department will be evaluated by the Local HTA Program before implementation or purchase.” In this context, “new technology” is defined as “a change from current practice (either adoption of new technologies or modification, replacement, or discarding of existing technologies or process of care) that may have a direct or indirect impact on patient care and/or financial aspects of health care services.” In addition, from a surgical perspective, “new technology” is also defined as having at least one of the following characteristics: (1) increased cost, (2) different risk profile, (3) need for new training, or (4) use of a different anatomical approach. The <italic>Policy</italic> also states that “only health care providers or health services employees may submit requests—not technology manufacturers or vendors.”</p>
<p>An overview of the Local HTA Program is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350611421916">Figure 1</xref>. The process begins with the <italic>Technology Request Pathway</italic>, which serves 2 functions: (1) it can be a rapid approval process for noncontentious technologies or (2) it can be the preliminary step for a more thorough review process (<italic>Local HTA Pathway</italic>). The applicant, usually a surgeon, provides basic information about the technology and its intended use, risks, and benefits (Form A). Next, the applicant gets support from the Division Chief or Department (Form B) to ensure that the technology fits within the strategic direction of the Division or Department. The technology is also checked for any legal, contractual, or cost issues (Form C) prior to starting the review process. The Technology Request package (Forms A, B, and C) is then reviewed by the Local HTA Advisory Committee, which checks for completeness of information. The Committee or its physician leader also determines whether the technology represents a minor change of practice, allowing for immediate approval for purchase and implementation, or whether it needs to be referred to the <italic>Local HTA Pathway</italic> for further assessment (Form D). The <italic>Technology Assessment Screening Guide</italic> (Appendix I of the Program) was developed to assist in this decision.</p>

<title>Decisions Based on Local HTA Advisory Committee Recommendations</title>
<p>From December 2005 to December 2010, 68 technology requests were documented by the Local HTA Program. We note that this number is likely an underestimate, as not all requests were captured by the Programs’ archives, particularly in the earlier years. There were 5 requests recorded in 2005, 10 in 2006, 8 in 2007, 31 in 2008, 9 in 2009, and 5 in 2010. The rise in requests in 2008 represents, in part, the improvement in documentation procedures and interest in the new program. The fall in requests in 2009-2010 follows the funding freeze put on new technologies after the incorporation of the Calgary Health Region into the province-wide body, Alberta Health Services, in May 2008. Of the 68 technology requests recorded, 14 were requested by the Division of General Surgery, 10 by the Division of Orthopaedics, and 6 by the Division of Ophthalmology, with the other divisions each making a total of 1 to 5 requests over the 5-year period.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350611421916">Figure 2</xref> shows the decisions made on the 68 technology requests. Fifteen of the initial request submissions were incomplete, either because an internal applicant could not be found (the <italic>Policy</italic> does not allow vendor-initiated requests without an applicant from the Department) or the applicant failed to complete the required forms. Of the 53 complete technology requests, 21% (11/53) were approved within the <italic>Technology Request Pathway</italic>. These technologies were deemed to involve only a minor change of practice and approval was given for purchase and implementation. The remaining technology requests (79%, 42/53) were referred to the <italic>Local HTA Pathway</italic> for decision by the Surgical Executive Committee. Of these 42 requests, 1 was approved, 24 were conditionally approved either as a Single Case or for Clinical Audit, 14 were approved for research use, and 3 had a potential impact beyond the scope of surgery and were referred to other working groups or the provincial government.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1553350611421916">Table 3</xref> shows the criteria or concerns (failure to meet criteria) that led to the decisions made for each of the 42 technologies referred to in the <italic>Local HTA Pathway</italic>. The most frequently used concern was “cost”; this was because unless a technology was cost-neutral, implementation was always contingent on approval by the financial officers who control the budget. The next most frequent concerns were those within the “Health Gain” domain: “population health” (defining the specific patient population or setting practice guidelines), “standard of care” (often requiring outcome measures to ensure that the standard of care is met in our setting), and “efficacy” (regarding the amount and quality of the published data). However, the concerns were differently distributed for the various decisions. For the “Clinical Audit” decision, the top concerns other than “cost” were “standard of care” and “population health.” For the “Research: Clinical Trial” decision, top concerns or criteria were “efficacy” and “innovation/knowledge and research.” For the “Research: Support of Project” decision, top criteria or concerns were “innovation/knowledge and research,” “safety,” and “efficacy.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we report how new surgical technologies and innovations are evaluated by describing the activities of a Local HTA Decision Support Program within the Regional Department of Surgery &amp; Surgical Services in the Calgary Health Region over a 5-year period. HTA is a multidisciplinary field of applied research providing high-quality information about the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and broader impact of drugs, medical technologies, and health systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611421916">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611421916">5</xref></sup> The Local HTA Program was designed to integrate objective impartial HTA research evidence with local operational management information in a systematic, consistent, and transparent manner to inform the adoption and use of new technologies, ensure enhanced patient care, and support evidence-informed decisions. Importantly, the Local HTA Program was created and revised with significant input from surgeons and surgical support staff in the local setting. Furthermore, surgeons and support staff sat on the technology reviewing committees, which were responsible for translating HTA information into clinical practice recommendations within the local context.</p>
<p>Although few would disagree with the principle of evidence-informed decision making, the tension between thoroughness and timeliness is always an issue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350611421916">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350611421916"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350611421916">24</xref></sup> Our Local HTA Program attempted to minimize this problem by providing a method by which noncontentious requests can be approved relatively quickly (1-4 weeks after submission of completed forms) by the Local HTA Advisory Committee (<italic>Technology Request Pathway</italic>) at their monthly meetings, while providing the option to gather more information and refer more complex cases to the Surgical Executive Committee for decision (<italic>Local HTA Pathway</italic>). Over the 5-year period examined, at least 21% (11/53) of technology requests were approved by the more rapid <italic>Technology Request Pathway</italic>. This is likely an underestimate, as the records for these rapid decisions were not always forwarded to the Department of Surgery Health Technology and Innovation Office in the earlier years—a limitation of our study. The development of the <italic>Technology Screening Guide</italic> (Appendix I of the Program) was instrumental in providing a checklist to determine which pathway an assessment should follow. Also, utilization of a multicriteria decision process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350611421916">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1553350611421916">26</xref></sup> and the appointment of multidisciplinary, objective, and trusted personnel to comprise the Local HTA Advisory Committee was essential.</p>
<p>In spite of our attempt to simplify the technology request application process, 22% (15/68) of requests were incomplete on receipt (ie, incomplete Forms A-C) or no internal applicant was found (applicants from the Department are required if the initial inquiry is from a vendor). While we do not know the reasons for incomplete applications, we can speculate that the effort to fulfill the required paperwork and/or find an internal supporter was greater than the need to introduce a new technology. In any case, the Local HTA Program does permit rapid approval of an urgent/emergent request as a Single Case, particularly for patients with limited options. For technologies approved for a Single Case, any subsequent requests for the same technology are conditional on satisfactory outcomes for the previous case.</p>
<p>Of some surprise to us was that no technologies were rejected outright on the initial review (although some were rejected later). In fact, most completed requests received were carefully thought out. We suspect that when applicants understand what kinds of criteria will be considered by the Local HTA Program and that their application will be peer-reviewed, they limit their requests to promising technologies that they are willing to champion. Also, the required paperwork may act as a filter for technologies that lack evidence for the potential for improved patient care.</p>
<p>The initial review of a technology by the Local HTA Pathway rarely resulted in a “yes” decision for adoption of the technology. Rather, the majority of requests were given approval for a limited number of cases with the requirement to satisfy certain conditions (Single Case and Clinical Audit decisions, 45%) or were approved only for research protocols (Clinical Trial and Research Project decisions, 26%). This is in contrast to other reported hospital-based assessment programs, which measure their effectiveness by how many technologies were denied and thus how much money saved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1553350611421916">27</xref></sup> Our Local HTA Program recognizes the need to build evidence and offer additional approval options between full acceptance and rejection. New surgical devices or generational updates of existing devices often have little published evidence to support their use. Rather than stifling innovation and rejecting the technology, which has been a criticism of HTA initiatives,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1553350611421916">28</xref></sup> the Local HTA Program attempts to manage risks associated with the limited evidence by setting conditions for technology use, as has been done or recommended elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1553350611421916">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1553350611421916"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1553350611421916">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>For these partial approval types of decisions, the limitations placed on a technology were proportional to the uncertainty about the technology. For example, technologies given the less restrictive Clinical Audit decision had a lower proportion of “efficacy” and “safety” concerns (43% and 29%, respectively) than technologies given the more restrictive Clinical Trials decision (100% and 75%, respectively). Conditions placed on the Clinical Audit outcome were relatively straightforward, such as developing training protocols, ensuring equipment compatibility, reporting outcome measures to verify that satisfactory results are achieved, or clearly defining patient selection criteria. Full approval of the technology is likely if the conditions are satisfied. In contrast, the conditions for Clinical Trials are stringent, including review by the institutional ethics board and safety approval. Full approval of the technology is unlikely before the clinical trials are completed and independently verified. A disadvantage of allowing partial approval is that the onus falls on the applicant to satisfy the conditions and find funding for testing, if required. If departments do not have an internal budget for research, this can prove daunting. Also, small internal audits may not eliminate bias or be able to detect rare adverse events. The ability to provide funding for evidence development as part of the Local HTA Program would be beneficial, and a variety of funding models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1553350611421916">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1553350611421916"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1553350611421916"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1553350611421916"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1553350611421916"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1553350611421916">37</xref></sup> are currently being discussed.</p>
<p>In situations where clinical research evidence was locally gathered, there were a few cases in which several technologies addressing the same condition were compared. In one case, the best technology was approved for a second round of testing, while 2 other technologies tested were rejected. In another case, a newly approved technology triggered the sudden disinvestment of an older (but still adequate) technology. Disinvestment was necessary because having both the old and new technologies posed significant patient safety issues due to dangerous equipment incompatibility. In yet another case, it was recognized that the technologies under consideration could affect other medical disciplines, thus the technologies were referred to a province-wide working group for review. The continued addition of new technologies without standardization or disinvestment of older technologies can result in reduced purchasing efficiency or patient safety issues. This highlights the urgent need to consider adoption proposals that are specifically linked to disinvestment proposals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1553350611421916">38</xref></sup> and to identify health care services that do not provide value for money.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1553350611421916">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Relatively few technologies were brought forward for a second round of review within the study period. Generally, the onus for submitting follow-up reports is left with the applicant. In May 2008, there was a major reorganization of the health care delivery system in Alberta with the absorption of the Calgary Health Region into the province-wide Alberta Health Care Services. Although the Local HTA Program continued to function after this time, there was much organizational confusion and a funding freeze was put on all new technologies. Consequently, the Surgery Health Technology and Innovation Office was reluctant to request follow-up reports from those applicants who did not voluntarily submit reports, as it was unclear whether new technologies could be funded. Thus, we do not know if some of these technology requests were abandoned by the applicants or if outcomes collection is still in process. We suspect that some technologies were tried (as a clinical audit) and found to be unsatisfactory. Therefore, the applicant did not submit a further request for full approval, in effect delivering their own “no” decision.</p>
<p>There are several areas where our Local HTA Program could be improved. As recommended by Mitchell et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1553350611421916">40</xref></sup> hospital-based HTA using local data can fill gaps in the published evidence and also improve the generalizability of evidence to the local setting. To take advantage of local evidence, health systems should encourage the development of hospital-based HTA centers, seek out local preference data, and maintain databases of patient outcomes and utilization of services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1553350611421916">40</xref></sup> Easy access to databases of patient outcomes within our organization would facilitate our technology adoption monitoring processes. In addition, although there appears to be a general view that involvement of patients and the public is highly desirable in HTAs and many HTA agencies have established some mechanism for seeking input from patients or the public in their processes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1553350611421916">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1553350611421916">42</xref></sup> our program lacks both patient and public input.</p>
<p>Our Local HTA Program was developed within a Canadian health care region, which included 4 adult acute care hospitals and 1 pediatric hospital. As part of the Program, a “tool box” was developed to facilitate transfer and adaptation of the program to other groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350611421916">20</xref></sup> In fact, the Local HTA Program is now being adapted for use by the province-wide surgery clinical network within Alberta Health Services. We believe that the program is generalizable to other health care organizations that require integration of local contextual information with research evidence as provided in external HTA reports. A similar program has been developed for the province of Ontario in Canada,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1553350611421916">43</xref></sup> and the MINI-HTA program (management and decision support tool) is operating locally and has been distributed nationally for hospital services in Denmark.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1553350611421916">44</xref></sup> A summary of the lessons learned for development and implementation of the Local HTA Program is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1553350611421916">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<p>In conclusion, our Local HTA Program has several unique features. First, the Program was designed by surgeons for surgeons, and surgeons are the key players in making recommendations and decisions. Conflict of interest is avoided by the presence of a multidisciplinary impartial Local HTA Advisory Committee. In fact, we know that our program has prevented the unrestricted uptake of technologies that have been approved elsewhere in Alberta, indicating that surgeons can ask hard questions about new technologies. Second, any department member is empowered and encouraged to submit a technology request. Third, the Program is highly collaborative, relying on a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, managers, researchers, and administrators to bring their expertise to the evaluation process. Fourth, the Program encourages innovation while managing risk by offering a range of approval levels. Thus, the Local HTA Program is positioned to help bridge the gap between evidence and practice, a long-standing concern,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350611421916">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350611421916"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611421916">16</xref></sup> by providing a way to incorporate global evidence with local relevance as well as by involving surgeons themselves. We believe that our Local HTA Decision Support Program has sufficient versatility to be adapted to a wide variety of regional health authorities.</p>
