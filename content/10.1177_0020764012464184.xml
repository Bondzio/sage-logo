<body>
<p>Public mental health has come into its own in the past decade or so, certainly in the UK. The evidence for prevention of mental illness and promotion of mental health is getting stronger, and yet there appears to be a reluctance among mental health care professionals to take on the role of educators. One reason for this appears to be a lack of training that focuses largely on diagnosis and management of illness. Furthermore, resources are also often diverted to management, whereas it is well known that prevention is better than cure. It is important to make a distinction between mental health promotion and prevention of mental illness. Mental health and mental illness, although distinct, are often seen as two ends of the spectrum. Prevention can be categorized as primary, secondary and tertiary. Psychiatrists as clinicians are trained to deal with secondary and tertiary prevention.</p>
<p>Positive mental health can lead to social and economic benefits, including improved educational attainment, better productivity, better physical health and lower mortality and improved resilience to adversity. The economic costs of mental illness are truly huge (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764012464184">Campion, Bhui &amp; Bhugra, 2012</xref>). In England alone the annual cost of mental illness is £105 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764012464184">CMH, 2010</xref>). Mental health promotion and prevention are effective means and strategies to reduce the burden of disease. Age of onset of mental illness is an important factor in our understanding of the role of health promotion. Half of all mental illnesses (excluding dementia) start before the age of 14, and 75% by the mid-20s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764012464184">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764012464184">Kim-Cohen et al., 2003</xref>). It has been suggested that between a quarter and a half of adult lifetime prevalence of mental illness may be preventable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764012464184">Kim-Cohen et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to looking at vulnerability, we also need to study resilience and protective factors. Apart from genetic vulnerabilities, social inequalities as evidenced by unemployment, poor housing, overcrowding and poverty contribute to the genesis of mental illness. Gender and age can also play a role. Social capital and networks, emotional and social literacy and good physical health can contribute to resilience. Child abuse – physical, emotional or sexual – can contribute to deteriorating mental health. One-parent families, overuse of alcohol, violence, parental unemployment and other developmental factors can lead to mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764012464184">CDCP, 2005</xref>). High risk-taking behaviours such as smoking, drug use, lack of physical exercise leading to unhealthy eating and obesity can also contribute to the genesis of mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764012464184">McManus, Meltzer &amp; Campion, 2010</xref>). Some groups are more vulnerable to developing mental illness. These include black and minority ethnic groups, children in care, people with a learning disability and prisoners. Thus special attention is needed to develop and deliver preventive health care for these groups.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764012464184">Green, McGinnity, Meltzer, Ford and Goodman (2005)</xref> showed that, in the UK, 10% of children and young people have a mental disorder at any given time, including conduct disorder, emotional disorder, hyperkinetic disorder, autism and so on. Inevitably, these disorders will cause poor school attendance and scholastic achievement may be affected.</p>
<p>Conduct disorder is related to later personality disorder and criminal activity. Emotional disorders are linked with later self-harm and depression. These are largely social factors and early intervention for various psychiatric disorders has shown varying degrees of success. Social psychiatry is the branch of psychiatry that is concerned with the effects of social environment on the mental health of the individual, and with the effects of the mentally ill person on his/her social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764012464184">Leff, 2010</xref>). Using life events as an exemplar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764012464184">Leff (2010)</xref> very cogently argues that experiences in the past are represented in the subject’s memory and operate in the present to trigger psychiatric illnesses and sometimes precipitate these and at other times produce relapse. Social psychiatry is best placed in developing mental health promotion and prevention of certain mental illnesses. Educating individuals, families and societies is at the core of social psychiatry as well as that of public health. An understanding of the role that social factors play in the precipitation and perpetuation of psychiatric illnesses is critical in developing any educational activities.</p>
<p>Should we be looking at preventive and social psychiatry as a broader branch of psychiatry? The reasons for this approach are obvious from the brief evidence presented above. Even though psychiatrists or mental health rofessionals may not be able to reduce social inequalities, awareness of variations and informing policy makers is a role that they can easily fulfil. Promoting parental health and prenatal education through health visitors and nurses, telephone peer support, violence reduction, smoking cessation and supporting good parental skills can all play a key role in reducing psychiatric distress. Working with children at pre-school level and school-based health promotion focusing on a number of initiatives can lead to reduced rates of conduct disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764012464184">Durlak, Weissberg, Dymincki, Taylor &amp; Schellinger, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it can be argued that social psychiatry is reventive and social medicine by another name. Taking cultural factors and cultural patterns of child rearing and child development into account, it becomes obvious that social psychiatry has to be at the heart of public mental health and any educational strategies.</p>
<p>Early interventions for mental disorders must include educating families and patients and schools as well as making society at large aware of the impact of mental illness. Early interventions in dementia can also influence rates of dementia. Promoting social resilience through schools as well as work-based health promotion can play a significant role. Encouraging social and community cohesion and green spaces can add to self-worth and self-esteem and a sense of belonging. This is particularly relevant for individuals who are socio-centric in their outlook.</p>
<p>Mental illness influences physical illness, and in turn physical illness affects mental health. Psychological well-being and coping strategies can be taught and must form a part of the school curriculum. There are different levels of education and interventions for primary prevention and promotion of mental health. Effective strategies must use social paradigms at the individual, familial, cultural and social level.</p>
