<abstract>
<p>Red blood cell transfusion therapy has been used with the ultimate goal of enhancing oxygen delivery to vital organs and tissue beds, thus enhancing cellular function. Red blood cell transfusion therapy is also a long-standing practice, and since the 1950s it has only grown in utilization, especially within the United States. Recently, transfusion therapy has come under increased scrutiny with a desire to develop evidence-based therapeutic guidelines that not only decrease undue risk to the patient but also decrease the overutilization of this high-cost, low-availability product. Despite the development and implementation of these guidelines, significant complications associated with red cell therapy persist and may be related to storage of blood products. Recently, within the transfusion literature, there has been a renewed focus on red cell storage lesions and their contributions to perioperative outcomes. Several meta-analyses, and now a recently launched, multinational randomized controlled trial, have been initiated to help bring clarity to whether or not the length of product storage has any effect on patient outcomes. This review will focus on the nature of storage lesions, complications associated with storage, as well as a brief review of some of the more provocative literature surrounding this controversial topic.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The complications resulting from red cell therapy have been well described over the past decade and range from the catastrophic such as hemolytic transfusion reactions to those less frequent complications such as transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM), development of microchimerisms, transfusion-related circulatory overload (TACO), and increased risk of perioperative infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253212445488">1</xref></sup> Recognition of these complications has led to the development of interventions and protocols that aim to decrease red blood cell transfusion rates, thereby minimizing potential transfusion-related complications and associated negative patient outcomes. Recently, the recognition of the potential issues associated with red cell storage, the complications of storage (ie, storage lesions), and the length of storage has been debated within the literature. In the desire to answer the questions as to whether red cell storage contributes to poor perioperative outcomes, several meta-analyses have been performed that try to isolate the contribution of storage lesions patient outcomes. However, these studies have yet to give the definitive answer because of the confounding issues surrounding red cell administration such as timing, dose, and indications. To help answer these lingering questions, new ongoing randomized controlled trials have been initiated to give clarity to this clinical conundrum. This article will review some of the aforementioned articles and studies to help the reader gain a better understanding of the issues surrounding red cell storage lesions and their potential contribution to perioperative outcomes.</p>

<title>History/Purpose of Storage</title>
<p>The purpose of red cell storage is to preserve function of the red cell so that on transfusion the cell will survive in circulation beyond 24 hours. The first storage material was a glucose citrate solution that was used by Rous and Turner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253212445488">2</xref></sup> in 1915. Ultimately, this discovery led to the development of acid–citrate–dextrose (ACD), which allowed red cell storage for 3 weeks with a 70% recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212445488">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another major change in red cell storage was the migration from bottle-stored (ACD) to bag-stored products that contained citrate–phosphate–dextrose (CPD) or CPD with adenine (CPDA). The introduction of plasticized collection bags allowed for the subsequent fractionation of blood products and better utilization of these cellular therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212445488">3</xref></sup> The bags also allowed for prolonged storage with CPD, typically providing viable cells for up to 21 days and CPDA for up to 42 days.</p>
<p>It has been recognized that red cells require adenine and phosphate but also undergo hemolysis during prolonged storage. As such, mannitol (which also has mild antioxidant features) was introduced as a stabilizing medium, and it is one of the multiple red cell additives used today. In Europe, collection bags containing mannitol are denoted as SAGM (saline, adenine, glucose, mannitol), but in the United States, these additives are denoted as AS (additive solution) with a variety of numbers, such as AS-1 or AS-5. There is one AS product that does not contain mannitol, AS-3, but does contain extra citrate and phosphate.</p>

<title>Red Cell Storage Lesions</title>
<p>There are a multitude of red cell storage lesions that have been described in detail (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1089253212445488">Table 1</xref>). Briefly, these include metabolic changes to the red cell and storage medium, rheological changes, loss of membrane carbohydrates, oxidative damage to both red cell membrane lipids and proteins, changes in oxygen delivery and affinity, changes with regard to endothelial interactions, microvesicle formation, bacterial contamination, and hyperkalemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253212445488">4</xref></sup></p>

<p>Many of the metabolic changes arise from the fact that the red cell requires glycolysis for survival. Within glycolysis, intracellular glucose is converted to adenine triphosphate (ATP) for energy. A by-product of this action is the creation of lactic acid, and over time, as the red cell in storage becomes more acidotic, the glycolysis process is slowed. The utilization of hypothermia also helps reduce glycolysis and preserves the overall nutrient supply. In addition, hypothermia has the added benefit of inhibiting the energy-dependent sodium pump found on the cellular membrane; however, this inhibition leads to a persistent potassium leak in which up to 1 mEq/d of intracellular potassium is introduced into the extracellular milieu.</p>
<p>It is critical to maintain a high ATP level in order to ensure red cell survival, and a loss of ATP through storage may lead to the loss of phospholipid pumping with the resulting exposure of the phosphotidyl serine, a phagocytosis signal and a membrane loss through calpain-driven microvesicle formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253212445488">5</xref></sup> Of note, the exposure of the red cell membrane phosphatidyl serine may lead to thrombin generation and subsequently adversely affect oxygen delivery and transport.</p>
<p>The physical changes to the red cell shape are frequently purported to potentially cause complications related to storage. In storage, it is known that the spherical shape of the red cell moves to that of a spheroechinocyte. The spherocechinocyte is, however, not irreversible and can be ameliorated by warming the red cell at a neutral pH, provided red cell nutrients are also supplied. This process is called rejuvenation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212445488">3</xref></sup> This process over time becomes irreversible when the cell loses membrane components via the spiny structures of the spheroechniocyte (microvesicles). The creation of microvesicles in the red cell membrane is a natural maturation event and can be stabilized by higher than normal ATP levels.</p>
<p>The overall pH of the storage solution, as well as other storage media changes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1089253212445488">Table 2</xref>), plays a role in the generation of red cell storage lesions. The average pH of the solution is around 5.5 to 5.8 depending on the mixture. When red cells are added to the solution, the pH is raised to around 7.1 that favors the breakdown of 2,3-DPG (diphosphoglycerate) and enhanced ATP production. The lower than physiologic pH will also tend to inhibit enzyme systems and ultimately allow for higher levels of glucose-6-phosphate and glutathione (which also has antioxidant features).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212445488">3</xref></sup></p>

<p>The changes in red cell shape would naturally seem to affect blood flow and oxygen delivery to the capillary beds. In fact, rheological changes leading to increases in viscosity and decreases in capillary flow have been reported, but the overall clinical effect is unclear at best.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253212445488">6</xref></sup> One of the confounding issues is that the changes, as mentioned earlier, can be reversed with good storage systems and rejuvenation and that red cells appear to be able to compensate for storage when brought back to a normal pH and allowed to increase their ATP concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212445488">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>What may be more detrimental to red cell shape and survival is the presence of white blood cells in the storage medium. It is known that white blood cells, by the release of cytokines, proteases, and lipases, can attach the red cell surface and lead to faster exocytic microvesicle or microparticle formation. Prestorage leukocyte reduction may help avoid this complication and may explain some of the perceived benefits from leukocyte reduction.</p>
<p>Storage is also associated with oxidative damage that contributes to the overall red cell injury and to poor oxygen delivery to tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253212445488">Figure 1</xref>). When oxygen is bound to hemoglobin, occasional formation of oxygen radicals and ferric methemoglobin are formed. The superoxide radicals and water undergo Fenton transformation into hydroxyl radicals with resultant damage to lipid and protein components of the red cell membrane. In addition, there are chain-breaking oxidative damage to band III that results in the creation of neo-antigens and loss of CD47 that subsequently leads to red cell clearance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212445488">3</xref></sup> The aging cells may also directly activate vascular oxidases and uncouple endothelial nitric oxide synthase to generate subsequently reactive oxygen species (ROS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253212445488">7</xref></sup> There is also some concern that during massive transfusion, this oxidative load may be quite large and may play a role in the development of transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI).</p>

<p>Finally there has been a concern of the effect of storage of red cells on <italic>S</italic>-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-hemoglobin). It has been observed that nitric oxide is transported to microvascular sites as an <italic>S</italic>-nitrosolthiolon the 93-Cys residue of hemoglobin.

<title>Clinical Studies Regarding Storage and Outcome</title>
<p>There have been numerous studies published regarding the utilization of red cell transfusion and the possible relationship of storage and outcome. Many of the studies have been involving “high-risk” patients who received multiple red blood cell transfusions during surgery or trauma.</p>
<p>One of the earliest studies was performed in 1993 by Marik and Sibbald<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253212445488">10</xref></sup> and focused on the effect of red blood transfusion and changes in gastric mucosal pH (pHi). The measurement of pHi has been suggestive of end-organ perfusion, and during this study, the group noted that there was an inverse correlation between the age of transfused red cells and the maximal change in pHi. A provocative speculation was that older, less deformable red cells might lead to decreased delivery because of sludging and ultimately mucosal ischemia. However, this study was refuted by 2 subsequent studies, one from Fernandes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253212445488">11</xref></sup> and another by Walsh et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253212445488">12</xref></sup> who could not reproduce the results.</p>
<p>Another prospective study by Sakr et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253212445488">13</xref></sup> used spectral imaging to detect changes in sublingual circulation 1 hour after transfusion of 1 to 2 units of leukocyte-reduced red blood cells. It was noted that there was no correlation between storage time and changes in capillary perfusion. And in 2008, the research team led by Leal-Noval<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253212445488">14</xref></sup> found that the transfusion of red cells stored for less than 19 days increased cerebral tissue oxygenation for up to 6 hours, whereas older cells failed to result in the observed increase.</p>
<p>While these studies raised questions regarding microvascular perfusion and oxygen delivery, several other earlier studies noticed a relationship of red cell storage and massive transfusion. Murrell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253212445488">15</xref></sup> noted in their review that massive transfusion of longer stored red blood cells was associated with excessive mortality. However, this result has again been questioned since it is well known that excessive transfusion, by itself, is a determinant of overall morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p>The conversation regarding stored blood was heightened by a widely quoted study by Koch et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253212445488">16</xref></sup> published in the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> in 2008. In this study, Koch et al reviewed the cardiac surgery registry of a single center, the Cleveland Clinic, and identified subgroups of patients who received red blood cells stored for 14 days or less and those who received blood stored for more than 14 days. The group reported that the subgroup that received the older storage product displayed 1.1% excess in-hospital mortality with an overall 34 excess deaths.</p>
<p>However, the study has fallen under significant scrutiny. Hess,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212445488">3</xref></sup> in a recent review, noted that the groups were not balanced since the patients who received the older products received more units in total. When the study was corrected for the greater number of patients receiving more units, the results are no longer statistically significant, and this group had also previously shown that patients who received more blood products had worse outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1089253212445488">17</xref></sup> Additional limitations were noted that the clinical characteristics of the patients and the ABO type of red blood cells received were not similar.</p>
<p>An even more recent study published by the group headed by Sanders et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253212445488">18</xref></sup> examined red blood cell storage and length of stay and renal complications after cardiac surgery. This was a prospective observational cohort study in which old blood was defined as red cells stored for more than 14 days. The secondary outcome measures for the study included renal failure. The study was performed at a single site, was restricted to adult cardiac surgical cases, and involved the use of cell salvage. It was determined that in patients who received only 1 unit of red blood cells, the postoperative length of stay was longer in “old blood group” versus the “new blood group” (8 vs 6 days), a 3.8-fold increased risk. An increased incidence of renal dysfunction 65.7% versus 43.9%, <italic>P</italic> = .008, was also reported. The criticism of the study was that the study was underpowered to detect associations of blood age with mortality or with the composite morbidity end points, and no uniform blood transfusion protocol was used.</p>
<p>Since there have been numerous studies regarding red cell storage, a desire to enhance the power and control variations has led to meta-analysis evaluation on the subject matter. Zimrin and Hess<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1089253212445488">19</xref></sup> in a review of 24 studies determined that, as a general rule, there was no clinical effect that could be attributable to longer storage of blood. Triulzi and Yazer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1089253212445488">20</xref></sup> who examined more than 25 studies further supported the result of the aforementioned analysis in an exhaustive review. Their review found the following observations:</p>

<list-item><p>Red cell transfusion volumes are an independent marker for worse outcomes</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Different definitions of storage duration are used</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The utilization of leukocyte-reduced blood products was not uniform</p></list-item></list>
<p>Vamvakas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253212445488">21</xref></sup> performed a subsequent meta-analysis that reviewed 24 observational studies and 3 randomized controlled trials. Homogeneous studies were integrated by “fixed-effects methods” (for those who were medically and statistically homogeneous), whereas others were integrated by “random-effects methods.” The study results stated that in 2, very small, randomized controlled trials, there was a reduction in in-hospital mortality in patients transfused with older red blood cells (summary odds ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval = 0.14-0.99; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), but the populations were medically heterogeneous (included intensive care unit, cardiac surgery, and trauma patients) and did not reach significance in the intention-to-treat analysis. The integration of other observational studies investigated, because of uncontrolled numbers of transfusions, produced summary results either negative or impossible to evaluate. Overall, the consensus was that there was no evidence that adverse outcomes were associated with the age of red cells. It was noted by Vamvakas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253212445488">21</xref></sup> that in review of the observational studies, patients who had adverse outcomes also received more transfusions, and those transfusions were composed of older storage products. As such, it has been impossible to “de-link” the number of transfused of red cells, the duration of storage, and the number of adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253212445488">21</xref></sup></p>

<title>RECESS and ABLE Studies</title>
<p>To obtain a definitive answer to the question of the effect of red cell storage lesions, 2 large trials are currently underway. The Red Cell Storage Duration Study (RECESS) is currently a US-sponsored trial whereas the Age of Blood Evaluation (ABLE) is sponsored by the United Kingdom and Canada. The trials are complementary and designed to answer some key questions concerning blood storage and complications in different patient populations. Both studies acknowledge that to date there is no consistent standard regarding “young” or “old” units and the fact that storage injuries are a continuum with depletion of nitric oxide within hours, depletion of 2,3-DPG occurring over days, and membrane injuries occurring over days to weeks.</p>
<p>The RECESS trial is a phase III interventional, randomized, open label (multicenter, partially blinded, randomized clinical trial) with 20 to 25 centers participating. The study uses red cells that are prestorage leukoreduced in AS-1, AS-3, or AS-5 additive solutions. The use of leukoreduction is to eliminate any contribution to outcome by the cytokines found in white cell destruction that occurs during prolonged storage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1089253212445488">22</xref></sup> Inclusion criteria include some of the following: age ≥ 12 years old, ≥40 kg body weight, complex cardiac surgery with the use of median sternotomy, and patients &gt;18 must have a Transfusion Risk Understanding Scoring Tool (TRUST) ≥3. TRUST is a tool created to predict the probability of transfusion and contains the components of age, gender, hemoglobin level, body weight, creatinine level, elective surgery, prior cardiac surgery, and surgical tasks. A number greater than or equal to 3 indicates a 60% to 79% probability of red blood cell transfusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1089253212445488">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The RECESS study also has numerous exclusion criteria with the most significant being utilization of left ventricular assist devices, hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), use of alternatives to heparin, autologous or directed donations, and prior red cell transfusion during hospitalization.</p>
<p>The primary outcome for the study is the measurement of change in the multiple organ dysfunction score (MODS). MODS has been used to identify clinically significant complications and is composed of elements that include respiratory component (Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>/Fi<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>), renal component (creatinine in µmol/L), hepatic component (bilirubin µmol/L), cardiovascular component using the pressure-adjusted heart rate (PAR = HR × CVP/MAP, where HR is the heart rate, CVP is central venous pressure, and MAP is mean arterial pressure), hematologic component (platelet count/mL × 10<sup>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212445488">3</xref></sup>), and neurologic component using the Glasgow Coma Score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1089253212445488">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The complementary study, ABLE (ISRCTN44878718)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253212445488">25</xref></sup> is another double-blind, parallel randomized, multicenter controlled trial that compares the outcomes associated with the transfusion of fresh blood to that of control in critically ill, intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The fresh arm is defined as prestorage leukoreduced red blood cells that are stored for 7 days or less. The inclusion criteria for this study (with an aim of enrolling 2510 patients), which differs from the RECESS study, will include adult ICU patients who receive blood within 7 days of admission to the ICU and expected to require invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation for greater than 48 hours. The primary outcome for this study is 90-day all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes include organ failure, hospital-acquired infections, and mortality. Currently, active enrollment in the study is underway in the countries of France, Canada, and the United Kingdom with an expected completion in early 2013.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Experts have speculated on the potential value of tranfusing fresh blood. However, without supportive data from well-designed clinical trials, the adoption of a new practice change to transfusing shorter date stored blood products is currently not warranted and has significant and far-reaching implications on current blood bank operations. Results from the large prospective multinational trials underway should provide more definitive recommendations.</p>
