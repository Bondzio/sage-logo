<title>Background</title>
<p>The completeness of self-reported serious adverse events (SAEs) in clinical trials can be reduced by inaccuracies in subject reporting and lost to follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1740774512467237">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>This study assesses the usefulness of a health data linkage system in obtaining SAE data in a randomised controlled study of oral and implant naltrexone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1740774512467237">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>SAEs were collected from 68 heroin-dependent subjects during a randomised controlled trial of oral and implant naltrexone with follow-up to 26 weeks. Patient self-report data were cross-matched against hospital and emergency department (ED) attendances for the same period using a health data linkage system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1740774512467237">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 29 hospital admissions and 74 ED attendances were identified using health data linkage. Of these, 12 (41.4%) hospital admissions and 50 (67.7%) of ED attendances had not been reported as SAE in the randomised controlled trial. In subjects participating in the trial at the time of the event, there was a 1.25-fold increase in the number of hospital admissions and a 2.25-fold increase in the number of ED attendances recorded using data linkage. Overall (including withdrawn subjects or those lost to follow-up), there was a 1.71-fold increase in hospital admission and a 3.09-fold increase in ED attendance recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1740774512467237">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The use of data linkage should not be used as a replacement for thorough follow-up, as the datasets can take substantial periods to update, making them a poor substitute for real-time follow-up. Additionally, some SAEs such as life-threatening events that do not involve ED or hospital attendance may be overlooked as would SAEs that occurred outside the dataset’s range, for example, interstate or overseas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1740774512467237">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Health data linkage can be used to effectively reduce the extent of missing health data in a clinical trial.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The accuracy and completeness in the reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs) are of particular importance in the investigation of new clinical approaches or pharmaceutical treatments. Clinical studies often rely on self-reported SAE, which may be affected by a subject’s recall ability, clinical knowledge, or by social desirability bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512467237">1</xref>]. Additionally, missing data associated with lost to study follow-up have been a long standing issue in clinical research, with the loss of such data potentially resulting in bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512467237">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512467237">3</xref>]. Failure to detect certain SAEs can result in the safety of the investigated treatment inaccurately profiled, which can be detrimental or even life-threatening to the health of the patients to which this research is applied.</p>
<p>Health data linkage systems such as the Western Australian State Data Collection can be used in clinical research to assist in the collection of SAE data. Health data linkage systems bring together records derived from different sources (i.e., hospital admission, emergency department (ED) attendances, death registries, cancer registries, and midwife records) related to the same individual. This allows researchers to easily obtain large amounts of health data on cohorts of patients within a set region.</p>
<p>Patients with substance use disorders are notoriously difficult subjects to include in clinical trials. In such patient groups, there tend to be high levels of mental health co-morbidity and other health issues (i.e., hepatitis C), criminality, and lifestyle instability (unemployment, poor family relationships, and homelessness), which can make follow-up of such subjects difficult.</p>
<p>While the use of opiates is surpassed by other drugs such as cannabis and amphetamines in terms of use, this category of drugs makes up nearly 60% of treatment demand in Europe and Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512467237">4</xref>]. Traditionally, opiate dependence has been treated with long acting opiates such as methadone; however, concerns exist that such treatments prolong dependence rather than assisting patients in achieving abstinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512467237">5</xref>]; thus, research into the development of alternative treatments has been of interest. An alternative has been the use of opiate antagonists such as naltrexone. While the success of naltrexone has struggled in its original oral formulation, long acting preparations have been developed to overcome the need for daily dosing associated with the oral formula, mitigating problems with poor patient compliance and decreased clinical efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774512467237">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512467237">7</xref>]. A recent study has shown that a subcutaneous naltrexone implant significantly reduces the incidence of return to regular heroin use at 6 months as compared to the oral formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512467237">8</xref>].</p>
<p>This study will examine the usefulness of a state-wide (Western Australia) health data linkage system in augmentation with SAE data for subjects in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of oral and implant naltrexone for the treatment of heroin dependence.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-1740774512467237">
<title>Participants and study design</title>
<p>The study utilised subjects from a double-blind, double-dummy RCT of oral versus implant naltrexone for the treatment of heroin dependence. In the original RCT, 35 heroin-dependent (<italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>) persons received active naltrexone implant treatment with placebo tablets – the ‘implant’ group. Another 35 heroin-dependent persons received active naltrexone tablet treatment with placebo implant – the ‘oral’ group. Participants and treating clinicians were blinded to the randomised treatment. Further details about the treatment, masking, and blinding can be found in previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512467237">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774512467237">9</xref>]. In the current study, one oral naltrexone participant was excluded from the study due to their withdrawal of consent on day 15 of the study, and a second oral patient was excluded following her disclosure of her amphetamine (not opioid) dependence. Therefore, the study included 68 participants, with 35 (22 males) in the implant naltrexone group and 33 (21 males) in the oral naltrexone group.</p>
<p>While the current study utilised subjects from a previous RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512467237">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774512467237">9</xref>]), it was conducted under its own protocol and ethics approval. Thus, the objectives examined in the current study are different from those published earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512467237">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774512467237">9</xref>].</p>

<title>Definitions and classifications</title>
<p>SAEs were classified as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalisation or resulted in prolongation of existing hospitalisation, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., in a child born to a study participant), or was a medically important event or reaction. Adverse events (AEs) were classified as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Both definitions were taken from the <italic>Australian Clinical Trial Handbook</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774512467237">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Hospital and ED attendances were considered in total and with specific investigation of (1) opiate poisoning/overdose (<italic>International Classification of Diseases</italic> (10th rev.; <italic>ICD-10</italic>) code: T40.0–T40.4), (2) non-opiate drug poisoning/overdose (T40.5–T40.9, T42.3, T42.4, T42.6–T42.7, T43.6, T43.9, T51.0–51.3, T51.8–51.9, T52.0–52.4, T52.8–52.9, and 53.0–53.9), (3) opiate-related mental health events (F11.0–F11.9), (4) non-opiate drug mental health events (F10.0–F10.9 and F12–F19.9), and (5) mental health events (non-drug related) (F0–F9.9 and F20–F99).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1740774512467237">
<title>Self-report data collection</title>
<p>AE data were scheduled for collection as part of regular research and clinical follow-up at days 1, 5, 8, 15, and 28, and then every 14 days to 26 weeks. Specifically, subjects were asked at each time point whether they had experienced any AEs; whether they had experienced any nausea, headaches, fatigue, loss of appetite, depression, sleep disturbances, stomach disorders, agitation, fitting, visual disorders, general aches, or weight gain; and whether they had experienced any other ill effects that might be related to the naltrexone implant. Additionally, a clinical evaluation of the implant site was performed, scoring 0–4 for redness, swelling, and tenderness. AE and SAE forms were completed by trained research staff for each event. The forms were then signed and approved by a research medical officer.</p>
<p>All such events were reported to the independent monitoring committee (IMC) for evaluation and classification based on the relevant International Conference on Harmonisation policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774512467237">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512467237">12</xref>]. The IMC members were all medically qualified and comprised a Professor of Psychiatry, Professor of Public Health, and two Addiction Specialists (Fellows of the Australasian College of Addiction Medicine) with extensive experience in the treatment and assessment of substance use disorders.</p>

<title>Hospital and emergency department morbidity database</title>
<p>The Western Australian State Data Collection utilised in this study brings together records derived from different sources, but related to the same individual. Linkages are identified using probabilistic matching based on the patient’s unique medical record number, full name, birth date, sex, and address as the principal matching fields. The average proportion of invalid links (false positives) and missed links (false negatives) were both estimated at 0.11% by a validation study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774512467237">13</xref>]. The database has been validated and used in numerous health studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512467237">14</xref>]. The geographical isolation of Western Australia and associated low level of population turnover make it ideal for long-term follow-up using record linkage method. For example, using record linkage data available from the Western Australian State Data Collection, our recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774512467237">15</xref>] managed to track 333 (92.2%) of 361 patients who were treated with a naltrexone implant first time between 2001 and 2002. That the remaining 7.8% of the patients were not tracked by the record linkage system may simply be because these patients did not incur any hospital morbidity or mortality during our study period, although it is possible that some of them had moved out of Western Australia and died interstate or overseas.</p>
<p>At the time of recruitment to the initial RCT, participants provided written consent for their records to be linked to other governmental databases for research purposes. On completion of the RCT, the study population’s health data were ascertained for the period of the RCT using the Western Australia State Data Collection. The componential datasets utilised in this study included the Hospital Morbidity Data Collection, encompassing all public and private hospital admissions in Western Australia since 1970, and the ED Data Collection, a record of ED activity in Western Australia’s public hospitals and private hospitals under contract with the Western Australia Government since 2002.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1740774512467237">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>To determine the accuracy of self-reported SAEs, data collected from the Hospital Mortality Data Collection and ED Data Collection were manually matched against the SAEs collected during the RCT. For the data to be matched, the records had to be within 2 days of each other (to allow for minor discrepancies in patient recall) and have corresponding diagnoses (<italic>ICD-10</italic> codes for hospital and ED data and written diagnosis for SAE reports). For study purposes, hospital and ED events with a corresponding self-reported SAEs were classified as ‘reported’ and while those without were classified as ‘unreported’. Levels of accuracy were recorded for participants who were still participating in the trial at the time of the SAE (i.e. they had attended subsequent follow-up appointments).</p>
<p>Each participant was allocated an ‘end date’ based on their last data collection point (i.e. the last time they presented for follow-up). AE data collected on or prior to this date were classified as occurring during follow-up, while SAEs that occurred after this time point were classified as occurring following lost to follow-up. The number of reported and unreported SAEs was tabulated for participants during follow-up and lost to follow-up. Additionally, the number of SAEs per participant year was calculated for participants during follow-up and following lost to follow-up. Subjects who were not compliant with the study (oral) medication but presented for follow-up were still considered to be ‘on study’.</p>
<p>The time each patient spent in the study was plotted using a Kaplan–Meier survival curve and compared using a Log Rank test of equality. The number of hospital and ED events was also compared for the two groups using Poisson regression. The numbers of subjects who were admitted to hospital or attended ED were compared between the two groups using Fisher’s exact test. Additionally, the accuracy of reporting was calculated for the two groups. All analyses were conducted using a critical p value of 0.05.</p>
<p>The average number of hospital and ED events per study participant were calculated for the oral and implant groups. The ratio of the two groups was calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The CI was calculated using standard deviation of the log rate ratio (RR).</p>

<sec id="section14-1740774512467237">
<title>Ethics approval</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of the University of Western Australia (RA/4/1/1925) and the Department of Health, Western Australia (2011/8).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of baseline demographic (sex, age, age of first use, duration of regular heroin use, body mass index (BMI), and median <italic>DSM-IV</italic>); these results were summarised by Hulse <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512467237">8</xref>].</p>
<p>During the 26-week study period, 29 hospital admissions (21 participants: 11 oral and 10 implant naltrexone) and 74 ED attendances (42 participants: 22 oral and 20 implant naltrexone) were identified from the state hospital data linkage system. Listings of each hospital and ED attendance are included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774512467237">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774512467237">2</xref>. The median period of follow-up was 164 days (interquartile range: 55.5–171.5 days). There was no significant difference in the length of follow-up for participants randomised to treatment with oral (median = 131; interquartile range = 61–170 days) versus implant (median 168; interquartile range = 50–173 days) naltrexone (p = 0.49) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774512467237">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Completeness of self-reported SAEs relative to data linkages</title>
<p>The use of the linked data resulted in a 1.25-fold and 2.25-fold increase in the number of identified hospital and ED attendances in subjects who were participating in the study at the time of the event. Of the 20 hospital admissions and 54 ED attendances that were identified using the linked health data in subjects participating in the study at the time of the event, rates of self-reporting were 80.0% and 44.4%.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of opiate overdose/poisoning was associated with two hospital and three ED attendances in subjects participating in the study at the time of the event. Additionally, two hospital and three ED attendances were associated with non-opiate drug poisoning/overdose in the study. All opiate and non-opiate drug overdose/poisoning were self-reported.</p>
<p>Mental health diagnoses were highly prevalent in the health dataset, occurring in 17 hospital admission and 12 ED attendances in subjects who had not withdrawn from the study or had become lost to follow-up. In these subjects, rates of self-reported mental health events were 84.6% for opiates, 71.4% for non-opiate drug, and 83.3% for non-drug mental health. For ED attendances, the rates of self-reported mental health events were 100% for opiates, 60% for non-opiate drug, and 100% for non-drug mental health.</p>

<sec id="section17-1740774512467237">
<title>Completeness of AE dataset</title>
<p>For all subjects (including those who had withdrawn or been lost to follow-up), the use of the linked data resulted in a 1.71-fold increase in identification of hospital admissions and a 3.09-fold increase in the identification of ED attendances. Of the 29 hospital admission identified, 12 had not been previously self-reported (41.4%), of which 8 occurred in patients who had withdrawn from the study or lost to follow-up (27.6%). Similarly, of the 74 ED attendances, 50 had not been previously reported by subjects (67.6%), of which 47 occurred in subjects who were no longer participating in the study (63.5%).</p>
<p>All hospital and ED attendances with a diagnosis of opiate or non-opiate drug overdose/poisoning were self-reported and occurred in subjects who were participating in the study at the time of the event. Twenty-three of the 29 hospital attendances and 16 of the 74 ED attendances were associated with a mental health diagnosis (hospital attendance may have multiple mental health diagnoses). The original set of AE contained 65.2% of the hospital admissions and 56.2% of the ED attendances with a mental health diagnosis that was identified by data linkage. Similar rates of reporting were observed for opiate, non-opiate drug, and non-drug mental health diagnoses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1740774512467237">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The use of linked health data was shown to be a valuable tool in the augmentation of SAE data, significantly increasing the amount of available AE data. This method was shown to be especially valuable in subjects who had withdrawn from the study or become lost to follow-up, providing researchers with means for examining health outcomes that may otherwise be missed.</p>
<sec id="section20-1740774512467237">
<title>Accuracy of self-reported adverse events</title>
<p>Study results indicated that self-reported SAE resulting in hospital admission had a high level of accuracy (80%). In contrast, reporting of ED attendances was substantially lower (44.4%). The high levels of accuracy in the reporting of hospital admissions were consistent with the findings of studies investigating the accuracy of self-reported drug use, criminal activity, and risky behaviour in similar patient cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774512467237">16</xref>]. The lower levels of accuracy in the reporting of ED attendances may be associated with the nature of these attendances and the perceived importance of these events compared with hospital admissions relatively to hospital admissions. Additionally, while almost all ED attendances would be associated with AE, not all ED attendances would be considered as SAE. In contrasts, an AE that required hospital admission by definition would be a SAE.</p>
<p>Although assessed using a relatively small number of opiate and non-opiate drug events (n = 8), all events were reported in the RCT, indicating that the subjects did not exhibit any bias in the reporting of events that indicated failure of the treatment. Mental health-related events showed a much larger fluctuation in the accuracy of reporting, possibly attributable to patient perceived importance of the events to the study. For example, it may be possible that opiate and other drug events may have been considered as more relevant as compared to ED attendances for mental health issues. Additionally, mental health events may have been under-reported due to the patient’s perceived stigma associated with mental health problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1740774512467237">
<title>Completeness of self-reported SAE relative to data linkages</title>
<p>The use of the linked hospital data in the follow-up and monitoring of SAE was shown to be an effective method of patient following-up, especially in subjects for whom following follow-up data were not available. In this study, an additional 12 hospital admissions (41.4% of the total hospital admissions) and 50 ED attendances (67.6% of the total ED events) were identified using the data linkage system. Although rates of hospital and ED attendances in subjects actively involved in the study were not dissimilar to those who had withdrawn or become lost to follow-up, a number of previous studies have found significantly worse outcomes in subjects who become lost to follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774512467237">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774512467237">18</xref>]. The extrapolation of such data should thus be avoided as it may result in significant bias and misinterpretation of data.</p>
<p>A major problem with conventional follow-up methods (e.g. face-to-face, by phone, and mail) in longitudinal studies is high subject attrition rate, mainly due to subject’s non-contactability, resulting in significant potential study bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512467237">2</xref>]. This is especially true for opioid-dependent populations, who are particularly mobile and difficult to contact. For example, previous studies have reported a 70% follow-up rate at 3 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512467237">3</xref>] and 52% at 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774512467237">19</xref>]. The use of health data linkage has the potential to increase the efficiency with which clinical drug trials collect serious morbidity data. It also has the potential to dramatically increase the period of follow-up with only minimal increases in cost.</p>
<p>Health data, although commonly collected prospectively, are only available from a central database with a considerable time delay. Given the need to monitor and protect patient safety, health-linked data should not replace rigorous face-to-face patient follow-up, but should only be used to augment collected self-report and other data. The Western Australian State Data Collection does however allow the capture of all SAEs that are life-threatening, requiring inpatient hospitalisation or ED attendance, or resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (Hospital Morbidity Data Set) that occur within Western Australia. Although not utilised in this study, the data linkage also has the ability to identify congenital anomalies/birth defects (via the Births Defects Registry), other medically important events of reactions (cancer registry), and those events resulting in death (through linkage with the Death Registry). The only SAEs that may be overlooked within WA are those life-threatening events that do not involve ED or hospital attendance.</p>
<p>The failure to observe certain SAEs or increases in the frequency of SAEs can be detrimental to the health of patients to which this research is applied, especially in the case of pharmaceutical regulatory trials. The failure to identify such risks in pre-registration clinical trials can place patients at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality post registration.</p>
<p>In an attempt to reduce the rate of lost to follow-up, researchers often select highly motivated and stable participants for regulatory trials and other research. In doing so, the research sample can be a poor representation of the general cohort to which the drug is to be marketed. In reducing problems with lost to follow-up, data linkage could reduce the need for strict selection of clinical trial participants in large-scale safety studies, ensuring the applicability of the results to the drug’s target population.</p>
<p>If the use of data linkage is incorporated into the initial consent for the study, it can enable the collection of data on participants who are lost to follow-up. Additionally, data linkage allows participants’ reporting to be substantiated by medical records, reducing recall bias and patient inaccuracies.</p>
<p>While the use of a data linkage system such as Western Australia State Data Collection may be beneficial, there is still potential for SAE to be missed using such dataset if the SAE occurs outside of the scope of the dataset. In this study, a state-wide health dataset was utilised; thus, SAEs that occurred interstate or overseas would not have been identified. Similarly, the use of such datasets may be unrealistic for studies involving multiple sites, outside a single region, for example, a multination drug trial, where data availability, methods of collection, and completeness/accuracy may vary significantly between regions. Additionally, the use of such data systems may not be as useful in areas where an individual regularly moves in and out of the data collection region. In Australia, infrastructure has recently been created to allow for a national network of data linkage (see the Public Health Research Network, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phrn.org.au">www.phrn.org.au</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The use of health data linkage also has the potential uses within clinical research that are not only restricted to SAE collection. In this study, one of the main objectives of the study was to measure the rate of opiate overdoses resulting in hospitalisation as a measure of efficacy of the treatment. In obtaining the hospital data, we could confirm that only two opiate overdoses requiring hospitalisation occurred during the study.</p>

<sec id="section22-1740774512467237">
<title>SAEs in oral versus implant naltrexone participants</title>
<p>The data showed no evidence to suggest a significant difference in the rate of hospital or ED attendance in participants treated with oral or implant naltrexone. However, the data highlight the potential for differences or lack of difference to be masked by missing data. Rates of both hospital attendances and ED attendances per subject year appear to be slightly higher for implant naltrexone patients prior to the inclusion of the linked health data (hospital RR: 0.74; ED RR: 0.90); however, following inclusion, the rates of both are higher for the oral naltrexone treatment group (hospital RR: 1.14; ED RR: 1.18). The difference between the two RRs for hospital and ED attendances may be attributable to a longer median period of follow-up in implant naltrexone patients (168 days compared with 131 days). While not significant, the difference in the median period of follow-up may be attributable to the efficacy of the two treatments, with far fewer subjects in the implant naltrexone treatment group returning to opiate use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512467237">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Additionally, there was no significant difference in the completeness of self-report in the two groups or the length of follow-up. However, it is likely that the sample size chosen for this RCT would only be sufficient for detecting large differences in this respect, as the sample size was selected based on anticipated efficacy outcomes.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1740774512467237">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The study does suffer from a number of limitations that may reduce generalisability of these data to other studies. Heroin-dependent patients often lead disorganised lifestyles, which can make follow-up of such patient groups resulting in high rates of lost to follow-up, which may not exist in other more highly motivated patient groups. Additionally, the study was also relatively small (69 patients) and was conducted at a single site.</p>
<p>The usefulness of health data linkage is also dependent on the quality of data obtained from the linked datasets. One issue with quality noted in this data collection was the absence of diagnosis in a number of ED attendances (28.4%). Additionally, comprehensive health data systems such as the Western Australia State Data Collection are limited in their ability to capture health events not requiring hospital or ED attendance, such as diarrhoea, insomnia, and muscle soreness that may be treated by a general physician or not be treated at all.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1740774512467237" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>While patient’s self-report is a reliable source of SAE data, the use of a comprehensive state-wide health data collection system has the ability to greatly improve the quality of data obtained by substantiating patient reports, identifying unreported data for all participants, and efficiently and cost-effectively increasing the length of follow-up. The use of such a system was of particular assistance in the collection of data on patients who had become lost to follow-up. If feasible, the use of health data linkage should be considered in the design of RCTs, especially those involving patient groups with a high level of lost to follow-up anticipated.</p>
