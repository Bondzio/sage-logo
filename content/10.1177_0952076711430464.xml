<p>With the death of Richard Chapman in April 2011, public administration has sadly lost one of its leading scholars and advocates, who played a seminal role in developing and promoting the subject in the last quarter of the twentieth century. His manifold talents, his energy and his splendid – sometimes almost obsessive – organisational regimens enabled him to excel in all areas of academic life, as well as play an active role in public life.</p>
<p>Yet early in life Chapman had been considered an academic failure, leaving school early to work in the clerical grade of the civil service. His experience in the RAF in National Service, where he observed the floundering efforts of public school–educated trainee officers to cope with the tests and exercises he was responsible for laying out, convinced him that his own intellectual capacity was not negligible and that he needed an education. After taking A-levels part time, he secured a place at Leicester University in 1961 to study politics, securing BA, MA and PhD degrees. There then followed academic posts at Liverpool and Birmingham, before he moved to Durham as a Reader in 1971, where he remained until his retirement in 1996, having been appointed to a Chair in 1986.</p>
<p>Chapman’s first piece of academic work for his Master’s degree had been on TH Green, from which he deduced the importance of a public service ethos in a liberal democracy, a theme which was to resound in his later academic writings and in his public life. Some research work in the 1960s for the Fulton Committee on recruitment turned his attention to the civil service, which was henceforth to become the focus of his academic writings. A stream of articles and studies followed. Early in-depth studies of the bank rate change in 1957 (the subject of his PhD) and the Vehicle and General affair revealed Chapman’s ability to use primary source materials, laid bare in public enquiries, to dig deep into the decision-making process and to draw lessons about the development and workings of British government. Chapman disliked academic jargon and was left cold by some of the more theoretical writings on public policy; instead in the late 1970s he realised what a treasure trove the national archives at Kew could be in illuminating the world of Whitehall. Chapman was particularly interested in the challenging task of administrative biography and his books <italic>Leadership in the British Civil Service</italic> (1984) and <italic>Ethics in the British Civil Service</italic> (1988) were masterly studies of how Percy Waterfield and Edward Bridges respectively faced challenges and contributed to the administrative tradition in Britain. In his active retirement Chapman devoted himself to the even more ambitious ‘bureau biography’: <italic>The Civil Service Commission 1855–1991</italic> (2004), a penetrating study based on reading hundreds of files. All these major works showed a capacity to draw, from rather narrow subject matters, important general reflections that were of concern not only to academics but also practitioners of government in Britain. Although Chapman had previously been critical of the mandarin elite’s introversion, he was totally out of sympathy with the impact of the ideas of the new public management school. He was convinced these were having a corrosive effect upon accountability and the fundamental values of public service. Consequently his last years were spent warning against these developments, whilst also working on issues of accountability and freedom of information.</p>
<p>In his concern for public service and his belief that the academic life ought to influence the wider world, Chapman led by example. He gave selfless service, not only to his own university, but to numerous public bodies such as the Advisory Council on Public Records, the City of Durham Standards Board and the local Samaritans or his own local village. Furthermore, he played a key role in fostering the development of the discipline of public administration. He was one of the early editors of the <italic>Public Administration Bulletin</italic> (the precursor of this journal) and gave long service on its editorial board. He was an active member and former Chairman of the Joint University Council for Public and Social Administration and was tireless in his efforts to promote and protect the interests of the discipline. He was constantly in demand as an external examiner, visiting lecturer and consultant, both in the UK and in Commonwealth countries.</p>
<p>Chapman was a brilliant teacher who would draw the best out of his pupils, instilling in them disciplines of rigorous thought and hard work. Any loose or inane generalisation on their part would be met by a courteous ‘that is an interesting point, but what do you mean…’ before a Socratic questioning of alarming precision would ensue. He was a valued mentor, support and inspiration to countless young academics over the years and was particularly supportive of international scholars. He was enormously generous in his time and regarded this mentoring as being of fundamental importance to the academic life. He particularly valued the many life-long friendships that developed. The uplifting memorial service in Brancepeth, Durham, in June, attended by large numbers of his friends, colleagues, former pupils and neighbours, showed how much his friendship meant to so many people and how he will be missed.</p>
