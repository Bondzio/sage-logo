<title>The Science and Art of Medicine</title>
<p>1928, the National Institute for Medical Research, Hampstead, London. Henry Dale, Edgar Schuster, two unsuspecting cats and an adjustable mechanism proposed to replace the heart. The ensuing experiment pioneered the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) we use today.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659113484682">1</xref></sup> There is no doubt that CPB technology has since advanced, but the engineering prowess on display in Dale and Schuster’s experiment surpasses our modern roller pumps. It boasted one drive source and two synchronous pumps, each pump working against widely different resistances. Their paper describes a rapid, independently adjustable pump capable of maintaining equality of output in the two different systems while preventing the accumulation of blood on either side. The pulmonary and systemic systems in this case were the hind end of unsuspecting cat #1 and the lungs of unsuspecting cat #2, respectively. Perhaps, with an overall prime volume of 100ml, this was, in fact, an early version of miniature CPB! What is indisputable is that this was research using engineering to mimic physiology. In comparison, much of our modern-day research focuses on reducing the deleterious effects on patients of our accepted non-physiology.</p>
<p>The Science Museum in London runs late night openings for the visiting public. Invited to speak on behalf of the British Heart Foundation about heart lung machines, I was a little overawed when the organisers informed me that the heart lung machine being shown was the Dale-Schuster pump kept on display in the ‘Science and Art of Medicine’ exhibition on the museum’s 5<sup>th</sup> Floor. Following my presentation, the first question from Joe Public was, “Why don’t cardiac teams use evolved ‘Dale and Schuster’ engineering? Why do you just use a basic, single pump?” I remember thinking at the time that this was an excellent question. This initial thought was closely followed by my regret at not considering this viewpoint in more detail before my presentation.</p>
<p>While we now recognise and accept our limitations in being able to artificially mimic the exquisite physiology of the human body, the goalposts have moved from the ‘Art of Medicine’ to the ‘Science of Medicine’. Dale and Schuster were attempting to simulate the intrinsically linked, but varied roles of the left and right heart. In hindsight, their pump was medical art and demonstrated very clever engineering brilliance. Modern-day research demands us to understand the science behind the artificial technique. This edition of <italic>Perfusion</italic> is an excellent example of the demands we now put on science-driven research. In this issue, Hayes, Skekar and Fraser take artificial oxygenation to the next level by asking, “How much is too much?” and urge us to fine tune our thinking on optimal oxygenation practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659113484682">2</xref></sup> Beckmann et al. quantitate modified ultrafiltration with respect to coagulation factor levels, platelet counts, platelet functions and cellular growth factor concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659113484682">3</xref></sup> On the other hand, Rigby’s group make a different examination of coagulation science, aggressively controlling the coagulation cascade to affect intrathoracic haemorrhage and prevent lung damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659113484682">4</xref></sup> These are the scientific answers our speciality and patients now require to take CPB technology forward.</p>
<p>Comparing research eras also highlights our increasing demand for more robust ‘outcome measures’. The Dale-Schuster pump was used experimentally in 1940 by Kohlstaedt and Page to look at kidney perfusion; their key outcome measure was increased liberation of renin, which they attributed to a reduction in kidney pulse pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659113484682">5</xref></sup> Newland and co-workers have merited publication in this edition by considering one variable, temperature, and their key outcome measure being the multifaceted RIFLE score to grade acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659113484682">6</xref></sup> Another good example of the ‘science of medicine’ furthering our clinical practice is the ‘art’ of meta-analysis. Interestingly, the Sun et al. meta-analysis of retrograde autologous priming identified a significant reduction in adult blood transfusion, but no effect on clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659113484682">7</xref></sup> What remains true is that quality perfusion must be founded on quality research, whether it is classified as ‘art’ or ‘science’. Many accepted myths exist within our profession and it is always refreshing to see these myths challenged by fact. Naso’s group does exactly this by demonstrating scientifically that, with currently available devices, a primed CPB circuit can be safely maintained sterile for up to 35 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659113484682">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This edition further reinforces that <italic>Perfusion</italic> publishes the work of researchers who have a strong focus on the ‘Science of Medicine’. We should, however, also keep a mindful eye on the ‘Art of Medicine’ that propelled our field to where it is today. Some commentators even may go as far as to suggest that the new ‘Art of Medicine’ is in fact ‘Science’.</p>
