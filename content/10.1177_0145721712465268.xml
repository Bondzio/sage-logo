<p>It is an election year, and we have been bombarded with the question “Are we better off now than we were 4 years ago?” The question revolves around national politics and has become a mantra throughout the campaign season. The answer to the question varies considerably depending on whom you talk with or ask. However, if you ask the question “Is <italic>The Diabetes Educator</italic> better off now compared to last year?” the answer is definitely yes! As we come to the end of 2012, <italic>TDE</italic> continues to be a strong member benefit with the help of our publishing partner, Sage Publications. We have had a number of significant successes this year, including an increased use of marketing strategies (social media) along with another increase in impact factor.</p>
<p>In 2012, Sage has somewhat changed how it markets and sells journals like <italic>TDE</italic>. Sage works with authors, readers, and subscribers of <italic>TDE</italic> online rather than through direct mail pieces. Almost all marketing efforts are done electronically through online advertising, targeted e-mail campaigns, newsletters, and social media. This is not to say that printed materials (eg, conference flyers) no longer serve an important purpose; rather, reliance on printed material is diminishing with time as it becomes increasingly ineffective. Use of blogs, Facebook, podcasts, Twitter, and other digital-type resources are becoming available and more popular. Social media continues to develop at a rapid pace. The latest social media developments—including user trends, new platforms, and how other journals use these technologies—are being monitored. Facebook is likewise becoming a major tool, with researchers also using Twitter to ask colleagues questions or share their latest research. Blogs are also becoming available to connect new readers and sometimes the general public. Sage continues to monitor how people arrive at <italic>TDE</italic> content. It has been noted that more and more references to <italic>TDE</italic> come from Wikipedia. As a result, <italic>TDE</italic> now has a homepage that contains bibliographical information plus links to <italic>TDE</italic>. In all instances, Sage is continually investing in ways to disseminate content and build on viable marketing channels for <italic>TDE</italic>. As an example of how Sage has been creative in meeting the needs of members, in this issue of <italic>TDE</italic>, the article “Development and Evaluation of the <italic>Decide to Move!</italic> Physical Activity Educational Video” has a link to the video described in the article.</p>
<p>Again this past year, <italic>TDE</italic> is ranked in the Endocrinology and Metabolism as well as Public, Environmental, and Occupational Health category of the Thomson Scientific Citation Reports (formerly, Institute for Scientific Information) with an impact factor of 1.959. This represents a 0.6–percentage point increase in impact factor over last year (1.947 in 2010; 1.873 in 2009). An impact factor is one measure of quality of content and number of citations associated with a particular journal.</p>
<p>We are pleased with the progress that AADE (<italic>TDE</italic>) and Sage have made in 2012, and we believe that we are better off now compared to where we were last year. We look forward to 2013 and encourage members to contact the Editorial Office with any comments, suggestions, or recommendations for improving <italic>TDE</italic>. Let us know if there are particular topics you would like to see covered in future issues. We appreciate your observations and suggestions. If I can answer any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me directly at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, College of Nursing, 285 Old Westport Road, North Dartmouth, MA 02747; phone: (508) 999-8586; e-mail: <email>jfain@umassd.edu</email>.</p>
