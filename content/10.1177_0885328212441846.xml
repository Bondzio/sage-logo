<abstract>
<p>Naturally available and biocompatible materials are potential substitutes for synthetic mesoporous materials as suitable drug carriers for the development of cost-effective drug delivery systems. This work investigates the application of a porous silica material derived from diatoms, also known as diatomaceous earth. The aim is to explore the surface functionalization of diatom microcapsules and their impact on the drug loading and release characteristics of water-insoluble drugs. Indomethacin was used as the model for poorly soluble drug. The surface modification on diatoms was performed with two organosilanes; 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane and N-(3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl) ethylene diamine and phosphonic acids (2-carboxyethyl-phosphonic acid and 16-phosphono-hexadecanoic acid) providing organic surface hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Extensive characterizations using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry was performed to confirm covalent grafting of monolayer aminosilane and phosphonic acid on the diatom surfaces. Differences in loading capacity of diatoms (15–24%) and release time (6–15 days) were observed which is due to the presence of different functional groups on the surface. It was found that 2-carboxyethyl-phosphonic acid, 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane and N-(3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl) ethylene diamine render diatom surfaces hydrophilic, due to polar carboxyl functional group (COOH) and active amine species (NH and NH<sub>2</sub>) that favor drug adsorption; better encapsulation efficiency and prolonged release of drugs, over the hydrophobic surface created by 16-phosphono-hexadecanoic acid. This work demonstrates diatom porous silica as a promising drug carrier, with possibility to further improve their performances by tailoring their surface functionalities to achieve the required drug loading and release characteristics for different therapeutic conditions.</p>

<p>Considerable research, in last two decades, has been directed towards the development of new and more efficient drug delivery systems to address problems associated with the conventional drug therapies, such as limited drug solubility, poor biodistribution, lack of selectivity and unfavorable pharmacokinetics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328212441846">1</xref></sup> Hydrophobic drugs do not dissolve in the blood and are unable to reach their target, which reduces their pharmacological efficacy. Also, bioactive agents such as genes, proteins, nucleic acids and enzymes, administered through oral or intravenous routes, can be degraded prematurely by metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328212441846">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328212441846">3</xref></sup> These challenges have contributed to the rapid development of new and controllable drug delivery systems prepared using advanced nanotechnology-based synthetic methods, towards achieving various therapeutic goals such as the delivery of therapeutic agents to the desired site, enhancing bioavailability and drug protection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328212441846">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212441846">4</xref></sup> Realizing goals for modern drug delivery systems requires the development of small independent reservoir structures or containers that can be produced inexpensively, loaded with drug easily and delivered locally in a controlled manner with optimal therapeutic concentration and for desired time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212441846">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Porous synthetic silica materials, due to their unique features, such as biocompatibility, controllable pore structure, tailored surface chemistry, high surface area, high drug loading capability, bioactivity for bone tissue engineering, chemical resistivity and mechanical rigidity have attracted great attentions for the development of new drug delivery systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328212441846">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328212441846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328212441846"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328212441846">8</xref></sup> However, despite the advanced synthesis of various silica mesoporous materials, including the most popular series such as MCM-41 and SBA-15, their synthetic process is time-consuming, expensive, involves high-energy consumption and the use of toxic materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328212441846">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328212441846">9</xref></sup> Hence, to address some of these disadvantages, there is a need to explore alternative silica porous materials for drug delivery applications, and nature is offering an excellent solution.</p>
<p>Nature has developed elegant biologically based self-assembly synthetic routes to produce silica biomaterials with complex three-dimensional (3-d) porous structures and diatoms, single cell photosynthetic algae are the most outstanding example.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328212441846">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328212441846">11</xref></sup> Diatoms have distinct 3-d architecture of silica cell walls (frustules) with highly-ordered pore structures, species characteristic patterns and hierarchical pore organization with unique mechanical, molecular transport, optical and photonic properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328212441846">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328212441846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328212441846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328212441846"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328212441846">16</xref></sup> In recent years, these properties of diatom silica have been explored by our group and others for a number of applications including photonics, filtration, water purification, immunoprecipitation, immunoisolation, microfluidics, microfabrication and nanofabrication, sensing and biosensing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328212441846">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328212441846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328212441846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328212441846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328212441846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328212441846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328212441846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328212441846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328212441846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328212441846"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328212441846">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>We recently recognized the potential of diatom silica biomaterials and demonstrated their capability for drug delivery applications for the first time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328212441846">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328212441846">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328212441846">27</xref></sup> The pill-box structures of diatom frustules with hollow and large inner space, microscale and nanoscale porosity, high surface area, excellent biocompatibility, amorphous silica, modifiable surface chemistry, high permeability, low density, non-toxicity, low cost and the ability to mimic the nature of constituents for natural bone and medical implant, make diatom silica a promising biomaterial for local drug delivery applications. Even though diatoms can be easily cultivated, a large and even less-expensive source of diatom silica is diatomite or diatomaceous earth (DE), which is formed by the fossilized siliceous frustules of diatoms, available in millions of tones as very cheap material from the mining industry. Our study showed that diatom microcapsules from DE can be used as effective drug-carriers for both poorly and water soluble drugs, for oral and implant applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328212441846">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328212441846">27</xref></sup> We also functionalized diatom structures by dopamine modified iron oxide nanoparticles to introduce diatoms with magnetic properties and demonstrated their ability to work as magnetically guided drug delivery microcarriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328212441846">28</xref></sup> This study showed strong indication that by surface modification of diatom silica structures, it is possible to control their drug loading and release characteristics and further improve their performance for drug delivery applications.</p>
<p>The aim of this work is to explore the surface functionalization of diatom microcapsules and their impact on the drug loading and release characteristics of water-insoluble drugs. In particular, our work is focused on investigating the impact of surface and chemical (hydrophobic and hydrophilic) properties of these modifications. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212441846">Figure 1</xref> shows typical diatom structure and the schematic diagram of proposed surface modifications which includes self-assembled organic monolayers (SAM), based on organosilanes and phosphonic acid with hydrophilic (3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane [APTES] and N-(3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl) ethylene diamine [AEAPTMS] and 2-carboxyethyl-phosphonic acid [2-phos]) and hydrophobic (16-phosphono-hexadecanoic acid [16-phos]) properties. Organosilanes APTES and AEAPTMS with amino functional groups were selected as they are popular surface modification agents and widely used for a number of applications in promoting steady adsorption between organic compounds (proteins, drugs) and silica substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328212441846">29</xref></sup> Phosphonic acids were recently used for surface modification of metal oxides, but has not been explored for functionalization of diatom silica.

<p>DE mineral was supplied by Mount Sylvia Diatomite Pty Ltd (Queensland, Australia). DE in the form of isolated and purified diatom microcapsules was prepared through several separation steps as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328212441846">31</xref></sup> Ind, a lipophilic drug with log P = 3.6 and pKa = 4.5, &gt;99.0% purity (thin layer chromatography [TLC]), 2-phos, 16-phos, APTES and AEAPTMS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Australia.

<sec id="sec4-0885328212441846"><title>Surface functionalization of DE</title>
<p>Surface modification of diatoms using selected organo silanes was prepared by a standard silanization process previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328212441846">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328212441846">33</xref></sup> Briefly, 0.1 g DE powder was mixed with 10 ml toluene containing 0.5 ml APTES or AEAPTMS in solution. The suspension was purged with pure nitrogen gas and tightly sealed. After an overnight incubation, it was sonicated to ensure an even dispersion of the mixture. The modified diatom microcapsules were collected by filtration after copious rinsing with toluene, followed by ethanol before being dried in a vacuum desiccator at ambient conditions. Similar steps were repeated for surface functionalization with AEAPTMS. For surface treatment with 2-phos and 16-phos, 1 mM ethanol solution of either phosphonic acids was added to the diatom microcapsules that were kept clean in hydrogen peroxide (5%). DE was sonicated in ethanol to remove possible multilayer formation before being transferred to an oven, where the sample was annealed at 140℃ for 24 h, in order to achieve a dense formation of monolayer on the silica surface. A base rinse in 5% triethylamine/ethanol via sonication was performed to remove any remaining physisorbed molecules, followed by copious rinsing with ethanol.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328212441846"><title>Drug loading</title>
<p>A total of 0.1 g DE was added to 2 ml ethanol before the suspension was sonicated for 2 h, followed by using excess ethanol for washing DE powder by filtration and evaporation. On the other hand, Ind was added to ethanol to yield a 5 mg/ml concentration. The mixture was sonicated to obtain an even dispersion, followed by repeated drop-wise loading into dispersed diatom microcapsules. After ethanol had evaporated, drug molecules peremeated through the pores into the hollow centre inside the microcapsules to form drug-loaded diatoms.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0885328212441846"><title>In vitro drug release</title>
<p>Spectroscopic measurements of Ind released from drug–diatom samples were monitored at the most prominent wavelength for Ind–DE in buffer, that is λmax = 310 nm, detected Ind drug release studies were carried out in phosphate buffer at pH 7.2, whereby 1 ml aliquot of centrifuged drug–DE suspension released to the bulk solution was withdrawn every 5–15 min in the first day and replaced with fresh buffer. The extracted aliquot was transferred to a 1.0 ml quartz cuvette of 10 mm path length, 4 mm width (Starna Scientific, Australia) for UV–Vis spectroscopy analysis (Cary 1E, Varian Inc.) to conduct absorbance/intensity measurement to calculate net drug concentration and thus the overall cumulative release. From the second day onwards, same steps were repeated twice per day until drug was completely released from DE.</p>

<p>Structural characterization of diatoms before and after loading of Ind was performed using a field emission scanning electron microscopy, FESEM (Philip XL30). Milli-Q water was added to the diatom samples to create a suspension mixture. A drop of suspension was placed on a silicon wafer. The sample on the wafer was left to dry, mounted on a holder with double-sided conductive tape and coated with a 3 nm platinum layer. The microscope was operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV and at normal incidence, a working distance of 20 mm and different scales to acquire low- and high-resolution images.</p>

The pressure was 5 × 10<sup>−9</sup> mbar during analysis. It was conducted as a qualitative and quantitative study to confirm the surface modification of diatoms. Modified surface with organosilane and phosphonic acid (PA) were scanned and compared to bare diatom surface. The elements O, C, P, N and Si in the samples were identified from survey spectra recorded over the energy range of 0–1100 eV at 1.0 eV resolution and pass energy of 160 eV. High-resolution spectra (0.1 eV) were recorded for the C atom photoelectron peaks to identify the chemical state of the organic molecules. The core-level binding energy of the different peaks were normalized by setting the bonding energy of C1s peaks for C–C bonds at 285.0 eV. Processing and curve-fitting of the high-resolution spectra was carried out using Casa XPS™ with peak assignments for each element and atom–atom binding type.</p>

However, after drug loading (Ind), most of the pores were seen as partially or fully closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328212441846">Figure 2(c)</xref>). This is explained by the multilayered adsorption of drugs on diatom surface that is not occurred during monolayer modification with organosilanes and phosphonic acids.

<p>The survey XPS spectra in bare diatoms reveal the presence of the following elements O (∼58%), C (24%) and Si (18%). New peaks of N and P were observed in silanized and phosphonated diatoms, respectively, which is in agreement with the presence of these elements in amine groups (APTES and AEAPTMS) and phosphate groups (2-phos and 16-phos). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328212441846">Table 1</xref> shows the normalized elemental peak areas (per unit area) of APTES, AEAPTMS, 2-phos and 16-phos functionalized-DE as compared to bare diatoms. The intensity of the spectra signal of C, O, N and Si depends on the degree of silanization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328212441846">35</xref></sup> The quantity of O and C atoms of the silane-modified diatoms does not differ much from the bare diatoms. N signal was detected with 2–3% N1s peak intensity (area %), indicating the silane immobilization onto diatom surface that depicts a layer of APTES or AEAPTMS organic siloxane film formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328212441846">36</xref></sup> In the case of phosphonic acid modified diatoms, similar to organosilane, one extra peak showing signals of P atoms was observed with characteristic increase in C atoms in 16-phos, due to its long CH<sub>2</sub> hydrocarbon chain.

For the reference binding energies used in resolving the peaks, the value was the same as in literature, that is 285 eV for C–H (C–C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328212441846">Figure 3(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328212441846">b</xref>)).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328212441846">37</xref></sup> Carboxyl and hydroxyl groups were found in phosphonic acid–DE (C–OH at 287 eV, C=O at 287.5 eV, COOH at 289 eV) but not in silane-modified diatoms. Contrarily, C–N was found in silane–DE, at 285.5 eV, but not in phosphonic acid–DE, confirming presence of different functional groups. The chemical shift of the binding energy is very sensitive to the effects of the electronegativity of the neighbouring bound element and the chemical-binding environment that is confirmed in phosphonated diatoms where C−O peaks were moved to the higher binding energy. Moreover, the C1s binding-energy value of the C−P bond in the 2-phos chemical environment (data not shown) is slightly higher than that in the 16-phos, which is caused by the significant ionic property of the −PO<sub>3</sub> and −COOH terminating functional group. In addition, the binding-energy assignment for the C−P bond at 286.2 eV of the phosphonic acid-modified diatoms is different from expected, may due to the highly electronegative environment with oxide-rich silica of diatom surface.

This peak is absent on the bare surface, confirming the successful process of silanization. There are two N1s signals for APTES modified surface, that are NH<sub>2</sub> at 399.3 eV and NH<sub>3</sub> at 401.6 eV; showing a greater amount of NH<sub>3</sub> species than AEAPTMS. Their NH<sub>2</sub>:NH<sub>3</sub> ratio is calculated to be 1:3 and 1:1.5, respectively. In the case of AEAPTMS, the decomposition of the N1s peaks shows the contribution of two distinct chemical states of nitrogen, NH–C at 399.8 eV and <inline-formula id="ilm1-0885328212441846"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0885328212441846"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>NH</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> at 401.5 eV. The latter is ascribed to the proton exchange with remaining surface hydroxyl groups from diatom surface. This observation suggests that some of the −NH<sub>2</sub> head groups are oriented towards the SiO<sub>2</sub> surface of the diatoms. This shows AEAPTMS has a much stronger NH<sub>2</sub> signal, indicating more NH<sub>2</sub> groups are available, to offer more active sites for accepting electrons or electronegative molecules to form new bonds or stabilized compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328212441846">38</xref></sup></p>

The attachment becomes apparent from the appearance of phosphorus signal. By comparing 2-phos and 16-phos modified DE, 2-phos has a stronger P–O signal than 16-phos, due to the fact that it is a significantly smaller molecule than 16-phos, and 16-phos has a larger hydrocarbon chain which renders the P–O part in its overall structure relatively smaller. The P = O and P–C signals are similar in both 2-phos and 16-phos.</p>

<p>TGA analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328212441846">Figure 4</xref> shows the weight loss from bare diatoms, drug (Ind), Ind loaded in bare and modified diatoms. Since diatoms are essentially composed of SiO<sub>2</sub> with high thermal stability, it contributes to no weight loss. It is difficult to detect weight loss from silane and phosphonic acid monolayers as their amount is extremely small compared to the combined weight of diatoms and loaded drug. Unlike bare diatoms surfaces, Ind can be chemisorbed into the active functional groups of silane or phosphonic acids. This results in a wider range for the drug decomposition temperature in modified than bare diatoms.

</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885328212441846">Table 2</xref> displays loading results for Ind in diatom microcapsules and the encapsulation efficiency for each, calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0885328212441846">equations (1)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0885328212441846">2</xref>). Drug-loading capacity of the surface-functionalized diatoms was determined to be 15–24 ± 2% based on net drug loss. AEAPTMS yields the best result for highest drug loading and encapsulation performance, followed by 2-phos, APTES, bare diatoms and 16-phos. This is elucidated by the weaker interaction between silanol in diatoms and phosphonic acids than that of amine in AEAPTMS and APTES. The latter leads to a greater adsorption of drug molecules, that is 19% in hydrophilic APTES, 24% in AEAPTMS and 22% in 2-phos; that are greater than bare DE (15%) and hydrophobic 16-phos (15%). This result can be explained by the properties of Ind, which is a hydrophobic and water insoluble molecule. When hydrophobic monolayer and hydrophobic drug interact, both repulsive and attractive forces can be induced depending on the interfacial interplay and distance function based on Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (DLVO) theory. In hydrophilic (polar) medium, interactions between hydrophobic drug and hydrophobic SAM or 16-phos are expected to be attractive not repulsive, due to the presence of Van der Waals (dispersive) forces. Strong, long-range repulsion may emerge from steric or electro-steric (when functionality is charged) or structural forces upon symmetric interactions of polymer molecular or functional groups at the interface. When the long-chained, 16-phos molecules at DE surface and the Ind molecules interact, repulsive steric or structural forces emerge, which could hinder the drug’s adsorption. This is a possible explanation why drug loading of silane and 2-phos modified diatoms is 1.5 times higher than bare diatoms. The 2-phos yields a far better performance than 16-phos because its hydrocarbon chain is 5.5 times shorter than 16-phos, monolayer is rather disordered then densely packed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328212441846">40</xref></sup> Therefore, instead of its hydrocarbon organic group, the carboxyl group are exposed at interface and have the most profound impact on the overall molecular chemistry, giving rise to its hydrophilic property, rather than a hydrophobic one in 16-phos.

<p>DSC is crucial in ascertaining phase transitions that Ind might undergo during encapsulation and storage in diatom microcapsules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328212441846">Figure 5</xref>). The pure DE’s broad endothermic peak indicated at 149.16℃ is believed to be due the removal of chemisorbed or structural water from the bulk mineral structure. DSC graph carried out on pure Ind shows a sharp endothermic peak at 165.7℃ for its melting in the stable crystalline γ-form. The endothermic transitions indicated at temperature range 162–166℃ is largely due to drug structure beak down as part of the melting process of the stable γ-form of the crystalline Ind. The APTES and AEAPTMS modified, Ind-loaded DE samples display two instances of endothermic phase transitions (157℃ and 163–164℃) as for DE-Ind, while the 2- and 16-phos show only one (155℃). Coincidently, the melting temperatures for both the organosilanes and phosphonic acid structures are quite similar or marginally lower, rationalizing the occurrence of various functionality/structure-mediated, endothermic transitions in the temperature range 154–163℃ for the surface functionalized, drug-loaded DE samples (DE–Ind, APTES–DE–Ind, AEAPTMS–DE–Ind, 2-phos–DE–Ind and 16-phos–DE–Ind). The observation of characteristically minor second peaks for the APTES–DE and AEAPTMS–DE appears to be consistent with the breakdown of weaker Bronstead acid–Lewis base interactions between the amino groups from the silane and the carboxyl groups of the Ind drug. In our previous work, we showed by XRD analysis that the Ind encapsulated in diatoms maintains its non-crystallinity up to 3–6 months, which is highly favorable because amorphous drug can be up to 1000 times more soluble. Amorphous encapsulated drug form is important for drug delivery applications, because it critically affects drug dissolution rate and extent depend in vitro and in vivo; and consequently, improvement by means of amorphization could enhance drug bioavailability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885328212441846">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885328212441846">42</xref></sup>

<p>More prominent curves were observed for APTES- and AEAPTMS-modified diatoms, as they show two DSC peaks in comparison with phosphonic which shows only one.

This is because as monolayers were covalently grafted on diatom surface, the samples underwent endothermic process as new chemical bonds were formed. The enthalpies were also subjected to change by a reduction of one to two orders of magnitude when drug deposition occurred as seen in the DSC thermograms.</p>

<p>Signal splitting is more significant in AEAPTMS than APTES modified diatoms, indicating a firmer monolayer deposition, as the oxidation process is very likely due to the available proton (H<sup>+</sup>) from the amino groups in APTES and AEAPTMS. The terminal group (NH<sup>+</sup> and <inline-formula id="ilm2-0885328212441846"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math2-0885328212441846"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>NH</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> from the organosilane, −OH from PA-modified diatoms) bears hydrogen-donating tendency due to the available protons with positive charges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885328212441846">43</xref></sup> Therefore their NMR peaks slightly shifted towards more positive region. The broad splitting of Si across −100 to −80 ppm implies hydrogen bonding in APTES and 2-phos-modified diatoms. This explains the high drug loading due to the strong monolayer deposition on diatom surface and good drug adhesion to the SAM. For PA–DE, Q4 signal shifted to −117 ppm, implying new Si–O–P bond formation. The broad peak in 16-phos indicates a signal splitting of Q4 to Q2 and Q3-type silica. However, the splitting in 16-phos is less obvious, suggesting a weak grafting or incomplete surface modification. The <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328212441846">29</xref></sup>Si NMR results indicate that immobilization of organosilanes and phosphonic acid have impact on the condensation state of modified diatom silica. The polar functional groups from the immobilized molecules have high hydration energy (OH− and CH<sub>3</sub>COO− from the phosphonic acids; and NH<sub>3</sub>+ and NH<sub>2</sub>− from the organosilanes) and encourage silica condensation process resulting in broader signalling in the Si NMR spectra.</p>
<p>The interaction between drug and SAMs-modified diatoms were investigated by <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328212441846">13</xref></sup>C NMR and the most characteristic spectra are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328212441846">Figure 7</xref>. There are no new peaks formed as a result of modification, but the intensity of signals differs from bare diatoms, indicating the variation in the number of C atoms. The greater the integrated area is under the curves, the more drug molecules are entrapped inside the diatom microcapsules. This is especially affirmed by APTES and AEAPTMS–DE, as these SAMs have rich amino silane functionality that is a good receiver for electrons. Since these silanes are positively charged, the electrostatic bonding with the electronegative functional group of Ind, that is methoxyl, carbonyl, C=O of the carboxylic group and chloride constituents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328212441846">Figure 7</xref> inset), is likely to take place. The formation of the intermolecular dimers via carboxyl groups in the 2-phos and 16-phos accounts for a higher molecular mobility of the drug in phosphonated diatoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885328212441846">44</xref></sup> This yields a strong C signal in AEAPTMS as discussed earlier, followed by 2-phos, APTES and 16-phos. The weakest C spectra appear in 16-phos, indicating the reduction of drug adsorption due to the rise in surface hydrophobicity of modified diatoms, resulting in low drug loading and encapsulation efficiency as seen in TGA, and vice versa. Also, similar to <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328212441846">29</xref></sup>Si NMR, there exists splitting and peaks that are broader in the drug-modified diatoms which indicates greater carbon presence in the chemical environment of diatoms, with respect to the extended short-range disorder of carbon molecular orientation due to the amorphous drug state.

However, that burst release was significantly suppressed from 80% in bare DE to 60% upon functionalization by 2-phos, APTES and AEAPTMS, suggesting that hydrophilic surface favors a stronger drug adsorption on modified diatoms including a better containment of drug inside silica pores and matrices, resulting in slower release kinetics. This is explained by weak secondary intermolecular bonding such as Van der Waals, electrostatic forces such as induced dipole–dipole attractions in the physisorbed drug molecules that was deposited to the active carboxyl-terminated PA (2-phos) or silane-terminated (amino rich) SAM-grafted diatoms. Interestingly, the fastest release (faster than in bare diatoms) is depicted in 16-phos–DE, indicating that the hydrophobic properties in 16-phos from long alkyl chains could hinder the diffusion and permeation of drug molecules through the porous DE structure. We suppose that the immobilized 16-phos molecules are not densely packed on diatom surface and as their molecules are collapsed, the expose of hydrophobic chain of their molecule is significantly increased. As the strength of the drug–functional group interaction in SAM can be controlled by using different functional groups, this is proposed to be a useful approach to control drug loading and release performances of diatoms.

<p>The drug release mechanism from diatoms is mainly directed by diffusive transport of drugs through their porous structures. Since diatoms is a silica lattice with relatively high surface area (31 m<sup>2</sup>/g) and porosity (0.052 cm<sup>3</sup>/g), the diffusion of Ind to the phosphate buffer media is a surface-dependent phenomenon. The slow release from the second day until the day of completion can be fitted with a zero-order model. The drug release rate is fairly constant, as the solvent accessible area in diatoms remains unchanged and there is no degradation throughout the release period. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885328212441846">Table 3</xref> shows the release efficiency and drug elution time of free drug (control), drug-bare and drug-modified diatoms. According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885328212441846">Table 3</xref>, drug release time can be prolonged by 50% &gt; 30% &gt; 20% via surface modification of AEAPTMS &gt; 2-phos &gt; APTES and quickened by 40% with 16-phos, using bare diatoms as the standard reference. Similarly, burst release can be suppressed by 17.8% &gt; 16.4% &gt; 13.7%, with AEAPTMS &gt; 2-phos &gt; APTES.<?tlsb?><?twb?> These results confirm that the surface functionalization on diatoms was successfully used to alter their drug loading and release performance. Further improvement can be achieved by the selection of modifications with appropriate functional groups to provide stronger interactions with drug molecules including possibility of creating stimuli-responsive release (pH, temperature, radio frequency).</p>

<p>This study demonstrates the surface modifications of diatom silica and their influence on drug loading and release behaviour of water-insoluble drugs where Ind drug was used as the model. The surface modification by covalent attachment of selected organosilanes terminated with amino groups (APTES, AEAPTMS – silane; and phophonic acids (2-phos, 16-phos–phosphonic acid) COOH-terminated group was successfully performed and proven by several characterization techniques (DSC, TGA, ssNMR and XPS). With amine groups covalently grafted to the AEAPTMS-modified DE, up to 60 wt.% increase of drug adsorption can be achieved, followed by 2-phos &gt; APTES &gt; bare &gt;16-phos in descending order. Aminosilanized and 2-phophonated diatoms increase Ind loading and prolong in vitro release, showing the advantages of active polar and functional groups (NH<sup>+</sup>, <inline-formula id="ilm3-0885328212441846"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math3-0885328212441846"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>NH</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> from silane and COOH from 2-phos) in improving drug release characteristics. Contrarily, the modifications with 16-phos which creates a hydrophobic diatom surface caused quicker drug release and lower loading. These results confirm that by appropriate surface functionalization on diatoms, it is possible to tune drug loading (15–24%) and release characteristics (6–15 days). In conclusion, diatom silica as a cheap, biocompatible and natural material offers considerable potential to be applied for implantable drug delivery, especially in bone therapy and orthopaedic applications.</p>
