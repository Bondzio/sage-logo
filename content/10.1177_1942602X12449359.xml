<abstract>
<p>The NASN 2012 Annual Report provides highlights from the past 12 months, showcasing accomplishments in each area of NASN’s strategic plan: Programs/Services, Research, Public Relations, and Advocacy. The association strives to improve the level of service provided to our members and ensure that membership dues are more than offset by member services and value by continually addressing the strategic plan as outlined by the NASN Board of Directors. Based on this Annual Report, the <italic>NASN School Nurse</italic> Editorial Advisory Board identified 12 membership tips that will be referenced throughout this article, encouraging members to take advantage of a variety of benefits available to them.</p>

<title>NASN—Behind the Scenes</title>
<sec id="section2-1942602X12449359">
<title>Income and Expenditures</title>
<p>NASN has three major sources of income: membership dues, services (publications, annual conference, and live programs), and external funding. There continues to be a strong balance between the varied income sources. As NASN continues to harness its external relationships and build its reputation as a key, credible partner in promoting children’s health, it increases its opportunities to apply for and receive external sources of funding. For example, NASN has significantly expanded the scope of its programs during the past 4 years as a result of financial support from the federal government and industry (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1942602X12449359">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>NASN has three major areas of expenses and remains committed to its members and the community to return as much as possible to direct services, products, and programs. The majority of expenditures (77%) provides direct services and resources for members. Other expenditures include direct member services such as providing resources for advocacy, disseminating programs, providing communication channels, and printing and shipping NASN material resources. Expenses for administrative and membership support staff, computer programs, and “keeping the lights on” are accounted for in overhead expenses (17%). Board meetings, conference calls, officer travel, and the governance work accounts for at approximately 6% of total expenses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1942602X12449359">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Membership</title>
<p>NASN is devoted to enlisting and retaining memberships. NASN had a total of 15,012 members as of December 19, 2011, representing a 9.4% increase in individual memberships from the previous 12 months. In 2010, 74% of the new members renewed membership. Currently, 43 affiliates have a unified dues structure. Arkansas, New Jersey, North Carolina, Washington, and West Virginia are the five most recent affiliates to unify. NASN makes an intentional and aggressive effort to eliminate barriers to renewal. As of December 2011, 1,019 members were paying their dues in quarterly installments (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1942602X12449359">Table 2</xref>, Tip 1).</p>

<p>The state of the economy has been evident at the past few Annual Conferences, most notably in that fewer attendees pay with purchase orders (school district funds). NASN is working diligently to promote the conference by targeting members via conference blast e-mails; placing ads in various publications; adding conference banners and blurbs to the NASN <italic>Weekly Digest</italic>; and sending messages via Facebook, Twitter, and Conference Site discussions. NASN again used its association database management system to administer conference planning tasks and data including the abstract submission and review process, event profiles, speakers, registrations, exhibitors, tickets and badges, and so forth. The Conference Site was expanded to serve as a comprehensive resource as well as a networking platform for attendees and speakers. First launched in 2010 for the Annual Conference in Chicago, the Conference Site demonstrates NASN’s dedication to use of technology to enhance the annual conference. The goals for the Conference Site are as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-1942602X12449359" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>provide comprehensive conference information in one location,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>provide a forum for attendees to network before, during, and after the event,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>enable attendees to gather detailed information from speakers regarding sessions,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>create and organize a conference schedule before the event,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>access session materials including abstracts and handouts,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>join the conversation on other NASN social media sites including Facebook and Twitter, and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>use the mobile-friendly interface onsite at the conference.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Final bonuses for attending the conference include being first to get your hands on new information and publications, shop at the Endowment Fund Silent Auction “Purses for Nurses,” support NASN’s Endowment Fund Event with a host of friends, network with affiliate colleagues at the Affiliate Rally and Affiliate Night Out, and attend top-notch presentations with well-known speakers and experts in the school health field. Start planning for NASN 2013 “Advocacy, Access, Achievement: Leading the Way” now, which will be held June 27–30, 2013, in Orlando, FL.</p>

<sec id="section8-1942602X12449359">
<title>Live Programs</title>
<p>NASN continues to offer many live programs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1942602X12449359">Table 2</xref>, Tip 5). The visibility of the role of the school nurse often leads to related projects and new collaborations. The current available live programs are as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-1942602X12449359" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p><bold>Managing Students With Seizures</bold> is delivered by local chapters of the Epilepsy Foundation, with NASN providing the CNE credit and program administration. This program is also available online, offered as five separate modules.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><bold>School Emergency Triage Training</bold> is a hands-on triage course, updated in June 2011. The course trains school nurse participants to lead first-aid teams and teach others how to assist in triage during a mass casualty event.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><bold>H.A.N.D.S.</bold><sup>SM</sup> <bold>(Helping Administer to the Needs of Students with Diabetes in School)</bold> is a full-day interactive educational program copresented by NASN trained educators: a certified diabetes educator (CDE) and a school nurse. Participants receive current diabetes treatment information with an emphasis on the role of the school nurse as the leader of the school health team. Program updates as well as access to sample forms, references, resources, and tools are available online to H.A.N.D.S.<sup>SM</sup> participants. There are currently 16 CDEs and 22 school nurse–trained H.A.N.D.S.<sup>SM</sup> instructors. An active H.A.N.D.S.<sup>SM</sup> instructor discussion list also supports instructor updates and program consistency.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><bold>Managing Asthma Triggers (MAT II &amp; MAT III)</bold> is the result of a grant from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), now in its 9th year. NASN was one of 13 awardees out of over 130 applications. The program goals are to effect positive changes in school environments and to improve the indoor air quality in schools with a special emphasis on controlling indoor asthma triggers. In 2011, NASN sent two school nurse representatives to the EPA National Asthma Forum in Washington, DC. The National Asthma Forum provides attendees the opportunity to discover best practices, explore the latest science, learn about leading asthma care programs, and develop leadership and action plans. More recently, 12 school nurse educators were trained to bring the Managing Asthma Triggers III program to school nurse groups around the country. This program teaches school administrators and other school staff how to mitigate asthma triggers and educates them about the role the school nurse can serve in helping improve indoor air quality in schools. The MAT III program is offered exclusively online. Finally, NASN plans to video and audio tape MAT III for placement on the NASN website.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><bold>School Nurse Childhood Obesity Prevention Education (S.C.O.P.E.)</bold> is a full-day comprehensive program that includes an overview of increasing prevalence of childhood obesity. This includes the school nurse’s role in screening children and adolescents’ body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and Type 2 diabetes; assessing risks for childhood overweight and obesity (i.e., assessing diet and physical activity and assessing family risk factors). The program also includes guidance for the school nurse to understand his or her role in referrals for overweight children and in providing evidenced-based practice for the prevention and management of childhood obesity in schools. A new component to the program is leadership and advocacy training for the school nurse to effect environmental changes in the school to promote healthy lifestyles for all students. As a result of collaboration with the United Health Foundation, NASN has produced four online CNEs, two related to childhood obesity and two related to school nurse leadership. In addition, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the national Initiative for Children’s Healthcare Quality Collaborate for Healthy Weight project provided the resources to develop a webinar on the role of the school nurse in addressing childhood obesity. This webinar led Discovery Communications to invite NASN to collaborate with them on a project promoting their Discovery Health initiative. The webinar can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.collaborateforhealthyweight.org/Take-Action/Events/Past-Events.aspx">http://www.collaborateforhealthyweight.org/Take-Action/Events/Past-Events.aspx</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Strategic Plan: Research</title>
<p>Under the guidance and counsel of the Research Director, NASN strives to be the leading authority on school nursing and provider of evidence-based tools and resources. <italic>A Case for School Nursing</italic>, originally developed in 2011 and updated in 2012, is a resource based on a literature review of school nursing outcomes. This evidence-based document supporting school nursing practice is accessible on the NASN Press Page and the NASN Advocacy web page: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nasn.org/portals/0/about/2010_The_Case_for_School_Nursing.pdf">http://www.nasn.org/portals/0/about/2010_The_Case_for_School_Nursing.pdf</ext-link>. The 2011 Ratio Ruler uses enrollment and school nurse intensity data from documented sources. When valid data are not collected by a state agency or the affiliate, the ruler indicates the method used to estimate the ratio of school nurses to students.</p>
<p>Other efforts to promote school nursing research include maintaining communication and relationships with the National Center for Education Statistics, Department of Education Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools, and HRSA to highlight the need for school health data for decision making and policy guidance to promote improved health outcomes and academic success for students. NASN reached a broader audience with the publication of an additional letter to the editor regarding the number of students on long-term mechanical ventilation in the journal <italic>Pediatrics</italic> in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942602X12449359">Bergren, 2011</xref>). In addition, formal and informal school nurse research networks held a joint meeting and invited network representatives from Massachusetts School Nurse Research Network, North Carolina, Delaware, Washington, District of Columbia (National Children’s Medical Center), Alabama, Iowa, and Florida to participate. These networks are collectively seeking financial resources to hold a national summit highlighting school nursing research to prepare to conduct multisite studies on the effectiveness of school nurse delivery models, school nursing interventions, and the impact of school nurse intensity on the health and education of school-age children.</p>
<p>NASN encourages and promotes masters and doctoral student research that addresses the NASN Research Priorities through communications on the NASN Research and Student discussion list. For example, NASN continues to work with two doctoral students who are working on nursing minimum data sets including failure-to-rescue data. Both published their work in the <italic>Journal of School Nursing</italic> in 2011. Nursing research is also promoted on the SCHLRN-L School Nurse Discussion List, which is in its 17th year of promoting school nursing and NASN services to both members and nonmembers. Fellowships, grants, and publication and presentation opportunities are posted regularly (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1942602X12449359">Table 2</xref>, Tip 8).</p>
<p>The NASN Quick Poll in the <italic>Weekly Digest</italic> provides immediate, nonscientific feedback on current questions and trends. The data produced provide a popular mechanism for members’ voices to be heard and gives NASN and its partners a snapshot of trends and issues affecting school nurses and school children. NASN shared this informal data in advocacy communications and has even included them to supplement grant applications. The Quick Poll also prompts NASN members and nonmembers to visit the NASN website weekly.</p>
<p>NASN also demonstrated its support for evidence-based practice in 2011 by providing the informational services of full-text access to the EBSCO (Elton B. Stephens Company) product, CINAHL Plus for Board members, staff members, and editorial advisory board members of <italic>Journal of School Nursing</italic> and <italic>NASN School Nurse</italic>. The EBSCO contract offers the online database of Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebscohost.com/cinahl/">http://www.ebscohost.com/cinahl/</ext-link> and full text access to 606 journals. Unlike acute care nurses, school nurses do not have access to the health science literature to support evidence-based practice or policy writing. NASN provided this service as a response to a 2010 article in the <italic>Journal of School Nursing</italic>, which suggested only a very small percentage of school nurses use professional peer-reviewed publications to enhance their professional knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942602X12449359">Carlisle et al., 2010</xref>). It was also in response to a 2009 quick poll that indicated 91% of respondents would value full-text access to the literature.</p>

<title>Written and Online Communications</title>
<p>The <italic>Journal of School Nursing</italic> received its first impact factor (0.717) in 2011 and is ranked 62 out of 89 in Nursing by Science Citation Index and 59 out of 87 in Nursing by Social Science Citation Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942602X12449359"><italic>2010 Journal Citation Reports</italic>, 2011</xref>). The impact factor is a measure reflecting the average number of citations to recent articles published in science and social science journals. The Executive Editor promoted the <italic>Journal of School Nursing</italic> as a journal of choice for Fellows who are child health and family researchers and clinicians at the American Academy of Nursing’s annual meeting in October 2011. Since April 2011, the Executive Editor has produced a podcast announcing the coming issue contents. NASN staff direct members to the podcast via the listserv, Facebook, and Twitter. Also, it is worth noting that the number of readers who accessed journal articles online in 2011 substantially increased from the previous year (742,537 compared to 481,474).</p>
<p>The <italic>NASN School Nurse</italic> has demonstrated growth toward becoming a strong clinical resource journal this past year. The publication created a new editorial board, while members on the formal editorial board were elevated to join an editorial advisory board. The two boards now double-blind review all submissions. Significant journal statistics include the following:</p>

<title>Media Outreach</title>
<p>In 2011, there were more than 6,000 mentions of <italic>school nursing</italic> in the news. This includes stories from broadcast affiliates, radio programs, Internet media sites, media blogs, newspapers, and magazines across the country. Topics included school nursing and meningitis, immunizations, diabetes, asthma, health screenings, student-to–school nurse ratios, and staffing of school nurses and unlicensed personnel.</p>
<p>The recent budget crises facing states has brought national attention to the need for access to professional school nursing services, and the media has framed these stories in a positive light. NASN’s increased media presence has resonated with potential and current campaign partners. In response, NASN updated its media section on the website to include links to past and recent press releases, the Ratio Ruler, documents describing the evidence-based research on the impact that school nursing services have on student learning outcomes, links to related news articles, media guidelines and resources, and NASN media staff contact information. NASN also maintains a media archive of video and audio clips of NASN-related broadcasts.</p>
<p>NASN released 11 press releases in 2011. Additionally, NASN arranged, in partnership with NASN educational campaigns, several in-person media briefings and speaking engagements, radio and satellite media tours, and weekly (if not daily) phone and e-mail interviews with NASN spokespeople promoting the link between school nursing and student success. In 2011 alone, <bold>more than 500 million</bold> media impressions were generated by NASN.</p>
<p>NASN archives its Radio interviews, which are available on the NASN website and BAM Network. A wide variety of educational associations share and broadcast the NASN interviews. BAM hosts the NASN Radio segments on iTunes, where NASN reached the top 25 category (number 7 on the iTunes Education K-12 chart on the Apple site). NASN generates revenue when anyone opens a link to a radio segment. A 2% response rate is considered very successful for this type of social media—for the NASN radio segments response rates range between 30 and 45%. In 2011, 12 new shows aired, with several more shows scheduled and/or recorded for 2012. NASN Radio remains attractive to both school nurses and funding partners for disseminating current and trusted information to school nurses and school communities.</p>
<p>NASN social media is attracting new credible partnerships and even revenue. The NASN page on Facebook has more than 2,300 fans, and Twitter reaches more than 1,600 followers in addition to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Education.com">Education.com</ext-link>’s 2,200 Twitter followers for requested NASN promotional messaging. NASN’s YouTube account is linked with campaigns and videos celebrating school nurses and is utilized to post announcements from the NASN President. Notable media headlines are also linked to NASN’s Digg account. All social media sites are now conveniently located on the new NASN website under <italic>Engage and Connect With NASN</italic>.</p>
<p>NASN plans to use social media to target parents about an upcoming new initiative. NASN recognizes that the support of parents around the country is vital to protecting children and enhancing school nursing services. The new website will host links to engage parents, provide resources for parents to advocate for access to professional school nursing services, and share parent testimonies supporting school nurses, categorized by state. NASN anticipates parents and guardians to be among its greatest allies in 2012 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1942602X12449359">Table 2</xref>, Tip 10).</p>
<p>To assist NASN members unfamiliar with social media, NASN continues to provide social media education in the <italic>NASN School Nurse</italic>, at the Annual Conference, and via e-mail requests. Several affiliates have launched their own social media pages as well, with support from NASN staff.</p>

Eight additional publications were released in 2011: <italic>Managing Diabetes at School: Tools for the School Nurse; School Health Office Diabetes Record; Are You Sick, No, I’m Seven: School Nurses Share Their Funny Stories; NASN Advocacy Folder; 100 Conditions Chart; Care and Kindness: School Nurses Making a Difference; Disaster Preparedness—Guidelines for School Nurses</italic>; and <italic>Scope and Standards of Practice—School Nursing</italic> (2nd ed.).

<title>Strategic Plan: Advocacy</title>
<p>The first session of the 112th Congress proved to be difficult to move forward any health-related legislative issues, including NASN’s legislative priorities. Congress attacked key provisions in the Affordable Care Act, including cutting a substantial portion of the Prevention and Public Health Fund. In addition, Members of Congress challenged the implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (Public Law No. 111-296). Meanwhile, federal agencies continue to restructure programs in response to limited funding. For example, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention redesigned its Division of Adolescent and School Health and scaled back its focus on coordinated school health issues.</p>
<p>NASN Board members present the organization’s top-tier legislative priorities in meetings with members of Congress and/or their staff during the annual January Board Meeting. These meetings provide an opportunity for NASN Board members to educate Congress about the inextricable link between access to professional nursing health services and positive learning outcomes. Establishing relationships with members of Congress also enables NASN to promote additional relevant issues of concern that arise throughout the year related to student health outcomes, such as protecting the Public Health and Prevention Fund.</p>
<p>NASN maintains its voice and presence on Capitol Hill through consistent communication with Congressional staff about priority legislation. For instance, the Student-to–School Nurse Ratio Improvement Act of 2011 B (H.R. 2229) was reintroduced in the House on June 16, 2011, by Representative Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY-4). NASN continues to pursue attaching this bill as an amendment to include in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Additionally, NASN’s involvement with the National Alliance of Pupil Services Organizations influenced the incorporation of the terminology of “specialized support services personnel” in the Senate version of the ESEA reauthorization bill. The language was also included in the Graduation for All Act (H.R. 4122), the Positive Behavior for Safe and Effective Schools Act (H.R. 2597), and the Reducing Barriers to Learning Act (H.R. 2800).</p>
<p>NASN successfully inserted school nursing language into bills addressing concussions associated with school athletics and food allergy and anaphylaxis management. The School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act (H.R. 3627/S. 1884) was in introduced as a bipartisan bill in the House and Senate. These companion bills would provide states with incentives to require elementary and secondary schools to maintain and permit authorized school personnel to administer stock epinephrine at schools. The bills recognize the lead role of the school nurse as “authorized personnel,” as cited in the legislative language.</p>
<p>NASN is a leader in advocating for student health privacy. NASN often provides expertise to government and national agencies and organizations regarding the intersection of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Family Education Rights Privacy Act (FERPA). For example, NASN submitted the following public comments to the Federal Register on suggested changes to the FERPA:</p>
<list id="list7-1942602X12449359" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Increase disclosure to federal, state and local government officials by allowing federal, state and local public health officials to share records for public health reporting, surveillance, and reimbursement.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Allow (do not require) schools to contribute to immunizations registries.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Allow the sharing of personally identifiable student information for billing purposes.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Provide annual training to all who handle personally identifiable health and education information.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Require notification of stolen information or the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>NASN has accepted several invitations to the White House for meetings regarding child nutrition, the pregnancy prevention fund, and a Specialized Instructional Support Office at the Department of Education. The primary departments with whom NASN works closely include</p>
<list id="list8-1942602X12449359" list-type="bullet">

<p>NASN is a reliable “voice of school nursing” for these departments and agencies, which often reach out with requests to NASN to respond to inquiries, discuss issues, participate in conferences and initiatives, and attend presidential and national media events.</p>
<p>In September 2011, NASN received an invitation to the Vice President’s residence for an event commemorating the anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act. Linda Davis-Alldritt (NASN President) and Mary Louise Embrey (NASN Director of Government Affairs) met Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden (see issue cover photo). They also had an opportunity converse with members of Congress and directors of federal agencies. In October, NASN Executive Director Donna Mazyck and Mary Louise Embrey attended a White House event honoring “heroes” who work on specific issues related to violence against women.</p>
<p>NASN remains engaged in many other national advocacy initiatives, including</p>
<list id="list9-1942602X12449359" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Let’s Move! Campaign:</bold> The White House Domestic Policy Office and the First Lady’s Office communicate with NASN regarding the role school nurses play to help promote healthy lifestyles among students and prevent childhood obesity. NASN updates the Let’s Move! office on its participation in relevant advocacy activities.</p>
</list-item>

<p>
<bold>FDA’s First Annual Health Professionals Conference:</bold> NASN participated in this initial conference at the invitation of the FDA. NASN networked with professionals at the conference and established ongoing communications with FDA staff. Two Public Health Service Corps nurses currently on staff at FDA met with staff at NASN in December 2011 to dialogue about areas of mutual interest.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>National Coordinating Committee on School Health and Safety:</bold> NASN is an active member at the general meetings and as a member of the steering committee. At the Fall 2011 meeting, NASN’s Director of Government Affairs updated the group on NASN’s priorities and activities, and NASN’s Director of Research presented a plenary on the importance of tapping various funding streams for health services. The meeting allowed NASN to have a substantial discussion with officials from other parts of HHS, the Department of Justice/Office of Justice Programs, the Department of Education, and the Department of Agriculture.</p>
