<p>It was only a matter of time before a book with such a title would appear. Beginning with Jürgen Habermas’ shift in views on religion in public life a decade ago, the notion of the “post-secular” has gained currency in academic circles. Yet the term suffers from a lack of clarity. As Craig Calhoun aptly puts it in his essay, “post-secularism can hardly mean ‘after secularism,’ though it might signal an end to taking it for granted that a clear, stable, and consistent demarcation has been established between secular and religious dimensions of life” (p. 335). The thirteen essays in the collection make some strides in making this point.</p>
<p>Given Habermas’ role in this debate, he is both applauded and critiqued. Michele Dillon offers the most pointed comments. Describing his effort as a “gesture toward religion,” she regards his cognitive-rationalist orientation as giving short shrift to emotion and tradition, and hence his conception of the post-secular society still privileges rational as opposed to faith-based argumentation. Moreover, his use of the terms “secular citizens” and “religious citizens” implies a too easy distinction. Nonreligious people are mobilized by religious-cultural ideals and, alternatively, religious people may not be inspired by the same ideals. Citing the civil rights movement, “we would be hard pressed,” she says, “to say who in that movement was a religious citizen and who was a secular citizen” (p. 266).</p>
<p>More than any other commentator, Bryan S. Turner defends a version of the older secularization thesis. He sees global democratization undermining ancient forms of sacredness and ineffability and massive consumption now turning religion into a secular choice and empty practice. He points to the “contraction of the span of transcendence” (p. 152) and a subsequent loss of tension between religion and the world. Accordingly, he warns that if we fail to take secularization seriously this could lead to presuming that every new flash seemingly of religious renewal is evidence of “re-sacralization.” His point has some merit although his generalizations on democratization and consumption seem a bit wide-sweeping.</p>
<p>What about religion or its absence within the university? Thomas Masuzawa lays out a genealogy of developments within the modern university: it is becoming secularized, and being Germanized, as he says. The spirit of enlightened modernity with its ideals of critical thinking unloosened its religious moorings. But he warns that yearning for the “post-secular” might lead to an illusion of an exit from the secular when there is no real exit. John Schmalzbauer and Kathleen Mahoney are more sanguine, indeed welcoming of a reintegration of religion and academia. They cite the growth of academic institutes, centers, networks of scholars, the expansion of religious studies departments, and the like as having “fueled the return of religion to the campus” (p. 216). Certainly religious scholarship has flourished and even interest in religion may have increased, but these hardly translate into any thorough-going integration of religious values within academia or enhanced levels of personal faith in public universities.</p>
<p>Most contributors hammer at the religion/secularity dichotomy as too simple and misguided: religious people engage this-worldly life, and often do so largely incognizant of any serious separation of the religious from the secular. Moreover, both of the basic terms are problematic in a serious comparative study, as Richard Madsen points out when applying the Western category of religion to Chinese culture. Plus, there are varieties of secularism, each distinctively shaped by contextual influences, governmental arrangements, and the selective appropriation of Enlightenment and/or other humanistic ideals. Nor does secularism necessarily imply an increased absence of religious influence: it often serves to adjudicate relations among religions; that is, to legitimate pluralism, in places like India, the United States, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Moreover, the religious and the secular are social constructions formed in no small part in juxtaposition to one another. Courtney Bender writes about “entanglements,” noting that the lived world is not so neatly divided into religious and secular spheres; spiritual discourse within modern highly-individualized societies especially, she argues, arises out of experiences within both religious and secular institutional sectors. John Torpey points to the difference between active religiosity (institutionalized) and that which is latent (as manifest in mood and sensibilities), and suggests that in a country like France the tension over the presence of Muslims is explained partly as that of a repressed Christian culture now newly aroused. His archeological image prompts us to think of religious influences, and perhaps secular ones, being layered within historic cultures and capable under certain conditions of re-activation.</p>
<p>Sometimes too, religion serves as a quasi-ethnic, secular identity. Being Jewish, Muslim, or Christian in a multi-religious setting defines and locates each one in relation to the others, thereby altering all of their self-conceptions. In which case, sorting out the religious from the secular and how the two mesh creating hybrid religious/secular realities becomes important for various social science disciplines. Hent de Vries devotes an entire chapter to analyzing Barack Obama’s divergent mix of influences, not just in the obvious sense—racially, culturally, and religiously—but as they bear upon his political theology, which amounts to an amalgam of Christian realism on human nature and hope combined with a strong dose of secular pragmatism, influences Obama himself credits to the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr.</p>
<p>Other contributors propose a more radical reorientation of the relation of the religious and the secular. Philip Gorski offers a revisionist perspective on Durkheim, arguing the importance of his Aristotelian intellectual roots, and suggesting that he was concerned with a “sociology of the good,” which if read this way could, he thinks, free us from the narrow confines of the religion/secularity dichotomy. James K.A. Smith would like us to move beyond conceptualizing religion as disembodied belief, favoring instead a refocus on liturgy, or what he describes as “rituals of ultimacy.” Influenced by Heidegger, he looks upon religion as ultimate love, that which we really worship, and a quality or allegiance that operates more on the order of mood than of cognition. It follows then that much of what we take to be secular (he cites football games and NASCAR) are in his perspective religious—which some readers will see as liberating the study of religion, and others will think is much too open-ended. Eduardo Mendieta defends the claim that the post-secular offers opportunities for a more expansive understanding of self-reflectivity, or what he calls “authenticity.” Because it is post-foundational, such authenticity expands freedom of belief and unbelief, and thus in his view makes us truly modern. Craig Calhoun uses the phrase “secular transcendence” to imply a reach beyond the immediate (cf., Charles Taylor’s “immanent frame”), to arrive at a deeper apprehension of the human. We apprehend the human in unlimited ways but especially, he suggests, in “analogies, contexts, and connections” (p. 358).</p>
<p>All this makes for a rich, if somewhat patchy discussion that should be carried forward. But the discussion must move beyond the parochial quarters of the sociology and anthropology of religion into the larger provinces of these disciplines. The theoretical leads here spill over and offer new insights for social, cultural, and political analysis broadly.</p>
