<p>Although much has been written about the strengths and challenges of using a response to intervention (RTI) model for identifying and serving students with learning disabilities (LD), the consequences of using this model for gifted students with LD have not been fully explored. This article addresses this void in the literature. A brief overview describing gifted students with LD is provided, followed by a description of RTI. Using a case illustration, the challenges of using RTI for the identification of these students are discussed, and a strength-based, integrated model is proposed as an alternative. Recommendations for training programs and school practitioners are provided.</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451212454005">
<title>Gifted Students With Learning Disabilities</title>
<p>In recent years, there has been increasing attention paid to identifying characteristics of gifted students with LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212454005">Assouline, Nicpon, &amp; Whiteman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212454005">Beckley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053451212454005">Nielsen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212454005">Brody and Mills (1997)</xref> defined this subgroup of gifted learners as “those who possess an outstanding gift or talent and are capable of high performance, but also have a learning disability that makes some aspect of academic achievement difficult” (p. 282). With the accumulated research that has evolved over the past few decades, many researchers are in agreement that gifted students with LD manifest a complex array of abilities, learning challenges, and needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212454005">Assouline et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212454005">Baum, Owen, &amp; Dixon, 1991</xref>; Davis &amp; Rimm, 1995, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212454005">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053451212454005">Johnson, Karnes, &amp; Carr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053451212454005">Nielsen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1053451212454005">Silverman, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1053451212454005">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>). For many of these students, their LD often mask their abilities, thus causing both exceptionalities to appear less extreme and sometimes resulting in average or below average performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212454005">Assouline et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212454005">Baum et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1053451212454005">Silverman, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1053451212454005">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to their gifted peers without LD, gifted students with LD can display high levels of creative potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454005">Baum &amp; Owen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212454005">Colorado Department of Education [CDE], 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053451212454005">Reis, Neu, &amp; McGuire, 1997</xref>), exceptional analytic abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053451212454005">Nielson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053451212454005">Reis et al., 1997</xref>), extraordinary spatial abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053451212454005">Reis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1053451212454005">Silverman, 2002</xref>), superior vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212454005">CDE, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053451212454005">Nielson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053451212454005">Reis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1053451212454005">Silverman, 2002</xref>), and task commitment in areas of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1053451212454005">Neu, 2003</xref>). Many gifted students with LD can also have penetrating insights into complex issues and an unrelenting sense of curiosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053451212454005">Nielson, 2002</xref>). Despite these documented strengths, gifted students with LD possess many characteristic behaviors that negatively affect their learning and hamper identification for gifted services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053451212454005">Nielsen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053451212454005">Reis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1053451212454005">Reis &amp; McCoach, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1053451212454005">Silverman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1053451212454005">Nielsen (2002)</xref>, gifted students with LD can become extremely frustrated in school and quickly give up on tasks. They can (a) become fearful of taking academic risks; (b) have difficulty with fine and gross motor skills, which can result in motor difficulties and poor handwriting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1053451212454005">Weinfeld, Barnes-Robinson, Jeweler, &amp; Shevitz, 2002</xref>); and (c) have low self-esteem, which is often masked by inappropriate behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454005">Baum &amp; Owen, 1988</xref>). These students are further described as (a) disliking drill-and-practice activities for acquiring new skills, (b) having poor organization skills, and (c) having difficulty with spelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212454005">CDE, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454005">Cohen &amp; Vaughn, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1053451212454005">Neu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1053451212454005">Silverman, 2003</xref>). Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454005">Baum and Owen (1988)</xref> noted that, because of the frustration caused by this unique combination of skills and deficits, gifted students with LD can be some of the most disruptive students in class. Typical characteristics of gifted students with LD identified in the literature are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212454005">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Response to Intervention</title>
<p>With the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212454005">2004</xref> reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) as the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA), school districts were granted greater flexibility in their use of assessment procedures for determining LD identification. This revision allows states and districts opportunities to address concerns with the aptitude-achievement discrepancy model and to develop more appropriate identification practices for students who are suspected of having an LD. One of the most frequently suggested alternatives to the use of an IQ/achievement discrepancy formula is the implementation of an RTI model, which provides students with increasingly intensive levels of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451212454005">Fuchs, Fuchs, &amp; Speece, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212454005">Gresham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053451212454005">McMaster, Fuchs, Fuchs, &amp; Compton, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Response to intervention is an early intervention strategy that is implemented within the general education classroom. It provides a process by which students may be identified to receive special education and related services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212454005">Fuchs, Mock, Morgan, &amp; Young, 2003</xref>). The general framework of RTI revolves around a collaborative, multitiered, problem-solving, and intervention process with ongoing progress monitoring designed to help struggling learners “at risk” of school failure. An important focus of RTI centers on early intervention and remediation of students’ learning challenges or perceived deficits. Multitiered models generally consist of three (or in some cases four) tiers of support, each differing by degree of intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212454005">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1053451212454005">Shinn, 2008</xref>). The first tier usually consists of quality instruction in the general education classroom accompanied by a universal screening measure. Students who have not met expected grade level benchmarks are then considered for more intensive support and interventions. The second tier, still part of the general education system of supports, consists of providing students with smaller group, more focused instruction in their area of need, and similar types of educational support. Students who continue to be unresponsive to treatment, determined by ongoing progress monitoring, are then provided with a third tier of interventions and further assessment. In some models of RTI, Tier 3 is considered to be special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053451212454005">Mellard &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although much has been written about RTI in the context of identifying students with LD, the literature that explores the use of RTI to identify students who are gifted is nascent at best (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212454005">Bianco, 2010</xref>). Proposed models of RTI are generally not suitable for the identification of giftedness, particularly at Tiers 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1053451212454005">Volker, Lopata, &amp; Cook-Cottone, 2006</xref>). For RTI to be efficacious for this purpose, it must go beyond the focus on below-grade-level performance and deficits and be reframed as a strengths-based approach. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212454005">Bianco (2010)</xref> suggested a model that seeks to identify students’ precocities as well as their areas of struggle. In this model, attention is paid to providing opportunities for students to develop, explore, and demonstrate interests, talents, and strengths. This is key in the identification of students’ advanced abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053451212454005">Gentry, 2009</xref>). Tier 2 of a strengths-based model includes provision of differentiated instruction and enrichment opportunities that target the gifted learner’s areas of need, both in terms of remediation and talent development. At Tier 3, more intensive interventions, such as intensive acceleration and individualized and/or special education services, are provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212454005">Bianco, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1053451212454005">
<title>RTI for Gifted Students With LD</title>
<p>Gifted students with LD were not well served under previous LD identification methods. The aptitude/achievement discrepancy model served to exclude many gifted students with a suspected LD from being identified and/or qualifying for special education services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212454005">Assouline et al., 2010</xref>). Their academic performance was often in the average range, thus not low enough to qualify for special education services. Additionally, their gifted abilities were masked by their LD, posing further problems for identifying and qualifying for gifted services. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212454005">Assouline et al. (2010)</xref>, gifted students with LD “were not only waiting to fail, they were failing to flourish” (p. 102). It is likely that RTI poses similar challenges for gifted students with LD. Consequently, RTI must be reconceptualized in a way that allows classroom teachers to address the complex needs of gifted students with LD. These issues are addressed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1053451212454005">
<title>Consider Anthony</title>
<p>Anthony is currently in fifth grade. His elementary teacher describes him as intense, energetic, and imaginative. He is an independent learner, often preferring unstructured, independent tasks to teacher-directed or cooperative group activities. He prefers finding solutions to problems independently and sometimes in unconventional ways. Teachers have noted that Anthony dislikes and resists most routine practice tasks such as math drills, spelling tests, handwriting practices, and copy tasks. Anthony has always loved school; however, his parents report that this year he is more reluctant to go to school in the mornings and frequently asks if he can stay home, insisting that he “already knows what they will teach him anyway.” Anthony is considered the class expert on all things related to astronomy and space exploration, his two areas of interest. His parents report that as early as 4 years of age, Anthony could be found in his room combing through his parents’ <italic>Scientific American</italic> magazine (see <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1053451212454005">Note 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, Anthony’s language arts and mathematics scores on standardized tests and classroom-based measures reflect grade-level achievement. He is a hard worker despite how easily he gets frustrated. Anthony’s creativity is often expressed in his writing and art; his essays and creative writing reflect his vivid imagination and attention to visual detail. His stories are elaborate but are marked by a lack of organization and numerous spelling and grammatical errors. Although Anthony enjoys math and has a very good grasp of mathematical concepts, he makes many careless computation errors, especially when he wants to finish his work too quickly. Anthony’s current grade-level performance actually reflects a decline in his academic abilities, since in earlier grades his academic skills were well above average.</p>
<p>Socially, Anthony has one good friend in the fifth grade and is generally accepted by his age-mate peers. Anthony’s friends enjoy looking at his drawings of new and improved spaceships that he has designed. However, although Anthony gets along well in class, problems emerge when he tries to dominate activities or when he becomes frustrated and argumentative with peers and adults. Whereas this problem has surfaced in the classroom and on the playground, it is most frequently observed during competitive activities. This can sometimes be a problem for Anthony, his friends, and his teachers.</p>
<p>Although RTI may hold promise for meeting the needs of gifted students with LD like Anthony, it is not without challenges. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053451212454005">National Association of State Directors of Special Education (NASDE; 2005)</xref>, Tier 1 is characterized as the core instructional program that delivers a scientifically validated curriculum to all students. Instruction is differentiated within the core to meet a broad range of students’ needs and skills. Furthermore, universal screening is central to Tier 1 to help identify each student’s level of proficiency, bring large percentages of students to acceptable levels of proficiency, and identify those students who “lag behind the group on critical measures of performance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053451212454005">NASDE, 2005</xref>, p. 23).</p>
<p>The first level of challenge for gifted students with LD occurs within Tier 1, in the core curriculum in the general education classroom. Gifted learners need additional opportunities to be challenged to continue to grow academically at a rate commensurate with their ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>). However, most gifted students, with or without LD, receive all or most of their education in the general education classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1053451212454005">Starko, 2008</xref>) with teachers who are not adequately prepared to meet their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212454005">Croft, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053451212454005">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1053451212454005">Starko, 2008</xref>). In fact, according to the State of the States in Gifted Education report 2006–2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451212454005">Council of State Directors of Programs for the Gifted &amp; the National Association for Gifted Children, n.d</xref>.), only four states require coursework in gifted education in initial teacher preparation programs. Without adequate training, it is unlikely that teachers feel adequately prepared to meet the needs of gifted students with LD like Anthony.</p>
<p>Despite the intent, without attention to students’ strengths, RTI functions on a deficit model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212454005">Bianco, 2010</xref>). Although the objective is to provide early intervention for students experiencing challenges in school, teachers and other school professionals continue to focus on students’ perceived deficits. For example, students are referred to as “nonresponders” or “Tier 3 students,” and new “separate” classes are being developed for these students. This may be the result of the recent and widespread practice of utilizing RTI as a means of identifying students with LD. Indeed, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212454005">2004</xref> reauthorization of the IDEA specifically endorses the use of an RTI model for this purpose. An additional area of concern about RTI models relates to the emphasis on academics. Student success is also contingent on having social-emotional needs met, but these are often unaddressed in an RTI framework. As with academic screenings, frequent probes or benchmark/baseline assessment of social and emotional functioning should occur so that issues in these areas can be supported early and effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>By design, RTI is meant to identify and provide early intervention to those students who lag behind their peers on predetermined grade-level benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053451212454005">Mellard &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>). Early intervention is critical for gifted students with LD as this can reduce frustration and prevent social-emotional and behavioral issues such as poor motivation, low self-esteem, discipline problems, and mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, that can easily develop without proper identification and intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454005">Brody &amp; Mills, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1053451212454005">Silverman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of the duality of their exceptionalities, gifted students with LD like Anthony may not be lagging behind their peers as evidenced by grade-level achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053451212454005">McCoach, Kehle, Bray, &amp; Siegle, 2001</xref>); however, despite functioning at grade level, they are not reaching their full potential. It takes a skilled teacher, one familiar with the characteristics of gifted learners, to recognize the gifted potential in a student who may be struggling in some areas, demonstrating talent in others, while managing to keep up with his peers.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section5-1053451212454005">
<title>Using RTI to Address Anthony’s Needs</title>
<p>Meeting Anthony’s needs, both in terms of his strengths and his weaknesses, within an RTI model clearly presents some challenges. The ways in which the dual exceptionalities interact render the identification of either one difficult. The child’s giftedness masks his or her LD, and the disabilities mask giftedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053451212454005">McCoach, Kehle, Bray, &amp; Siegle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>). If Anthony’s case is considered within the context of RTI, there are three potential outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section6-1053451212454005">
<title>Outcome 1</title>
<p>In the first scenario, benchmark data are examined and Anthony’s teacher observes that he is generally at or above grade level in all areas. Despite Anthony’s display of many characteristics of a gifted student with a LD, his teacher is unfamiliar with this and assumes he is a typical fifth-grade student. She does not consider him in need of Tier 2 intervention in any area. In this scenario, like many children who have an LD and are gifted, Anthony’s achievement scores may continue to decline over time due to the increasing impact of his LD on achievement and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053451212454005">McCoach et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212454005">2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053451212454005">Reis et al. (1997)</xref> observed that gifted children with reading disabilities tend to experience increasing academic difficulty as they progress from primary to intermediate and secondary grade levels. Due to more reading-intensive assignments, Anthony may begin to have more and more academic difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1053451212454005">Reis et al., 1997</xref>). He is liable to become frustrated, which may result in additional behavior problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>). As he moves on to secondary school, where reading for various content classes becomes more complex and abstract and where he is confronted with a variety of teachers, learning, and performance requirements, his academic performance and behavior are at high risk of declining even further. At that point, Anthony may finally be identified with an LD and receive some special education and related services. However, after struggling academically for so long, he may have lost confidence and become disengaged. Like other students who are disengaged and have an LD, Anthony is at high risk of dropping out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1053451212454005">Reschly &amp; Christenson, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1053451212454005">
<title>Outcome 2</title>
<p>The second scenario results in earlier identification of Anthony’s LD. Through grade-level progress monitoring, Anthony’s teacher notices some decline in his performance and motivation in school. In looking at Anthony’s school records and interviewing Anthony and his parents, she begins to notice that his decline in academic achievement and overall school motivation has occurred steadily over the past couple of years. Concerned about Anthony’s areas of weakness, his teacher contacts his parents, and Tier 2/targeted interventions are implemented in an effort to foster growth in areas of academic weakness. Targeted interventions are for students who are not making adequate academic progress, need additional academic challenge, or are struggling in the social-emotional arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>). Small-group counseling is also provided to address some of Anthony’s social and behavioral problems. Based on progress monitoring data, Tier 3 interventions are implemented as Anthony is slow to respond to the Tier 2 supports. Although some of his academic skills improve, he still struggles with boredom due to not being challenged in areas of precocity and with self-esteem as a result of his difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1053451212454005">
<title>Outcome 3</title>
<p>The third scenario, in which both of Anthony’s exceptionalities are recognized, is the optimal outcome for Anthony but it is unlikely to result using traditional RTI models. It is only via a strengths-based perspective that Anthony is apt to receive a dually differentiated curriculum in which all of his needs are met. Using a strengths-based model, Anthony’s teacher recognizes variations in her students’ readiness, interests, and learning styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>). Students in Anthony’s class are provided with multiple opportunities to explore, develop, and demonstrate all strengths, interests, and talents so that their full potentials can emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053451212454005">Gentry, 2009</xref>). There is a match between the instruction, curriculum, and services with students’ abilities, interests, and skills in the general education setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212454005">Brown &amp; Abernethy, 2009</xref>). In addition to focusing on students who lag behind, Tier 1 benchmark assessments are also used to identify those who have already mastered aspects of the grade-level content. Above-grade-level screening instruments are incorporated into screening practices to increase the utility of the RTI framework in the identification of gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212454005">Bianco, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212454005">Brown &amp; Abernethy, 2009</xref>). These data are used by Anthony’s teacher to identify those students who may need intensive strengths-based interventions. Identification and recognition of Anthony’ strengths prove helpful in terms of building his self-esteem and increasing motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454005">Brody &amp; Mills, 2004</xref>). Anthony’s teacher also examines patterns of Anthony’s achievement and academic performance longitudinally, which is an effective means to screen for and identify students who are gifted and have concomitant LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053451212454005">McCoach et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212454005">2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the data collected at Tier 1 to inform their development, Tier 2 targeted interventions are implemented. For example, differentiated instruction and enrichment opportunities are provided to Anthony within the core curriculum (at or above grade level) in greater depth or at an accelerated pace in those areas in which he excels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212454005">Coleman &amp; Hughes, 2009</xref>). A collaborative team effort between the classroom teacher and other school specialists, such as the special education teacher, school psychologist, and gifted specialist, is necessary to plan and develop a dually differentiated curriculum to address all of Anthony’s learning, needs, strengths, and challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212454005">Bianco, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212454005">Crepeau-Hobson &amp; Bianco, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to curriculum-based measures (CBMs), targeted assessment tools are used at Tier 2 to identify both Anthony’s strengths and processing deficits. These measures include observations of behavior, assessments of executive functioning and memory, and focused measures of assessment that better identify both academic precocity and weakness. These data are used in intervention development allowing for the consideration of processing deficits that might adversely impact Anthony’s academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212454005">Crepeau-Hobson &amp; Bianco, 2011</xref>).</p>
<list id="list1-1053451212454005" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Systematic interventions that address Anthony’s academic weaknesses as well as enrichment and/or accelerated opportunities in areas of strength are provided.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Small-group instruction that allows teachers to focus on individual needs, both in terms of deficits and strengths, are implemented. Groups allow an opportunity to develop higher order thinking, problem-solving skills, and research skills in one group while developing organizational and reading fluency skills in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Behavioral/social-emotional interventions are also implemented to address Anthony’s social needs and foster intrapersonal understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item></list>
<p>At Tier 3, to identify Anthony’ gifts, difficulties, and deficits, he receives a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, psycho-educational evaluation that includes assessment of basic psychological processes, cognitive ability, and achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212454005">Crepeau-Hobson &amp; Bianco, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053451212454005">Hale, Kaufman, Naglieri, &amp; Kavale, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1053451212454005">Volker et al., 2006</xref>), as well as evaluation of social-emotional functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1053451212454005">Trail, 2011</xref>). This comprehensive assessment utilizes test scores as well as interview data and observations and reveals that Anthony is truly a gifted student with an LD and differentiates him from peers who struggle for other reasons, such as lack of motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212454005">Brody &amp; Mills, 1997</xref>). The data from this comprehensive evaluation are then used to develop an individualized plan of services, supports, and interventions to both foster growth and ameliorate academic difficulties. As a result, Anthony has both an Advanced Learning Plan and an individualized education program (IEP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212454005">Crepeau-Hobson &amp; Bianco, 2011</xref>). In other words, when using a strength-based RTI model, gifted students with LD may receive more than one set of targeted Tier 2 or Tier 3 interventions: one set designed for helping them meet their accelerated learning needs and the other to support their learning needs due to their LD.</p>

<title>Implementing the Model in Practice</title>
<p>Planning tiered supports begins with a focus on the student’s strengths and interests. General education classroom teachers are encouraged to start the planning process by collaborating with the student, his or her family, the school’s gifted-and-talented coordinator, and the special education teacher. Similar to strength-based planning as outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454005">Bianco, Carothers, and Smiley (2009)</xref>, the problem-solving process should begin with the following questions:</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that developing special programs specifically for gifted students with LD is not always necessary. Existing school resources often can be modified so that appropriate services are provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454005">Brody &amp; Mills, 2004</xref>). An intervention program for Anthony includes grade-level instruction in those areas where Anthony is on grade level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454005">Brody &amp; Mills, 2004</xref>), opportunities to develop compensatory strategies, and remediation of his deficits in reading and spelling. To aid in the compensation for identified processing deficits, Anthony is afforded accommodations, such as access to a computer and extended time on standardized tests and assignments, to ensure success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454005">Brody &amp; Mills, 2004</xref>). In addition, because acceleration is an effective method for fostering growth in content areas of strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212454005">Colangelo, Assouline, &amp; Gross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1053451212454005">Rogers, 2002</xref>), Anthony also has opportunities for above-grade-level activities and curricula in areas of strength such as math and science. Inclusion in gifted programming enhances Anthony’s self-esteem, provides him with intellectual stimulation, helps keep him interested and engaged, and provides access to other gifted students.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications for Training and Practice</title>
<p>Meeting the needs of students who are both gifted and have LD poses a challenge to teachers and other school personnel. Traditional models of RTI may not be efficacious in this regard unless they include a strengths-based perspective. Focusing only on learning deficits and below-grade-level performance will undoubtedly leave gifted students with LD in the proverbial academic cold. Furthermore, teacher training programs devoid of attention to practices designed to identify areas of student proclivity will further hinder the identification the academic needs of these students.</p>
<p>The promise of RTI is meeting the educational needs of all students via early and frequent assessment of student achievement and progress. If this is approached with purposeful consideration of student strengths as well as their difficulties, students like Anthony are more likely to reach their full potential. The underidentification of gifted students, including those with concomitant LD, is likely related at least in part to inadequate teacher training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451212454005">Bianco, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212454005">Bianco &amp; Leech, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053451212454005">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1053451212454005">Silverman, 2003</xref>). Thus, teacher and related service provider preparation programs must emphasize the identification of strengths as well as weaknesses, both in general and within the context of RTI, when training future school personnel.</p>
<p>For RTI to be effective in identifying gifted students with LD, efforts must be made to use a strengths-based approach at all tiers. Assessment efforts should (a) include the use of multiple grade-level screening tools at Tier 1; (b) record reviews and targeted assessment that elucidates processing, academic, and social-emotional deficits as well as strengths at Tier 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212454005">Crepeau-Hobson &amp; Bianco, 2011</xref>); and (c) provide a comprehensive, multidisciplinary psycho-educational evaluation designed to tap the specific pattern of the student’s unique pattern of intellectual and academic strengths and weaknesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053451212454005">McCoach et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212454005">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1053451212454005">Volker et al., 2006</xref>). These assessment practices will allow the differentiation of varying learning needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1053451212454005">Semrud-Clikeman, 2005</xref>) and can inform educational and intervention planning and implementation and allow for the provision of a dually differentiated curriculum to meet these students’ complex educational needs.</p>
