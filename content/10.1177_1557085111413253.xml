<abstract>
<p>For a study of police women’s identities, qualitative data were generated from in-depth interviews with 21 women working in two metropolitan police departments and varying in race, ethnicity, rank, and tenure. Most women identified female-male differences but noted exceptions. Many felt characteristics concentrated among women enhanced job performance, and men’s characteristics damaged performance. Several insisted that sex-category differences in key attributes accounting for good police work were nonexistent or minimal. Women do not simply reproduce old female-male stereotypes and the hierarchies that devalue female-associated traits. They fashion complex, positive occupational identities that are not necessarily tied to their sex category.</p>

<body>
<p>There is considerable empirical evidence of a persisting belief that police work is an inappropriate job for women; this belief rests on the view that women and men have essentially different characteristics and that only men’s characteristics support effective police work. At the same time, in some police departments, individuals recognize a broadened range of qualities required for police officers to do their jobs well. In many sectors of society, there also is a shift away from the essentialist view that women’s characteristics and abilities on the job (or in other settings) are necessarily different from those of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1557085111413253">Risman, 2004</xref>). Women have now worked in policing for decades, and many have moved up the ranks even into the highest leadership positions. The re-visioning of police work and changing assumptions about women, which occur in at least some sectors of society, sparked our interest in how women employed as police officers for several years self-identify and go about doing their work. We wanted to know how they describe their identities and actions as women and as police officers.</p>
<p>Existing research does reveal persistent tendencies for the public and for some police officers to equate effective policing with crime fighting by a person with “masculine” capacities for “aggression, violence, danger, risk taking, and courageousness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085111413253">Franklin, 2005</xref>, p. 6; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1557085111413253">Heidensohn, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1557085111413253">Hunt, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1557085111413253">Prokos &amp; Padavic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1557085111413253">Young, 1991</xref>), or even “hypermasculinity” that “glorifies . . . aggression, independence, and dominance” (p. 14). Moreover, not specific to policing, in U.S. society, qualities associated with “maleness” (being agentic, assertive, rational, and instrumentally competent) are valued and associated with high status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557085111413253">Eagley, Wood, &amp; Diekman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557085111413253">Gerber, 2009</xref>). Alternatively, qualities associated with both “femaleness” and low status include expressiveness, communal orientation, and submissiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1557085111413253">Conway, Pissamiglio, &amp; Mount, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1557085111413253">Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, &amp; Xu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557085111413253">Gerber, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Along with evidence of the persistent association of masculinity and the assumed, valued attributes of men with policing, there is countervailing evidence of change. In some police organizations, shifts to community policing and away from authoritarian management may have expanded the qualities that police officers see as necessary to accomplish police work to include female-associated expressiveness and communal orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1557085111413253">Davies &amp; Thomas, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1557085111413253">Heidensohn, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1557085111413253">Miller, 1999</xref>; alternatively see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1557085111413253">Davies &amp; Thomas, 2003</xref>). Supporting this view, one study found that after the institution of community policing in two large agencies, regardless of their gender, most officers valued the “softer” forms of community policing as well as aggressive patrol work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1557085111413253">Paoline, Myers, &amp; Worden, 2000</xref>). Further suggesting changes in police departments, bureaucracies increasingly institute practices against reproducing gender distinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1557085111413253">Jackson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1557085111413253">Ridgeway, 2007</xref>). They favor treating employees as “workers” rather than “women” and “men.” Although implementation is uneven, police departments have affirmative action and antidiscrimination policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1557085111413253">Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557085111413253">Collins &amp; Vaughn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1557085111413253">Gottfredson, 1996</xref>). Perhaps due to such changes, women police officers interviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1557085111413253">Rabe-Hemp (2007)</xref> increasingly held high rank and/or jobs associated with stereotypes of masculinity (e.g., firearms instructors). Nearly all said that over time, organizational culture became more accepting of women and discrimination and harassment lessened (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1557085111413253">Miller, Forest, &amp; Jurik, 2003</xref> on gay and lesbian officers).</p>
<p>In light of the changing context of at least some U.S. police departments, the assignment of women to a growing range of police tasks, possible alterations in the attributes of police that are valued by themselves and the public, and broader shifts throughout society, we wanted to take a fresh look at how women police describe their identities. To guide the development of questions and interpretation of responses, we drew on the literatures on “doing gender,” occupational identity, and police.</p>
<sec id="section1-1557085111413253">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>In this section, we first review the literature emphasizing the various ways that people construct gender through their actions and interactions. Individuals may reproduce common stereotypes by <italic>doing traditional gender</italic>. They may <italic>redo gender</italic> by behaving in ways that produce a nonstereotypical version of gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1557085111413253">West &amp; Zimmerman, 2009</xref>). Or, if old gender norms are losing currency, they may <italic>undo gender</italic> by challenging “the essentialism of binary distinctions between people based on sex category” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1557085111413253">Risman, 2009</xref>, pp. 83-84).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1557085111413253">1</xref></sup> As a second topic in this section, we consider the literature on women working as police officers in relation to the broader literature on alternative ways to accomplish femininity. The review leads to our conclusion that prior research has not fully considered the possible variations in how women police see themselves and do their work. We designed our study to fill this gap.</p>

<title>Different Ways of Doing Gender</title>
<p>Feminist theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557085111413253">Connell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1557085111413253">West &amp; Fenstermaker, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1557085111413253">West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987</xref>) conceptualize gender not as a fixed role or identity but as a person’s actions and interactions that either reproduce or challenge common perceptions of the essential nature of being female or male. Many men in capitalistic Western societies construct <italic>hegemonic masculinity</italic>, which signifies acceptance of heterosexual men’s dominant position and the subordination of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557085111413253">Connell, 1995</xref>). Hegemonic masculinity would be consistent with stereotypes of police as men who are aggressive, strong, and assertive. Many women construct <italic>emphasized femininity</italic>, which complements hegemonic masculinity by embodying characteristics associated with traditional stereotypes of femininity (e.g., passivity, dependence, and fragility). Women construct emphasized femininity in part because others hold them accountable for acting in ways consistent with traits associated with the female sex category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1557085111413253">West &amp; Zimmerman, 2009</xref>). Negative reactions by coworkers, supervisors, or citizens desiring to maintain traditional gender arrangements may limit individuals’ willingness and resources to actively create new forms of femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1557085111413253">Connell, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1557085111413253">Ridgeway (2007)</xref> proposed a somewhat different conceptualization that takes into account both workplace and gender identities. In her view, both the work organization’s purpose and a worker’s position influence expectations about what a person will be like and how she or he will act on the job. Workplace-related identity is usually in the <italic>foreground</italic> “of individuals’ contextual definitions of who self and other are and what that implies in terms of behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1557085111413253">Ridgeway &amp; Correll, 2004</xref>, p. 516). Gender, a <italic>background identity</italic>, colors people’s sense of self and actions, but in work settings it is usually not the primary focus of what is happening on the job.</p>
<p>Although girls in tough neighborhoods and women employed as police or in other settings have very different contexts and status, the literature on girls provides useful examples of various identity solutions that involve redoing gender (i.e., nonstereotypical constructions). Girls in high-crime neighborhoods combine qualities commonly associated with being female with qualities usually associated with masculinity to accomplish gender through forms other than emphasized femininity. Some girl gang members dress, speak, and behave to produce an <italic>oppositional femininity</italic> incorporating characteristics of loyalty, bravery, and fighting ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1557085111413253">Hagadorn &amp; Devitt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1557085111413253">Jones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1557085111413253">Laidler &amp; Hunt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1557085111413253">Portillo, 1999</xref>). Girls in Philadelphia redid gender by switching between race- and gender-related community expectations of feminine respectability and the reality-based necessities to survive in tough communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1557085111413253">Jones, 2010</xref>, p. 154). Jones described this process as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>From this negotiation of overlapping and, at times, contradictory survival and gender projects emerges new forms of femininity that encourage and even allow girls to use physical aggression when appropriate without sacrificing any and all claims to a respectable feminine identity. (p. 155)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Police women similarly may feel no discontinuity when they combine their versions of femininity with the characteristics they associate with and enact as capable police officers.</p>
<p>In addition to acknowledging the various ways that individuals accomplish gender, theorists highlight the importance of recognizing that gender at all levels—individual identity, the organization, and social structure—has its effect in combination with other status markers, such as race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557085111413253">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111413253">hooks, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111413253">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1557085111413253">West &amp; Fenstermaker, 1995</xref>). In organizations, intersecting statuses affect women’s opportunities, disadvantages, and the expectations of them as well as their interactions with other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1557085111413253">Holvino, 2010</xref>). Relevant to our research, numerous studies of police departments reveal greater disadvantages of women than men who work as police (e.g., harassment, blocked opportunities) and for Black in contrast to White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557085111413253">Felknes &amp; Schroedel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1557085111413253">Haarr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1557085111413253">Haarr &amp; Morash, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1557085111413253">Martin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1557085111413253">Pogrebin, Dodge, &amp; Chatman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1557085111413253">Texeira, 2002</xref>). As identity depends partly on others’ reactions to the self and one’s experiences in varying contexts, differences across multiple statuses may influence identity. For example, in some Black communities, women are seen as more competent than men because they must take initiative and act effectively so that they and their families survive financially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557085111413253">Collins, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1557085111413253">Dugger, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1557085111413253">Jones, 2010</xref>). Also important, there is heterogeneity in gender beliefs and in identities within groups of women with the same race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1557085111413253">McCall, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1557085111413253">Deutsch (2007)</xref> criticized the body of literature on “doing gender” for its tendency to contribute to a “theory of gender persistence and the inevitability of inequality” (p. 106). Countering this tendency, she raised the possibility that the entry of women and men into nontraditional jobs and occupations, which would include policing, may affect the perception of difference between men and women rather than just reproducing assumed differences. Our study addresses Deutsch’s criticism by bringing data and analysis to bear on whether old stereotypes of women are consistently incorporated into police officers’ identities or alternatively whether these stereotypes are resisted, dismantled, replaced, or irrelevant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1557085111413253">
<title>Police Women</title>
<p>After women police first assumed responsibilities as patrol officers, in her important early study of how new recruits identified and did their jobs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1557085111413253">Martin (1980)</xref> portrayed the resolution of women’s conflicting gender and job expectations as a choice between dichotomous identities. Officers with what Martin called a <italic>PoliceWOMAN</italic> identity used less authoritarian approaches to police work and accepted a male-dominated work culture, restricted work assignments, and men’s protectiveness. Other officers accomplished the <italic>POLICEwoman</italic> identity by stressing overachievement, conformity to a male police subculture, and “doing masculinity,” for instance by refusing protection offered by male coworkers. Through their actions, <italic>PoliceWOMEN</italic> assumed emphasized femininity that reproduced stereotypical gender beliefs that women are passive, supportive, and emotional. In contrast, <italic>POLICEwomen</italic> enacted a form of masculinity.</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1557085111413253">Rabe-Hemp (2009</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1557085111413253">Martin &amp; Jurik, 2007</xref>) concluded that the notion that a person identifies with characteristics associated with either traditional femininity or masculinity may be an oversimplification. In a sample of 38 officers with 10 to 30 years of experience, women differentiated themselves from male police and “did” both gender and police work, as Rabe-Hemp put it, <italic>collaboratively</italic>. Most self-identified as doing traditional gender by showing empathy, using communication skills, and avoiding the use of force. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1557085111413253">Rabe-Hemp (2009)</xref>, even though the women believed they were effective, most attributed their effectiveness to stereotypical, devalued, feminine attributes. They used “community policing as a means of legitimizing feminine characteristics in police work” (p. 125). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1557085111413253">Rabe-Hemp (2009)</xref> interpreted women’s resistance to labels such as dyke and lesbian and their use of personal grooming techniques to highlight their physical attractiveness to men as efforts to overcome the characteristics of stereotypical masculinity embodied in the police role.</p>
<p>Though Rabe-Hemp acknowledged the possibility of new forms of femininity, she did not describe them. She noted that some women stressed masculine aspects of policing (“putting hands on,” “getting dirty,” and “scuffing up knees”), but she did not attribute such self-descriptions to new forms of femininity. She saw these “masculine” policing activities as indicators of the greater salience of police identity in comparison to gender identity and called for research on women who gave salience to their police identity. Viewing the reproduction of stereotypical feminine identity as prevalent in policing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1557085111413253">Rabe-Hemp (2009)</xref> concluded that in the future, women will be increasingly segregated and separated from “real police work.”</p>
<p>Presenting a different view than Rabe-Hemp but consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1557085111413253">Ridgeway (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1557085111413253">Moore (1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1557085111413253">Moore &amp; Kimmerling, 1995</xref>) found that Israeli police women’s occupational identity was more salient than their gender identity. Although men described themselves as highly masculine, and women described themselves as highly feminine, men and women working as police were equally likely to say they had the traits needed to do the job. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1557085111413253">Moore (1999)</xref> concluded, “[f]or women, there is no contrast between being feminine and being assertive, dominant, and analytical” (p. 65). Although this may mean that occupational identity trumps gender identity, there is an alternative interpretation. Possibly neither men nor women “did” traditional gender, but they “did” gender in some unique ways. In other words, they may have constructed gender in ways that did not reflect traditional dichotomous masculinity/femininity stereotypes.</p>
<p>Although women may often see themselves and act in ways that reproduce traditional gender arrangements, this is not always the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1557085111413253">Butler, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1557085111413253">Connell, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1557085111413253">Sasson-Levy &amp; Amram-Katz, 2007</xref>). There is a need for research that discovers and documents any unique ways that police identify and act as women. Moreover, the literature suggests that women and men police officers do not routinely devalue characteristics they associate with being female. Research on police, women in other occupations, and even on girls has suggested alternative ways that females may accomplish gender; the interviews and analysis described below focused on exploring these alternatives.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>As one of our interests was to study police women who differed in rank, we restricted the sample to women who had been employed as police for more than a few years, and therefore were eligible to be at middle and higher ranks. Thus the study did not include women who left policing soon after joining the force or who were in the earliest stages of their careers at the time of the interview. Consistent with feminist theory’s emphasis on intersections (e.g., gender combined with race, ethnicity, tenure in the department), we maximized demographic, rank, and tenure variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1557085111413253">Sprague, 2005</xref>, p. 41).</p>
<p>Snowball sampling began with Haarr asking several women police she knew to participate in an interview and to identify other women of differing races and ethnicities, levels of seniority, and ranks that she could invite to participate. Twenty-one women working in two police departments in one Southwestern U.S. metropolitan area took part in the study. They were not provided with any incentives for participation. The purposively selected sample included 8 White, 5 African American, 5 Latina, and 3 Asian women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1557085111413253">Table 1</xref>). Though not asked about their sexual orientation, four women revealed they were lesbians. As seniority and rank, which indicate position and power in an organization, affect women’s resources for doing gender and standpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1557085111413253">Sprague, 2005</xref>), we recruited participants with years of experience ranging from 6 to 31 and from different ranks (i.e., patrol officers, detectives, specialized positions, sergeants, lieutenants, commanders, and deputy chiefs).</p>

<p>Especially for Whites, more years in policing translated into being at a higher rank. African American women less often moved up in rank even with increased years on the force. Although Latinas had been employed for several years, none held higher ranking positions. Relatively new to police work, Asian women were concentrated in low ranks.</p>
<p>The study location, use of purposive sampling, and small sample size preclude generalizing beyond participants. Thus, we cannot draw conclusions about how race and ethnicity influenced women’s opportunities for promotion. However, the sample diversity made it possible to see if findings held across subgroups of women. The richness of the data allowed for developing a complex picture of how women viewed themselves and policing.</p>

<title>Interviews</title>
<p>Haarr conducted in-depth retrospective career-course interviews with each of the 21 women. She used feminist research methods to increase the reciprocity in relationships with study participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1557085111413253">Sprague, 2005</xref>, pp. 134-135). To increase women’s say in the interview experience, they specified the place and time where they felt most comfortable having the interview. Some interviews were held at the local police department, whereas others were at the researcher’s home or office. In addition, throughout the consent and interview process, an informal tone was maintained, and participants were encouraged to define what they wanted to present or not present about themselves, their career, and their workplace experiences.</p>
<p>Affirming women’s viewpoints as important, Haarr framed the research as an opportunity to share past and present experiences in policing. Also consistent with feminist methods, during the interviews, Haarr reflected on her standpoint on personal workplace challenges as an academic negotiating gender and as being several years into her career; this reflection helped her to hear, understand, empathize with, and encourage conversation about policewomen’s experiences and identities. Occasionally, she shared an experience similar to what was being shared with her, though she did this cautiously so as not to overly influence the emphasis that women placed on certain workplace experiences or redirect the conversation. For example, if a woman explained that it was challenging to juggle work and homelife, Haarr might agree that she also had experienced this challenge. When women described workplace experiences they found troubling or difficult, she affirmed their view (e.g., “Wow, that happened to you?”) and then asked how they handled the situation. In summary, consistent with feminist research methods, the interview was approached as a process of interaction between the interviewee and researcher, in which women were able to explain their experiences from their own standpoint and in their own words, but the interviewer also shared or empathized with women’s viewpoints. Also consistent with feminist methods, much of the section on findings presents women’s actual statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1557085111413253">Sprague, 2005</xref>, pp. 169-173).</p>
<p>The structured interview schedule of open-ended questions asked for detailed information about women’s identities and experiences from their entry into the training academy to their current positions and assignments. It covered three information domains: <italic>identity at work</italic> (e.g., fit of identity to the job and effect of the job on identity, what it means to be a woman, identity and expectations from others in the workplace), <italic>gender and racial/ethnic group solidarity at work</italic> (e.g., unity among officers, similarities and differences between subgroups of officers at work, and perceptions that women’s presence threatens male officers); and <italic>discrimination in police work</italic> (e.g., coworker questions about capabilities to do the job, overprotection or failure magnification by coworkers). Questions also asked women to describe current and past positions held and length of time on the police force. As the study concerned women’s subjective perceptions, the questions and follow-up probes allowed and encouraged participants to elaborate on their experiences. Interviews lasted from 1.5 to 3 hr, with most about 2 hr. Interviews were tape recorded with the participant’s consent and later transcribed verbatim for data analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1557085111413253">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>All transcribed interviews were loaded into NVivo software, which was then used to code themes and analyze the data. Morash and Haarr jointly undertook the process of coding themes, data analysis, and interpretation of findings. First, Morash identified and coded both general and specific themes in the data. Next, Haarr reviewed the coded themes and revised and recoded some of them, compared the themes across race-ethnicity and seniority levels, and provided interpretation of the data. Then, Morash reviewed the interpretations and cases with common themes, added alternative interpretation, and revised themes and interpretation. Finally, after discussion with Morash, Haarr revised the coded themes in keeping with the consensus interpretation, which was achieved in all cases. This approach, which did not involve calculations of intercoder reliability, is commonly recommended for establishing credibility of qualitative inductive analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1557085111413253">Elliott, Fischer, &amp; Rennie, 1999</xref>). To further establish credibility, we also searched for cases that contradicted initial conclusions. Contradictory findings were used to qualify and elaborate interpretations.</p>
<p>A key research goal was to move beyond assuming that women police are a homogeneous group by understanding and revealing that they “are themselves diverse in location in systems of organizing” within police departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1557085111413253">Sprague, 2005</xref>, p. 41). Thus, analysis identified differences between subgroups and unique cases in subgroups. When we found subgroup differences, for example, between racial/ethnic groups, we further analyzed the data to determine whether they were explained by rank or years on the force.</p>
<p>Findings are presented so that readers know characteristics for each woman quoted. We describe women as low in rank if they are sergeants, in specialized positions (e.g., recruiter, community action officer, detective, training officer), or patrol officers. High rank includes deputy chief, lieutenant, and commander. In addition, in the presentation of findings, a unique number is associated with each study participant. This makes it clear when the same women are quoted multiple times in the findings section. To maintain confidentiality, we present ranges for years of seniority and do not note specific job assignments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1557085111413253">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Analysis revealed a complex picture of whether and how women did gender in relation to their work. Even those who perceived essential gender differences qualified their description of the degree of difference. Many women valued the traits they associated with women and devalued those associated with “maleness.” Finally, there was evidence of women resisting stereotypes imposed on them by the department or individuals in it and of women feeling and acting as if gender was irrelevant to their work as police officers. We develop these themes below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1557085111413253">
<title>Perceived Essential Gender Differences</title>
<p>Most women (76.2% or 16 of 21) identified fundamental differences related to gender, and noted that women’s qualities were of value and/or men’s qualities were a hindrance in doing effective police work. However, 10 of these women additionally pointed out that at some point during or after training, gender did not differentiate police or lost significance to police work. Three women took the position that no essential differences distinguished women from men.</p>
<p>Women who attributed some traits to the inborn nature of women or men linked these differences to gender-associated roles and approaches to doing police work. One woman (African American, low rank, 30+ years, No. 6) thought women are “more compassionate because we’re mothers, and they’re fathers, and fathers to me don’t have the same compassion that mothers do.” Another officer similarly linked her capability on the job to “the mothering part of me”:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Same with dead babies or dead people, guys will be getting the numbers and making the phone calls and I’m like, is there someone in the car? Or, you know, maybe we can grab a cup of coffee. And that might be the mothering part of me, but I think of varied ways of how to help them, not just making a report. (White, low rank, 10 to 15 years, No. 20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Comparing women with men, an Asian woman elaborated “they’re very different. . . . women are definitely gonna communicate differently than men” (low rank, 10 to 15 years, No. 1). Offering a unique perspective, one Latina officer said that “by nature” women are “nosey” (low rank, 10 to 15 years, No. 17).</p>
<p>Some women who identified female-male officer differences qualified their comments by describing the divide as not absolute. This was the case for a woman who said that men characteristically used more physical force than women, but she had the strength needed “where you have to come through the door, and it’s a knock-down, drag-out, and you’re right in the middle of it” (White, low rank, 10 to 15 years, No. 19). In another example, an officer noted that not all men shared the flaw of having too much pride (Latina, low rank, 30+ years, No. 7). A final example of a study participant stating that differences between men and women were not absolute is an officer who pointed out that women’s tendency to prefer community policing was not totally “a female thing” because an assignment to a certain part of the city could influence a male or female officer’s preference for doing community policing (Asian, low rank, 10 to 15 years, No. 1).</p>
<p>Women’s view that traditional gender roles and attributes differentiated them from men had no clear relationship to years on the force. However, lower rank women (85%) were much more likely to essentialize gender differences and to describe themselves “doing” traditional gender. Also, the emphasis on gender role differences occurred most often for women of color (2 of 3 Asians, 4 of 5 Latinas, and 3 of 5 African Americans), who often linked “being a woman” to being a good wife and/or mother. Two Latinas further explained that their culture emphasizes women filling these roles. Only one White woman characterized womanness as fulfilling family roles. Describing the same switch of self-presentations that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1557085111413253">Jones (2010)</xref> found for girls who moved between peer and other contexts, one African American woman explained that being a woman meant being able to fulfill the different roles of mother, wife, and police officer. We interpret this comment as meaning that women would need a mix of characteristics to be all of these things. Indeed, other officers associated being a woman with a mixture of female stereotypic (compassionate, nurturing, emotional, empathic) and nonstereotypic (determined, dedicated, loyal, strong, confident) traits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1557085111413253">
<title>Redoing Gender: New Hierarchies of Differences</title>
<p>Even though they saw female-male distinctions, most (76.2%) study participants rejected the traditional hierarchy of valued “masculine” and devalued “feminine” characteristics. This finding was consistent across racial and ethnic groups as well as groups varying in seniority. However, higher rank women (37.5%) were more likely than those with lower rank (7.7%) to maintain that women’s character is a good fit with the actual demands for management in police work, for instance, the need to effectively develop staff.</p>
<p>Many women (61.9%) at some point during the interview expressed the view that men’s and women’s different natures made them equally effective on the job. For example, one officer explained how women and men could accomplish policing tasks equally well:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think they [female officers] are very similar to male officers. They do their job. They just handle it differently. They handle calls differently. Where maybe a male might use strength, I think a female might use strength up here [pointing to her head], you know and strength here [pointing to her mouth] by talking their way to solve a situation. (Latina, low rank, 10 to 15 years, No. 11).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several women (52.4%), including some who gave examples of gender-equivalence in job performance, also described female-related characteristics as making their job performance better than men’s performance. In our sample, this was most common for White (75%), Asian (66.7%), and Latina (60%) women but rare for African American women (20.0%). Women valued their greater abilities as communicators with citizens and coworkers as well as being “smarter” and more compassionate. One Latina (low rank, 30+ years, No. 7) and one White officer (low rank, 10 to 15 years, No. 19) described how women’s superior abilities affected job performance when police arrived on the scene of hostile encounters. Specifically, one of them (No. 19) said, for men, you have “this muscular officer coming through the door ready to arrest everybody who looks at him wrong.” In contrast, “the women come in and [say] just calm down . . . tell me what your problem is and let’s see if we can work this out.” She went on to clarify that the women’s approach was “best” with her comment, “The men are getting there.”</p>
<p>In explaining how women’s unique abilities enhance their capacity to do police work, study participants expanded their views of the job to a greater range of activities than the use of force and aggressive patrol. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1557085111413253">Miller (1999)</xref> noted, this expansion is highly consistent with the emphasis on community policing. One officer explained that women’s tendency to be “nosey” was valuable because knowing “about people’s business” helped to get to the root of a problem, which is “what law enforcement is about” (Latina, low rank, 10 to 15 years, No. 17). Another officer even more explicitly linked gender differences to the ability to do community policing,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think men tend to be a little bit more. . . . [incomplete thought in interview], especially in this profession, for example, you want to clean drugs off the streets, arrest them all. Well, that may not be the solution; the solution may be, let’s find the root of why there are drugs even present in this community. Let’s go talk to the business owners and talk to the community and get them to help. (Asian, low rank, 10 to 15 years, No. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some women in all racial and ethnic groups flipped the hierarchy of gender differences by devaluing “maleness” and pointing out its negative features. One said that although she had seen the same in a few women, many men had “huge egos,” “power and control issues,” and a tendency to be highly aggressive in their interactions with the public on calls for service (White, high rank, 10 to 15 years, No. 4). Another thought men were deficient because they lacked “female” traits; for men, “It’s so much of a strength issue, a bruteness” (White, low rank, 10 to 15 years, No. 19). In contrast, for women “it’s not only strength, it is compassion, listening, talking; it’s all these different things in women.” Three of the five African American study participants maintained that men tend to be macho and use their physical strength on the job to demonstrate their masculinity. Three Latinas also focused on how machismo and male pride define men and explain their regular use of physical strength in police work. Except for Asian women, though they used different words, women viewed men’s “machismo” and “pride” as barriers to good job performance, and they viewed women’s special skills as enhancements. The small sample size precludes strong inference about the difference for Asian women, but the emphasis on communalism and humility in many Asian cultures may explain why Asian women did not feel that men tended to be “macho.”</p>
<p>By placing value on some of the attributes associated with stereotypes of femininity, such as compassion, did women contribute to their own lesser status in the department? A few women did not see this as the case, because they felt that men agreed that these special qualities of women were valuable. One of these women said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think a lot of the younger guys and even some of the sergeants realize the importance of women in police work. We can do more things than people said, and I really think that we talk and tend to be better with the victims. . . . I think we have a very important niche because after everything is settled we can go ahead and have, at least most of us, we can go in and help the actual person or victim and explain things and be there to listen. (White, low rank, 10 to 15 years, No. 20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly another officer explained that male officers see “we can diffuse the situation more so than the guys” and that the men appreciated this (Asian, low rank, 6 to 8 years, No. 5).</p>
<p>Contradicting perceptions of appreciation of gender-linked qualities of women officers, one study participant (White, high rank, 10 to 15 years, No. 18) explained that the police organization failed to appreciate women officers’ special abilities to see things from the standpoint of a person assumed to be low status by virtue of being female. Our data cannot reveal the degree to which organizations and work groups supported women’s positive views of themselves. They do, however, suggest that it would be worthwhile to examine whether organization-wide appreciation of a range of skills and abilities affects job satisfaction and performance of officers with those capabilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1557085111413253">
<title>Undoing Gender</title>
<p>Of the fairly large proportion of women (71.4% or 15 of 21) who at some point in the interview pointed out that there were no or negligible gender differences between police, higher ranking women were slightly overrepresented (87.5% vs. 61.5%). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1557085111413253">Ridgeway and Correll’s (2004)</xref> conceptualization of gender as a <italic>background identity</italic> and workplace-related identity in the <italic>foreground</italic> while women were at work is consistent with our data. Nearly three quarters of the women thought that, at least at some times and places, neither sex categories nor gender affected how officers do their job and how well they do it. These women often acknowledged disagreement with officers who thought sex and gender were relevant to police work.</p>
<p>One woman with many years of experience exemplifies officers who “undid” gender. She attributed officers’ ability to handle child abuse and rape to qualities of empathy and interpersonal skills unconnected to the police officer’s sex or gender.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s still a very typecast job to some degree for a woman. We’ll have a girl in here ‘cause they do child abuse and rapes, and it’s an inappropriate typecast, because your gender is not an issue. There it’s your empathy and your ability to relate to people. (White, high rank, 30+ years, No. 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recognizing that other people would not agree, she added, “And I know most people think there’s like this huge difference between men and women in law enforcement and I really think it’s more about individuals than gender.”</p>
<p>Women separated job-relevant characteristics from both sex categories and gender. Emphasizing the salience of her occupational identity at work, though she certainly did not deny that she was a woman, one officer gave an example of this process,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t really think about women <italic>per se</italic> in law enforcement. I never considered myself a woman police officer . . . I think about myself as a police commander, a police lieutenant, police sergeant. I recognize that I’m a woman, I’ve never doubted that. I also recognize the fact that I individually feel that I work as hard as or harder than my counterparts, but I don’t put things in a balance of men and women. I’ve just never focused on that. (White, high rank, 17 to 20 years, No. 15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Providing an explanation of officers’ thinking alike, and in ways unrelated to sex or gender, one woman attributed it to their similar training, during which they were “broken down” and “rebuilt” (low rank, 17 to 20 years, No. 3). She said the training “stays with you forever.” White officers (7 or 88%) were especially likely to say they did not see gender or pay attention to gender in the workplace because male and female officers are equal, encounter the same things on the job, and act similarly. White women may see fewer effects of gender because they experience less inequality than minority women. This possibility is consistent with studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557085111413253">Bolton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1557085111413253">Hassell &amp; Brandl, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1557085111413253">Morash, Haarr, &amp; Gonyea, 2006</xref>) showing that minorities have more workplace problems in police departments than do Whites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1557085111413253">
<title>Resisting Impositions of Negative Identity</title>
<p>Women actively resisted organization-wide and individual coworker practices that challenged their complex and positive identities. Several of them (38%) described male coworkers who made it known that women were essentially the same as each other, less able than men, and therefore shared the same failings. Women individually and collectively resisted these externally imposed notions of their nature and their shortcomings. Half of the White women, though just 20% of African American women, described this pattern of resistance. In addition, a greater proportion of women with higher rank resisted sex stereotypical assumptions than those with lower rank (50% vs. 31%). Resisting externally imposed negative identity appeared to be most common for White and higher ranking women perhaps because they had more influence and status and had fewer workplace problems.</p>
<p>Exemplifying individual resistance to sex stereotypical assumptions, a high-ranking officer recalled that in response to a question about gender differences, an academy training officer immediately said, “physical strength” (White, 17 to 20 years, No. 15). She disagreed, saying in the interview, “I have several female officers [who I supervise] that probably could run fifteen blocks around the guys around here, and are very in tune with themselves, very athletic.”</p>
<p>Also rejecting essentialization of female-male differences, another high-ranking officer (White, 10 to 15 years, No. 4) recounted a situation when her supervisor and mentor saw fundamental differences between women and men working as police, ironically at the point that she received a top score on an examination for a very high position. He said he could no longer mentor her in the promotion process. Assuming homogeneity and support between all women, he told her to spend time with a female police administrator in another jurisdiction. She begrudgingly followed this advice. She described the experience,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[He said] I can only do so much for you ‘cause I don’t see the world the way you see the world. Blah, blah, blah. He said, “I’m gonna send you to Grand City [a nearby city police department] to hang out with Officer Jane Smith [pseudonym] for a couple of weeks.” Jane Smith walks on water; I mean I have guys in my department who think Jane Smith is the neatest thing since canned beer because they read about her in the press.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interviewer: Did you think him saying that you need a female mentor was odd?</p>
<p>Officer: I don’t want my gender to be an issue. I don’t want to play that female card. But I think a lot of men in many respects—unfortunately, my chief is pretty Neanderthal when it comes to women. He’s a lot better than some, but he’s not where he should be.</p>
<p>According to study participant No. 4, Officer Smith “didn’t share shit with me.” Offering herself as evidence that sex categories do not determine behavior, she said, “I don’t care if you’re male, female, green, African American. I don’t care. I’ll help anybody.”</p>
<p>In many police departments, officers undermine women as a group by constantly examining and questioning their performance, denigrating their work efforts, magnifying their failures, and assuming that one woman’s shortcomings indicate all women’s shortcomings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1557085111413253">Martin &amp; Jurik, 2007</xref>). Unrelated to rank, women in our study resisted men’s attempts to undermine women officers as a group. Five women—three with 10 to 15 years on the police force and two with 17 to 20 years on the force—reasoned and acted to resist male coworkers’ intense scrutiny of women and their related magnification of women’s failures. According to one of the high-ranking women (White, 17 to 20 years, No. 8), women officers in her department recognized the negative effects of this practice for all women, and put a stop to it. After several years, like other women, her “awareness” was “raised,” so that when a person says that a <italic>female officer</italic> has a failing, she angrily reacts, “[g]ender doesn’t have a place, because you wouldn’t say this <italic>male</italic> officer did so and so.” In the same vein, one Asian (No. 1) and one Latina officer (No. 11), both with low rank and 10 to 15 years on the police force, expressed frustration with men’s scrutiny of women’s performance, particularly women’s displays of emotion on the job. They rejected (and therefore resisted) men’s criticisms that women were overly emotional on the job by reasoning that men applied a “double standard” in such situations, labeling men’s displays of emotion on the job as a positive characteristic or overlooking such displays, but taking women’s emotionality as evidence they could not handle the job.</p>
<p>Three women—one Asian (No. 1) and two White (No. 19, No. 8)—focused on women’s solidarity in resisting the gendered organization. One of these women said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We have a real strong group of women around here that aren’t afraid to speak up and tell the men, and I think they [men] get very intimidated by that ‘cause we’re not, we don’t allow them to suppress us. We stand up for what we think is right. But the men are still, this is a man’s world, this is a man’s job and you can’t do it as well as we can. You’re not as strong as we are. That is their mentality. (White, 10 to 15 years, No. 19)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She believed that by “sticking together” women held the men’s negative labeling of women in check.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section13-1557085111413253">
<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Most of the diverse group of women we studied saw fundamental female-male differences, but they did not agree on what those differences were and they often qualified their perception of difference, noting tendencies instead of absolutes. Women did not just reproduce old stereotypes of femininity (or masculinity) but mixed what appeared to be individually selected characteristics, only some of which conformed to old sex stereotypes for men or women, in descriptions of themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1557085111413253">Moore (1999)</xref> documented a similar “mixing” for Israeli police, with women and men identifying gender-related traits but both groups believing they had the characteristics necessary to perform well on the job. Moreover, participants in our study devalued some of the characteristics they identified as common to men and valued those common to women. To protect and defend their sense of self, women recognized and individually or collectively resisted negative stereotyping and the creation of a sex divide by mentors and coworkers. The vast majority of women therefore accepted that women had some qualities traditionally associated with femininity at the same time that they valued and added to those qualities. The vast majority also recognized that their police work in some cases had nothing to do with gender or sex categories. Women did not either accept traditional gender stereotypes or revise them or note their lack of relevance to policing. Which of these approaches to gender they took instead depended on the context and the moment.</p>
<p>The results of other studies lend credibility to the finding that women value qualities they associated with being female as enabling them to do good police work. Women officers interviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1557085111413253">Davies and Thomas (2003)</xref> said they excelled at networking and effective management by virtue of their gender. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1557085111413253">Miller et al. (2003)</xref> documented that lesbian and gay police officers positively evaluated their unique capabilities to understand victims and other oppressed people. Notably, officers we studied seem to associate women’s capabilities in policing not just in the “soft” area of community policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1557085111413253">Miller, 1999</xref>) but across different settings that include violent confrontations and high-level management.</p>
<p>Several women who saw and valued unique aspects of “being a woman” simultaneously viewed key qualities of effective police officers as little or not at all connected to sex or gender. Women had identities as women in general, wives, mothers, police officers, and colleagues that collided and merged in different ways. They were not so much doing gender and doing policing collaboratively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1557085111413253">Rabe-Hemp, 2009</xref>). Rather, in their view, they were always “being women,” but they often found the sex distinctions and assumed associated differences between women and men irrelevant to their work or to assessments of themselves or their coworkers. They especially resisted attempts to highlight women’s inadequacies and attribute them to all women in the department. In so doing, the women rejected the hegemonic gender beliefs that men and women have very different characteristics and abilities and that men are more worthy of status and are more competent than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1557085111413253">Ridgeway &amp; Correll, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Because race, ethnicity, rank, and tenure in a department may influence women’s identities, we considered these variations in the analysis and noted them in findings. The few race and ethnic group differences that we found cannot be generalized beyond the group and location studied; and the small sample size of each group provides reason for future research to shed additional light on our findings. We cannot explain or further clarify the finding that unlike other racial and ethnic groups, African American women rarely described female-related characteristics that enhanced their job performance. Rank and years on the force did not explain this finding, and a careful review of the data did not suggest an alternative explanation. The finding may be peculiar to our data set. However, the data do provide evidence that some women consider their culture in describing their unique identities, as evidenced by the Latinas who emphasized family roles. This is another area deserving of more study.</p>
<p>That women of color and lower rank women were most likely to essentialize gender differences and to describe “doing” traditional gender highlights a need for further research on whether the association occurs more broadly than in our sample, and if it does, reasons for the association. A tendency to emphasize traditional sex and gender differences could account for women’s lower rank, if such tendencies lead others to view women as unable to handle higher rank assignments. Alternatively, women may not see their own capabilities to successfully accomplish higher ranking jobs or to mange such jobs with the demands of being a wife and mother in addition to being an officer.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that once women move up in rank, they become more aware of their multifaceted characteristics and capabilities. This may explain why higher ranking women more often described women’s greater abilities as communicators with citizens and coworkers and their greater intelligence and compassion on the job. Perhaps as a result of such views, they more often resisted sex stereotypical assumptions and organization-wide and coworker-imposed notions of women’s shortcomings. Higher rank may provide women position and information resources that give them a vantage point for seeing variation in officers’ capabilities and thereby appreciation that a great variety of personal characteristics “fit” with contemporary policing. Knowing whether and how women’s sense of self is connected to rank is essential information for designing training, promotion processes, and organizational supports (e.g., child care, shift arrangements) that produce representation of all racial/ethnic and gender groups at the various ranks of policing. A diverse higher management team is most likely to encourage a mix of needed capabilities in a workforce.</p>
<p>By focusing on women’s identities, we do not intend to obscure sexism, racism, or other oppressions and inequities that police experience in their departments. Indeed, the women’s narratives of resistance to protect and defend their complex positive identities provide a glimpse at some of the problems they confronted due to intersecting status markers. In our own future work and in research by others, it remains important to examine organization-wide perceptions that women’s (and racial and ethnic groups’) “selves” are deficient for doing good police work and to reveal whether and how officers’ contributions are therefore slowed down, stymied, or subverted. Research on the gendered police organization, which may be experienced differently by varying subgroups of women, could point to changes needed so that women do not need to defend identities that include job performance-enhancing qualities, such as compassion, alternative standpoints, and communication skills.</p>
