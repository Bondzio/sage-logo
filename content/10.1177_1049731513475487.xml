<abstract>
<p>Ronald Hughes, Judith Rycus, and their colleagues have produced a seminal review of differential response (DR) programs implemented across the nation. Their review questions nearly every aspect of the DR movement, beginning with the concept on which all DR programs are based and ending with serious concerns about the quality of evaluations conducted to date. Given current support for DR initiatives and wide variation of existing DR models, not all in the social sciences will agree with their conclusions. Nevertheless, this review represents the type of analysis critical to advancing practice in the field. Although many issues are raised in the Hughes et al. review, our response focuses on four critical points, which we believe represent the core problems identified. These include the concept that serves as the foundation for the DR movement, the role of assessments, and the primary problems with evaluations conducted to date.</p>

<body>
<p>“Issues in Differential Response” (2013) by Ronald Hughes and associates, is a thorough and insightful review of differential response (DR) programs in the United States. This is an important, compelling critique of an initiative that has enjoyed near universal support and has been adopted by child welfare agencies nationwide. Points made throughout their review raise serious concerns about nearly every aspect of the DR movement, ranging from its conceptual framework to the evaluations that support its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The National Council on Crime and Delinquency’s (NCCD) Children’s Research Center (CRC) would like to recognize the authors’ courage, integrity, and genuine concern for the child welfare field. The primary authors are internationally known experts with extensive experience in policy and program development, much of which was designed to improve practice through family engagement techniques. They have also championed the application of research findings and evidence-based programs to inform program development. It is never easy to critique a popular program, especially one that has enjoyed the level of support afforded DR, and CRC applauds the authors for taking on such a difficult task. Hughes et al. undoubtedly knew their review would evoke strong reactions from DR supporters. Therefore, such an endeavor required an exhaustive review of the literature; clear, thoughtful identification of major issues; and willingness to state conclusions in unambiguous terms. We at CRC believe they have achieved these objectives. It is our hope that child welfare professionals, regardless of their DR beliefs, will carefully consider the Hughes et al. study and use the information to strengthen future policy and program initiatives. The study represents the critical thinking needed to move the child welfare field forward. We thank the editor for the opportunity to respond to this review.</p>

<title>Review of Major Issues Identified</title>
<sec id="section2-1049731513475487">
<title>Potential Misallocation of Resources</title>
<p>Of all the issues raised in this review, we found four to be the most compelling. First, while DR programs vary greatly by jurisdiction, all are designed to provide enhanced services to families identified in various ways as low risk. Although differences in criteria used to define low risk are alone problematic, the idea of providing enhanced services to low-risk families when treatment resources are scarce presents a significant logical and ethical conundrum. Presumably, families assigned to DR are less likely than others to abuse or neglect their children in the future; or, depending which eligibility criteria are used, it is hypothesized that the level of subsequent maltreatment observed in low-risk families will not be as serious as that perpetrated by higher risk cases. To the extent this is true, even if DR programs proved successful, providing enhanced services to low-risk cases may represent a misallocation of resources. If these resources were instead allocated to high-risk families, they may produce even better results, providing greater protection to more vulnerable children.</p>
<p>There is little evidence that providing additional services to low-risk cases reduces future maltreatment. In fact, CRC research indicates that <italic>reducing</italic> services to low-risk families has no detrimental impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731513475487">Wagner &amp; Johnson, 1999</xref>). This same research demonstrates that targeting resources to high-risk families can significantly reduce rates of subsequent abuse and neglect.</p>
<p>Some of DR’s focus on low-risk families presumably stems from the belief that, if not provided assistance, these families’ risk levels will increase over time. Prevention is a worthy goal, but there is little evidence to suggest that most low-risk families progress to higher risk levels over time. Unquestionably, some will, but current NCCD research suggests most will not. Though early intervention may prevent some future maltreatment, available research indicates using scarce resources to assist high-risk families has a far greater effect. Knowing this, why would agencies pursue programs that increase resources provided to low-risk families? That is not to say these families do not need services, but there are opportunity costs involved. Unless resources are unlimited, every dollar spent on low-risk families represents a dollar that could assist families at high-risk levels. One could well conclude there is an ethical mandate to establish funding priorities that focus on children most at risk of future maltreatment and that DR programs, by design, do not conform to this mandate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049731513475487">
<title>The Cause and Effect Conundrum</title>
<p>Hughes et al. also cited myriad concerns with DR evaluations completed to date. One issue raised is central to the DR initiative’s fundamental purpose. DR programs are based on the premise that the current approach to child protection is too adversarial—that investigations are threatening and that concentrating on maltreatment allegations makes family engagement and service provision difficult. DR proponents hypothesize that a less adversarial approach concentrating on needs rather than maltreatment allegations will more successfully engage families without negatively affecting child safety.</p>
<p>This is an eminently testable concept. However, many DR programs complicate the issue by adding funding for services and resources—sometimes including basic living needs such as rent and appliances—that are not typically available to families in the traditional response (TR) track. In addition, DR workers often were provided more training and technical assistance than TR staff. This begs the question: if DR proved successful, is the success due to fundamental changes introduced with DR, or simply to increases in services and other resources? One could further argue that a corresponding increase in expectations should accompany increased resources, yet the overall goal for DR programs is simply to keep children as safe as they are in the TR track. It is rare to find evaluations where programs providing more services are expected only to maintain the status quo. Regardless, with these enhancements in place, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to determine precisely what was responsible if and when improvements in outcomes for DR cases were noted.</p>
<p>As Hughes et al. state, if the extra services provided to DR families resulted directly from savings in court costs or other requirements of TR no longer deemed necessary, the enhancements would be attributable directly to the change in strategies, and their inclusion would not be problematic. However, no such claim was made in any evaluation and the additional services were, in some instances, the direct result of funding provided by private foundations. Hence, instead of a level playing field on which the central premise of DR could be evaluated, DR programs were given resources not available to TR programs. Not only would these added services potentially affect outcomes, they would affect results of surveys of client and staff satisfaction as well. Under these circumstances, it would be surprising if families in DR programs—as well as DR staff—did not find DR more responsive to family needs.</p>
<p>It appears the efficacy of the DR strategy has not been established, even for low-risk families. We agree with the Hughes et al. study that claims of DR success go beyond what outcome data legitimately support.</p>

<sec id="section4-1049731513475487">
<title>No Clear Definition of Which Cases Should Be Eligible for DR Placement</title>
<p>The various methods used to determine which families are eligible for DR open the door for myriad unintended consequences. In general, DR targets families that are considered low risk. However, low risk is defined in a number of ways, either conflating immediate safety and longer term risk issues; or reflecting the severity of the allegation, the type of allegation (neglect or abuse), the source of the report, and/or case-specific factors, such as the age of the child. Even if valid risk instruments are used to assign cases to DR, there are instances where, in low-risk families, there are immediate and sometimes serious safety issues present. As the Hughes et al. study notes, if workers routinely accept the low-risk rating and concentrate only on building a helping relationship with the family, critical safety concerns could be overlooked:
<disp-quote>
<p>Inaccurate assessments of children’s safety and risk of further harm not only affect the accuracy of track assignments—they also affect all subsequent case decisions. This is of considerable concern in a dichotomous tracking system such as DR, where everyone expects that families determined to be at “high risk” will be tracked to investigation and “lower risk” families will be tracked to [alternative response]. Therefore, if the information gathered by the screener does not reach the threshold necessary to trigger an investigation, the family may automatically be perceived as “lower risk” and by inference, the children thought to be “safer” than those children referred for investigation. (Hughes et al., 2013, p. 9)</p>
</disp-quote> Data from California (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049731513475487">Figure 1</xref>) quantify the differences between risk and safety constructs. In families determined to be low risk (using a well-validated assessment instrument), approximately 31% had a safety concern identified that required an in-home safety plan. In about 2% of these cases, safety concerns resulted in removal of one or more children. To the extent that families deemed not to meet the threshold for an investigation leads to the conclusion that the children are “safe,” serious safety concerns may go unresolved. In essence, the concept of assigning families to different tracks based on risk turns the whole assessment process on its head. Traditionally, first contact with the family involves a safety assessment to determine if there are any immediate threats of harm present and to establish the severity of any identified threats. This, by definition, requires that workers ask about the allegation that prompted child protective services involvement, which, as several evaluations infer, is not always done with families in the DR track. Once immediate safety is ascertained, long-term risk is assessed. There is a strong correlation between safety and risk. However, while safety issues are less likely to be identified in low-risk families, they do occur with considerable frequency.</p>

</fig>
<p>Even greater potential for error occurs when assignments to DR are based on other factors, often used as proxies for risk. As noted earlier, these include the severity or type of allegation, the source of the report, and the age of the child. In such instances, it is not at all clear that cases assigned to DR are indeed low risk. CRC was recently asked to review one state’s policies for assigning cases to DR and found that new referral rates for these families actually exceeded those observed for TR families (18.6% vs. 16.8%). This finding suggests that, if risk is used to guide track assignments, agencies should use valid, research-based tools. Criteria such as those listed above are not equivalent to risk of future maltreatment. Hence, youth assigned to DR could, in some instances, be more vulnerable than those investigated and managed in the traditional fashion.</p>

<sec id="section5-1049731513475487">
<title>Finally, the Desire to Help Families Does Not Reduce the Value or Need for Comprehensive Assessments of Safety and Risk</title>
<p>The Hughes et al. study states:
<disp-quote>
<p> … the principles that underlie DR programming may prevent a thorough assessment of risk and safety from occurring in alternative tracks. DR’s stated preference that workers focus on family needs rather than incidents of maltreatment would clearly discourage practitioners from having the sometimes difficult conversations with families that are necessary to fully assess risk and to address safety concerns… . . If the specific factors, conditions, and dynamics that elevate risk in a family are not accurately identified and fully understood, it is significantly more difficult to provide relevant services to remediate these conditions to prevent maltreatment recurrences (Rycus &amp; Hughes, 1998). Caseworkers cannot help parents strengthen their protective capacities and reduce risk if the parents do not recognize or understand the safety threats operating in their family and how these are expressed. If workers do not know who was caring for a child when maltreatment occurred, or the circumstances of its occurrence, it is difficult to help families construct and implement safety plans to avoid similar situations in the future. (Hughes et al., 2013, p. 11)</p>
</disp-quote> This is a critical point with significant implications on casework practice, relevant to DR and TR approaches. The field needs to be cautious about deliberately or unintentionally creating cultures of “naive practice” in which workers focus solely on family strengths and protective capacities in the absence of danger, risk, and needs, or vice versa. Hughes et al. accurately state effective safety planning is only possible when caregivers and caseworkers engage in a balanced, thorough exploration of harm/potential harm, develop effective safety plans when needed, and continuously monitor compliance with safety plans.</p>
<p>Hughes et al. point out that some DR implementations include standardized, structured assessment tools. Historically, risk assessment has been criticized as being deficits based. As one component in a broader context of family assessment, risk assessment helps workers develop clarity amid the complexity of information available. Approaches that require both structured safety and research-based risk assessments—regardless of track assignment—may more effectively achieve balanced understanding of family situations; greater focus on how parental behavior affects child safety; and increased reliability and validity in decision making regarding the need for ongoing interventions.</p>

<sec id="section6-1049731513475487">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>The Hughes et al. study raises important issues, and its findings are compelling. This type of critical review is needed but is often lacking in the social sciences. Much can be learned from this and we anticipate that DR programs will use these findings to clarify and strengthen operations. Some jurisdictions have begun to review criteria used to identify families eligible for DR assignment. All should ensure that thorough assessments of safety and risk are completed on all families, regardless of track assignment. Additional research should focus on the conceptual basis of the DR approach to determine if a change in approaches is warranted or if DR represents a misallocation of resources better allocated to high-risk cases. In an era of evidence-based practice, no program should survive and flourish simply because it is viewed as a good idea.</p>
