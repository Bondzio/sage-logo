<body>
<p>Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder characterized by refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height, intense fear of gaining weight, and body image disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313481062">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Although AN affects a small percentage (0.3% to 0.9%) of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390313481062">Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, &amp; Kessler, 2007</xref>), it is the most lethal of all psychiatric illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313481062">Birmingham, Su, Hlynsky, Goldner, &amp; Gao, 2005</xref>). Treatment goals for AN include returning the client to an individualized expected weight for age and height, normalized eating behavior, and improved cognitions regarding weight, shape, and food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078390313481062">Mehler &amp; Andersen, 2010</xref>). The current literature reflects contradictory evidence on the ability of these individuals to accurately report body weight and height. Furthermore, it is currently unknown whether or not individuals weight-recovered from AN (remission from anorexia nervosa [RAN]) are able to correctly report their weight and height.</p>
<p>Self-report measurements of weight and height are often clinically used to calculate body mass index (BMI; kg/m<sup>2</sup>), a key assessment measure for persons with AN. Similarly, studies of eating disorders frequently rely on the accuracy of self-reported weight and height due to ease of collecting this information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313481062">McCabe, McFarlane, Polivy, &amp; Olmstead, 2001</xref>). However, the literature suggests contradictory findings. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313481062">McCabe et al. (2001)</xref>, individuals with AN were able to accurately report their weight. Nondieting control participants significantly underreported their weight. Both groups significantly overestimated their height. In a replication study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390313481062">Meyer, Arcelus, and Wright (2009)</xref> examined subjective and objective weight and height measurements in 39 individuals with AN. These participants tended to significantly overestimate their weight yet accurately predict their height leading to an overestimation of BMI. To date, there have been no studies on the accuracy of self-report of height and weight in persons following weight recovery from AN.</p>
<p>Accuracy of self-report of weight and height among healthy persons has been an area of previous investigation. In a study of 104 healthy women, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390313481062">Meyer, McPartlan, Sines, and Waller (2009)</xref> found that most individuals significantly underestimated weight and overestimated height, resulting in a significantly lower BMI than actual. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390313481062">Nakamura, Hoshino, Kodama, and Yamamoto (1999)</xref> also showed underestimation of weight in a study of 317 healthy adult women; however, unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390313481062">Meyer, McPartlan et al. (2009)</xref>, this latter study revealed significant underestimation of height. In a sample of 2,805 individuals from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390313481062">Conley and Boardman (2007)</xref> found that women between the ages of 18 and 24 years who overreported their weight by at least 5% were significantly more likely to exhibit disordered eating behaviors.</p>
<p>Although initial efforts have focused on the validity of self-report weight and height measurements in AN, and in healthy controls, little is known about this in individuals remitted or weight recovered following AN. This is potentially important in terms of assessment of recovery and risk for relapse in this vulnerable population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390313481062">Steinhausen, 2002</xref>). The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a difference in self-report versus objective measurements of body weight and height (and BMI) in individuals with weight-recovered AN (RAN), relative to those with active AN, and healthy controls.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1078390313481062">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Participants included individuals recruited for a parent study on the neurobiology of eating disorders. Subjects were recruited through media advertisements and from local outpatient eating disorder programs. Subjects were nonhospitalized women ranging in age from 18 to 45 years. Research diagnostic assessments (for the purpose of diagnosing current or past history of AN) were made by a trained interviewer using the Structured Clinical Interview for <italic>DSM-IV-TR Axis I</italic> disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390313481062">First, Gibbon, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 1996</xref>). Participants included women who currently met <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313481062">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) criteria for AN (<italic>n</italic> = 23), remitted AN (RAN; <italic>n</italic> = 45; defined as no longer meeting the criteria for <italic>DSM-IV</italic> AN for at least 6 months), and healthy controls (<italic>n</italic> = 71). Individuals in the AN and RAN groups had no history of current major depression and were not taking any medications for 6 months prior to study. The healthy control group had no history of a major <italic>DSM-IV Axis I</italic> psychiatric disorder (including eating disorders), nor were they engaged in current dieting behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1078390313481062">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Subjective weights and heights were obtained from participants via self-report during a telephone screening interview. Objective measures of weight and height were obtained by a registered nurse during an initial outpatient screening visit conducted at an NIH-funded General Clinical Research Center. Body weight was measured using a calibrated metabolic scale. Height measurements were collected in triplicate using a stadiometer and averaged. Subjective and objective BMI were calculated from the respective weights and heights (BMI = kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1078390313481062">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using PASW<sup>Â®</sup> software (SPSS/IBM, Chicago, IL). Results are reported as mean Â± standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic>). Descriptive statistics were calculated, including KolmogorovâSmirnov tests of normality. Variables not normally distributed were transformed prior to statistical analyses. Within-group differences were assessed by Studentâs paired <italic>t</italic> test or Wilcoxin signed rank test, with statistical significance set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, two-tailed, to account for multiple comparisons. Differences across the three subject groups were examined by analysis of variance or the KruskalâWallis test, with subsequent planned comparison of the RAN group to the AN and CON groups with the MannâWhitney <italic>U</italic> test. Statistical significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<sec id="section5-1078390313481062" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean age of participants was 23.2 Â± 4.0 (<italic>SD</italic>) years for the RAN group, 24.5 Â± 7.4 for the AN group, and 21.9 Â± 4.3 for the CON group, with the patient groups being slightly older than the CONs (<italic>H</italic>[2] = 6.157, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Subjective and objective weight, height, and corresponding BMI values are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078390313481062">Table 1</xref>. For the RAN and CON groups, self-reported subjective weight was significantly less than objective weight (<italic>t</italic> = 3.1[44], <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005; <italic>z</italic> = â4.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; respectively). For the AN group, subjective weight was not significantly different from objective weight (<italic>t</italic> = .39[22], <italic>p</italic> = <italic>n</italic>s). Similarly, the RAN and CON groups subjectively reported being taller than that observed with objective measures (<italic>z</italic> = â3.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <italic>t</italic> = â3.6[70], <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; respectively), whereas there were no such differences for the AN group (<italic>t</italic> = â.89[22], <italic>p</italic> = <italic>n</italic>s). The RAN and CON groups had lower BMI (when calculated using subjective measurements) compared with objectively calculated BMIs (<italic>t</italic> = 3.9[44], <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <italic>t</italic> = 5.8[70], <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study extends previous findings by examining subjective and objective weight, height, and BMI in persons with RAN. Results suggest that RAN individuals appear to be different in their underestimation of body weight in comparison with the AN group. Rather, they were not significantly different from their control counterparts. Underestimation of weight among controls is in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390313481062">Meyer , McPartlan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390313481062">Nakamura et al., 1999</xref>). The absence of differences in estimation of weight, height, and BMI between the RAN and CON groups may reflect the decreased preoccupation with body shape and weight that coincides with remission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390313481062">Clausen, 2004</xref>). This is consistent with findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313481062">Bachner-Melman, Zohar, and Ebstein (2006)</xref>, showing similar levels of body dissatisfaction, disordered eating, drive for thinness, and endorsement of the thin ideal among individuals recovered from AN compared with controls. Although these similarities suggest remission, findings point to the potential variability in self-report weight measures in persons with RAN as well as in healthy controls.</p>
<p>Findings of no significant difference between subjective and objective weight in the AN group support previously reported results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313481062">McCabe et al. (2001)</xref>. One possible explanation for accurate reporting of weight among persons with active AN, despite body image disturbance, is that these individuals may be engaged in more frequent monitoring of body weight as a means of control. Because of their preoccupation with weight and more frequent weight monitoring, they may have more accurate, objective measures to inform their subjective report. Findings, however, are in contrast to those observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390313481062">Meyer, Arcelus et al. (2009)</xref>, who showed overestimation of weight and, hence, overestimated BMI in persons with AN. Unlike these previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313481062">McCabe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390313481062">Meyer, Arcelus et al. 2009</xref>), the current study used a structured clinical interview to diagnose current and past history of AN and rule out co-occurring major psychiatric disorders. It is possible that differences reported in these earlier investigations may be related to studying individuals during acute illness, although both these previous studies focused on patients actively seeking treatment. Unlike these reports, the present investigation included a more heterogeneous sample that did not limit participation to those attending an eating disorders clinic, a group more likely to be seen in outpatient and primary care settings.</p>
<p>Limitations of the current study include the relatively small sample size of the comparison groups, although it is the first to compare accuracy of self-report measures following weight recovery from AN. Thus, findings should be replicated in a larger sample. Because of the study design, self-reports of height and weight were not collected on the same day as subjective measurements. Additionally, for the AN group, subjects with a BMI of &lt;15 were excluded due to potential medical instability. Thus, although not the primary focus of this study, the extent to which findings in the AN group can be generalized to a lower weight population remains unknown.</p>
<p>Although it appears that individuals with RAN have a different level of subjective assessment of weight and height compared with ANs, further study of change in body estimations over the course of remission needs to be examined in a larger sample. Furthermore, investigation of factors that mediate this change and its relationship to treatment interventions will be important to ascertain. Although the RAN group appears similar to controls in terms of level of weight and height estimations, other remaining residual characteristics of the disorder may have greater predictability of risk for relapse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1078390313481062">
<title>Clinical Implications</title>
<p>Clinicians see clients across the lifespan and may encounter individuals actively suffering with AN, RAN, as well as those practicing unhealthy or disordered eating behaviors. Through careful assessment of past medical and psychological problems, as well as a detailed history of eating behaviors, and previous weight fluctuations, clinicians are able to identify individuals with active and remitted eating disorders as well as those who are engaged in the associated high-risk behaviors (i.e., binge eating, purging, fasting). Although these symptoms are frequently underreported, expertise in client assessment and screening make nurses well positioned to recognize high-risk individuals and assist them in getting the appropriate health care for their eating related concerns.</p>
<p>The results of this study suggest that individuals with active AN accurately report their weight and height. This finding may seem counterintuitive to the common assumption that individuals with AN overestimate their weight as a component of the disordered thinking associated with their diagnosis. This accurate reflection of body weight may be indicative of excessive weight checking, which supports a preoccupation with body image and body dissatisfaction. Nurses caring for individuals with AN who give accurate self-reports of weight and height may want to specifically ascertain how often these clients are weighing themselves, how they perceive their current weight status, as well as questions regarding food intake and the use of compensatory behaviors (e.g., self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, fasting, and excessive exercise).</p>
<p>Results further suggest that individuals weight-recovered from AN underestimate their weight and overestimate their height, much like control group participants. This similarity, coupled with a BMI in the normal range, may lead the clinician to believe that remitted individuals are no longer preoccupied with their weight and, therefore, no longer at risk. However, that assumption could be inaccurate. AN is a complex and often debilitating condition characterized by relapse and chronicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313481062">Grilo, 2006</xref>). Thus, affected individuals, particularly during early stages of remission, may be in need of careful, ongoing monitoring to assist individuals in preventing relapse. Although weight control may be stable for individuals with remitted AN, the risk for ongoing disordered eating behaviors continues to be associated with the major psychological components of the illness including weight and shape concerns, internalization of a thin ideal and body image disturbance.</p>
<p>It is also important to consider the findings related to the healthy controls. The literature clearly highlights that healthy individuals are quite likely to underestimate their weight and overestimate their height leading to an underestimation of their true BMI. Although for many clients this may not be a tremendous concern, there are many patient populations where accurate body weight and BMI are critical. Additionally, even subtle changes in weight may be an early indication of a variety of other health-related concerns including possible depression, food insecurity, or other constitutional problems. In summary, reliance on self-reported weight and height may produce an inaccurate representation of health status and may mask the subtle changes indicative of potential impending problems.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Clinically, self-report of weight and height to calculate BMI among RAN individuals and healthy controls cannot be assumed to be accurate. Thus, objective measurements are important to assist clinicians in identifying weight fluctuations and associated trends in this population. Though individuals with AN tend to accurately report their height and weight, these measures should always be objectively determined as this information is used to inform clinical decisions and treatment interventions within this vulnerable population.</p>
