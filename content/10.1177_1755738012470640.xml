<p><italic>InnovAiT</italic> is produced on a 3 year cycle. However, many articles do not significantly go out of date in that time. This section of InnovAiT summarises articles from the previous cycle of InnovAiT that GPs and GPs in training might still find useful today.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1755738012470640"><title>Personality disorders</title>
<p><italic>Dr Cressida Amiel</italic></p>
<p><italic>InnovAiT</italic> 2010 3(4): 192–198</p>
<p>The term ‘personality’ refers to the enduring characteristics which influence the way a person thinks, feels or behaves in a wide variety of circumstances. A personality is deemed to be ‘disordered’ when it causes suffering to that person or to other people. The Department of Health estimates that 10–13% of the adult population has a personality disorder. This article presents an overview of current thinking with regards to the classification, diagnosis and treatment of these complex conditions.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1755738012470640"><title>Depression in the elderly</title>
<p><italic>Dr Emma Funnell</italic></p>
<p><italic>InnovAiT</italic> 2010 3(4): 199–208</p>
<p>Depression is the most common mental illness in the elderly, affecting an estimated 15% of the elderly population living in the community. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, poor quality of life and increased social dependence. Recognition of depression in this age group is poor. Treatment can also be difficult compared to younger patients, with increased prevalence of side effects of medication, polypharmacy and poor compliance. The role of the GP is crucial and this article looks at the risk factors, presentation and treatment options for depression in older people in primary care.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1755738012470640"><title>Depression and suicidal behaviour in children and adolescents</title>
<p><italic>Dr Matthew Hodes and Dr Julia Gledhill</italic></p>
<p><italic>InnovAiT</italic> 2010 3(4): 209–213</p>
<p>Although most GPs are accustomed to detecting and managing depression in adults, they are much less comfortable with managing depression in children and adolescents. This article provides an overview of the diagnosis and management of depression in these age groups, focusing on the primary care setting. It also discusses suicidal behaviour, which may be a symptom of depressive disorder but can also be indicative of other difficulties, and therapeutic interventions for suicidal behaviour.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1755738012470640"><title>Skin malignancy</title>
<p><italic>Dr Alice Shiner, Dr Dilnath Gurusinghe and Dr Katy Wallis</italic></p>
<p><italic>InnovAiT</italic> 2010 3(4): 215–224</p>
<p>Skin malignancies are extremely common with over 100 000 new cases diagnosed in the UK every year. Skin lesions may be a presenting complaint or identified as an incidental finding during consultation. This article presents an overview of different types of skin malignancy, the features to look for that might indicate malignancy when a patient presents with a skin lesion in primary care and the subsequent management of suspicious skin lesions.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1755738012470640"><title>Fatigue and lethargy in palliative care</title>
<p><italic>Dr Ken Morgan</italic></p>
<p><italic>InnovAiT</italic> 2010 3(4): 225–231</p>
<p>Fatigue is the most common symptom experienced by patients with chronic progressive illnesses such as cancer, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and multiple sclerosis. While it is normal to feel fatigue when the body or mind has been exerted, pathological fatigue is pervasive, may occur with little or no exertion and may not be relieved by sleep or rest. Fatigue has both physical and psychological components. It may manifest physically as a feeling of weakness or psychologically as mental tiredness, lack of motivation and reduced concentration. This article provides a strategy for GPs to manage fatigue in their patients receiving palliative care.</p>
