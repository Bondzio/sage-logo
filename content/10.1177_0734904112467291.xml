<abstract>
<p>Intumescent coatings, mainly composed of ammonium polyphosphate, pentaerythritol and melamine, are widely used in the field of fire protection of steel structures. The objective of this study was to investigate how the presence of two different inorganic fillers (titanium dioxide and mineral fibres) will affect the fire performance of an acrylic-based intumescent coating. In both cases, it was observed that the inorganic filler enabled improvement of the fire-protective behaviour of intumescent paints, maintaining their performance for a longer time. The mode of action was attributed to reinforcement of the char due to the presence of the fillers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Passive fire protection materials insulate steel structures from the effects of the high temperatures that can be generated in fire. They can be divided into two types, non-reactive, of which the most common types are boards and sprays, and reactive, of which intumescent coatings are the best example.</p>
<p>Intumescent coatings provide an appearance similar to that of a paint finish, and remain stable at ambient temperatures. However, in a fire situation, the increase in temperature causes a chemical reaction and the intumescent coating expands to many times its original thickness. This provides an insulating foam-like coating or ‘char’ that protects the substrate for a certain period of time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734904112467291">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734904112467291">3</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The intumescent coating is designed to insulate the steel and prevent its temperature from rising above a certain point, called the failure temperature (550°C is usually taken as the failure temperature of steel in cellulosic fires). The aim of the intumescent coatings is thus to extend as much as possible the time taken by the steel to reach this temperature.</p>
<p>The intumescence process is caused by the interaction of three components: a carbon source (polyols such as pentaerythritol), an acid source (such as ammonium polyphosphate (APP)) and a blowing agent (such as melamine). The above components are bound in a solvent- or water-borne polymeric binder. Other components can be added to improve the paint properties and to enable easy application or to achieve faster drying.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734904112467291">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Moreover, in most of the cases, inorganic fillers such as titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) or inorganic fibres are added to the formulation for various reasons. It has been demonstrated that APP is very reactive and can react with most of those inorganic fillers leading to thermally stable phosphates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734904112467291">5</xref>

<p>The objective of this study was thus to investigate how the presence of those fillers affects the properties of the intumescent protective char. In the first part, the use of inorganic fibres is investigated and in the second part, the use of TiO<sub>2</sub> is investigated.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>Raw materials were resins (Emultex DP 5457 from Synthomer for the polyvinyl acetate (PVA1-based systems or Mowilith DM230 from Celanese for PVA2-based systems) and intumescent additives (APP: Exolit AP422 supplied by Clariant, melamine (MEL) and pentaerythritol (PER) or dipentaerythritol (diPER) purchased from Aldrich and used as received without any further purification). The mineral fillers have been supplied by Lapinus (trade name Rockforce<sup>®</sup> MS603-Roxul<sup>®</sup>1000) for the mineral fibres (MFs) and by Huntsman for the TiO<sub>2</sub> (trade name TR92). Rockforce MS603-Roxul<sup>®</sup>1000 is a high quality engineered MF. Its chemical composition and physical properties are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734904112467291">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734904112467291">2</xref>, respectively. In Europe, Tioxide<sup>®</sup> TR92 pigment is the most widely used TiO<sub>2</sub> pigment. Its physical properties are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734904112467291">Table 3</xref>. Chlorinated paraffin (Cereclor 70) was used in PVA2-based systems.</p>

<p>The heat source is a radiator provided by Saint Gobain (France). The steel plates used are squares of 10 cm × 10 cm with a thickness of 5 mm. About 600 µm of dried intumescent coating is applied on the surface of the steel plate. A black coating, provided by Medtherm Corp. (Huntsville, AL), resistant to 800°C and having a constant emissivity of 0.92, is applied on the non-heated side of the steel plates. The constant emissivity of the backside of the plate allows accurate measurement of its surface temperature using an infrared pyrometer. The infrared pyrometer is positioned at a constant distance from the steel plate, and the beam is pointed on the centre of the plate. It detects the temperature on the non-heated face of the steel plate and registers the time/temperature curve on a computer. This test is used for comparison of the temperature profiles versus time. This small-scale test is very stable and repeatable. The whole system is placed into a box in order to avoid the effect of the fume cupboard reducing the convective and chimney effects.</p>

<p>The temperature profiles obtained at the interface show two parts: a first one where the temperature sharply increases until it reaches around 200°C and a second one where the temperature slowly increases up to around 300°C after 1800 s. During the first part, the intumescence develops to form a sufficiently high amount of char to protect the substrate leading to a slope break of the temperature profile. During the second step, the intumescent char is efficient enough to protect the material and the increase in temperature is relatively low.</p>
<p>Those results demonstrate that the temperature reached at the interface for the intumescent formulation containing the MFs is lower than the one obtained for the reference formulation. It thus demonstrates that the use of MFs in the intumescent coating enables improvement of its efficiency.</p>
<p>At 1 cm above the interface, the temperature profiles are different. At t &lt; 100–110 s, the temperature increases very rapidly and a peak is observed. During this step, the thermocouple is in the air; so measurement is not accurate and as a consequence, the data obtained during this step cannot be discussed. When the intumescent shield covers the thermocouple (t &gt; 110 s), the temperature increases slowly, similarly to the one obtained for the temperature measured at the interface. It is observed that the temperature reached for the reference formulation is lower when compared to the one for the coating including MFs. This can be explained by the fact that the use of fibres leads to a decrease in the expansion of the coatings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734904112467291">Figure 5</xref>) and thus, the amount of protective layer between the thermocouple and the heat source is lower and the temperature is higher.</p>

<p>Similar experiments have been carried out including 5% of fibres and the temperature profile measured at the interface is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734904112467291">Figure 6</xref>. Similarly to what observed for the formulation containing 2%, the use of fibres enables obtaining a better protection since the temperature measured at the interface between the coating and the substrate is lower for PVA1-MS603-5% compared to the reference during the whole of the experiment. Moreover, at t = 1400 s, a variation of the slope of the temperature curves is observed for the coating without fibres and thus, the temperature of the reference formulation increases faster. This effect could be attributed to the collapse of the intumescent char structure. It may thus be assumed that the use of fibres maintains the char integrity for a longer period. This effect is particularly important since the aim of intumescent coatings is to delay as much as possible the time for which the structural steel reaches its failure temperature.</p>

<title>Heat radiator test</title>
<p>In order to validate the positive effect of fibres when incorporated in intumescent coatings, the fire performance of PVA1-MS603 containing 5% of fibres has been evaluated using the heat radiator test. The temperature profiles obtained for the non-coated substrate, for the PVA-based formulation without fibres and with 5% of MS603 are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734904112467291">Figure 7</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The temperature profiles are similar to those obtained by cone calorimetry. That is to say that the curves can be divided into two steps, namely, a step corresponding to the development of the intumescent process where the temperature sharply increases up to around 210°C and then a second step where the intumescent shield plays its protective role and thus, where the temperature reaches a pseudo-steady state. When comparing the systems with and without fibres, it is clear that the fibres enable maintaining the char integrity for longer. Indeed, whereas for PVA1-MS603-5%, the temperature is stable up to 4000 s (&gt;1 h), the temperature on the backside of the PVA1-ref coated sample increases slowly between 1000 and 3600 s (at around 1°C/min) and then more rapidly (at around 3°C/min) up to 4000 s corresponding to the destruction of the protective layer.</p>
<p>The fire-protective behaviour of PVA-based intumescent paints with and without fibres has been investigated. It was demonstrated that better performance, in particular at long protection time, can be achieved using fibres in intumescent coating presumably because the fibres allow the char integrity to be maintained for longer.</p>

<title>Char morphology</title>
<p>The char morphology analysis has been performed on the PVA-MS603-5% formulation in order to better understand the mode of action of the fibres.</p>
<p>First, the virgin paint was analysed before heat treatment. The scanning electron microscopic (SEM) picture (back-scattered electron (BSE) image) of the formulation is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734904112467291">Figure 8</xref>. A ‘brighter’ BSE intensity correlates with greater average atomic number (Z) in the sample, and ‘dark’ areas have lower average Z. The fibres are observable on the pictures (bright grey) and their size is in the range of the data given in the datasheet of the fibre (Table 2 - 125 ± 25 µm). Moreover, an analysis has been carried out using wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) probe (not presented in this article) and confirms in the bright grey part the presence of Si, Al, Mg, Ca, K and O.</p>

<p>The intermediate grey part corresponds to the APP that is included in the formulation at high loading. It is also possible to observe that between the APP particles, some resin is present and enables maintaining the integrity of the paint. Finally, the larger dark grey regions are attributed to the presence of melamine.</p>
<p>Small pieces of paint (1 cm × 1 cm) were exposed to the heat radiator test and samples have been collected just after ignition (t<sub>1</sub>) and after 30 min (t<sub>2</sub>). In each case, the char layer exhibits a big bubble in the centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0734904112467291">Figure 9(a)</xref>). In order to perform the analysis, the char has been cut in its centre (black part in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0734904112467291">Figure 9(b)</xref>). The top and the bottom of the sample have then been analysed separately.</p>

<p>First of all, it appears that the char residue is mainly composed of phosphorus and carbon. The compositional maps corresponding to C present some black regions that do not correspond either to phosphorus-rich regions or to calcium-rich regions. These black regions of the C compositional maps are more or less spherical and could thus be attributed to open cells (no material). When comparing the analysis performed at t<sub>1</sub>, it can be noticed that the number of the cells is higher when the bottom is analysed. Thus, the porosity of the intumescent char is not homogeneous through the thickness of the char and the bottom of the char presents a higher porosity. This phenomenon has already been reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734904112467291">13</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>A gradient in the fibre content through the char can also be observed particularly at t<sub>2</sub>. Indeed, almost no Ca is detected at the bottom of the materials when a large region is analysed whereas when the top is analysed, Ca-rich regions can be observed. Ca is detected in regions where neither carbon nor phosphorus is detected. Thus, it can be assumed that those regions correspond to the presence of fibres. As a consequence, it can be reasonably assumed that the top of the char is richer in fibre content compared with the bottom. Moreover, the shape of the fibres is not maintained since more or less spherical Ca-rich regions are observed. So, modification of the fibres (such as its crystallinity) or its reaction with other component of the formulation (such as APP or its degradation products) during the heat treatment can be assumed.</p>
<p>Finally, it can be observed that regarding phosphorus compositional maps, in the char collected at the top of the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0734904112467291">Figures 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0734904112467291">13</xref>), some regions presenting a high amount of phosphorus are observed. Formation of calcium phosphate could be excluded since no correlation between Ca and P compositional maps are observed.</p>
<p>The fire-protective behaviour of PVA-based intumescent paints with and without fibres has been investigated. It is demonstrated that better performance, in particular over a long time period, can be achieved using fibres in intumescent coatings, presumably because fibres allow the char integrity to be maintained. It was also observed that the use of fibres limits the expansion, particularly when high loadings are used.</p>
<p>The analysis of the compositional maps of char demonstrates that a gradient in fibre content is observed (higher concentration on the top). Moreover, it also demonstrated that the fibres react and/or degrade, since their shape is not maintained after heat treatment.</p>

Whereas TiO<sub>2</sub> is relatively stable from ambient temperature to 800°C, APP degrades in two steps. The two degradation steps of APP were previously reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734904112467291">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734904112467291">17</xref></sup> The first step, which begins around 300°C, consists essentially of elimination of NH<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, leading to the formation of a highly cross-linked polyphosphoric acid, whereas the second step, at a temperature higher than 550°C, corresponds to polyphosphoric acid evaporation and/or dehydration to P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub> that sublimes. When TiO<sub>2</sub> is added to APP at a Ti/P ratio = 0.5 (corresponding to a weight ratio TiO<sub>2</sub>/APP around 20/80), the second step of degradation of the APP is sharply reduced.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Intumescent coatings are widely used as passive fire-protection materials to insulate steel structures. Whereas the basic ingredients of intumescent paints are composed of an acid source (such as APP), a carbon source (such as for example pentaerythritol or its dimer) and a blowing agent (such as for example melamine), inorganic fillers are usually added for various purposes. This study investigates the influence of two types of inorganic filler (MFs and TiO<sub>2</sub>) on the fire-protective behaviour of an intumescent coating. In both cases, the fire protection is improved when the fillers are added to the coating. Since APP is very reactive, it is suspected that at high temperature, the inorganic filler reacts with APP or with its degradation products leading to the formation of thermally stable phosphate species (such as TiP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> in the case of TiO<sub>2</sub>). It may thus reasonably be assumed that those species enable the char to maintain its integrity and thus, the protection lasts for a longer time compared to pure systems without inorganic fillers.</p>
