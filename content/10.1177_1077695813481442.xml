<title>Point</title>
<p>As a former journalist, I found Stephen B. Shepard’s book a wonderful and moving portrait of the old and new world of journalism. Shepard’s career has spanned literally the top tier of the print profession including stints as senior editor at <italic>Newsweek</italic>, editor of the <italic>Saturday Review</italic>, and editor-in-chief at <italic>BusinessWeek</italic>. He is also an academic presently serving as dean at the City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate School of Journalism. Shepard spent over twenty years at <italic>BusinessWeek</italic>—taking the prestigious magazine from “original stories and hard-hitting analysis” (p. 90) to “uncharted waters” in 1994 as an online publication (p. 174).</p>
<p>Shepard begins by sharing a very intimate look at his personal life and struggle to pursue his dream in life—to be a journalist rather than an engineer. He shares his fears and successes of childhood growing up in the Bronx, New York. Shepard’s openness is compelling and inspiring for students who may want to read about his journey and career path.</p>
<p>The book is divided into four parts taking the reader from “Foundation,” “The <italic>BusinessWeek</italic> Years,” and “CUNY: A New Journalism School for a New Era” to “The Quest for New Business Models.” Shepard shares his educational years, including a six-month training program at McGraw-Hill (p. 37) on “three old-line trade magazines,” that sealed the deal for his love of journalism. He talks about his first big league job as a reporter at the ripe age of twenty-six for <italic>BusinessWeek</italic> in 1966 (p. 39). On one assignment, Shepard discusses meeting Ralph Nader who was concerned about auto safety. The story was on General Motors and the need for social responsibility and big business.</p>
<p>Shepard also details the working environment explaining that women had a difficult time getting work in journalism. Shepard shares a letter one female colleague received in 1962 from a managing editor from the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have an open mind on all job applicants and do not have a company policy against hiring women reporters. However, if we have a choice between a male reporter and a woman reporter and both are equally qualified, we will hire the man. Our preference for men is based on our desire to develop promising news reporters into future news executives who will make a career with us; we have found through experience that women, because they marry and have children, are not as good prospects from a long-term career point of view. (p. 42)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Shepard recognized the talent and commitment of women he worked with and made it his mission to hire and promote women during his tenure as editor-in-chief at <italic>BusinessWeek</italic>.</p>
<p>During his first stint at <italic>BusinessWeek</italic> (he had two), Shepard covered the first Earth Day, the Union Carbide plant in West Virginia, and the long gasoline lines in the 1970s (p. 54).</p>
<p>Shepard then takes us to his time at the Columbia School of Journalism to help create the Walter Bagehot Fellowship Program in Economics and Business Journalism, which is now the Knight-Bagehot Program. There, Shepard worked for five years as a part-time adjunct faculty member and director of the program. He then got a call to work for <italic>Newsweek</italic> as an editor to cover business. One of the big cover stories was Shepard’s idea and was called “The Graying of America,” published in February 1977. Shepard realized that the birthrate in the United States had changed and that there would be “an aging population” (p. 68). It was soon after that the journalist was promoted to national editor, covering stories such as Jimmy Carter’s inauguration, the landslide election of Ronald Reagan, and John Lennon’s death in 1980. But perhaps it is Shepard’s role as editor-in-chief of <italic>BusinessWeek</italic> in the mid-1980s that puts everything in perspective and the change in journalism that is taking place. In his role as editor, Shepard chronicles the magazine’s successes in the beginning, taking in more than “$6 billion in revenue . . . and earning at least $l billion in operating profits” (p. 100).</p>
<p>The magazine continued to be competitive and covered stories about Japan threatening the U.S. economy; companies that had “slipped” and were losing steam—including Eastman Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, Levi Strauss, and Disney (p. 102); corruption at Allegheny International; the stock market crash of 1987; the decade of greed; China’s prison labor; Bankers Trust derivatives; and the implosions at Tyco, WorldCom, Adelphia, Quest, and Vivendi (p. 145). He also details the impact the global economy has and how this story prompted his world travels. A very moving portion of the book details Shepard’s visit to Berlin where he is told that a “chain-linked” area designates the location of Hitler’s bunker. That visit, Shepard stated, “stirred up in me. There were other signs of my Jewish awakening over the next months and years” (p. 156). It again reinforced Shepard’s heritage, his upbringing, and his dealing with childhood anxieties. I thought this personal perspective brought another dimension to the book and was beautifully written.</p>
<p>Shepard shifts to the impact of the Internet. He makes note that the digital revolution “had already started by the time I became editor-in-chief in 1984” (p. 159) when the department was called Information Processing. <italic>BusinessWeek</italic> soon went online, and Shepard says, “about 1.1 million people had registered to receive the publication” (p. 174). However, Shepard concludes, “the disadvantages were now obvious. There was no apparent way to make much money, no effective business model” (p. 175). By 2004, Shepard was on his way to his position at CUNY.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps the most profound change in journalism has been the extraordinary transformation wrought by social media. In my traditional world, journalism operated in a “vertical” mode; we content producers-print or broadcast-sent news, analysis and commentary to a passive audience. No longer. Journalism has become a “horizontal” medium in which users are part of a continuing process. . . . Journalism is now more decentralized, more participatory, more democratic, and more widely distributed than three of four years ago. (p. 293)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As I wrote this review, there were reports of staff layoffs, as <italic>Newsweek</italic> shifted to an online publication. Shepard’s history raises questions about the future of magazines. Professors and students will benefit from reading about his experiences.</p>
