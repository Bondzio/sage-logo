<p>The 2007 launch of the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) introduced a new mechanism of state security against the uncertainties of climate change. Proponents argue that increasing the ability of member-states to finance disaster recovery through catastrophe insurance mitigates the effects of increasingly frequent and intense hurricanes and thus contributes to climate change adaptation. In contrast, I offer a critical analysis of the CCRIF that draws out how it facilitates what I call the ‘financialization of disaster management’. The introduction of financial logics and techniques enables the state and capital to visualize a population’s self-organizing adaptive capacity as both a threat to state-based forms of order and a value that can be leveraged on capital markets as catastrophe risk. Leveraging enhances a state’s ability to repair its critical infrastructure and preemptively negate undesirable adaptations. The CCRIF blends risk pooling with parametric insurance techniques to turn the uncertainty surrounding a population’s immanent adaptability into catastrophe risks that can be leveraged to enhance state security and capital accumulation in an emergent environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The 2007 unveiling of the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) ushered in a new era of disaster management in the Caribbean. The CCRIF is a regional insurance facility that offers parametric insurance for 16 member-states. In brief, parametric insurance differs from traditional indemnity coverage in that it does not cover actual losses, but rather provides a predetermined amount of remuneration once a specific parameter, such as a hurricane’s wind speed, is met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero, 2010a</xref>). The CCRIF’s parametric coverage combines catastrophe modeling with regional risk pooling. Catastrophe models simulate the impact disaster events of varying magnitudes have on state revenue, which allows the CCRIF to project the probability of specific loss events and price member-states’ catastrophe risks accordingly. Pooling diversifies disaster risk portfolios at the regional scale, which lowers the cost of coverage for individual states and enables them to transfer their catastrophe risks to global financial markets through the World Bank and European reinsurers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0967010612438434">World Bank, 2007</xref>). The CCRIF’s innovative mixing of parametric insurance and risk pooling creates a new mechanism of disaster recovery financing that links governments with global reinsurance and capital markets around the problem of insuring critical infrastructure against catastrophic risks previously thought to be uninsurable.</p>
<p>However, Foucauldian analyses of risk and insurance suggest that the CCRIF’s efforts to identify, price, and transfer catastrophe risks are more than financial maneuvers that reveal the latent reality of catastrophe risks. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612438434">Aradau and Van Munster (2008</xref>: 24) argue, ‘identifying the future as bearing catastrophic risk is ... linked with visions of order and ways to constitute and reproduce it’. From this perspective, risk is conceptualized as a <italic>dispositif</italic> for governing social problems, an assemblage of institutions, bodies of scientific knowledge, calculatory practices, and underlying rationalities of security that render uncertain futures amenable to intervention, manipulation, and management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0967010612438434">Aradau and Van Munster, 2007</xref>). <italic>Dispositifs</italic> of risk are an essential component of liberal government, which trades on the tensions between freedom and security to shape the ‘conduct of conduct’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0967010612438434">Foucault, 1991</xref>). Risk techniques such as statistics disclose uncertain futures in terms of more or less probable events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0967010612438434">Foucault, 2007</xref>). In ‘giving certain familiar events a kind of reality which alters their nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0967010612438434">Ewald, 1991</xref>: 200), risk provides a roadmap for action designed to ensure the growth, development, and security of the liberal subject’s indeterminate life. Security here is a biopolitical problem of the protection and betterment of a population’s essential life processes in an indeterminate world, rather than a geopolitical matter of prevention and exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0967010612438434">Dillon, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>What constitutes ‘risk’ and ‘uncertainty’ changes as liberal government reflexively problematizes the amount and kind of government exercised over external domains such as the economy and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612438434">O’Malley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0967010612438434">Dean, 2004</xref>). From this perspective, catastrophe risks associated with, inter alia, climate change, terrorism, and global pandemics are less symptoms of modernization run amok than ordering principles of a <italic>dispositif</italic> of ‘precautionary risk’ that is a central component of neoliberal order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612438434">Aradau and Van Munster, 2008</xref>). I follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612438434">Cooper (2008)</xref> in defining neoliberalism not in terms of commoditization but rather in terms of financialization. Financialization is a cultural as much as an economic process: it seeks to inscribe a normative rationality of ‘living with risk’ that treats risk as both threat and opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0967010612438434">Martin, 2002</xref>). A <italic>dispositif</italic> of precautionary risk inculcates a new disposition towards uncertain futures, the belief that a catastrophic future is both imminent and must be avoided by action in the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612438434">Aradau and Van Munster, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this light, we can analyze the CCRIF as a biopolitical innovation in the government of emergent life that reconfigures established risk management techniques, specifically parametric insurance and risk pooling, through rationalities of threat and security that circulate within a wider <italic>dispositif</italic> of precautionary risk. It rearticulates the relations between insurance, the state, and global financial markets around a biopolitical problematic of security in a potentially catastrophic environment. The CCRIF’s economy of biopolitical security is my focus in this article: how and to what effect does the CCIRF’s catastrophe insurance govern the socio-ecological contingency of disasters? I argue that the CCRIF facilitates what I call the <italic>financialization of disaster management</italic>. Such a process reorganizes disaster management around the imperatives of financial speculation, which imagines uncertain futures in a way that secures and makes the present profitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0967010612438434">de Goede, 2008</xref>). It does so through a process of appropriation and accumulation that transforms environmental insecurities into catastrophe risks that states leverage on financial markets to increase their adaptive capacity, or their ability to act within the socio-ecological emergency of a disaster. Financialized disaster management is not preoccupied with reducing a population’s existing vulnerabilities; instead, it speculatively envisions and acts against potential threats disasters pose to capitalist order.</p>
<p>Key here is how the CCIRF’s parametric coverage allows states to preemptively negate a threatening future through territorial and calculatory techniques of catastrophe modeling that quantify, value, and commodify adaptive capacity as catastrophe risk. The CCRIF’s mobilization of preemptive techniques modifies conventional deployments of preemption, which involve a set of practices for envisioning and acting on an uncertain future, by inciting threats to materialize as risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0967010612438434">Massumi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0967010612438434">Anderson, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0967010612438434">1</xref></sup> As a technique of financialized disaster management, preemption turns threats that undesirable adaptations pose to global neoliberal order, such as undocumented migration after a disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0967010612438434">Mullings et al., 2010</xref>), into an untapped reservoir of capital that is leveraged for both state security and accumulation in an emergent environment.</p>
<p>This article explores how the CCRIF utilizes and reconfigures techniques of risk and uncertainty to secure neoliberal order in an uncertain environment. It draws both on archival research and on interviews conducted on disaster management and climate change adaptation in Kingston, Jamaica, between June and December 2009. The first section reviews the history of the Caribbean’s exclusion from global reinsurance markets. The next unpacks the security rationalities that motivated the CCRIF’s creation. The two sections that follow examine the CCRIF’s risk pooling and catastrophe modeling techniques, respectively. I then identify and analyze the financialization of disaster management in the Caribbean and its biopolitical effects. A brief conclusion considers the implications of this analysis for future research.</p>

<title>Insurance in the Caribbean: A history of financial exclusion</title>
<p>Foucauldian analyses of risk and insurance have detailed how insurance is a biopolitical technology comprised of a set of techniques and rationalities deployed to measure, commodify, and manage uncertain life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero, 2010a</xref>). Historically, it has operated through what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0967010612438434">Collier (2008)</xref> calls ‘actuarial-statistical’ modes of knowledge, which calculate and project risks as probabilities based on the occurrence and distribution of past events. Through actuarial-statistical practices, insurance turns chance events into regularities at the level of the population; in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0967010612438434">Ewald’s (1991</xref>: 200) phrasing, it ‘constitutes a certain type of objectivity, giving certain familiar events a kind of reality which alters their nature’. For this reason, certain risk analysts, most famously Ulrich Beck in his ‘risk society’ thesis, declared catastrophic non-linear events such as environmental change and terrorism uninsurable. However, sympathetic critiques have drawn attention to the ways in which insurers deploy a variety of calculatory techniques that exceed the predictive logic of actuarialism to convert radical uncertainties into insurable risks (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0967010612438434">Bougen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0967010612438434">Ericson and Doyle, 2004</xref>). ‘Enactment-based’ forms of knowledge quantify and value catastrophe risks through simulating multiple possible futures rather than extrapolating the future from the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0967010612438434">Collier, 2008</xref>). A host of new catastrophe insurance and risk management practices are emerging on the backs of these techniques, including weather derivatives, catastrophe bonds, and parametric schemes such as the CCRIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>Rather than an immutable boundary between insurable and uninsurable risks, the history of insurance involves a constant tension between how the indeterminacy of life is envisioned as an uncertain future and the various calculatory practices that seek to objectively represent this uncertainty as risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero, 2010a</xref>). This tension drove the emergence of risk pooling schemes in the Caribbean that presaged the CCRIF. Insurance has historically had limited penetration in Caribbean markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0967010612438434">Pollner, 2001</xref>), owing in large part to the limits of actuarial-statistical insurance techniques. The region’s ‘financial exclusion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0967010612438434">Leyshon and Thrift, 1995</xref>) from global reinsurance markets is documented in two reports from the mid-1990s prepared by Dennis Lalor, chairman of the Insurance Company of the West Indies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0967010612438434">2</xref></sup> Reinsurance is essentially insurance for insurers; it covers the risk of catastrophic losses to insurers’ portfolios. Reinsurance firms have historically been loath to invest in the Caribbean, since the region’s relatively small economies offer limited business that comes with considerable catastrophic risk. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0967010612438434">Lalor (1994</xref>: 7–8) notes that although Munich Re, one of the world’s largest reinsurers, received 0.3% of its total premium income from Caribbean business in 1994, the region was one of ‘the five largest liability scenarios’ in its portfolio. Indeed, over the period 1967–92, Munich Re’s investments in the region resulted in losses of 27%. Moreover, from 1983 to 1992, its losses were 38%, indicating the increasingly negative impact of more frequent disasters in the Caribbean on reinsurers’ bottom lines. The Caribbean market is not profitable enough for reinsurers to expand business in the region, especially with much larger US markets nearby. As a result, ‘in view of the relative sizes of the markets, and the pay back potentials, [reinsurers’] available capacity is inevitably allocated to the US market at the expense of the islands’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612438434">Lalor, 1996</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>With limited reinsurance, undercapitalized Caribbean insurers have difficulty building catastrophe reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0967010612438434">Pollner, 2001</xref>). A solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612438434">Lalor (1996</xref>: 5) proposes is the creation of a regional pool. Three characteristics stand out. First, the regional pool is a geographic solution to the problem of financial exclusion. It is a rescaling strategy to overcome the limitations of national-scale insurance markets, specifically the inability of national markets to create catastrophe reserves. The basic premise is that insurance companies throughout the region pay premiums into the pool in order to build its capital reserves. This creates a self-sustaining catastrophe fund for Caribbean insurance companies that diversifies each company’s risks throughout the region. Second, the goal of risk pooling here is to enable insurers to expand their portfolios and increase profitability by providing insurers with additional underwriting capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612438434">Lalor, 1996</xref>: 24). Third, this rescaling of reinsurance markets reorganizes relations between insurance companies, multilateral institutions, and Caribbean governments. Lalor acknowledges that governments may have to make an initial contribution to the pool to provide start-up reserves. Additionally, during the pool’s first years, he envisions that it may have to establish a line of credit with multilateral institutions until its reserves are sufficient enough to cover probable catastrophic losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612438434">Lalor, 1996</xref>: 23). Reinsurers are largely left out of the picture, because ‘the result of retroceding too much of [the pool’s] portfolio would likely invalidate much of the benefits of establishing a pool’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612438434">Lalor, 1996</xref>: 25).</p>
<p>While Lalor’s reports do not include specific plans, they signal an insurance imaginary that underwrites the CCRIF’s risk pooling techniques. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero (2010b)</xref> argues that the development and adoption of catastrophe insurance as an environmental risk management tool in non-Western states is conditioned by what he calls a ‘global insurance imaginary’ that positions insurance as an essential tool for climate change adaptation. Consistent with a precautionary <italic>dispositif</italic> of risk outlined above, the ‘life’ to be secured in discourses of climate catastrophe is envisioned in terms of interconnection, unpredictability, and emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612438434">Grove, 2010</xref>). This is a culturally specific understanding derived from the adoption of complex systems theory in Western political economy and the life sciences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612438434">Cooper, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612438434">Dillon and Reid, 2009</xref>). The global insurance imaginary enables ‘the globalisation of a rationality of governing uncertainty through insurance [that] aligns “other” non-Western ways of being in the world with a Western financial capitalist rationality of governance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero, 2010b</xref>: 241).</p>
<p>From this perspective, risk pooling emerged through a unique variant of this global insurance imaginary that advocates risk pooling as a climate change adaptation strategy for insurers that can overcome the region’s history of financial exclusion. The next section details how this imaginary articulates with contextually specific visions of state security to position the CCRIF as a way to access untapped sources of disaster financing and thus secure states against the effects of climate change.</p>

<title>Premediating disaster: Visions of state security in an emergent environment</title>
<p>Lalor’s design for a regional risk pool languished off the radar until 2004’s Hurricane Ivan. Ivan scored a glancing blow on Jamaica, causing losses of US$549 million, roughly 8% of the country’s GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612438434">ECLAC, 2004</xref>). The bullet Jamaica dodged hit Grenada head on. Ivan passed directly over the island; its US$2.4 billion in damages was more than twice the country’s GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612438434">ECLAC, 2004</xref>). A program officer in the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) summarized the storm’s impact for me: ‘the country was just completely decimated; they lost 200% of their GDP in one night. <italic>For a while the state itself ceased to exist</italic>, it was housed on a British ship trying to get things together’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0967010612438434">3</xref></sup> The Grenadian state’s existence was compromised not just by the havoc Ivan wreaked on state infrastructure. The storm’s economic impact created a so-called liquidity gap that financially crippled the government, which had no access to capital and had to delay relief and recovery efforts for weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0967010612438434">CCRIF, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Grenada’s experience spurred government leaders and World Bank officials to reconsider the state-security implications of the region’s financial exclusion. Its inability to access disaster recovery financing compounded the precarious political-economic position of Caribbean states in the global neoliberal order. The end of the Cold War brought with it the end of preferential trade agreements with the USA and its Western allies, who had promoted capitalist development in the region as a bulwark against the spread of communism in the USA’s ‘backyard’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0967010612438434">Klak, 2009</xref>). With the communist threat vanquished, the West saw the economic connections forged by multilateral agreements such as America’s Caribbean Basin Initiative, the European Commission’s Lomé Convention and the Caribbean–Canada Trade Agreement as sources of threat and insecurity, especially as Caribbean ports became vital nodes in transnational drug-trafficking networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0967010612438434">Griffith, 2008</xref>). Additionally, the mid-1990s creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and contemporaneous World Trade Organization rulings undermined the preferential treatment that those trade deals afforded Caribbean manufacturers and farmers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0967010612438434">Black and Kincaid, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The region’s growing dependence on international trade and increasing difficulty accessing investment capital and Western markets made Caribbean leaders sensitive to issues that negatively affect macroeconomic stability. Crime and organized violence associated with social inequality and the drug trade have traditionally been the main concerns (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0967010612438434">UNODC/World Bank, 2007</xref>). Such reasoning gives a Caribbean flavor to the ‘failed states’ discourse that dominated Western states’ post-Cold War security concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612438434">Duffield, 2001</xref>). According to this discourse, crime, violence, and disorder are symptoms of failing or failed states that lack the infrastructural and institutional capacities to manage their populations in ways consistent with the norms of liberal capitalist order. The danger is that underdeveloped populations will create shadow economies of globalization, such as the transnational drug trade, that creatively utilize the physical and cybernetic infrastructure created through neoliberal development to support non-liberal modes of collective life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612438434">Duffield, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Jamaica’s Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller took this one step further in her Presidential Address at the 2006 meeting of the Caribbean Development Bank’s Board of Governors. After recognizing that globalization directs investments to regions with political and economic stability, she then argued that the Caribbean’s vulnerability to natural disasters was one of ‘several undesirable factors’ that contributed to the region’s marginal standing in the global economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612438434">Simpson-Miller, 2006</xref>: 22). Her assertion positions disasters as a determinant of the state’s ability to manage its population. Ivan’s impact on Grenada crystallized this emerging rationality. The Grenadian government’s near collapse established a frightening link between the immediate impact of hurricanes on state treasuries and the ever-present fear of social disorder lurking in the shadows. Its inability to access disaster recovery financing converged with post-Cold War security concerns and increasingly frequent and intense hurricanes associated with climate change to reposition financial exclusion as a threat to state security.</p>
<p>Jamaica’s Minister of Finance Omar Davies made this connection explicit when he told a World Bank-organized conference of potential CCRIF donors:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There are immediate short term, medium term, and long-term effects [from hurricanes]. These include the need for resources to pay workers, service debt, and effect repairs to critical social and economic infrastructure. <italic>If some of these are not tackled quickly, there can be serious health and environmental risks and even social upheaval</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0967010612438434">Davies, 2007</xref>: 2; emphasis added).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This vision of disasters and security joins human security issues of health and environmental risks with state security concerns over the possibility of social upheaval that results from a state’s inability to secure its critical infrastructure. This is a constitutive paradox of neoliberal development that complicates the insurance imaginary outlined above: a society’s physical and cybernetic infrastructure enables the connectivity and circulation that sustain modern life, but it also supports non-liberal modes of life such as the drug trade and organized crime that threaten state-based order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612438434">Duffield, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0967010612438434">de Goede, 2008</xref>). The potential breakdown of critical infrastructure after a disaster disrupts desirable circulation and threatens the possibility of undesirable circulation.</p>
<p>The minister’s insurance imaginary moves insurance and its associated ‘financial capitalist rationality of governance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero, 2010b</xref>: 241) onto terrain once occupied solely by disaster management. The integrity of critical infrastructure has been the focus of disaster management since its institutionalization in the 1960s and 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0967010612438434">Lakoff, 2007</xref>). In their genealogy of disaster preparedness, Collier and Lakoff argue that rationalities of ‘vital systems security’ problematize the protection of infrastructure against unpredictable threats such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or atomic bomb attacks. This security rationality, they continue, has its roots in US Civil Defense programs of the 1950s and their associated techniques of preparedness. Scenario exercises, vulnerability mapping, training and education programs, and other such enactment-based activities organize society around the principle of always being prepared for an enemy invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612438434">Collier and Lakoff, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The confluence of the Caribbean’s financial exclusion, its geopolitical and economic marginalization in the post-Cold War neoliberal economy, climate change, and the ‘failed states’ discourse alters the significance of infrastructure and what it means to secure it. Critical infrastructure here supports more than the actual flows of people, resources, and information that sustain modern liberal societies. Instead, infrastructure is a site of multiplicity at the level of the virtual (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0967010612438434">de Landa, 2002</xref>). That is, there are innumerable <italic>possible</italic> ways in which people might creatively utilize the infrastructure of global capital and the territorial state. Here, there is a slight but important difference between my argument and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612438434">Duffield’s (2010)</xref> understanding of ‘reflexive modernization’ and ‘actually existing development’. Duffield makes clear that creative uses of globalization’s infrastructure (reflexive modernization) allow alternative modes of social order (actually existing development) organized around non-liberal principles. In contrast, I am suggesting that the security rationality that undergirds the CCRIF is not concerned with actual alternatives, but with the possible, yet-to-be-imagined challenges to state order that might come into being if the state is unable to repair its infrastructure rapidly enough. In short, it problematizes the <italic>possible</italic> physical, cultural, and psychic movements in which non-insured populations engage as they seek to adapt to climate change and disasters within and against present constraints (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0967010612438434">Swyngedouw, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0967010612438434">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Key here is the imaginary nature of the threat disasters are said to pose. The fact that no upheaval came to pass in Grenada, even after the state ‘ceased to exist’, so to speak, did not dissuade state leaders from imagining worst-case scenarios in which widespread disorder and violence <italic>could</italic> break out after a hurricane if a government lacked the financial capacities to adequately respond. Such visions of an uncertain future mobilize what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612438434">Grusin (2004)</xref> calls a premediative imaginary. Premediation is a distinct mode of thought about the future that seeks to envision potential future catastrophes in order to remove the element of surprise from catastrophic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0967010612438434">Aradau and Van Munster, 2007</xref>). It is not about forecasting or prediction, but rather about imagining a variety of possible futures to chart a course for action in the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0967010612438434">de Goede, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0967010612438434">de Goede (2008)</xref> argues, security practices depend on cultural narratives of impending catastrophe that compel action in the present against threats that do not yet exist. Indeed, the threat disasters pose to state order can be read as a ‘future cause’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0967010612438434">Massumi, 2007</xref>) of the CCRIF: the CCRIF did not develop in response to actually existing threats, but rather premediated visions of what could happen if future disasters played out differently. A DFID officer explained to me the potential the department’s leaders saw for the CCRIF to facilitate access to new sources of finance, which led them to advocate the CCRIF’s creation:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We were one of the main supporters of the CCRIF, and we pushed long and hard to get consensus around that.... For us, recognizing that the Caribbean is particularly vulnerable to disasters that could erode a lot of developmental gains, we felt it was important that these [financial] resources be available to help countries recover.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0967010612438434">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The World Bank similarly touts the benefits of overcoming the region’s financial exclusion. An internal grant application to cover the Haitian government’s participation in the CCRIF argues:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>An immediate infusion of capital will enable [the government] to jumpstart recovery efforts quickly, limiting the liquidity impact on the government budget. The liquidity provided immediately after the event will allow the Government to focus its efforts on providing direct assistance to the most affected citizens instead of working to raise funds from the international community to start the recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0967010612438434">World Bank, 2005</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The visions of disorder, financial exclusion, and macroeconomic insecurity spun by development and government officials convinced the Bank to revisit the possibilities, first broached by Lalor’s reports, for regional risk pools as an emergency disaster-finance mechanism. With the Bank’s support and funding from the Japanese government to cover start-up costs and initial technical assessments, the CCRIF came online in June 2007.</p>
<p>While the CCRIF borrows some elements from Lalor’s risk pool, two differences reflect these distinct security concerns. First, the CCRIF connects states with global reinsurance and capital markets while excluding local insurers and disaster management agencies. Second, the CCRIF combines risk pooling with parametric insurance techniques to meet governments’ demands that they be able to quickly access capital following a disaster. Each of these will now be considered in turn.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0967010612438434">
<title>A new geography of insurance</title>
<p>Insurance technologies are put into play through ‘risk assemblages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0967010612438434">Dean, 2004</xref>), shifting networks of insurers, reinsurers, risk management experts, and state and international agencies that mobilize risk technologies in a biopolitics of security. The CCRIF’s risk assemblages are characterized by the absence of local insurers and national disaster management agencies. Unlike Lalor’s pool, which was structured to provide insurance companies with catastrophe coverage, the CCRIF only services Caribbean governments. Indeed, none of the representatives of four Jamaican insurance firms I interviewed in late 2009 recognized any effect of the CCRIF on their business in the previous two years. The common refrain was that the CCRIF covers government infrastructure, which they had no interest in insuring. As one insurer told me, ‘I would say it has not had a negative effect on us because it didn’t cover anything we would have covered or wanted to cover’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0967010612438434">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The CCRIF likewise has minimal involvement with national disaster management agencies. While two of the five spots on the CCRIF’s Board of Directors are reserved for representatives of member-states, these positions are filled by regional business and economic development organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0967010612438434">World Bank, 2007</xref>). As a result, wide-ranging disaster management issues take a back seat to narrow financial interests. According to a CCRIF executive,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We’re not involved [with national disaster management agencies] in their day-to-day operations, not directly through the governments. Although our governance structure includes regional representation, we’ve gone to CARICOM [Caribbean Community] and the CDB [Caribbean Development Bank]; they’re the sources of those representatives. They haven’t been looking down the disaster management line; they’ve been focused on finance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0967010612438434">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The CCRIF’s governance structure sidelines agencies otherwise intimately involved in disaster recovery. In effect, it creates a new disaster recovery apparatus centered on the imperatives of disaster financing and its impact on macroeconomic recovery.</p>
<p>While Lalor’s diagram failed to extend past the regional scale and gave reinsurance a limited role, the CCRIF makes reinsurance a central part of its capacity-building strategies. Capacity here refers to the Facility’s ability to make payouts after a disaster event while remaining solvent. For example, in its 2008–9 policy year, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0967010612438434">CCRIF (2009</xref>: 28) wrote 30 policies for 16 member-states. It collected US$22 million in premiums, $65 million from international donors, and an additional $22 million in donations from member governments. However, it assumed $560 million in aggregate exposure through these contracts, which far exceeds the amount collected from premiums and donations. Thus, a particularly active hurricane season could lead to the CCRIF’s insolvency: its obligations would outstrip its capital reserves. The CCRIF’s reinsurance structure allows it to increase its claims-paying capacity beyond its limited reserves and thus remain solvent even during exceptional years. The Facility retained the first $12.5 million, which covered 1-in-5-year loss events, or cumulative disaster losses with a 1-in-5 chance of occurring within a given policy year. It then purchased $132.5 million in reinsurance, spread across three layers. The first layer is $12.5 million, which covered 1-in-7-year events. A $30 million layer covered 1-in-25-year losses, and the top layer of $90 million extended its claims-paying capacity to 1-in-1400-year loss events. $30 million of this top layer of reinsurance was placed into global capital markets through weather derivatives issued by the Facility and sold to the World Bank Treasury. This reinsurance structure, combined with capital reserves built up from the previous year’s premiums and donations, gave the CCRIF a claims-paying capacity in 2008–9 that exceeded losses with a 1-in-10,000 chance of occurring – ensuring that the CCRIF would be able to pay virtually all claims while remaining solvent.</p>
<p>This use of reinsurance by the CCRIF represents a key difference from Lalor’s plans. Lalor’s pool, which confines insurers’ risks at the regional level, overcomes the lack of catastrophe reserves caused by financial exclusion, but does not address the problem of financial exclusion itself. The CCRIF overcomes financial exclusion by turning regionally pooled risks into commodities that can be leveraged on global markets. For example, the CCRIF cedes risks to four reinsurers: Munich Re, Paris Re, Swiss Re, and Hiscox, a Lloyd’s of London syndicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0967010612438434">World Bank, 2008a</xref>). Lalor explained reinsurers’ interest in the language of gambling:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Reinsurers] get good business [from their involvement with the CCRIF], and they’re not losing any money because they’ve done their homework. In fact, the World Bank is piggybacking on reinsurers. The World Bank doesn’t know anything about modeling, but reinsurers know what they’re dealing with. They know the odds because, whether you like it or not, insurance is like going to the racetrack, and anybody who thinks it’s different doesn’t know it.... Munich Re and Swiss Re, they’re smart gamblers. They’ve done their homework. They know which horse is likely to pass the post first, and they place their money accordingly. They don’t put it on a 1-to-2 favorite; they put in on a 5-to-1 favorite.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0967010612438434">8</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In effect, risk pooling makes catastrophe coverage in the Caribbean a ‘good bet’ for reinsurers, who are now able to spread their potential for losses throughout the region. The rescaling of catastrophe risk markets through the CCRIF allows governments to access sources of disaster financing from which they had previously been excluded.</p>
<p>The CCRIF solidifies a new geography of insurance, a network of states, donor governments, multilateral institutions, and global reinsurance markets that overcomes the Caribbean’s financial exclusion. This assemblage hinges on the CCRIF’s catastrophe models, which turn place-bound uncertainties regarding a disaster’s impact on state revenue into abstract and globally mobile catastrophe risks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0967010612438434">
<title>Catastrophe modeling and the production of catastrophe risks</title>
<p>Lalor’s risk pooling plan relied on contributions from member firms for its capitalization. In contrast, the CCRIF generates revenue through parametric insurance contracts that governments purchase for both hurricane and earthquake risks. Parametric insurance is a distinct form of insurance that ‘changes the insurable event from the protection of assets to parameters and indexes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero, 2010a</xref>: 79). Payouts from parametric policies are triggered once predetermined parameters are met; in the CCRIF’s hurricane coverage, these are wind speed and distance from a predetermined measuring point. Parametric insurance is uniquely suited to addressing the security concerns of member governments, since payments only require verification of parameters – for example, that wind speeds met predetermined levels. This is much faster than indemnity coverage, which requires that insurers verify actual losses. Payments thus typically materialize in a few weeks rather than months or years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0967010612438434">World Bank, 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>The amount of remuneration is set by parameters written into the catastrophe insurance contract and determined through negotiations between the CCRIF and member-states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0967010612438434">9</xref></sup> For example, the Jamaican government may purchase a US$50 million hurricane policy. Its attachment point, the parameter level that determines when the government receives a payment, may be set to a Category 2 hurricane that is 50 kilometers from one of the island’s 13 measuring points, such as Kingston’s Norman Manley International Airport. This lowest parameter triggers a 20% payout, or US$10 million. Payouts increase as wind speed increases and distance grows closer: a Category 3 storm generates a 40% payout; Category 4, 60%; and Category 5, 100%. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero (2010a</xref>: 91–2) illustrates in his discussion of the CCRIF’s US$8 million payment to the Haitian government following the devastating 2010 earthquake, a state’s catastrophic losses often far exceed payouts it may receive from parametric coverage.</p>
<p>Payment levels are calculated through catastrophe models that represent the risk that potential disasters pose to government revenue. The CCRIF’s catastrophe models turn an illiquid asset, the threat future disasters pose to state order, into a liquid commodity that can be leveraged for growth, profitability, and development – in short, biopolitical security (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0967010612438434">Bougen, 2003</xref>). The CCRIF uses a standard five-layer catastrophe model (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0967010612438434">Collier, 2008</xref>) to project the impact specific events will have on government losses (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0967010612438434">World Bank, 2008b</xref>). The first layer is the hazard module, which uses 150-year historical data to model a particular event’s effects and its so-called disintegration as the location of the event – a hurricane’s eye or an earthquake’s epicenter – moves further away from a specific geographic location. The second layer is the exposure module, which analyzes the values of the built environment exposed to a particular peril. The CCRIF’s models estimate building and infrastructure coverage with satellite imagery, and calculate exposure levels for the entire territory by draping a 900-square-meter grid over its terrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0967010612438434">CCRIF, 2009</xref>). Within each block, exposure is calculated by multiplying the area of total building inventory by the inventory’s average replacement cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0967010612438434">World Bank, 2008b</xref>). This fine-toothed grid allows modelers to classify the exposure of each one-square-kilometer block on the basis of the value of physical assets it encompasses, and thus produce a detailed representation of each island’s exposure.</p>
<p>The impact of a storm on government revenue is represented by projecting the cost to repair exposed structures after a catastrophic event of different wind speeds and distances from the particular block in question. The first step in this projection is the third level of catastrophe models, the vulnerability module. This relies on detailed data to determine the vulnerability of asset classes within each block, such as building-construction materials, current usage, number of stories, and age. These data are combined with the hazard module to estimate the mean damage ratio (MDR), or the percentage of a structure’s replacement costs that will be required to repair it after an event of a specific magnitude. The MDR will increase along with the intensity of the peril in question: for instance, a Category 3 storm may result in an MDR of 0.60, while a Category 5 may have an MDR of 0.90.</p>
<p>To calculate projected losses, the MDR for each asset class is multiplied by the value at risk determined in the exposure module. This is the fourth level, the damage module. The fifth and final module, the loss module, aggregates the damage projections for each asset class in order to determine the overall impact of an event on the government’s revenue. This model is then run through thousands of simulations in order to generate probability functions for particular loss levels. A $1.5 billion loss may be attributed to a 1-in-10-year event, which has a 1-in-10 chance of occurring within a given policy year. These loss projections are used to determine the attachment points governments select in their contracts. In the CCRIF’s first year of operation, 2007–8, most countries selected policies with attachment points of a 1-in-20-year loss; in the second year, this was generally lowered to a 1-in-17-year loss.</p>
<p>The final output of the CCRIF’s catastrophe models – the catastrophe risks that represent probable losses in state revenue that occur because of specific wind speeds – is bought and sold in exchanges between member-states and the CCRIF, and between the CCRIF, global reinsurers, and weather derivative markets. To use Lalor’s above analogy with gambling, the CCRIF’s insurance is essentially a wager on the state’s ability to withstand a disaster: member-states gamble that they can maintain order and sustain development without an immediate infusion of external capital for anything less than a 1-in-17-year loss. Reinsurers wager that the state will not suffer such losses over the life of the one-year contract. But, state losses cannot be known in real time and can only be ascertained through damage assessments after the fact, which can take months or years to fully calculate. Thus, all parties involved in catastrophe risk transfers – governments, the CCRIF, and reinsurers – are gambling not over the state’s actual losses in the event of a disaster, but rather over the CCRIF’s projections of state losses, given particular parameters. The CCRIF’s parametric insurance thus links state security and capital accumulation around disaster recovery financing: the state’s preparedness hinges on the CCRIF’s ability to make state insecurity a good bet for global reinsurance and capital markets.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero (2010a)</xref> has detailed how parametric insurance is part of the wider problematic of neoliberal governance: it integrates states and the global reinsurance industry to transform developing countries’ governments into responsible risk managers. Indeed, parametric insurance is intimately connected with the neoliberalization of everyday life. It does not replace traditional forms of risk management, but rather ‘cater[s] to the traditional uninsurability of environmental hazards’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero, 2010a</xref>: 77). In the non-Western world, parametric weather-insurance schemes were piloted during the 1990s and 2000s as a way to provide small farmers with drought insurance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612438434">Skees, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0967010612438434">10</xref></sup> These were deployed for two purposes: First, to overcome farmers’ so-called poverty trap, in which their lack of access to credit, insurance, and other financial services, compounded with environmental degradation, exacerbated their poverty and rendered conventional development programs ineffective. Paralleling the Caribbean’s experiences outlined above, an insurance imaginary on poverty, development, and climate change asserted that parametric weather insurance based on rainfall measurements could overcome farmers’ financial exclusion and secure their livelihoods against climate change. Second, these programs were also designed to create new markets for insurers and financial-service providers (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0967010612438434">Hess, 2003</xref>: 7). The effect of these schemes was to transform livelihoods into lifestyles that could be developed and secured through the financial techniques and rationalities of Western capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, for much of the past decade, parametric insurance has been a cog in the financialization of non-Western populations. Financialization, as above, refers to processes by which diverse domains of life are reorganized around principles of risk management, accounting, and financial speculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0967010612438434">Martin, 2007</xref>: 43). Just as the spread of parametric insurance to farmers effects the financialization of their daily lives, its adoption in the Caribbean through the CCRIF incorporates disaster management into the rhythms and rationalities of global finance. The next section maps the contours of financialized disaster management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0967010612438434">
<title>Pre-empting adaptation: The financialization of disaster management</title>
<p>Financialization is a specific way of envisioning and acting on an uncertain future. It operates through techniques of securitization and leveraging to turn uncertain futures into risks that are leveraged for growth and security. Securitization is the process of turning place-specific uncertainties and debts into securities, abstract risks bundled together as financial products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0967010612438434">Martin, 2007</xref>). Through securitization, financialization draws together formerly distinct regions, populations, and social, economic, and ecological processes around the category of objective and comparable abstract risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0967010612438434">Martin, 2002</xref>). These securities in turn are leveraged on financial markets, through products such as derivatives and catastrophe bonds, to create profit and security out of the risks of global connectivity. Leverage refers here to the multiplier effect through which market actors assuming a debt or risk access resources and control processes they otherwise would be unable to influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612438434">LiPuma and Lee, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Securitization and leverage are essential components of parametric insurance’s biopolitical strategies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero (2010a</xref>: 79) argues that the securitization of catastrophe risk through parametric insurance schemes enables states to perform their sovereign responsibility to secure their populations’ development and well-being against calamities. Parametric insurance enables non-Western states, which often lack financial resources to repair critical infrastructure, to leverage their catastrophe risks on global reinsurance and capital markets. The effect is to ‘generat[e] a multiplier effect in [their] response capacities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero, 2010a</xref>: 85) as risk networks such as the CCRIF’s geography of insurance detailed above connect states with new sources of disaster financing.</p>
<p>However, more is at play than the human security dimensions of critical infrastructure: the financialization of disaster management extends into the virtual domain of premediated threats to state security. Key here is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0967010612438434">Martin (2007)</xref> calls the logic of the derivative. Derivatives are securities whose value derives from an underlying asset rather than an intrinsic value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612438434">LiPuma and Lee, 2004</xref>). In effect, derivatives price turbulence, the emergent force of global interconnection: they isolate, abstract, and securitize unpredictable components of a commodity’s price, such as weather or exchange-rate fluctuations, and thus enable leveraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0967010612438434">Cooper, 2010</xref>). In converting uncertainties into securitized and leveragable risks, derivatives connect market actors with resources that can be drawn on to maintain adaptability as an uncertain future unfolds (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0967010612438434">de Goede, 2005</xref>: 140).</p>
<p>The logic of derivatives extends beyond the financial domain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0967010612438434">Martin’s (2007)</xref> critical analysis of financialization and the US ‘war on terror’ highlights how the state and capital mobilize the logic of derivatives as a preemptive security strategy. Preemption, like preparedness, is a specific rationality of anticipatory action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0967010612438434">Anderson, 2010</xref>). It seeks to manage an uncertain future by turning virtual threats into actual risk. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0967010612438434">Massumi (2007)</xref> explains in his discussion of the US doctrine of preemptive war, preemption attempts to make the virtual threat of terrorism actualize on the state’s terms. The problem here is not to control bodies to eliminate surprise, but rather to shape the possibilities of future worlds so that surprises are acceptable and manageable. The capacity of the state to act within and on emergent life is a distinct form of power in the global political economy, the power of leverage. Leverage operates biopolitically not through techniques of sovereign power such as property rights, but rather through what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0967010612438434">Cooper (2010</xref>: 181) calls the ‘appropriation of the event’. In her words, leverage ‘potentializes and depotentializes connections’ in order to lay claim ‘over event worlds that have yet to actualize in space and time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0967010612438434">Cooper, 2010</xref>: 181). Leveraging the risks of, for example, preemptive military action forges new forms of interconnection that strategically limit the possibilities for emergent life and enhance the state’s capacity to act on this immanent terrain.</p>
<p>The centrality of leverage to parametric insurance techniques signals the limit of state-based order: the state lacks the adaptive capacity necessary to secure its vital infrastructure without leveraging catastrophe risk on global markets. Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0967010612438434">Hardt and Negri (2000)</xref> have famously shown, the constitutive power to create social life anew – the power to immanently generate difference – does not lie in the state, but rather is the property of the decentralized and diffuse multitude, the self-organizing collective subject of global biopolitics. In this light, leverage hinges on the ability of the state and capital to appropriate constitutive power through the derivative form, which subjects adaptability to quantification and measure. In biopolitical terms, derivatives allow the state to abstract, leverage, and parasitically appropriate the constitutive power of its population’s adaptive capacity as the risk of socio-ecological difference that may result from future catastrophes.</p>
<p>Leveraging catastrophe risks through premediated visions of societal breakdown thus turns catastrophe insurance into a biopolitical mechanism that increases the state’s capacity to respond to an emergency. Calculatory techniques securitize the threat of disorder as catastrophe risks that governments leverage on global financial markets for greater adaptability in the socio-ecological emergency. As above, the CCRIF’s parametric insurance is designed to minimize the time necessary for disaster financing to materialize, and thus to enable member-states to more quickly repair critical infrastructure, provide basic services, maintain order, and begin recovery efforts. In biopolitical terms, its goal is to facilitate the state’s ability to operate within the emergent time-space of catastrophe in order to depotentialize the constitutive power of radical adaptability and preemptively negate potential disorder. Thus, while the CCRIF allows states to leverage environmental risk to support ‘good’ forms of circulation that can increase human security, it also sets as its biopolitical target the possible – not necessarily probable – metabolisms formed through the contingent conjunction of ‘bad’ forms of adaptive self-reliance and the potential loss of state control during a disaster.</p>
<p>However, there is an important distinction to draw out. Leveraging through catastrophe insurance hinges on the ability of catastrophe models to price and securitize adaptive capacity as the source of turbulence. The CCRIF’s models turn the uncertainty of potentially destructuring socio-ecological metabolisms that embody the socio-ecological emergency into probable losses in state revenue that are exchanged through parametric and reinsurance contracts. Metabolism here refers to processes of environmental transformation that combine human capacities with non-human potentialities in the production of new environmental forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0967010612438434">Swyngedouw, 2004</xref>). Flows of state revenue are territorialized through cartographic maneuvers that assign quantified values to representations on a satellite image – the pixels, for example, that represent built structures – and sort out each of these representations within 900-square-meter grids. These practices break an immanent continuum of flow and circulation into discrete, territorialized units of value at risk that are classified and mapped to depict the country as an insecure and vulnerable space in need of insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612438434">Lobo-Guerrero, 2010b</xref>). Adaptive capacity is negatively represented here as how much it will cost the state to maintain its infrastructure, the cost of preemptively negating social upheaval. In essence, the CCRIF creates a new field of capital accumulation out of the uncertainties and adaptability of life enmeshed in the socio-ecological transformations that sustain capitalist development.</p>
<p>Financialization introduces a normative rationality for decisions on appropriate disaster management activities: fear of future disorder now determines how states utilize scarce financial resources to adapt to disasters and climate change. For example, Jamaica’s first year’s premium for the CCRIF, roughly US$4 million, was approximately eight times the amount budgeted for its national disaster management agency that year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0967010612438434">Government of Jamaica, 2007</xref>). But, as an official in Jamaica’s Ministry of Local Government noted, these resources have little impact on vulnerable populations:</p>

What the CCRIF provides is some type of economic support, and that doesn’t have to immediately affect the humanitarian side, the people suffering.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0967010612438434">11</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Along these lines, the CCRIF’s involvement with ministries of finance rather than national disaster management agencies prevents disaster recovery experts from shaping how states utilize CCRIF payments. A director of a national disaster management agency expressed to me his frustrations with his government’s use of a recent CCRIF payment to address macroeconomic concerns rather than rebuild infrastructure:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In our case, the money that was supposed to come from the CCRIF was earmarked for refurbishment of government buildings that were damaged. Come check [our island], the government buildings are still damaged but the money’s gone. Where it went was the general funds, so when stuff needed to be paid at that time, it covered those expenses. It’s a case where, ok, this money’s been set aside but you have bills to pay and you put it in the general pool where all the government utilizes it, then we don’t know how much of that money went to what.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0967010612438434">12</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, an officer in Jamaica’s Ministry of Labor and Social Services, which coordinates immediate disaster-response efforts in communities throughout the island, vividly illustrated the stakes of reorganizing disaster management around financial imperatives:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Government infrastructure should be so designed to make them capable of facilitating the social part of it. For example, we don’t have shelters to house persons after disasters. Most of our schools [which are used as disaster shelters in many communities] are not designed as hurricane shelters. I think you should have at least two or three [shelters] strategically placed, because after an event it takes time to rehabilitate, a year or two.... So we should have somewhere where these persons to go until they are able to return. <italic>Persons should be able to maintain some dignity</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0967010612438434">13</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This official’s concern with enabling people to maintain dignity even in emergency situations inadvertently brings into sharp relief the biopolitical effect of disaster management’s financialization: its tendency to turn individuals affected by disasters into a faceless population of potential threats to state security. Financialized disaster management values infrastructure not in terms of human livelihoods and well-being, but in terms of the role infrastructure plays in maintaining a docile and ordered population. As such, it organizes disaster management not around the principle of alleviating the human suffering and indignity that disasters can cause, but rather around that of preempting the threat that humans suffering pose to state-based order through the purchase of catastrophe insurance.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Repairing critical infrastructure after a disaster is of utmost importance in a region such as the Caribbean, where disasters frequently maroon marginalized communities and leave them without relief supplies for many days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0967010612438434">McDonald, 1985</xref>). The impacts of climate change, already visible in the Caribbean as an increase in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes, make the need for creative approaches all the more pressing. International development organizations and the insurance industry have heaped accolades on the CCRIF for its innovative combination of risk pooling and parametric insurance that allows global reinsurance markets to finance disaster recovery. This article has offered a more cautious appraisal of the CCRIF’s catastrophe insurance. Approaching the CCRIF as a risk technology, a set of rationalities and practices that governs through an uncertain future, draws out how the CCRIF facilitates what I have identified here as the financialization of disaster management. This process articulates the logic of preparedness, through which disaster management has traditionally understood and acted on a threatening future, with that of preemption derived from neoliberal practices of warfare and accumulation. The CCRIF makes preparedness contingent on preemptive financial maneuvers that leverage environmental insecurities in order to enhance the state’s capacity to maintain its critical infrastructure during an emergency. As a logic of financialized disaster management, preemption actualizes potential threats as catastrophe risks in order to appropriate and depotentialize the constitutive force of socio-ecological difference, a population’s immeasurable adaptive capacity.</p>
<p>The biopolitical tendency of financialized disaster management to reduce non-insured disaster victims to faceless masses that threaten state-based order should give pause to disaster recovery initiatives dependent on global finance. My analysis suggests this tendency may be a necessary, even constitutive, feature of financial techniques, whose underlying logic of the derivative is parasitically dependent on adaptive capacity for value-generating difference. Accordingly, the challenge moving forward is to reflexively question how various disaster management programs – both financialized and non-financialized – problematize and appropriate adaptive capacity. To the extent that government officials and researchers do not conflate state and macroeconomic security with human security, catastrophe insurance programs such as the CCRIF have the potential to provide much-needed adaptation resources. This necessitates reorganizing insurance techniques around alternative rationalities of security that are not founded on the neoliberal valorizations of life as a store of capital that, as this analysis has shown, condition disaster management’s financialization. Adaptation and disaster resilience are vitally important goals, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0967010612438434">Swyngedouw (2009)</xref> argues, the pursuit of security against climate change should not cloud our considerations of what life we are actually securing, and what life we should try to secure.</p>

<p>Lalor composed the first report for the prime minister of the Bahamas, who requested a review of catastrophe coverage in the Caribbean following 1992’s Hurricane Andrew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0967010612438434">Lalor, 1994</xref>), and the second for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) as part of a mid-1990s project on Caribbean disaster management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612438434">Lalor, 1996</xref>). These reports also suggest that the volatility of reinsurance pricing deters Caribbean insurers from entering the market.
