<p>As usual, we have tried in this issue of ResearchWatch to select and review a varied mix of publications from other journals that are both relevant and interesting to readers of the Journal of Medical Marketing.</p>
<p>The first paper that caught my attention was one from Health Economics, which is a journal to which I pay a lot of attention. This paper<sup>1</sup> looks at third party payers' decision processes for financing health technologies (so called ‘fourth hurdle’ processes) and addresses the need for a theoretical foundation in this area by analysing fourth hurdle processes from an economics perspective. Using a technique called decision-analytic framework and the theory of agents, the paper describes fourth hurdle processes as sets of institutions to maximize the value derived from finite healthcare resources. In this approach, the authors assume that benefits arise from the value of better information about and better implementation of the most cost-effective choice. They further assume that implementation is improved by decreased information asymmetries and better alignment of incentives and that this decreases the effects of ex ante and ex post moral hazard on service provision. The authors use, for example, potential indicators of high benefit such as high costs associated with wrong decisions and large population sizes affected by the decision. The authors’ intention is that their framework may serve as a basis both for further theoretical and further empirical work, for example, on comparative assessments of fourth hurdle processes. For anyone trying to take a rigorous approach to understanding market access, this is a useful paper.</p>
<p>Our next paper<sup>2</sup> looks at the topical issues of viral marketing in relation to medical technology. The authors contrast ideas from integrating marketing principles, which suggest new models such as viral marketing, with prior studies that have theoretically and empirically examined the fact that trust is the essence of any human interaction, especially for online activities. Using theviral marketing and trust literature as a foundation, this descriptive and applied study, attempts to integrate trust and viral marketing through a technology acceptance model and study the effect of consumers' trust on viral marketing acceptance. The respondents to the questionnaire were 69 experts responsible for the selection and purchase of the medical equipment. The study showed that trust plays an important role in the attitude toward viral marketing. This study verified the technology acceptance model and uses this to draw out some managerial implications for medical technology companies when designing their viral marketing campaigns. For medtech marketers experimenting with viral marketing, this paper gives an interesting perspective.</p>
<p>Our third paper<sup>3</sup> looks at the strategies of pharmaceutical companies in China. As the authors point out, management researchers have traditionally emphasized two main factors in the definition of corporate strategies: internal capabilities and industry competition. They take the view, however, that in less stable, transition economies it is particularly the changing institutional environment that influences strategy definition and performance of multinational corporations, as shown by numerous prior studies. Yet, despite the fact that institutions do matter so much, exactly how institutions matter remains a largely unresolved question in the view of the researchers. They therefore examines how institutions have affected the value chain configuration of Western pharmaceutical firms in China. Their research framework identifies four major strategic shifts along the value chain of Western firms in the pharmaceutical industry: upgrading along the value chain, outsourcing to contract service providers, expansion of geographical scope and diversification of product portfolio. The application of this framework allows the authors to suggest managerial implications for decision makers in Western pharmaceutical firms operating in China. This paper will provide a lot of thought for the leaders of pharma and medtech companies attempting to develop the Chinese and indeed other emerging markets.</p>
<p>Next, a paper that considers the changing world of medical education.<sup>4</sup> This paper begins from the premise that social marketing has a long and robust history in health education and public health. It discusses how social marketing strategies are designed to promote desired behaviours in high-priority health-related areas and nd how traditional social marketing campaigns have targeted patients or specific segments of the public, rather than physicians and other healthcare providers, to deliver health-related messages. The authors then go on to explore what they see as the emerging opportunity for the social marketing and medical education communities to collaborate and influence social change of medical students, interns, and others. The authors offer a primer on the medical education environment as it relates to social marketing strategies for healthcare providers and outline key themes and emerging needs in medical education. In particular, four major areas for collaboration with the social marketing community are highlighted. These include: emphasis on social accountability, use of technology in education and medical practice, alignment with changes in health care delivery, and future directions in the health care workforce. In addition, four practical strategies for meaningful collaborations between medical education and social marketing leadership are presented. This paper will have interest for anyone interesting in social marketing or medical education.</p>
<p>The fifth paper I recommend concerns direct to consumer advertising.<sup>5</sup> The authors describe how patients increasingly request their physicians to prescribe specific brands of pharmaceutical drugs and examine the popular belief that such requests are triggered by direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA). They examine the relationship between DTCA, patient requests, and prescriptions for statins and find that although the effect of requests on prescriptions is significantly positive, the mean effect of DTCA on patient requests is negative, yet very small. More interestingly, both effects show substantial heterogeneity across physicians, which they uncover using a hierarchical Bayes estimation procedure. They find that specialists receive more requests than primary care physicians but translate them less into prescriptions. In addition, the authors find that the sociodemographic profile of the area a physician practices in moderates the effects of DTCA on requests and of requests on prescriptions. For instance, physicians from areas with a higher proportion of minorities (i.e., blacks and Hispanics) receive more requests that are less triggered by DTCA and are accommodated less frequently than physicians from areas with a lower proportion of minorities. These results challenge managers to revisit the role of DTCA in stimulating patient requests. At the same time, they may trigger public policy concerns regarding physicians' accommodation of patient requests and the inequalities they may induce. I found this a fascinating paper with implications for all patient-focussed communications.</p>
<p>Our final selected paper this issue takes us to the rapidly changing UK market. It explores the interactions between value and power in networks of buyer-seller relationships in the quasi-market of the UK National Health Service. It thus begins to provide empirical evidence in an area that has not previously received detailed attention. The research is based on three in-depth case studies undertaken in the UK National Health Service. In these case studies, the complex sets of relationships between the purchasers and providers of community health care (this includes health visiting, district nursing, and therapies such as chiropody and physiotherapy) were investigated. The findings reveal a number of adaptations that have resulted from the complex set of power and value interactions within the network. The findings confirm that value and power need to be considered from both a dyadic and network perspective and illustrate that business-to-business marketing principles can make a valid contribution to the health care debate.</p>
