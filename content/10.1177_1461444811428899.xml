<abstract>
<p>The goals of this study are to explore several claims about the democratizing potential of the internet and to extend gatekeeping theory into user-generated content (UGC) domain. A quantitative content analysis of the most popular YouTube political news videos during the 2008 US presidential election was conducted to investigate the degree to which nonelites were able to partake in mainstream public discourse. We found that elites dominated first and second filters (news sourcing and news production) in the flow of online news, while nonelites dominated the third filter (news distribution). These results suggest that an update to the traditional gatekeeping model is needed to reflect the realities of today’s user-driven communication environment.</p>

<p>The debate about the impact of the internet on democracy and on empowering society’s nonelites is well known and still goes on unabated. For example, some have argued that the internet has shifted gatekeeping power away from the traditional mainstream media through the development of online user-powered communities (e.g. YouTube, Slashdot, Digg) where users engage in ‘gatewatching’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811428899">Bruns, 2005</xref>). Bruns argued that gatewatching occurs when members of online communities aggregate and rate news from various sources. News that is submitted and highly ranked by many users is featured prominently on these sites, while news that is unpopular remains obscure. Gatewatching allows users, as a collective, to become the ‘wire editors,’ sometimes replacing, and at other times undercutting the influence of the original ‘Mr. Gates’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1461444811428899">White, 1950</xref>). Additionally, an abundance of information channels reduces the power of traditional news organizations. For example, while traditional media organizations resisted publishing stories about the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal and Trent Lott’s racially insensitive remarks during Strom Thurmond’s 100th birthday celebration, the news still flowed through the internet and the tabloid press, eventually garnering the attention of mainstream media and their audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1461444811428899">Williams and Delli Carpini, 2004</xref>). Some internet optimists argued that easy access to political information, coupled with the ease of communication among citizens, has allowed previously disadvantaged and marginalized groups to organize for collective action, both on- and offline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811428899">Bimber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461444811428899">Trippi, 2004</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461444811428899">Shirky (2009)</xref> argued that anti-government activists in certain authoritarian countries enjoy greater leverage in their dealings with the government and influencing public opinion partially due to internet-based and other novel communication tools.</p>
<p>However, internet pessimists oppose this view, arguing that the more things change, the more they remain the same. Elites, they argue, find better ways to quickly harness the newest technology, and further increase their political clout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444811428899">Davis and Owen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444811428899">Kperogi, 2011</xref>). Some argue that elites still have an easy access to the mainstream media and continue dominating debates on public issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811428899">Bimber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444811428899">Hindman, 2009</xref>). For example, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444811428899">Alexa (2011a)</xref>, the fifteen most popular online news destinations, which are owned and managed in the vast majority of cases by powerful corporations, include (from the most to the least popular): Yahoo News, BBC Online, CNN Interactive, BBC News, The New York Times, The Huffington Post, The Weather Channel, Google News, NBC News and MSNBC News, Reddit, The Guardian, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://FoxNews.com">FoxNews.com</ext-link>, Reuters Group PLC, Wall Street Journal, and The Times of India. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444811428899">Hindman (2009)</xref> examined the most popular political bloggers and found that in terms of gender, education, race, and other attributes, these bloggers resembled elites much more than nonelites. The researcher argued that instead of empowering ordinary citizens, the internet shifted power from some elite groups to other elite groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444811428899">Davis and Owen (1998</xref>: 58) also concluded that internet-based novel media forms ‘are not the new democratic facilitators.’ Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461444811428899">Morozov (2009)</xref> argued that internet technology might provide a short-term edge to nonelite anti-government protesters in authoritarian nations, but over time, the authoritarian regimes or elite regime-friendly groups find ways to counter such attempts by infiltrating social networks, using sophisticated data mining tools to identify protesters, and using word-of-mouth marketing techniques to influence online political discussions.</p>
<p>This study contributes to the debate between internet pessimists and optimists. Specifically, we rely on empirical evidence to explore a possible shift in power from elites to nonelites in today’s era of user-driven communication. Such an era, by definition, should be characterized by nonelite empowerment, where citizens have a greater voice in public discourse. We contend that due to an increased power of users to create (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461444811428899">Dylko and McCluskey, in press</xref>) and ‘gatewatch’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811428899">Bruns, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461444811428899">2008</xref>) news content, there is a need to revisit the old debate between internet pessimists and optimists, and empirically re-examine democratic implications of today’s substantially more user-driven internet.</p>
<p>However, before discussing the possibility of a power shift in today’s communication environment, it is important to specify what we mean by elites and nonelites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1461444811428899">Smith (1993)</xref> in his examination of media coverage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, defined elites as government (federal and state) and big (oil) business. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1461444811428899">Wittebols (1995)</xref> in his study of news sources differentiated between elite (or official) sources and nonelite sources. The former group consisted of representatives of government, business, international organizations, and other powerful groups. The latter group included citizens, eyewitnesses, their families, and so forth. In this study, the nonelite groups are groups that are marginal, underfunded, and not mainstream, and that historically had little access to major news outlets to disseminate their views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461444811428899">Gamson and Wolfsfeld, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461444811428899">Sigal, 1973</xref>). Unorthodox and underfunded political candidates (e.g. Ralph Nader, Jesse Ventura), marginalized political parties (e.g. the Libertarian Party or the Green party) and grassroots organizations (e.g. Libertarian Party, DailyKos), and private citizens who have no strong financial resources or affiliation with government, business, or other powerful special interest group are all considered to represent nonelites in this study. On the opposite side of the spectrum are elites, which are conceptualized to be well-funded, well-organized, and mainstream, and well-known organizations and individuals, all of whom have traditionally had an easy access to the mainstream media, and could very effectively influence public opinion.</p>

<title>User-driven communication environment and YouTube</title>
<p>Two trends in today’s media environment are an increasingly active audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444811428899">Bennett and Iyengar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811428899">Bruns, 2005</xref>) and a growing popularity of user-generated content (UGC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461444811428899">Pew Internet and American Life Project, 2009b</xref>). YouTube is a platform for distributing both user-created and professionally created video content. It is arguably the most important (although by no means representative) exemplar of the user-driven, internet-based public sphere. Investigating YouTube enables scholars to develop valuable insights into the nature and political implications of UGC.</p>
<p>Some background on YouTube is necessary. In 2006, Republican Senator George Allen of Virginia, who started the electoral season with a double-digit lead over Democrat Jim Webb and was projected to be a sure winner, made the famous ‘macaca’ remark while addressing one of Webb’s supporters. The exchange was captured on video and subsequently posted on YouTube, and from there it traveled to major traditional news outlets. Allen eventually lost to Webb, which showed the potential of YouTube to be a powerful platform for political communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444811428899">Perlmutter, 2008</xref>). The 2007 CNN/YouTube primary presidential debates set rating records for cable news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461444811428899">Stelter, 2008</xref>) and further established YouTube as a powerhouse on the political communication scene. Additionally, in 2007 YouTube established a channel specifically for political campaign videos, called You Choose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444811428899">Gueorguieva, 2008</xref>), which encouraged many 2008 presidential and congressional candidates to extensively utilize the site. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444811428899">Gulati and Williams (2010)</xref> found that 72 percent of major-party Senate candidates created their own individual YouTube channels. Barack Obama’s campaign also uploaded more than 1800 videos to the site in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444811428899">Heffernan, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>YouTube is an extraordinarily popular website, and an undeniable leader in the rapidly growing user-generated video market. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444811428899">Pew Internet and American Life Project (2009a)</xref> reported that 62 percent of adult internet users in the USA have visited an online video-sharing website, such as YouTube, with 19 percent doing so daily. Nielsen Online reported that in April 2010 YouTube was ranked as the most visited video streaming website in the USA (97 million unique viewers), with its closest competitor, Yahoo, attracting an audience three times smaller (28 million unique viewers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461444811428899">NielsenNetRatings, 2010</xref>). In September 2011 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444811428899">Alexa (2011b)</xref> also reported that YouTube is the world’s third most-visited website of any type.</p>
<p>In addition to its popularity, YouTube (and UGC more generally) seems to represent a logical next step in the internet’s progression toward greater user control and more voluminous information-exchange capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811428899">Bimber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461444811428899">Dylko and McCluskey, in press</xref>). Both of these characteristics empower the user to have an unprecedented impact on their information environment, echoing hopes of many internet optimists, who see the medium as a powerful democratizing tool that may have important implications for both political and news media systems (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811428899">Bimber, 2003</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811428899">Chadwick, 2006</xref>, for comprehensive overviews). For example, in an act of citizen journalism, videos of police shooting 22-year-old Oscar Grant III were recorded on cell-phones and later posted to a global audience on YouTube, which led to widespread public discourse and protests in Oakland, California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444811428899">Antony and Thomas, 2010</xref>). Also, the mere act of posting content online can enhance one’s feelings of psychological empowerment, possibly leading to greater political participation on- and offline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811428899">Leung, 2009</xref>). However, some scholars have questioned the democratizing and deliberative power of YouTube due to its seemingly dismissive and playful atmosphere in regards to serious political issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444811428899">Hess, 2009</xref>). Moreover, some have argued that YouTube is increasingly mainstream and dominated by traditional news media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811428899">May, 2010</xref>). In sum, there is no consensus about YouTube’s influence on political communication.</p>

<title>Gatekeeping</title>
<p>This study uses a quantitative content analysis of YouTube’s political content to examine internet-empowerment claims made from the camp of internet skeptics and internet optimists. The theoretical framework adopted in this study is one of a complex news gatekeeping process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461444811428899">Shoemaker, 1997</xref>), where communication industry players (i.e. news sources, news organizations, and news content distributors) and various journalistic routines (i.e. reliance on prestige press or elite sources) largely determine how the news is made, gathered, and transmitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1461444811428899">Shoemaker et al., 2001</xref>). Specifically, the evolution of gatekeeping is investigated by exploring whether traditional media powerbrokers, such as traditional news organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461444811428899">Reese and Danielian, 1989</xref>) and high-ranking official sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461444811428899">Sigal, 1973</xref>), among others, still dominate the news gatekeeping process.</p>
<p>Gatekeeping and sociology of news research provides an explanation for how the news flows from its inception (e.g. real-world event) through the editorial process (e.g. a newswire editor) to publication and ultimate distribution to the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461444811428899">Entman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444811428899">Gans, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461444811428899">Shoemaker and Reese, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1461444811428899">White, 1950</xref>). Each point where a decision is made about what information to include or omit is a filter or a gate in the news channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1461444811428899">Shoemaker et al., 2001</xref>). In the current investigation, we follow the tradition of gatekeeping studies that examined the gatekeeping process by identifying the filters that news information must pass through from inception to distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444811428899">Bass, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461444811428899">Shoemaker, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444811428899">Bass (1969)</xref> examined the filters that news stories passed through (e.g. raw news, journalists, editors) in United Nations Radio before being broadcast. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444811428899">Shoemaker (1991)</xref> also described gatekeeping as a complex social process involving many filters, including individual (e.g. journalists), organizational (e.g. NBC news), and institutional (e.g. the journalism industry) filters. The present study adopts this approach to gatekeeping by identifying the filters that online news passes through before reaching a mass audience on a UGC website.</p>
<sec id="section3-1461444811428899">
<title>Democratizing how information flows through three information filters</title>
<p>Based on previous research, we examine internet democratization claims by focusing on three different filters in the news channel: (1) featured persons/sources in YouTube news, (2) YouTube news content creators, and (3) YouTube video posters. We regard these filters as essential to developing a comprehensive understanding of the shifting power dynamics between elites and nonelites. Sources (featured persons/sources of YouTube news) greatly impact what news journalists might focus on in the early stages of the newsgathering. News content creators (YouTube news content creators) have a great deal of power to shape how this news is framed and packaged. Finally, news distributors (YouTube video posters) have substantial power to determine which news items get disseminated to the ultimate audiences. We elaborate on each of these points next.</p>
<p>In regards to the first filter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444811428899">Bass (1969)</xref> identified the first step in the flow of news as raw news itself. Raw news is often collected from human sources, which are an important information filter due to journalists’ inability to extensively consult all the relevant information and inability to conduct extensive primary research. Due to such practical constraints, their stories tend to reflect the frames and biases of the story sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461444811428899">Shoemaker and Reese, 1991</xref>). In political news, elite sources have enormous gatekeeping power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444811428899">Gans (1979)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461444811428899">Sigal (1973)</xref> suggested that elite sources are almost ideal for traditional news organizations from the perspectives of newsworthiness (i.e. the higher the rank, the more newsworthy the source is) and news organizations’ routines (i.e. source availability and trustworthiness are generally considered very useful source characteristics). Additionally, in his ‘cascading network activation model,’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461444811428899">Entman (2003)</xref> argued that elite political figures (i.e. the President) have the highest level of power in framing political news. In other words, most of the sources have traditionally been elites, and such sources are critical to determining what is consequently reported as news. Today’s UGC outlets and models for news dissemination (e.g. political news blogs) are drastically different from traditional news organizations in terms of their goals, value orientations inside the organizations, and business models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444811428899">Perlmutter, 2008</xref>). This may alter their reliance on elite sources of news. To investigate the extent of elite sources’ power in today’s UGC environment, we ask:
<disp-quote>
<p>RQ1: Do the featured persons/sources of YouTube’s most popular political news videos come from the ranks of elite or nonelite groups?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The featured person/source relays the information to the next filter: news content creators, such as journalists, news organizations, or other groups responsible for packaging information deemed newsworthy into a news report. In his explication of gatekeepers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444811428899">Bass (1969)</xref> determined that individual reporters were the first gatekeepers from a news organization because reporters often decided both which story to report and which details to include in those stories. At the organizational level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444811428899">Shoemaker (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444811428899">Gans (1979)</xref> argued that news organizations have routines, practices, and embedded ideologies that impact the news. Similar to the influence of sources, who the news professionals are and what types of news organizations they work for might influence the type of news that is reported because individual reporters’ characteristics and organizations’ routines were shown to be important to the news production process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461444811428899">Shoemaker and Reese, 1991</xref>). In the pre-internet era, nonelite news content creators (e.g. alternative radio stations, marginal/radical social movements) had little chance of reaching a mass audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461444811428899">Gamson and Wolfsfeld, 1993</xref>). This may be changing today due to the recent transformation of the news ecosystem (e.g. reduction of the conventional news outlets’ audience, formation and growing popularity of niche media) with unconventional and nonelite outlets producing content that can attract substantial audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811428899">Bimber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461444811428899">Trippi, 2004</xref>). To investigate whether traditional media organizations, powerful organized special interest groups, or other entities that we conceptualize as elite, dominate the UGC environment, we ask:
<disp-quote>
<p>RQ2: Do the content creators of YouTube’s most popular political news videos come from the ranks of elite or nonelite groups?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The dynamics existing among news organizations are also important to how news is constructed. Intermedia agenda setting, a process of reciprocal influence among different news organizations, is another factor shaping news content due to news organizations’ tendency to take cues from one another, particularly from the prestige press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444811428899">Gans, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461444811428899">Reese and Danielian, 1989</xref>). Although such inter-organizational dynamics are not a news information filter as conceptualized here, they nonetheless represent an important factor affecting news content at various stages of its production (e.g. deciding to begin investigating a potential story, deciding what details to include, deciding when to publish/air the story) and examining the nature of these dynamics can shed important light on the democratizing potential of the internet. Research clearly shows that intermedia dynamics are powerful determinants of what information is distributed to the masses and emphasized, and what information is withheld or trivialized, especially in an ambiguous or fast-changing information environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461444811428899">Shoemaker and Reese, 1991</xref>). Some speculate that UGC might be characterized by greater diversity of content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461444811428899">Maratea, 2008</xref>). Also, there is evidence that political UGC, generally, and the political section of YouTube, in particular, do offer original content and go beyond just replaying content ‘copied and pasted’ from traditional media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461444811428899">Harp and Tremayne, 2007</xref>). However, recent studies of new media technologies have also found that much of UGC can be traced back to traditional news organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461444811428899">Munger, 2008</xref>). Therefore, we ask:
<disp-quote>
<p>RQ3: To what extent is YouTube’s most popular political news content based on the work of traditional journalists?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, after going through the featured person/source filter and content creator filter, news information passes through the last filter, the video poster. The new internet-based software tools allow users to rate, recommend, tag, comment on, and share links to news stories from various sources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811428899">Bruns (2005)</xref> called this development ‘gatewatching’ because nonelite members of the news-sharing sites watch news flow from online news outlets and then choose which stories to upload, redistribute, or recommend to their fellow online community members. Gatewatching technology, which characterizes much of today’s UGC, allows nonelites, for the first time, to act as an effective collaborative filter before news flows to a mass audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811428899">Bruns, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461444811428899">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1461444811428899">Sunstein, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The video poster is somewhat comparable to a ‘news outlet’ in the pre-internet era because video posters disseminate information collected by themselves or others to the audience – a function traditionally performed by a news outlet. The difference from the pre-internet era, however, is that today anyone with a smartphone can act as this final link in the gatekeeping chain of collecting and distributing news information. In other words, the original content creators and video posters are no longer necessarily the same. Therefore, we argue that it is important to focus on not only the featured person/source and the creator of the news content, but also on the final distributors of the online news – the video poster. Therefore, we ask:

<p>RQ4: Do the video posters of YouTube’s most popular political news videos come from the ranks of elite or nonelite groups?</p>

<sec id="section5-1461444811428899">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Videos were captured from YouTube each month (on the 19th day of the month) for the five consecutive months (June, July, August, September, and October) preceding the 2008 US presidential election. Videos were also captured on Election Day to identify the crucial pre-election video content. In our sample we included the videos appearing on the first page of the YouTube database when sorted by (1) most viewed, (2) in news and politics section, (3) for the current month. Final analyses were based on 113 videos (seven videos were removed from YouTube by their owners or website administrators, or were in a language other than English).</p>
<p>Selecting the most viewed videos was important because of their vast audience reach, and as a result, a potential to be more influential on the aggregate level compared to the less popular videos. Such a purposive-sampling approach has been used widely in communication research due to the recognition that some types of news content are inherently more important to study than other types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461444811428899">Reese and Danielian, 1989</xref>). Restricting the sample to the first page of the most viewed news videos of the month was based on insights from the online search behavior research portraying internet search engine users as satisficers and cognitive misers. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1461444811428899">Silverstein et al. (1998)</xref> showed that 85 percent of users of the then-popular AltaVista search engine used just the first page of the search results. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461444811428899">Pass et al. (2006)</xref> examined AOL search engine user behavior and showed that 90 percent of the clicks went to the sites on the first page of the search results (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461444811428899">Pan et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Elite vs nonelite</title>
<p>Nonelites in all three categories of filters were operationalized as groups and individuals that were marginal and under-funded. Several slightly different operationalizations of elites vs nonelites were necessary to precisely differentiate between these two groups in the context of each of the three information filters examined in this study. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1461444811428899">Table 1</xref> for precise operationalization of elite vs nonelite source/featured person. For the second filter, content creators, we used identical conceptualization. However, operationalization was slightly different (e.g. we specified that a local NBC-affiliated TV station was an elite source in the coding instructions). For the third filter, video posters, the same operationalization of elites vs nonelites was used as for the second filter. For video posters, user’s screen name was consulted. If the name was ambiguous, the poster’s YouTube profile was examined to determine if (s)he belonged to elite or nonelite group.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>To avoid researcher bias, three doctoral communication students served as coders who were unfamiliar with the direction or the research questions of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811428899">Krippendorff, 2004</xref>). Coders trained for 35 hours. Ten percent of the sample was randomly selected and independently coded by all three coders to establish the reliability of the actual sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444811428899">Riffe et al., 1998</xref>). We base our reliability evaluation on Krippendorff’s <italic>alpha</italic> coefficient and, for comparison, also report simple agreement and Cohen’s <italic>kappa</italic>. As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1461444811428899">Table 2</xref>, only two variables fell short of the minimum recommended reliability level of 0.667 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811428899">Krippendorff, 2004</xref>).

<title>Results</title>
<p>Before addressing the research questions, it is important to examine the descriptive characteristics of the videos. In this sample, the average video was viewed 1,108,483.40 times and the median was viewed 814,559 times (<italic>SD</italic> = 1,046,122.13), ranging from 143,703 to 8,552,490 views. For comparison, <italic>NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams</italic> attracted an average of 7.98 million viewers in the second quarter of 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461444811428899">Greppi, 2008</xref>). The average length of the video was about 9 minutes (<italic>M</italic> = 525.14 seconds; <italic>SD</italic> = 1083.92 seconds).</p>
<p>Of the major 2008 presidential election contenders, Barack Obama was the most frequently featured person/source in the videos (featured in 28.3% of all the videos in the sample), followed by Sarah Palin (17.7%), John McCain (8.8%), Hillary Clinton (3.5%), Joe Biden (0.9%), and John Edwards (0.9%). The rest of the featured persons/sources included: journalists (6.19%), such as Lara Logan or Tim Russert; other politicians (5.31%), such as Jesse Jackson or Harry Reid; and celebrities (5.31%), such as Judge Judy or Will Smith.</p>
<p>About one quarter (23.89%) of all videos had at least two content creators and about a fifth (20.35%) had at least three content creators, indicating the presence of many compilation videos. About 27 percent of videos were clips from news programs (e.g. CNN shows, news shows on CBS, Sunday morning news talk shows), about 15 percent were professional partisan videos (e.g. political ads), about 11 percent were amateur videos (e.g. a recording of a political rally by a rally attendee), and less than 10 percent were comedy programs (e.g. late-night comedy shows).</p>
<p>Some notable ‘elite’ video posters included: the Obama campaign (12.39%), the <italic>Associated Press</italic> (4.42%), <italic>C-Span</italic> (4.42%), and the McCain campaign (2.65%). Some nonelite video posters included: mlmedia (3.54%) and barelypolitical (2.65%).</p>
<p>In RQ1, we asked if political news content about elites or nonelites dominated YouTube in terms of who was featured in the most popular videos, and the answer is clear: the number of videos featuring elites in the most popular videos vastly overshadowed the number of videos featuring nonelites. As can be seen on the left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1461444811428899">Figure 1</xref>, the ratio of the elite-featured persons to the nonelite-featured persons in the videos was more than 4 to 1, in favor of the elites.</p>

<p>The second research question asked if content creators of YouTube’s most popular political news videos came from the ranks of elite or nonelite groups. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1461444811428899">Figure 1</xref>, the number of video content creators belonging to the elite group was more than two times greater than the number of content creators belonging to the nonelite group.</p>
<p>The third research question asked how much of YouTube’s most popular political news content was based on the work of traditional journalists. The modal value was 100 percent reliance on the traditional media content. However, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1461444811428899">Figure 2</xref> shows, the distribution of reliance on traditional journalistic content in the videos was bimodal, peaking at no reliance (about 37% of all videos in the sample) and 100 percent reliance (about 45% of all videos in the sample), with the remaining videos falling in the middle. On average, over 56 percent of content in videos was traditional media content (<italic>M =</italic> 56.87%; <italic>SD =</italic> 47.64).</p>

<sec id="section12-1461444811428899" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study showed that YouTube’s most popular political news videos tend to feature elites (i.e. elite dominance of filter 1), be created by elites (i.e. elite dominance of filter 2), and generally consist of traditional media content (i.e. further evidence of elite dominance of filter 2). Domination of elites among featured persons/sources fits well with the findings from the extant research on sourcing in the sociology of news literature. For example, of all the sources used in the news articles about the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, approximately 24 percent were nonelite (e.g. fishermen, average citizens) and 76 percent were elite (e.g. representatives of government, oil industry) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1461444811428899">Smith, 1993</xref>). Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1461444811428899">Wittebols (1995)</xref> showed that in the coverage of terrorism by the major US networks, elites were represented by 66 percent of sources (e.g. government officials), and nonelites by 34 percent of sources (e.g. families of victims). Similarly, we find that even in what may be argued to be the most democratic information outlet – a user-generated video-sharing website – elites undeniably dominate in terms of proportion of the sources featured in the popular YouTube videos. Additionally, we find that in the same democratic information environment, where anyone can participate and, at least theoretically, ‘rise to the top,’ elites dominate the proportion of the video content creators. Therefore, our findings lend descriptive support to the internet skeptics who believe that elites often manage to find ways to dominate the newest technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444811428899">Davis and Owen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1461444811428899">Winner, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Also, a significantly greater presence of elite vs nonelite content creators and a significant presence of traditional journalists’ work in our sample of the most popular YouTube political videos go against some recent claims that we are witnessing a ‘virtual elimination of the gatekeeping role of the mainstream press’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1461444811428899">Williams and Delli Carpini, 2004</xref>: 1208). Our descriptive findings suggest that the old institutional structure of news media is still alive and well: Traditional media still retain a strong hold on what content the masses consume. Such findings are particularly striking because they were obtained from YouTube – an egalitarian website visited by millions of users and where any user can post any content.</p>
<p>However, we do find evidence of the democratization of the gatekeeping process – specifically, for the third filter. Nonelites (e.g. disadvantaged groups and citizens) were overwhelmingly posting the majority of the most viewed political news videos on YouTube. This indicates that the third filter, video posters, was not controlled by elites; rather, the third filter was more influenced by nonelites. Additionally, over one-third of the most popular videos in the sample relied on no traditional media content at all, which shows a small amount of democratization for the second filter of content creators. All of this suggests that citizens can now create their own political news content, independent of mainstream traditional media, and effectively distribute it to a massive audience.</p>
<sec id="section13-1461444811428899">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One potential limitation of this study is that it deals with several variables with complex operational definitions. In this study, we strove to avoid the ‘precision at the cost of problem significance’ pitfall that characterizes many content analytic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444811428899">Holsti, 1969</xref>: 10). We examined gatekeeping from the perspectives of three different filters, in order to obtain the maximum confidence in terms of deriving insights into today’s gatekeeping process. As we strove to preserve the intricate conceptual nature of several variables in how they were operationalized and coded, the intercoder reliability for several variables became less than ideal. We believe that relatively low alphas obtained for several variables are not problematic in the present case. A lower alpha level (such as .667) is ‘appropriate for research that is breaking new ground with concepts that are rich in analytical value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444811428899">Riffe et al., 1998</xref>: 151). Second, lower reliability levels are also appropriate when using conservative reliability coefficients, such as Krippendorff’s alpha (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461444811428899">Lombard et al., 2002</xref>: 600). However, some suggest that the results involving variables with relatively low intercoder reliability should be viewed as tentative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444811428899">Riffe et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Another potential limitation is the possibility that some video posters misrepresented their true identities (i.e. elites disguising as nonelites), a practice known as ‘astroturfing’ in online political campaigning. While astroturfing was hypothetically possible, we believe there is a low probability that such misrepresentation has actually occurred. Videos in our analyses were intentionally rather visible and any astroturfing attempts involving them would likely draw public scrutiny and would be quickly revealed in the mainstream and alternative media. A LexisNexis search for the terms ‘astroturf’ and ‘astroturfing’ and subsequent analysis of the returned articles from <italic>The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today</italic>, and <italic>The Washington Times</italic> from January 1, 2008 through January 1, 2009 revealed that there were no reported astroturfing attempts during the 2008 presidential campaign involving YouTube.</p>
<p>No study is perfectly generalizable to all contexts – this one is no exception. Another limitation is the lack of generalizability to non-election news periods. We specifically examined the most viewed political news content posted to YouTube during a presidential campaign. Therefore, the conclusions of elite and nonelite influence should not be interpreted outside the bounds of election cycles. However, a recent study on YouTube’s political content from the 2008 election to early 2010 found evidence that the UGC forum that is YouTube is becoming more mainstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811428899">May, 2010</xref>). YouTube content is becoming increasingly dominated by elite media organizations and, thus, it has become increasingly filtered, in part due to the sheer quantity of videos that they upload (e.g. the Associated Press uploads between 25–40 videos per day) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811428899">May, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811428899">May’s (2010)</xref> study reinforces our study’s results because the author found that elites are a driving force on YouTube even beyond an election period.</p>
<p>The final limitation is our focus on the video-sharing form of UGC. Although this format is one of the most popular ways to share and consume UGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444811428899">Pew Internet and American Life Project, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461444811428899">2009b)</xref>, researchers should examine political content on wikis, discussion forums, blogs, participatory journalism sites, and so forth to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the nature and political implications of UGC.</p>

<title>Implications and future research</title>
<p>The results of this descriptive study indicate a potential shift in news gatekeeping online. Traditionally, news passed through filters firmly controlled by elite sources, professional journalists, and established news organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444811428899">Bass, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444811428899">Shoemaker, 1991</xref>). Also, it was the norm for news organizations to create news content <italic>and</italic> then distribute it to their audiences. Our study shows that even in one of the most egalitarian UGC environments elites are overwhelmingly the featured source in news reports. Traditional news organizations and other elite groups also control the news creation filter.</p>
<p>However, nonelites dominate the distribution filter. Nonelite individuals acting as video posters are deciding what news clips to record, edit, and post. Although elite mainstream news content creators still produce the majority of the popular content, nonelite individuals, communities, and organizations can effectively filter this content in or out, and thus influence what type of content the more passive and numerous masses consume.</p>
<p>Several researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444811428899">Bennett and Iyengar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461444811428899">Chaffee and Metzger, 2001</xref>) have argued that recent social and technological changes in mass media necessitate a critical re-evaluation of some existing communication theories and assumptions. Results of this study tentatively support this argument. Gatekeeping theory can be utilized to effectively trace the flow of information found online from its origin to its final distribution point to better understand how the internet impacts the public sphere. We do not recommend doing away with the traditional thinking on how news gets produced or disseminated. Indeed, this study’s results reflect many of the conventional sociology of news propositions (e.g. elites’ domination over news sourcing and production). However, we do find evidence that the discipline should update communication theory in order to reflect today’s active-audience reality. For example, it appears that a revision of the traditional gatekeeping model is in order: we should add a new filter – the active audience – as the last gatekeeper (or gatewatcher, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811428899">Bruns, 2005</xref>) in the process of news information dissemination. With this last filter, the gatekeeping concept appears to be drastically different from what it was during the pre-internet era.</p>
<p>We cannot make predictions about YouTube users’ motivations, nor can we make predictions about any effects of YouTube’s political news content. This is where future research would be instrumental. This study demonstrated that online users and communities now have access to new gatekeeping power through distributing UGC. Future research should investigate whether users are taking professionally produced content and are amplifying its frame or countering it. The latter possibility would further support the ‘internet-empowerment’ thesis.</p>
<p>Additionally, gatekeeping is a complex process. This study focused on three important filters in the news dissemination channel. However, there are many forces influencing what news stories reach the audience, including traditional and nontraditional news organizations, special-interest groups, norms dominant in traditional and nontraditional news industries, characteristics of journalists, discussions taking place on social network sites and blogs, and so forth. Research on whether today’s nonelites benefit from those forces, especially compared to elites, can greatly complement the present work. For example, it is important to survey today’s drastically altered journalism industry landscape to document whether existing journalistic organizations fall into the elite or nonelite camps. Investigating these questions will add the much-needed evidence in regards to the position of elites versus nonelites in today’s society, and will add important clarity and nuance to the debate between internet pessimists and optimists.</p>
