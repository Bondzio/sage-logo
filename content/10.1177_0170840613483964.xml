<p>What do exotic dancers, nurses, labourers and, more recently, investment bankers have in common? They are all practitioners of <italic>dirty work</italic>, according to the authors of this edited volume, defined by the editors as ‘tasks, occupations and roles that are likely to be perceived as disgusting or degrading’ (p. 1). Given the relative paucity of research on the nature and experience of – and responses to – stigmatized work, with its ‘invisible status’ (p. 2), this book is a very welcome addition.</p>
<p>The introduction by the editors provides one of the strongest contributions with its thumbnail history of the literature, emphasis on the socially constructed nature of ‘dirt’, associations between (low prestige) dirty work and socioeconomic class, gender, and race, and elegant chapter previews. The editors accurately signal to the reader the book’s emphasis on the contested and fluid boundary between ‘clean’ and ‘dirty’, and the importance of social, cultural, and temporal contexts in the social construction and experience of taint. However, as often happens with anthologies, there is a marked unevenness in the quality of the subsequent contributions. There is also an over-sampling of sex work and medical work, interesting as these occupations may be. And although the book begins with the tantalizing claim that it ‘sets out a research agenda for the study of dirty work’ (p. 1), such an agenda remains tacit at best.</p>
<p>Given how diverse the chapters are, let me provide a tour. Following the introduction, the book gets off to a rough start with two chapters that I found pretty hard to track (fortunately, the editors offer somewhat clearer previews). Höpfl provides a fairly meandering discussion of contamination. Along the way, she visits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840613483964">Kristeva’s (1987)</xref> distinction between the body (‘embodied experience’, p. 21) and the law (‘authority and regulation’, p. 22), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840613483964">Diderot’s (1957 [1773]</xref>) characterization of the acting profession as prostitution, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840613483964">Canetti’s (1962 [1960]</xref>) notion of ‘sting’ (p. 29) and resentment against authority, among others. The takeaway, I gather, is that organizations define what is pure (worthy) and impure (unworthy), casting the employee as debased ‘actor’ (p. 32) and thereby fostering resentment (and possibly revenge). One of Höpfl’s more provocative asides contrasted ‘the apparent purity of the abstract [with] the dangerous implications of embodied experience’ (p. 28). Dirt, it appears, is often in the details.</p>
<p>Vachhani focuses on ‘the ambivalence of the stain’ (p. 41). On one hand, stains can be thought of as visible soiling, as in scars and bodily fluids, bringing ‘<italic>disorder to order</italic>’ (p. 35, her emphasis). Similarly, symbolic stains, such as the taint of dirty work, threaten to contaminate the character of those who are associated with them. On the other hand, stains can be thought of more positively, as in the use of tattoos to express identity and the use of pigments to stain bacteria so as to expose pathology, bringing ‘<italic>order to disorder</italic>’ (p. 35). I admit that I’m greatly dumbing down her analysis, largely because stretches of the chapter and the opaque quotes from Grosz and Diprose were beyond my poor means to decipher.</p>
<p>The book picks up steam with Stanley and Mackenzie-Davey’s offering. They pose a very intriguing question: ‘What happens when an occupation becomes tainted for the first time?’ (p. 55). Most research on dirty work focuses on occupations where the taint is well-institutionalized in society’s view, as are the occupations’ protective ideologies. In contrast, the authors raise the example of the condemnation of investment bankers in the wake of the recent economic crisis. As such, the stigma they focus on is akin to that of senior management in the wake of corporate failure or to organizational members of all stripes in the wake of allegations of corruption. The authors argue that because the condemnation occurs after individuals’ entry into the occupation, causing a jarring transition from ‘“high flyer” to “crook”’ (p. 61) in the case of the investment bankers, and focuses on their behaviours and imputed motives (e.g. greed) – on their <italic>selves</italic> rather than their occupation per se – the individuals will vehemently dispute the condemnation. More broadly, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840613483964">Dick (2005)</xref>, Stanley and Mackenzie-Davey call for more research on the social construction of dirty work, particularly the dynamic interplay between the rhetorical strategies of ‘society’s arbiters’ (p. 59) of taint (e.g. media, politicians) and those of affected individuals.</p>
<p>Tyler’s chapter focuses on the sensemaking of sex shop workers in London’s Soho district. This is a reworked version of her <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840613483964">2011</xref> paper in <italic>Human Relations</italic>. Indeed, a fair bit of text has been borrowed more or less verbatim, along with quotations and the theoretical conclusions. That said, the insights she distils remain very provocative. One is how the geographical boundaries of the Soho red light district foster a localized culture that is far more permissive than the surrounding society. It’s not hard to imagine how this localized culture would help normalize the sex industry such that what is seen to be deviant outside of Soho is taken more in stride within Soho. Tyler’s study thus speaks to the important role of socially constructed boundaries for creating territories of normalcy. A second insight is the ‘simultaneous sense of attraction and repulsion and an apparent desire not to “clean up” dirty work, but rather to revel … in its filth’ (p. 66). That is, the workers found an ‘alluring fascination’ (p. 83) with the edginess of Soho, its stigma and the practices that fuelled the stigma serving to attract as much as repel. As with forbidden fruit, black-hat characters, and car wrecks, there is a certain atavistic and rebellious pleasure to be derived from observing if not immersing oneself occasionally in the underside of society that defies convention.</p>
<p>Grandy and Mavin’s contribution focuses on how exotic dancers ‘“do gender” within socially constructed sex and stigmatised hierarchies’ (p. 91). Although the editors characterize this occupation as ‘another underresearched form of work’ (p. 14), it actually strikes me as one of the most well-researched of the low-prestige dirty work occupations – perhaps reflecting society’s endless fascination with commercialized sex. Grandy and Mavin underscore the malleability of esteem-enhancing social constructions. While exotic dancers fully recognize their stigmatized status, they draw edifying comparisons between themselves and other occupational members, particularly ‘the lifer’ (p. 102; who views exotic dancing as a career, not a temporary means to make money), ‘the dirty dancer’ (p. 109; who engages in ‘illegal, immoral or unprofessional’ [p. 109] behaviour), and ‘the competitor’ (p. 99; who ‘adopts a “win-at-all-cost” attitude’ [p. 109] and poaches dances from others). One gets the sense that these roles have become reified as archetypes – institutionalized foils for affirming one’s own ‘good girl’ (p. 103) qualities. In noting the malleability – and multiplicity – of good girl and bad girl roles, the authors hint at how difficult it often is to convincingly and permanently place one’s character on the ‘good’ side of the divide; said one dancer, ‘It makes it hard because you do to an extent feel like you’re cheating [<italic>bad girl</italic>], even though we’re not doing anything wrong [<italic>good girl</italic>]’ (p. 110, emphasis in original). Occupational justifications appear inherently porous.</p>
<p>Selmi rounds out the trilogy of sex work chapters with a short treatment of how phone sex workers reframe their work to make it more personally palatable. One way is to psychologically distance themselves from the clients with demeaning labels such as ‘perverts’ (p. 121), ‘mentally ill’ (p. 122), and ‘loser’ (p. 123). However, this distancing begs the unanswered question of how the workers can draw edifying meaning if their clients are seen as so contemptible (i.e. So why am I serving perverts?). Much like the service workers so well documented in the burnout literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840613483964">Maslach, 1982</xref>), who vainly attempt to protect themselves from needy and emotionally draining clients by demeaning those clients, this seems like a reactive and ultimately pyrrhic victory.</p>
<p>McMurray offers an intriguing examination, dating back to Florence Nightingale, of ‘nursing’s claims to dirt and with it occupational identity and worth’ (p. 131). It’s often been observed that dirt rolls downhill to lower status occupations, and this is very apparent in medicine, with doctors eschewing physically, socially, and morally tainted tasks. McMurray notes that Nightingale trumpeted the importance of hygiene and sanitation, embracing the cleansing of dirt as an important and noble cause. More recently, ANPs (advanced nurse practitioners) have claimed certain tasks traditionally practised by doctors, thereby combining ‘the dirty work of care with curative regimes’ (p. 140) and thus blurring the line between ‘dirty’ nursing and ‘clean’ doctoring. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840613483964">Douglas’ (1966</xref>, p. 35) oft-cited definition of dirt as ‘matter out of place’, McMurray notes that the ANPs themselves may be seen as dirt by their threatened colleagues (a refrain echoed in Simpson, Slutskaya, and Hughes’ chapter on males in the female-typed occupation of nursing).</p>
<p>White and Pullen document how intensive care patients are part of a ‘complex circuit’ (p. 143), connecting bodies with invasive technology and medical procedures. The emphasis on sterility, piercing the body hygienically to introduce intravenous drugs, and containing and assessing ‘leakages from the body’ (p. 156), makes dirt an ‘absent presence’ (p. 160). The chapter provides an unusual perspective on the book’s mission to explore ‘how the boundaries between “clean” and “dirty” are negotiated and defined’ (p. 1), focusing on the medical rituals through which the boundaries are maintained.</p>
<p>As with sex work, there are three chapters on medical work, with Simpson et al.’s chapter rounding out the latter. These authors examine the interaction of gender and dirty work in nursing. On one hand, they find that males lean on traditional notions of masculine toughness in their claimed ‘ability to “stomach” the physical “dirtiness” of the job’ (p. 172), and on their shared gender with male doctors in sloughing off the social taint of servility that is often encountered by female nurses in their interactions with dismissive male doctors. On the other hand, male nurses encounter moral taint when providing intimate care for female patients, a taint that female nurses escape when dealing with male patients because of the cultural coding of such care as feminine. The authors offer the very insightful observation that ‘dirty work may appear “dirtier” when some groups undertake it’ (p. 181) because of cultural expectations associated with those groups. For example, ‘servile roles may appear to have more servility … when men perform them … and dangerous jobs may seem more hazardous … when women undertake them’ (p. 181). This relativity of dirt is likely no less true of other socially fraught demographic groups, particularly race and socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840613483964">Ashforth &amp; Kreiner, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Swan provides an indirect take on dirty work. She discusses how a 2007 glossy supplement of ‘one high-end monthly British magazine’ (p. 191), <italic>Harper’s Bazaar</italic>, frames ‘how women can uphold their middle-class career, their appearance and their lifestyle when there is no time’ (pp. 192–3). The models gleam amidst ‘imagery of whiteness and cleanliness’ (p. 201) and the nasty reality of domestic labour is quietly outsourced (‘gloss without the dross’, p. 201, is the author’s nicely turned phrase). Swan argues that this frame fits snugly within a wider cultural and historical narrative that sees ‘cleanliness and whiteness … as cultural codes for a certain classed and racialised form of femininity’ (p. 183). Indeed, Swan quotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840613483964">Anderson’s (2000)</xref> observation that, in Victorian England, domestic workers served ‘as a foil to the lady of the house’ (p. 187). I would add that contemporary ethnographies of dirty work suggest that today’s status-conscious societies still measure one’s social worth by one’s distance from dirt and the ‘dirty’ who attend it.</p>
<p>Lee-Treweek invokes a more colloquial definition of dirty work in her examination of how Polish immigrants to the UK come to terms with performing ‘low-skilled industrial labour’ (p. 219). What makes this task doubly difficult is the failure of many of them ‘to gain employment commensurate with one’s skills and education’ (p. 221). Although her interviewees invoked tropes such as earning a wage, taking pride in a job well done, and living up to their notion of ‘the “good migrant worker”’ (p. 212), Lee-Treweek argues that the menial and repetitive nature of the work makes it quite resistant to edifying meaning. Indeed, the irony of being stigmatized because of physical, social, or moral ‘dirt’ is that handling that dirt often becomes a source of pride in itself, thereby restoring some esteem (at least among one’s occupational culture). Work that is simply grindingly boring, however, provides fewer hooks for one’s pride.</p>
<p>Lewis’s chapter closes the book with more of a whimper than a bang as it requires the reader to accept a very elastic notion of dirty work. The chapter focuses on the case of a female entrepreneur who felt defensive about her decision to not cut corners in her homemaker and mother roles. Lewis argues that the woman’s disgust at the rude behaviour and casual attire of other female entrepreneurs at several business events ‘allowed her to associate herself with the conventional masculinity of entrepreneurship … and to establish a boundary between her and other women so as to avoid being considered as “one of them”’ (p. 235). Fair enough, but the argument would be much more persuasive if the disparaged women were enacting more stereotypically feminine roles rather than just sounding like entrepreneurial boors.</p>
<p>It would have been very helpful if the book had closed with some kind of postscript to the initial provocative themes raised in the introduction. After journeying through 13 quite disparate chapters, I was hungry for some theoretical closure (and for the missing ‘research agenda’, p. 1), even if it only involved revisiting those earlier themes. Still, let me close this review by returning to my earlier point; warts and all, this book remains a very welcome addition to an important but neglected area.</p>
