<abstract>
<p>In Cohen’s vision of the just society, there would be no need for unequalizing incentives so as to benefit the least well-off; instead, people would be motivated by an egalitarian ethos to work hard and in the most socially productive jobs. As such, Cohen appears to offer a way to mitigate the trade-off of equality for efficiency that often characterizes theorizing about distributive justice. This article presents an egalitarian challenge to Cohen’s vision of the just society. I argue that a society where all internalized the egalitarian ethos would be one lacking equal respect among its members, in which certain groups lacked the grounds of self-respect. Section 1 defends equal respect and a form of equality of self-respect as values with broad-based appeal to egalitarians, and argues that a particular form of hierarchy would undermine both equal respect and the grounds of self-respect. Sections 2 and 3 reveal that just such a hierarchy would emerge in a society in which all had internalized the egalitarian ethos, in the case of both carers and the untalented. Thus, Cohen’s proposed society is shown to fail to unite equality and efficiency. Instead, Cohen’s society would be characterized by a lack of equality.</p>

<body>
<p>Theorizing about distributive justice is often conducted as though trade-offs must be made between equality and efficiency. The Rawlsian incentives argument exemplifies one such trade-off: without unequalizing incentives, especially talented workers would work less hard and fewer would choose demanding jobs, and thus less would be produced; if the talented produce less, then less can be redistributed to the least well-off. Hence, we should allow unequalizing incentives for the talented so as to benefit most the least well-off. Such unequalizing incentives would leave everyone better off, and, as such, justify a move from equality of income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470594X12447777">1</xref></sup> Cohen argues, however, that the ‘persuasive power of this defence of inequality has helped to drive authentic egalitarianism, of an old-fashioned, uncompromising kind, out of contemporary political philosophy’ (1995: 160).</p>
<p>On this basis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470594X12447777">Cohen (2008)</xref> offers an alternative vision of the just society, in which an egalitarian distribution would not be distorted by such unequalizing incentives. Instead, members of Cohen’s just society would possess an egalitarian ethos motivating them to work hard and in the most socially productive jobs, thus rescuing ‘authentic egalitarianism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470594X12447777">2</xref></sup> Cohen describes this ethos as ‘a structure of responses lodged in the motivations that inform everyday life’, which would motivate everyone to benefit the worst-off as much as possible, within the bounds of a personal prerogative (2008: 123).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470594X12447777">3</xref></sup> Cohen provides the example of someone who could be a doctor, but prefers the less socially productive job of gardening. Guided by his or her egalitarian ethos, the doctor-gardener would choose to be a doctor without demanding unequalizing incentives in the form of pay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470594X12447777">Cohen, 2008</xref>: 184–6).</p>
<p>Cohen suggests that the ‘nuts and bolts’ of this society are provided by Carens’ market system in which jobs pay differing amounts in accordance with their degree of social productivity, so that the talented know which job to select in order to follow their egalitarian ethos and most benefit the least well-off: the one which pays the most. All income inequalities are then taxed away.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470594X12447777">4</xref></sup> As such, in Cohen’s society, that people possess the egalitarian ethos mitigates the need to trade efficiency for equality, or equality for efficiency.</p>
<p>Replies to Cohen usually attack his society either from a distinctively liberal perspective, by arguing that it undermines freedom of occupational choice or variety in ways of life,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470594X12447777">5</xref></sup> or from a Rawlsian perspective, by defending the Rawlsian restriction of the scope of justice to the basic structure, and so resisting Cohen’s extension of its scope to individuals’ choices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470594X12447777">6</xref></sup> Often, these objections consider the talented, such as Pogge’s concern for Clara, who would rather be a labourer, but owing to her talents should be a manager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470594X12447777">Pogge, 2000</xref>: 146). But such objections leave the egalitarian motivation of Cohen’s vision untouched. Worries of illiberalism or arguments for restricting justice to the basic structure do not address Cohen’s central claim to have proposed a more equal society. Further, as Cohen states against focusing on the talented, ‘The egalitarian can concede without qualm that a talented person’s life is less attractive in an equal society than it is when she is at or near the top of an unequal one,’ since her life will be more similar to the ‘common lot’ (2008: 206). An egalitarian’s concern, however, is with the ‘common lot’.</p>
<p>Hence, in this article I instead propose an <italic>egalitarian</italic> challenge to Cohen’s vision of the just society, denying that he unites equality and efficiency. As such, I undermine the very motivation of Cohen’s alternative just society. In Section 1, I argue that equal respect and a form of equality of self-respect are values with broad egalitarian appeal, and that a particular kind of hierarchy would undermine them. In sections 2 and 3, I then contend that just such a hierarchy arises within a society in which all internalize the egalitarian ethos, with respect to carers and the untalented.</p>
<sec id="section1-1470594X12447777">
<title>1. Equal respect and self-respect</title>
<p>I first characterize the two values on which my egalitarian challenge is based: equal respect among citizens and status self-respect. Using these values to challenge Cohen echoes the similarly based challenges to luck egalitarianism from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470594X12447777">Anderson (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470594X12447777">Wolff (1998)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470594X12447777">7</xref></sup> I argue that these values give the challenge broad reach among egalitarians, covering both those who regard respect as an important dimension of equality and those like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470594X12447777">Arneson (2000)</xref> who hold a purely distributive conception of justice, denying that respect is itself an egalitarian value. I then argue that a particular form of status hierarchy, liable to emerge in Cohen’s society, would undermine equal respect and self-respect.</p>
<p>First, I consider equal respect among citizens, which is an often-cited, but poorly defined egalitarian value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470594X12447777">8</xref></sup> For many egalitarians, equal respect is one important dimension of equality; others go further and contend that relational equality should be at the heart of egalitarian theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1470594X12447777">9</xref></sup> I take there to be equal respect among citizens when citizens regard each other as having equal status within the political domain and where no group systematically lacks status across the social domain in failing to be regarded as equals in all, or nearly all, areas of life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1470594X12447777">10</xref></sup> The significance of the social domain in securing equal respect is illustrated by reflecting on cases in which all have equal political status, such as the right to vote, and yet society is marred by the kind of relations that egalitarians tend to find troubling: consider societies with strong class or caste systems that are characterized by relations of condescension or servile behaviour or those societies in which women are regarded as unworthy of equal respect. I shortly return to elaborate on what it is for a society to be characterized by unequal respect across the social domain in a way that should trouble egalitarians, when discussing status hierarchies.</p>
<p>The second egalitarian value I consider is one dimension of self-respect: status self-respect. Self-respect can roughly be characterized as having due respect for oneself or having a sense of one’s own worth, and is generally regarded as important; Rawls calls it ‘perhaps the most important primary good’ (1971: 440). Status self-respect is that dimension of self-respect which is grounded upon one’s status within society, and so upon the respect of others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1470594X12447777">11</xref></sup> This dimension of self-respect is an aspect of recognition rather than appraisal respect, in concerning a person’s status or position rather than some positive appraisal of the excellences of that person’s characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1470594X12447777">12</xref></sup> As a contrast to possessing this status self-respect, consider someone who has to forage in bins for food in a society in which such an activity undermines one’s ‘respect-standing’ or someone regarded as a parasite on the rest of society, such as an unemployed person within a culture holding that those on welfare are ‘work-shy layabouts’.</p>
<p>The two egalitarian values I consider are intertwined. Someone who lacks equal respect of the sort earlier described, so lacking equal standing in the political sphere or lacking equal respect across the social domain (or both), lacks the grounds of status self-respect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1470594X12447777">13</xref></sup> They lack the sort of respect from others required to underpin status self-respect, in lacking the status or standing within society that is required for it. Conversely, if people feel they lack status in lacking status self-respect, they may be led to convey this lack to others, for instance by behaving in a fawning manner or allowing others to be inconsiderate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1470594X12447777">14</xref></sup> Hence, lacking status self-respect may undermine equal respect. The intertwining of these values means that, on the one hand, there is extra reason to value status self-respect if one is a relational egalitarian, or among those such as Dworkin who regard respect as one important dimension of equality, and, on the other, reason for those who reject the intrinsic importance of equal respect to value it as the grounds of one dimension of self-respect.</p>
<p>Further, status self-respect is an important dimension of self-respect: one who lacks the respect of others lacks an important ground of self-respect, as it is hard to respect oneself when others do not respect you or when one regards oneself as lacking a respect-worthy position. To support further the importance of status self-respect, in particular for welfare or access to advantage egalitarians such as Cohen, one could note the relation between the perception of unequal status and health outcomes. For instance (and there are many such instances), the Whitehall studies found that those on the lowest pay grade of the civil service had a death rate three times higher than those on the highest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1470594X12447777">15</xref></sup> Civil servants in the UK do not lack access to health care, food, and so on, which is taken to suggest it is not shortage of money itself which causes the problems, but instead the inequality in citizens’ status that comes with financial inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470594X12447777">Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009</xref>). Such evidence gives reason for welfare or access to advantage egalitarians, such as Cohen, to be concerned with people’s perception of their status, and so with status self-respect and equal respect.</p>
<p>A question remains over what form of equality of status self-respect should concern egalitarians. The role of status self-respect in securing equal respect, argued for earlier, suggests that those egalitarians concerned with respect should pursue straightforward equality of status self-respect – or at least, equality of the grounds of self-respect. But one might object to using the value of equal grounds of self-respect to attack Cohen given he holds an equal access to advantage conception of equality; instead, equal access to the grounds of self-respect would seem the relevant form of equality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1470594X12447777">16</xref></sup> Consider a person who could have had a job bestowing status, but instead opts to root in bins for food and thus suffer society’s scorn. Such a person had the opportunity to have the grounds of status self-respect, and thus (a Cohenite may claim) there is no injustice in leaving that person lacking such grounds. Since the challenge of this article still runs if one accepts that what matters is equal access to the grounds of status self-respect, as I demonstrate at the end of Section 2, for the purposes of this article I accept this characterization of the value of status self-respect.</p>
<p>In the rest of the article, I offer an egalitarian challenge to Cohen’s society based on the values of equal respect and self-respect. Being based on these two values, the challenge has broad reach among egalitarians, as illustrated by the comments I have offered in their defence. The only variety of egalitarian who could ignore this article’s challenge is one endorsing equality of resources alone, unconcerned with relational equality, self-respect, or well-being. Cohen is not such an egalitarian. In the remainder of this section, I begin my challenge to Cohen by arguing his society is vulnerable to the emergence of an inegalitarian hierarchy that undermines equal respect and status self-respect. In Sections 2 and 3, I then argue that such a hierarchy would emerge in a society in which all internalize the egalitarian ethos.</p>
<sec id="section2-1470594X12447777">
<title>Inegalitarian status hierarchies</title>
<p>I begin by arguing that a particular form of hierarchy is inegalitarian because it leads to unequal relations of respect of a sort troubling to egalitarians, so undermining the grounds of status self-respect for those at the bottom. I then argue that Cohen’s society is particularly vulnerable to such a form of hierarchy. It might seem, at first glance, that all hierarchical societies tend to undermine equal relations among citizens, given they involve an ordered ranking of persons, with these ranks having unequal power or status. Often egalitarians talk in general terms of social and political hierarchies undermining equal standing, suggesting that they think all such inequalities are incompatible with relations among equals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1470594X12447777">17</xref></sup> However, this is overstated: even in egalitarian societies, consensual hierarchies of power in the workplace, where managers give orders to workers, are likely. It is unclear that such hierarchies should trouble egalitarians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1470594X12447777">18</xref></sup> Thus, it is not a matter of definition that hierarchies are inegalitarian.</p>
<p>However, at least one form of status hierarchy is inegalitarian. A status hierarchy is one whereby the hierarchy’s roles are valued unequally, such that there is a known status inequality between different roles, and those at the top have greater status and those at the bottom have lesser status. Status hierarchies may not always lead to unequal respect. Lucas, for example, proposes creating multiple hierarchies, so that even if someone is bottom of one hierarchy, they may be top of another. For instance, a servant may be near the bottom of the hierarchy at work, but be captain of the pigeon-fanciers’ club (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470594X12447777">Lucas, 1977</xref>: 226–68).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1470594X12447777">19</xref></sup> In such a case, it seems that the servant may have grounds for equal respect from others and for status self-respect, in virtue of his role in the pigeon-fancier’s club.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1470594X12447777">20</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Two requirements must be met, however, if Lucas’s solution is to prevent unequal respect and loss of self-respect arising from social hierarchies. First, these hierarchies must be valued roughly equally: if most members of society consider the pigeon-fanciers’ club to be nowhere near as important as one’s job, then success in the former hierarchy will not contribute to equal relations with other members of society nor ground status self-respect. Second, the hierarchies must be independent of one another; for instance, if being a servant has a knock-on effect such that one is also likely to be near the bottom of other hierarchies, then multiple hierarchies will not ensure relations of equal respect. From this, one can draw a sufficient condition for a status hierarchy to be inegalitarian: when the hierarchy has unified, dominating importance among members of society. By the hierarchy having unified importance, I mean all, or almost all, members of the society share in the particular value system expressed through the hierarchy, such as if everyone ranks each other according to profession. By the hierarchy having dominating importance, I mean the hierarchy’s value trumps that of other hierarchies or influences one’s position in the hierarchies of other spheres of life. In a society ordered by a hierarchy with such importance, there would be a lack of equal respect among citizens and those at the bottom would lack the grounds of status self-respect.</p>
<p>Should a status hierarchy emerge as a result of citizens internalizing the egalitarian ethos, it would be an inegalitarian one, meeting this sufficient condition. The egalitarian ethos creates a unified sense of value: everyone in Cohen’s society internalizes the egalitarian ethos as part of their value system. Further, doing badly with respect to the egalitarian ethos would have deeper significance for relations of respect than reaching the top of the pigeon-fanciers’ club, since captaining the pigeon-fanciers’ club has no equivalent value to fulfilling the demands of justice. Thus, a hierarchy centred on following the egalitarian ethos would have dominating value, given justice has trumping value as compared to, say, private hobbies. In addition, in Cohen’s society, the demands of justice apply across many spheres of life. The egalitarian ethos guides not only one’s choice of job, but also one’s actions in everyday life, such as when one stops work, whether one attempts to get extra orders for one’s business and, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470594X12447777">Titelbaum (2008</xref>: 290) claims, even geographical location and retirement age.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1470594X12447777">21</xref></sup> The next section further illustrates the way the ethos spreads over life in considering its relevance to decisions to care for relatives or friends. Since the ethos provides a unified and dominating way to assess the value of one’s activities across many spheres of life, little of life would be independent from the hierarchy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1470594X12447777">22</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Hence, if a status hierarchy emerges regarding one’s complying with the ethos, it would be inegalitarian: its dominating and unified importance would undermine equal respect among citizens and those at the bottom of the hierarchy would lack the grounds of status self-respect because of that lack of respect and their sense of inferiority owing to their low position in the hierarchy. I argue in the next two sections that, in two particular cases, just such a form of hierarchy would emerge in a society in which all possessed the egalitarian ethos. Further, these two cases cannot satisfactorily be mitigated by the Cohenite response that members of the groups in question have equal access to self-respect.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1470594X12447777">
<title>2. Carers</title>
<p>I first argue that an inegalitarian status hierarchy would emerge in Cohen’s society regarding non-professional carers. Non-professional carers are those who engage in full-time care which takes as its object a particular individual, motivated by affection or family ties. In this article, when discussing this kind of care I consider its paradigmatic instances, for example, parents caring for their children, grandchildren caring for their grandparents or care for the infirm. This form of care should be contrasted to contracted professional care, whereby people employ someone else to perform the caring role. The problem Cohen faces concerning non-professional carers stems from the fact that, prima facie, choosing to care full-time for an individual would often fail to be one’s most socially productive role. Non-professional caring for a particular individual is unlikely to be the most efficient form of care available: society might provide wonderful care homes for the elderly or infirm and nurseries for children, providing excellent group care. Such group care would be more efficient since it frees more people to do other productive jobs rather than does non-professional individual care, while still ensuring quality care.</p>
<p>It might be objected that parental care produces better future citizens than nursery care, and hence has significant social benefits. Thus, parents’ most socially productive role may be to stay home, rather than perform another job while placing their child in group care. In response, first, this objection does not apply to caring for infirm adults or the elderly: caring for one’s grandmother, for instance, cannot be defended on the grounds that it produces better future citizens. Second, the evidence for the benefits of parental rather than nursery care during the working day is both contested and inconclusive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1470594X12447777">23</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Hence, choosing to be a carer is often unlikely to be an individual’s most socially productive role. This leads to a problem: it appears that Cohen’s society would permit few to choose to be full-time non-professional carers, yet many would claim it is, in general, desirable to accommodate people’s choices to be carers when it comes to paradigmatic cases such as parents caring for children or caring for the elderly and infirm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1470594X12447777">24</xref></sup> Note here two caveats on this claim that it is desirable to accommodate choosing to care. First, I do not deny that there may be cases in which accommodating caring is undesirable; for instance, consider a wife who dotes over her husband, spending her days easing his.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1470594X12447777">25</xref></sup> Such cases do not undermine the challenge to Cohen: the problem I present is that <italic>in general</italic> accommodating those who wish to care non-professionally is desirable, and, in general, Cohen struggles to accommodate that choice to care within his framework. Second, some might doubt the desirability of accommodating the choice to care given the gender inequalities associated with such choices. However, while I do not deny that at present it is predominantly women who care, the egalitarian ethos is proposed for a just society, which presumably would lack such worrying gender inequalities. For now, I assume the desirability of accommodating the choice to care in general; I return to defend this assumption after showing Cohen has problems doing so. There are two ways in which Cohen’s framework could accommodate the choice to care: as falling within the personal prerogative or by viewing care as part of one’s social duty. I handle each in turn, arguing that both routes mischaracterize caring and are inegalitarian as they undermine equal respect and self-respect.</p>
<sec id="section4-1470594X12447777">
<title>The personal prerogative</title>
<p>First, I consider the personal prerogative route: that choosing to be a carer rather than perform the most socially productive job possible is permitted by the personal prerogative, which constrains the scope of the egalitarian ethos. This characterizes being a carer as opting out of following the ethos, in that the personal prerogative means one need not always choose in accordance with what most benefits society. For now, I grant the assumption that the personal prerogative would be sufficiently extensive to allow the choice to be a carer, to get this approach off the ground. This is despite the examples given by Cohen of the choices permitted by this prerogative being far more limited, such as taking an hour off to visit one’s aunt (2008: 391).</p>
<p>Cohen offers two versions of the personal prerogative. Initially, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470594X12447777">Cohen (2008</xref>: 61) characterizes the prerogative as following one’s self-interest to some reasonable extent. Thus, if a person’s choice to care is part of his reasonable pursuit of self-interest, it would be permitted. Claiming that this narrow personal prerogative would permit choosing to be a carer, however, mischaracterizes the nature of that choice as self-regarding, juxtaposing it with choosing to benefit other members of society. Instead, at least often, choosing to care is an other-regarding choice motivated by concern for a particular individual. Hence, it mischaracterizes care to see it as within one’s prerogative to further one’s own interests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1470594X12447777">26</xref></sup> In response to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470594X12447777">Estlund (1998)</xref>, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470594X12447777">Cohen (2008</xref>: 390) modifies the personal prerogative, allowing that motives stemming from morality or affection also permit deviation from full compliance with the ethos. Hence, Cohen’s framework offers a way correctly to characterize an individual’s choice to care: caring is motivated by affection for the cared-for individual and is permitted by the extended prerogative.</p>
<p>While the extended personal prerogative does not mischaracterize an individual’s choice to care, unlike the narrow prerogative, both versions of the prerogative mischaracterize the role of caring within a society as being directly opposed to one’s social duty. Both characterize care as ‘opting out’ of one’s social duty owing to the nature of the personal prerogative: the prerogative is an exemption from following the demands of justice, to leave room for personal projects and avoid the ethos being excessively demanding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1470594X12447777">27</xref></sup> Characterizing care as opting out falls foul of both a communitarian and feminist critique originally made against Rawlsian liberalism. It assumes an individualistic or atomistic conception of persons in failing to recognize that relationships of dependency constitute a significant part of people’s lives and in ignoring carers’ contribution to society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1470594X12447777">28</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Even if this worry of mischaracterization is dismissed, there are egalitarian grounds to reject characterizing choosing to care as falling within the prerogative. In Cohen’s society, all internalize an ethos that suggests one should aim to benefit the least well-off in one’s economic choices. Plausibly, carers would feel that they fail to fulfil the heart of the egalitarian ethos, even if the prerogative permits their choice. It is as if they are too feeble to do as they should: get a job that produces income to be redistributed for the social good. Wage-earners would feel their contribution to society outstrips that of carers. Such attitudes towards carers stem from the mischaracterization of care just argued for, whereby caring is juxtaposed with contributing to society, that is, as ‘opting out’.</p>
<p>An inegalitarian status hierarchy would emerge as a result, with carers towards the bottom, along with other non-wage-earners. This hierarchy would undermine equal respect between carers and wage-earners, given the effects of a status hierarchy emerging in a society in which all internalize the egalitarian ethos argued for in Section 1. Here the egalitarian ethos is shown to be vulnerable to a version of Anderson’s challenge to luck egalitarianism: it would create ‘stigmatization of dependent care-taking relative to self-sufficient wage-earning’, so undermining equal respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470594X12447777">Anderson, 1999</xref>: 311).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1470594X12447777">29</xref></sup> As such, carers would lack the grounds of status self-respect – both because of others’ attitudes towards them and their own feeling of failing to contribute.</p>
<p>It might be objected that members of Cohen’s society would accept some deviation from the demands of the ethos as reasonable. Cohen’s citizens have good reason to accept the personal prerogative, given it ensures room for personal projects and prevents the ethos being excessively demanding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1470594X12447777">30</xref></sup> Therefore, it seems non-carers would respect carers, and carers retain self-respect, since following one’s personal prerogative can be justified.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1470594X12447777">31</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>There is, however, an obvious efficiency problem if the personal prerogative is so extensive as to cover opting out of performing any job and to care instead. Choosing to care instead of work may be a common choice, since many would have someone for whom they desired to care. Thus, for Cohen’s society to achieve equality and efficiency, it is unlikely it could include this extended personal prerogative which permits opting out of a job altogether. Further, the case for the personal prerogative permitting caring generalizes in a problematic way. Someone who, for instance, desired to surf or to care for their dog all day could appeal to their prerogative to opt out of performing a job just as carers could. This exacerbates the efficiency problem. But, crucially, I argue below, it would also alter citizens’ attitude towards carers, so creating problems of respect.</p>
<p>One might object that surfers or dog-lovers evidently differ from carers to the extent that only the latter’s choices should fall within the prerogative. This is intuitively plausible: in general, carers make a respect-worthy choice in a way that surfers do not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1470594X12447777">32</xref></sup> But the problem for Cohen is there are no grounds within his picture with which to say more, and so ground this distinction with respect to carers. In Cohen’s society, what counts as contributing is clearly demarcated: doing a job (which, remember, is not the way that the personal prerogative route characterizes caring). As a result, his vision of society offers no way to distinguish between surfers or dog-lovers and carers following their personal prerogative: these choices are grouped together as not contributing. This lack of a distinction suggests that a prerogative which permitted opting out of performing a job would not be a respect-worthy one to invoke. Carers would be on a par with those desiring to surf or care for a dog all day. Further, neither carers nor surfers and dog-lovers could easily justify their choices through appeal to the reasons that ground the prerogative’s inclusion in Cohen’s society: failing to do any job goes beyond leaving some space for personal projects. In addition, it is hard to characterize having to do a job as excessively demanding in order to justify one’s choice to other citizens, given that they perform such jobs themselves. Being unable to justify oneself to others is unlikely to preserve relations of respect or one’s self-respect. Hence, if the personal prerogative is sufficiently extensive to permit choosing to be a carer, carers are unlikely to be respected or have the grounds of self-respect – anymore than surfers or dog-lovers.</p>
<p>Finally, I would note that even if one could find a principled distinction between carers’ and dog-lovers’ or surfers’ exercise of the personal prerogative, so preserving respect and self-respect, the concern that one mischaracterizes what it is to care remains. The personal prerogative construes caring as ‘opting out’ of one’s social duty of contributing to society, yet it is inaccurate to juxtapose caring to contributing: often, to care is to contribute. As such, the personal prerogative route remains unattractive, over and above its threat to efficiency, equal respect, and carers’ self-respect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470594X12447777">
<title>Social duty</title>
<p>Some may think the personal prerogative route obviously misrepresents the attitude that members of Cohen’s just society would have towards caring, since at least some forms of care evidently contribute to society, such as raising children to be good future citizens. Indeed, caring for the vulnerable may even contribute to the sense of social solidarity that constitutes a part of the egalitarian ethos: people abandoning children, the elderly, and the infirm, leaving them by the roadside until some state organization picks them up, would hardly promote social solidarity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1470594X12447777">33</xref></sup> Hence, the second route to accommodate care within Cohen’s framework, namely of characterizing the paradigmatic instances of care (such as for children, the elderly, or the infirm) as part of what the egalitarian ethos demands, appears more plausible than the personal prerogative route. This route resolves the prima facie tension between caring and contributing to society by emphasizing caring’s importance: citizens of Cohen’s society would value caring, appreciating it as consistent with the egalitarian ethos given its role in social cohesion and its social productivity. As a result, it appears carers would have the standing that grounds self-respect and there would be equal respect between carers and wage-earners. Indeed, carers could be paid in the just society so as to reflect their contribution and to express the equal importance of caring and traditionally waged jobs. This would secure both equal respect between carers and non-carers and carers’ grounds of status self-respect, since the division between wage-earners and carers would be altogether removed.</p>
<p>Just like the personal prerogative route, however, the social duty route both mischaracterizes caring and faces an egalitarian challenge. First, the description of the importance of carers above still mischaracterizes caring; in this case, by introducing ‘one thought too many’ in understanding the choice to be a carer. When parents choose to care for young children, or children for elderly parents, rather than paying others or relying on state institutions, it is implausible to characterize such choices as involving the carer thinking ‘This will contribute to social solidarity and fulfil my social duty.’ It may even be undesirable to propose such a thought as part of the deliberation: it resembles the case offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470594X12447777">Stocker (1976</xref>: 462) of the friend who visits you in hospital, motivated not by the desire to see you, but by a sense of duty. A parent who cares for their child only after reflecting that it is permissible given its contribution to wider society introduces one thought too many.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1470594X12447777">34</xref></sup> The narrow personal prerogative route mischaracterized care by portraying it as a self-regarding choice, but the social duty route goes too far the other way: the characterization of being a carer is excessively other regarding, losing sight of the relevant other (the particular person who motivates the carer) altogether.</p>
<p>One might defend Cohen by replying that one’s social duty to benefit the least well-off is an appropriate consideration even within the personal domain of caring relationships. After all, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470594X12447777">Cohen (2008</xref>: 116 esp.) argues against restricting the demands of justice to institutional structuring, contending that ‘the personal is political’ in making economic choices. Thus, why not consider the demands of justice when making family choices too, where these have a bearing on social productivity? Hence, Cohen might claim that no mischaracterization of choosing to care is made in incorporating that choice into the domain of justice: it is appropriate to choose whether to care from the perspective of one’s social duty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1470594X12447777">35</xref></sup> Even if one dismisses the ‘one thought too many’ objection, however, an egalitarian challenge remains.</p>
<p>Consider the case of Bob, the surgeon-carer. Bob has an elderly granny, and has to choose between caring for her himself or working as a surgeon and either paying someone else to care or relying on state care. For talented people like Bob, it is particularly unlikely that being a carer is the most socially productive job they can perform. At the start of the discussion of care, I suggested that there is little evidence that there are significant benefits of individual over group care – and that individual care comes at significant cost to social productivity, owing to its inefficiency as compared to group care. Further, while I do not suggest caring requires no talent, it is highly probable that the talents required to be a skilled surgeon will be rarer than those required to be a good carer. As such, individualized care, such as Bob’s for his granny, is unlikely to be the most efficient form of care-giving, and comes at significant cost to social productivity given the social benefit of Bob exercising his rare talent to be a surgeon. Hence, Bob would be led by his egalitarian ethos to be a surgeon: this is the most socially productive choice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1470594X12447777">36</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Here, one could object to Cohen solely on the grounds that there is something troubling about a theory that implies that the talented should not care for relatives. Instead, I offer an egalitarian objection to Cohen revealed by the case of Bob. Carers have two options in light of the preceding discussion, where care is characterized as contributing to society and assimilated into the egalitarian ethos. The first is that they are talented, like Bob, and so could perform a more socially productive job; yet do not put the social good above their personal preferences. If carers fall into this first category, at best they make a choice permitted by the personal prerogative. But I have already argued that carers who opt out by following their prerogative would lack the grounds of status self-respect, feeling inferior to those who do not exercise their prerogative. At worst, these carers make a choice inconsistent with justice, if their choice is not an exercise of their prerogative, yet they do not choose the most socially productive job available. Given all internalize the ethos, those failing to follow it are likely to feel inferior, so undermining their status self-respect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1470594X12447777">37</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The second option open to carers is that they are not that talented, and as such, caring <italic>is</italic> the best they can do to benefit society. In such a case, the ethos directs the person to care. These carers, however, have to make what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470594X12447777">Wolff (1998)</xref> calls a ‘shameful self-revelation’ in having to admit to themselves, when assessing which job to choose, that they are not that talented. It might be objected that it is hardly shaming to admit to not being highly talented as the surgeon. To reply, I again return to the claims made at the beginning of the discussion of care: individualized care is less efficient than, and has no proven significant benefits over, group care. Hence, those who should perform individual non-professional care rather than another job are truly untalented, rather than merely failing to be highly talented, and hence would be shamed. To be shamed, Wolff claims, is to have one’s respect-standing lowered. Hence, carers in this second category would also have their status self-respect undermined. The argument just made, however, depends on accepting there would be such a relation between talent and shame within Cohen’s society: I defend exactly such a relation in Section 3, where I argue the untalented carer is one instance of a general problem with the untalented within a society in which all possess the egalitarian ethos.</p>
<p>Thus, Cohen’s society faces problems of respect concerning carers – assuming the arguments to follow in Section 3. First, as argued above, carers would lack the grounds of self-respect. Second, neither of the two options outlined offer respect-worthy reasons to be a carer: carers are either unable to put the social good first or are untalented. As such, members of the just society would know that neither of the ways carers might justify their choice are worthy of respect. Thus, there would be an inegalitarian status hierarchy between carers and others, since caring would lack status – and so equal respect among carers and others would be threatened. The social duty route to accommodating carers thus fails to rescue equal respect or the grounds of status self-respect for carers.</p>
<p>An objection could be levelled against the arguments made in this section that Cohen would be unconcerned that carers would lack the grounds of self-respect. He holds an equal access to advantage conception of equality, and many carers could have chosen a different occupation. Here, however, I defend the assumption made at the start that an attractive vision of the just society should in general accommodate choosing to be a carer, and not disadvantage people as a result of that choice. Otherwise, one offers a just society with a stunted picture of human relations in ignoring our dependency on others, just as communitarians and feminists claimed of Rawlsian theory. Following Anderson, I contend that a theory which fails to recognize the lack of self-sufficiency that constitutes much of human existence offers an ‘egalitarianism for egoists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470594X12447777">Anderson, 1999</xref>: 300). Furthermore, even if one were to bite the bullet regarding carers’ self-respect, the lack of equal respect between carers and others remains problematic for egalitarians. Finally, in the next section, I argue that Cohen’s proposed society undermines equal access to self-respect for at least one group: the untalented.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1470594X12447777">
<title>3. The untalented</title>
<p>I now argue Cohen’s society creates problems of respect and self-respect for the untalented, as well as carers. In so arguing, I defend the role of shameful self-revelations in the above discussion of carers. Consider two members of Cohen’s society, Tara and Una, who internalize the ethos. Suppose Tara possesses talents that command a high market value, but Una is untalented. Both choose the most socially productive job they can perform in accordance with the ethos, but Tara’s job produces far more than Una’s. Cohen rejects the Rawlsian publicity principle which suggests ‘justice must be seen in order to be done’, but the market would yield a degree of public knowledge about how much each citizen contributes because its wages reflect the relative social productivity of each job.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1470594X12447777">38</xref></sup> Una will know she produces far less than Tara, because she is untalented – and Tara will know she produces far more. Hence, there is a known hierarchy regarding how much each person contributes to society, with the untalented near the bottom since, by definition, the untalented are those lacking the socially productive abilities which command high market value.</p>
<p>The question is whether this known hierarchy of productivity is an inegalitarian one; whether it results in a status hierarchy that undermines respect. Prima facie, the hierarchy may seem unproblematic. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X12447777">Carens (2003</xref>: 145) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470594X12447777">Cohen (2008</xref>: 208–9), the root of the ethos is the first half of the slogan ‘From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.’ As such, the ethos centres not on the amount produced, but on contributing relative to one’s abilities: members of Cohen’s society should value effort, not ability. Both Tara the talented and Una the untalented have an equal shot at contributing relative to their abilities. At first glance, this should preserve equal respect among the talented and untalented, and give the untalented equal access to the grounds of status self-respect. Those at the top of the hierarchy of productivity should not be valued more highly than those at the bottom.</p>
<p>However, on closer inspection, the hierarchy of productivity is problematic. Members of Cohen’s society must assess their own compliance with the demands of the egalitarian ethos. For instance, they have to assess whether, given their talents, a particular job is the most socially productive one they can perform, within the limits of the personal prerogative. This self-assessment is unavoidably linked to their level of talent. In order to know whether a job is the most socially productive one you can do, you have to consider your talents and which jobs these talents make possible. Thus, when assessing their compliance with the egalitarian ethos, the untalented have to admit to themselves that they lack talent. I claim, and will shortly defend, that such a self-revelation of lack of talent is shaming, so echoing Wolff’s parallel claim. Further, as Wolff argues, being shamed is to have one’s respect-standing lowered. Shame makes one feel less worthy than others, and as a result makes it ‘difficult to retain any sense of oneself as an equal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470594X12447777">Wolff, 1998</xref>: 114). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470594X12447777">Dillon (1997)</xref> claims that feeling shame is the opposite of feeling one has self-respect.</p>
<p>Hence, in Cohen’s society, the untalented would lack the grounds of status self-respect, given the argument above that they have to make shameful self-revelations in assessing their compliance with the ethos. Indeed, the untalented would lack equal <italic>access</italic> to such grounds of self-respect, given their lack of talent is no fault of their own. In addition, equal respect between the talented and untalented is at risk. As I suggested when outlining the egalitarian values, if people feel they lack equal status, they might behave in ways that convey this lack to others. If so, equal respect is threatened. As a result, the hierarchy in productivity (which is in effect a hierarchy in talent) is problematic, owing to its impact on status.</p>
<p>There may also be a stronger threat to equal respect than the lowered status self-respect of the untalented. In a society in which all possess the egalitarian ethos, people know those earning little are either untalented or follow their personal prerogative. Lacking talent is regarded as shaming, and I argued in Section 2 that following one’s prerogative is unlikely to be valued as highly as benefiting others. Hence, neither option would lead to the feeling that those who earn little are worthy of respect. Thus, the hierarchy of productivity between the talented and untalented threatens to be an inegalitarian one, such that those at the bottom are thought by all to have less status than those at the top.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1470594X12447777">39</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>I now respond to two objections which might be made in Cohen’s defence. First, one could challenge Wolff’s assumption that lacking talent would be shaming. At present, such a relation between talent and shame is plausible. People tend to identify with their talents, seeing them as an important part of their self-conception; for instance, identifying with their athletic ability or mathematical prowess as a source of pride. Shame and pride influence how people conceive of themselves: rather than resulting from one-off actions, these attitudes tend to result from what people take to reflect on themselves more generally. For instance, people feel shame over actions they take to reflect negative aspects of their character or over lacking some valued trait.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1470594X12447777">40</xref></sup> Thus, at present, given the involvement of talents in people’s self-conceptions, lacking talent may be shaming.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1470594X12447777">41</xref></sup> One could deny, however, that there would be such a relation between talent and shame in Cohen’s just society.</p>
<p>I first show that Wolff’s own reply to the above is flawed, before defending the relation between talent and shame even within Cohen’s society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470594X12447777">Wolff (1998</xref>: 115) claims that the shamefulness of lacking talent is likely to be fairly universal, since contributing to the social product is always likely to be valued. On the face of it, this certainly holds true in Cohen’s society; indeed, the attitude that contributing to society is desirable is deliberately cultivated, given it is part of the egalitarian ethos. Against Wolff, however, inculcating Cohen’s ethos might be precisely the kind of cultural shift that would divorce lack of talent from shame despite social productivity being valued. The ethos is to contribute what one can <italic>relative to one’s abilities</italic>. As such, it might be held that members of Cohen’s society who internalize this ethos would think talents are not an appropriate object of either shame or pride: it is not contribution itself nor being talented that the ethos places value on, but instead on doing what one can, with the talents one has.</p>
<p>Such detachment from one’s talents, however, would be a deeply unattractive element of a society since it demands that people be alienated from their talents: proposing that people should not incorporate their talents into their self-conceptions, as objects of shame or pride, requires them not to identify with their talents. This alienation from one’s talents requires a radical shift in how people currently relate to their talents. Not only does such a shift seem impractical (which, admittedly, given Cohen’s denial of the relevance of facts to political philosophy, may not worry him), it also appears ad hoc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1470594X12447777">42</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>To illustrate this shift’s ad hoc nature, contrast identifying with one’s talents to requiring rewards for working hard. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470594X12447777">Cohen (2008</xref>: 50–51) claims that, while currently people may require high rewards for working hard as they have been socialized into expecting such rewards, in a different society habits could be changed. Claiming that rewards would not be necessary to motivate citizens of the just society is a principled move from the perspective of Cohen’s egalitarianism: expecting high rewards is unjust. In contrast, feeling shame in being untalented is not in itself counter to egalitarianism. As such, the suggestion that people be alienated from their talents is ad hoc; it is a way to mitigate a problem, but not one independently justified by Cohen’s egalitarianism. Someone who demands rewards acts in an anti-egalitarian manner, but it is far from certain that we would want to say the same of someone who identifies with their talents in such a way that they are a source of pride or shame. Should one really gerrymander human psychology solely to dodge this article’s challenge?</p>
<p>The second objection in Cohen’s defence is to reject the market and the way it offers to compare one’s productivity to that of others. Perhaps the challenge to Cohen results only from this particular form of implementation – a form Cohen never endorsed whole-heartedly (2008: 190). Without the market, citizens might think the cleaner’s contribution was on a par with the surgeon’s, and that there was nothing shaming in lacking the talent to do anything else.</p>
<p>In reply, what alternative mechanism could both direct the talented to choose the most socially productive jobs so as to preserve efficiency and yet give citizens no way to compare how much they produce? These two criteria for the mechanism are in direct conflict. One cannot give the talented a way to choose the most socially productive jobs without revealing the differing levels of contribution of those jobs, but doing so undermines respect and self-respect in permitting comparison. Yet, if the talented do not choose the most socially productive jobs because they have no way to know how to do so, then one levels down, trading-off efficiency to secure equal respect and self-respect. Hence, Cohen’s supporters face a choice: to level down and render the egalitarian ethos partially toothless since it no longer directs talented people’s choices between jobs or to create a society that undermines the status self-respect of the untalented and lacks equal respect between the talented and untalented. Neither option secures the combination of equality and efficiency Cohen desired.</p>
<p>One could respond that there is a mechanism which would hide differences in the level of contribution of different jobs, yet direct the talented into the most socially productive jobs: central planning, which allocates jobs according to individuals’ particular talents without revealing relative levels of social contribution. In such a system, people would not need to assess their own level of talent to choose the right job; instead, the central planner does so. But, even assuming citizens would be ignorant of the relative social productivity of jobs, central planning cannot be the solution to problems of respect for Cohen. This is because of the third value the egalitarian ethos is supposed to preserve: freedom of occupational choice. Cohen claims that the egalitarian ethos preserves equality by removing the need for unequalizing incentives, preserves efficiency by ensuring people work hard in the most socially productive jobs, and preserves freedom of occupational choice by having the ethos guide people to freely choose the most socially productive jobs rather than engaging in ‘Stalinist forcing’ of people into particular careers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1470594X12447777">43</xref></sup> Replacing the market mechanism with central planning would remove freedom of occupational choice: people would no longer select jobs in accordance with their sense of justice, but instead be assigned one.</p>
<p>Hence, both objections considered above offer deeply unappealing alternatives to the egalitarian challenge: either you alienate people from their talents or you remove the hierarchy of productivity, but in so doing trade-off either efficiency or freedom to preserve equality of respect and self-respect. But as it stands, Cohen’s society undermines equal access to grounds of status self-respect for the untalented, and so threatens to undermine equal respect between the talented and untalented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1470594X12447777">
<title>4. Diagnosing the problem</title>
<p>I have argued that Cohen offers an unappealing vision of a society in which citizens lack equal respect for one another, and carers and the untalented have their self-respect systematically undermined. Cohen appeared to combine capitalism’s efficiency with socialism’s equality and motivation for the common good. But in incorporating capitalism’s market structure, Cohen preserves its hierarchical ordering that places surgeons above the untalented and full-time carers. Further, Cohen’s particular version of egalitarianism exacerbates that hierarchical ordering and its inegalitarian consequences. Cohen’s citizens must internalize the egalitarian ethos, which creates a unified and dominating hierarchy in accordance to which citizens must rank themselves in order to meet the demands of justice by choosing the most socially productive job. In contrast, those forms of egalitarianism that restrict the scope of justice to the basic structure do not demand their citizens perform such a ranking, nor do they require their citizens to internalize such a unified and dominating way of valuing their activities, in order to meet the demands of justice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1470594X12447777">44</xref></sup> Thus, I conclude that Cohen’s ethos is especially vulnerable to problems of respect, and so fails to unite equality and efficiency. Instead, it gains efficiency at the cost of two crucial forms of inequality, disadvantaging many of those who are disadvantaged at present. Hence, in so far as egalitarians value status self-respect or equal respect, they should reject Cohen’s society.</p>

<p>One might object that it is impossible to know the social productivity of particular jobs within the ideal society. But Cohen engages in such comparison of jobs, such as in his doctor-gardener case (2008: 184–6). I also assume here that Bob is not so miserable being a surgeon that considerations of labour burden enter. Further, note that, as observed by an anonymous referee, I overlook one option in this article: that granny pays to counterbalance the cost of Bob’s care to society. One might, however, find such commodification of the caring relation unattractive, and worry about what happens to grannies without the money to do so, let alone children.</p>

<p>Shame might seem an overly strong response to lacking talent. But, neither here, nor in Wolff, is shame meant in a strong, moralized sense. An anonymous referee has objected, however, that we do not identify with our talents when understood as abilities that command high market value. Instead, we identify with our abilities. In response, in Cohen’s society, what would have high market value is what is socially productive. Further, we do not take pride in, and so identify with, our abilities, but rather, with our valuable abilities. In a society of people who have internalized the ethos, conceptions of what is valuable are likely to be influenced by what is socially productive. Hence, the distinction between talent and valuable ability seems less significant here.</p>
