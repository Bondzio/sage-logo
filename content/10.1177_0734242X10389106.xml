<abstract>
<p>In addition to environmental and economic benefits, systematic application of sustainable waste management in elementary education buildings also makes a positive contribution to the education of future generations. This study examines elementary schools in Istanbul, which are part of the Eco-Schools International Programme. This programme was established in 1994 with European Union support and it aims to introduce environmental management systems into primary schools within the scope of ISO 14001/EMAS. A questionnaire study was administered on the theme of litter management and sustainable waste management within elementary schools located in the Asian and European parts of Istanbul city, and the findings of a field survey were examined. Questionnaire findings were gathered under five themes: litter management, composting of organic waste, re-use of school materials, reducing consumption–selection of recycled products, waste management and sorting of recyclable materials.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The management of waste materials has become one of the most significant problems resulting from industrialization and it negatively impacts global environmental systems. At the present time, various waste management strategies are employed to address the issues of waste reduction, re-use of waste and recycling of waste. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X10389106">Buchanan (2005)</xref>, the waste problem defined within the scope of functioning of social and built environmental systems is not defined within the scope of the functioning of natural environmental systems. Buchanan explains that the concept of waste is solely a concept of industrial society: ‘In nature, there is no waste. In the organic cycle, the waste from one creature or process is nourishment for the next. Today, we not only consume or destroy nature’s resources faster than they can be regenerated, but we give nothing back to nature. Instead, we further burden it with waste and toxic pollution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X10389106">Buchanan, 2005</xref>). Within this framework, the model of sustainable development came to the forefront as a precaution against the destruction of natural environmental systems and depletion of resources due to industrial processes and the resulting waste products. The sustainable development model targeted at protection of environmental systems aims at ensuring continuity of life in the future world, through long-term projection studies.</p>
<p>The challenges of sustainable development and waste management are further complicated by increases in the types and quantity of waste materials in large cities, rapid population growth, differentiation of waste content according to space and timeframe, and limited financial resources for public services. As mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X10389106">Pitts (2004)</xref>; ‘In high-density cities, the amount of waste produced per unit land area is high, and it is much more difficult to find land for its disposal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X10389106">Pitts, 2004</xref>). Various researchers emphasize the importance of waste handling policies at an urban and even national scale. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X10389106">Pitts (2004)</xref> explains this matter as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Policies and procedures for dealing with wastes are therefore required at an urban level and also need to be based on a national approach, in order to avoid simple transference of problems to neighbouring areas. Planning policies and site design for subsequent re-use/recycling/reclamation need to be better defined. Active use of recycled, re-used and reclaimed materials should be encouraged through policies and planning. Strategic decisions about waste should be taken with the involvement of the local community, since alternatives to current practices can be made workable only if the community subscribes to the modification of behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X10389106">Pitts 2004</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The success of global and/or local waste policies can be ensured simply through raising awareness within society. Within developed societies, the process of raising environmental awareness includes investments in school educational programmes, designed to target the future adults within society. Within this framework, ‘green schools design’ has become one of the most important sustainable design topics. Today, programmes such as ‘LEED for Schools’, ‘BREEAM Education’ and ‘Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS)’ are the most important certification systems evaluated according to sustainability criteria. However, the new design or renovation of all school buildings in accordance with sustainable design criterions would involve a very long process. Therefore, sustainability topics should be incorporated within the phases of operation and maintenance in current, conventional schools. On both the local and global scale, there are many organizations directing the sustainable design and renovation of school buildings and works relating to the sustainable operation and maintenance of school buildings. One such programme is the eco-schools programme, which is applied very successfully in many countries. Many schools in Turkey are members of the eco-schools programme. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate litter and waste management in elementary schools within Istanbul that participate in the eco-schools programme. The scope of the study was defined as:</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X10389106" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the determination of the extent of the litter problem within eco-schools;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the evaluation of studies on reduction, collection, sorting and recycling of wastes produced by the sampled schools during operation and maintenance processes.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The sustainable design features of school buildings within the sample and the sustainable litter and waste management features of buildings under construction were not included in the evaluation process of the study.</p>
<p>The topic of use-stage waste management in Turkey is briefly mentioned as general information before discussing litter and waste management evaluation relating to eco-schools in Istanbul. According to the Dictionary of Environmental Terms published by the Turkish Ministry of Environment and Forestry, waste is defined as ‘all sorts of undesirable liquid, solid, gaseous or radioactive materials that are released into the environment in an amount sufficient to cause alteration in the environment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X10389106">Turkish Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2010b</xref>). According to this definition, each person in Turkey produces an average of 1.38 kg of waste per day. The types of solid wastes and recycling rates for the year 2009 in Turkey are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X10389106">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>The Eco-Schools International Programme</title>
<p>Eco-schools is a programme for environmental management and certification, designed to implement sustainable development education in schools by encouraging children and young adults to take an active role in how their school can be run for the benefit of the environment.</p>
<p>The Eco-Schools International Programme was developed as a response to some of the needs identified at the UN Conference on Environment and Development in 1992. The programme started in 1994, with the support of the European Commission (DG XI and DG XXII), in four countries: Denmark, Germany, Greece and the United Kingdom. In 1999, the organization received the ‘Worldaware Award for Global Education’ from the North–South Centre of Council of Europe and National Committee for International Cooperation and Sustainable Development (NCDO). In 2003 the eco-schools programme was identified by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) as a model initiative for Education for Sustainable Development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X10389106">Turkish Foundation for Environmental Education International, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The eco-schools programme employs a holistic, participatory approach, combining learning and action, thus providing an effective method for improving the environments of schools, raising awareness and producing behavioural change in young people, school staff, families, local authorities and others with a significant influence within local communities. Eco-schools is one of the programmes of the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fee-international.org">www.fee-international.org</ext-link>) and, as such, it is implemented through FEE member organizations (one per country). Currently, the programme is being implemented in 47 countries around the world, involving 32 156 schools (9898 of which have already been awarded various eco-schools certificates), 9 125 460 students, 628 005 teachers and 5013 local authorities. The eco-schools programme is based on ISO14001:2004. The eco-schools methodology encompasses seven steps that any school can adopt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X10389106">Foundation for Environmental Education International, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The eco-schools methodology encompasses seven steps (see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eco-schools.org/page.php?id">http://www.eco-schools.org/page.php?id</ext-link> = 19) that any school can adopt. Steps 2 and 3 are the most important stages for the data used in this study. In step 2, work begins with a review or assessment of the environmental impact of the school. The results of the school’s environmental review are essential in order to build the action plan, by assisting the school to decide whether change is necessary, urgent, or not required. The review also helps schools to set realistic targets and measure their success. The environmental review is crucial to understand the environmental situation within a school and provides the basis for the school’s eco-action plan (step 3 of the eco-schools programme methodology).</p>
<p>Schools may first quantify their impacts for the theme they are working on or cover all the areas in which the school may have environmental impacts, namely: waste management, waste minimization, school soils, biodiversity, energy, water, transport, health and well-being, and sustaining the world. Nevertheless, the school is free to choose other areas of environmental concern that are more relevant to its needs and to devise appropriate checklists accordingly.</p>
<p>Step 3 of the action plan is the core of the eco-schools work and is developed using the results of the environmental review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X10389106">Eco-Schools Methodology Step 3, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the information presented under the title ‘waste’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X10389106">Eco-Schools Themes, Waste, 2010</xref>), which is one of the themes of eco-schools programme, waste management is addressed in four different steps. In this sense, the following steps (reduce; sort wastes; re-use; recycle/recover) are suggested to be applied by students and others (educators, administrative staff, parents etc.).</p>
<sec id="section3-0734242X10389106">
<title>Reduce waste</title>
<p>Change manufacturing processes so that fewer materials are used or change consumer habits so that less wasted material is bought. In this scope, the example given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X10389106">Stitt (1999)</xref> on this issue is of great importance; ‘US businesses alone consume an estimated 21 million tons of office paper every year – the equivalent of more than 350 million trees. If offices throughout the country increased the rate of two-sided photocopying from the 1992 figure of 26% up to 60%, they could save the equivalent of about 15 million trees’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X10389106">Stitt, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0734242X10389106">
<title>Sort waste</title>
<p>Within the scope of sustainable waste management, various types of waste materials must be selected and collected at the school buildings and open spaces owned by schools. Therefore, during the design stage, areas for collecting and sorting waste should be allocated at appropriate points within the participating schools. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X10389106">Mendler et al. (2006)</xref>, while designing sustainable school buildings, space must also be allocated for secondary waste collection and sorting areas, in addition to general waste collecting and selecting areas. That suggests the following actions.</p>
<list id="list2-0734242X10389106" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Allocate space for collection of recyclables at the point of use (copy rooms, break areas etc.) and recycling storage and staging areas at the loading dock.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consider allocating space for composting food waste and collection of landscape maintenance debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X10389106">Mendler et al., 2006</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0734242X10389106">
<title>Re-use</title>
<p>The re-use of products or materials that would otherwise become waste can provide a range of social, economic and environmental benefits and re-use keeps goods and materials from entering the waste stream. Re-use means to continue using the product in its original or in a modified form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X10389106">El-Haggar, 2007</xref>). By its very nature, re-use requires less energy and fewer raw materials than either the production of new items or recycling. For example, the refilling glass bottles that weigh 10.5 ounces 25 times uses 93% less glass than packaging beverages in lighter-weight one-way glass bottles that weigh 5.9 ounces and hold the same volume of liquid. Likewise, a refillable bottle that makes 25 trips consumes 93% less energy than extracting raw materials and manufacturing new glass bottles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X10389106">Stitt, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0734242X10389106">
<title>Recycle/recover</title>
<p>Recycling has three main benefits: it reduces the demand upon new resources, it cuts down on transport and production energy costs, and it uses material which would otherwise be lost to landfill sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X10389106">Edwards, 1996</xref>). When a material is recycled, it is broken down in some form of industrial process and becomes either raw material in the manufacture of some recycled products, or a raw material in the manufacture of a different recycled content product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X10389106">Graham, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>The city selected for the present study, Istanbul, is the most crowded and economically-most important city of Turkey. Having the 34th largest economy of the world, Istanbul is the most crowded city of Europe as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X10389106">Wikipedia, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Directly proportional to economic development level and population, the number of educational institutions in Istanbul is higher than that of the education institutions in other cities of Turkey. Moreover, the great majority of the schools involved in eco-schools programmes are in Istanbul. By the second part of 2009, Istanbul had 55 schools participating in the eco-schools programme. Questionnaires were distributed to these 55 schools and 37 (67%) schools completed and returned the questionnaire. The distribution of participating schools located in the European and Asian sides of Istanbul is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X10389106">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The present study used a structured review method. This is a quantitative research method which is used in survey studies. A previous study called <italic>Formal Environmental Review</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X10389106">Nottinghamshire County Council, 2009</xref>), produced by the Eco-Schools International Programme, was used as the basis when preparing the questionnaire. However, the questionnaire was revised to better reflect the characteristics of the study site, in accordance with suggestions from the eco-schools programme. An open-ended question was added in order to take additional comments in the questionnaire study that generally comprised closed questions. Questionnaire forms were e-mailed to the eco-schools co-ordinators and administrators in the private and public elementary schools in Istanbul that participate in the eco-schools programme. Contact information of related co-ordinators and administrators was provided by the national co-ordinator of Eco-Schools of Turkish Foundation for Environmental Education, who is the representative of the Eco-Schools International Programme in Turkey. The questionnaires completed and returned by 37 schools constituted the database of the present study [The results of the questionnaire study, which was conducted under the approval and permission of Istanbul Provincial Directorate for National Education (İİMEM) have to be published and these publications have to be delivered also to İİMEM] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X10389106">Figure 2</xref>). The frequency analysis tool of the SPSS statistics software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was utilized to analyse the questionnaire results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0734242X10389106">
<title>Case study</title>
<p>Communication was established with eco-schools co-ordinators and administrators in these schools via e-mail, and the questionnaire comprising 15 questions in the topics of waste management was implemented. The main themes of the questionnaire study were litter management, composting, re-use, minimizing consumption and selection of recycled products, and sorts of selected wastes.</p>
<sec id="section9-0734242X10389106">
<title>Litter management</title>
<p>In order to collect litter in the schools efficiently, there must be enough litter bins of sufficient size sited at appropriate locations in the school buildings and in the school grounds, and they must be cleaned and disinfected regularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X10389106">CHPS, 2004</xref>). The CHPS Best Practices Manual provides the following advice on this topic: ‘Empty trash bins daily in classrooms, offices, restrooms, locker rooms, cafeterias and kitchen as well as in any outdoor areas such as playgrounds and picnic bench areas. Wash out trash cans weekly, as necessary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X10389106">CHPS, 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X10389106">Table 1</xref>)</p>

<p>The results of the questionnaire study indicate there is generally no problem with the sizes and cleanliness of litter bins considering numerical distribution of litter bins inside and outside of eco-schools in Istanbul. However, there is a problem in terms of the disinfection of trash containers, it is recommended that trash containers should be disinfected at least once a month in all the schools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X10389106">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Composting of organic wastes</title>
<p>Organic waste can be composted anywhere, anytime and in every climate type for use in site landscaping or for private gardens in residential areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X10389106">THERMIE, 1999</xref>). According to recommendations in National Best Practices Manual RS 2: Composting’:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Incorporate composting into the recycling and waste management plan for the school. Recover food remnants (meal preparation scraps and students’ leftovers) and yard trimmings/gardening clippings for use as compost. The environmental benefits of composting include extended landfill longevity. It can also be used to reduce erosion and nutrient runoff and can alleviate soil compaction. Allowing students to play an active role in their school’s composting program can be a valuable teaching tool (Hansen et al., 1999).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Only 18.9% of participating schools composted organic wastes, which is quite a low rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X10389106">Table 2</xref>). This is because composting is uncommon in Turkey, and organic fruit and vegetable waste materials are generally discarded. However, additional comments on this question show that schools employ different ways of utilizing food waste. For instance, at Natuk Birkan Primary School the food and dry bread waste are sent to an animal shelter, and oil waste is sent to be converted into biodiesel. At Marmara Primary School, waste oils produced in the dining hall are collected and delivered to a soap factory and the related certificate was submitted with the response to this study.</p>

<title>Re-use of school materials</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X10389106">The State of Connecticut – Department of Environmental Protection (2000)</xref> emphasizes the opportunities for re-use in schools: ‘In cafeterias, switch to re-useable utensils and crockery and investigate the possibility of switching to refillable containers for milk, juice and water. Encourage students who bring their own lunch to use a reusable lunch box and Thermos instead of brown paper bags and disposable drink containers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X10389106">Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to such measures, students can establish once-only or periodic drives to collect reusable items such as clothing, books, toys, computers and other electronic equipment. A re-use programme might involve the following activities.</p>
<list id="list3-0734242X10389106" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>On-site exchange.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Donating the collected materials to a specific beneficiary, such as a library, shelter or charitable organization.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Selling the collected materials at a community yard sale and using the profit for school activities (These drives are also sometimes part of national, state or local government campaigns) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X10389106">USEPA, 2002</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Re-use of plastic materials such as water bottle is encouraged in 91.7% of schools. Within this scope, various additional measures are conducted. For example, students and staff at Alev Primary School use their own glasses or water bottles instead of using plastic cups at water fountains in the corridors. It was mentioned that the introduction of this policy led to a reduction of 500 000 plastic cups per year. Students’ awareness of environmental issues is raised in almost all of the classes by stressing the topic of re-use and recycling.</p>
<p>A total of 97.3% of schools in this study send unused school materials to other schools in need of such materials, in line with the principles of social sustainability. These kinds of social co-operation projects are implemented by mutual communication with a school chosen as sister school and/or from ‘the list of schools in need’ in Turkey. It is known that such social co-operation activities are particularly active within schools in the western and southern regions of Turkey (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X10389106">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Reduction of consumption – selection of recycled products</title>
<p>Post-consumer material is defined as waste material generated by households or by commercial, industrial and institutional facilities in their role as end-users of the product, which can no longer be used for its intended purpose. In order to reduce waste, all the materials used in the schools must be used consciously and thriftily. Recycled-content products are made from post-consumer materials that would otherwise have been discarded. A recycled-content product is an item that contains recovered materials and is defined in accordance with ISO 14021. To be successful in ensuring the use of recycled-content products at schools, it is important to preferentially purchase from companies selling such products (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X10389106">Table 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X10389106">US Green Building Council, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>With regard to preference of recycled-content products, the questionnaire examined the use of stationery equipment and single-use paper towels. The results show that more schools use recycled cleaning products than recycled-content stationery. In the additional information, Atanur Oğuz Primary School indicated that it purchased cleaning materials and liquid soap products manufactured from natural raw materials, which were biodegradable in water, used recyclable packaging, did not cause bioaccumulation, and saved water by providing easy rinse due to its adjustable foam. The school uses water-soluble natural cleaning products produced by the TURMEPA (Turkish Marine Environment Protection Association), aimed at preventing pollution of seas and beaches in Turkey.</p>
<p>Thrifty/conscious usage of available resources and materials is as important as waste management in sustainable life perspectives. Questionnaire responses on managing consumption indicate that schools attempt to reduce the use of stationery, printing and writing materials, although at different levels. Enka Elementary School emphasized that office paper was used on both sides and that a school bulletin that was previously printed for parents every 15 days had instead been issued on-line for the last 2 years.</p>

<p><disp-quote>
<p>Co-ordination and control are important for the success of all waste management and recycling programmes.

<p>The California Education Code, Sections 32370-32376, encourages school districts to establish and maintain a paper recycling programme in all classrooms, administrative offices and other areas owned or leased by the school district. Additionally, PRC 42638 provides that each school district may co-ordinate with local agencies to implement solid waste management programmes in order to maximize the diversion of solid waste from landfill disposal or transformation facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X10389106">CHPS, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition to the waste streams listed in the questionnaire, under the category listed as ‘other’, İstek Acıbadem Nursery School and Fenerbahçe, Atacan and Avrupa Primary Schools recycled glass waste; Fenerbahçe Primary School composted organic waste; Çamlıca Kalem Primary School recycled copper waste; and İstek Acıbadem Nursery School recycled cardboard waste. HEV Kemerköy School collects waste paper and plastic bottles are regularly sent to Eyüp Municipality in Istanbul. It was mentioned that co-operation between eco-schools and TAP (Association of Portable Batteries Producers and Importers) allows waste batteries to be collected in a more efficient way. It was emphasized that students in Alev Primary School bring papers and batteries from home and put them into the school recycle bins. Students in Çamlıca Kalem Primary School collected 60 000 tons of paper with the help of their parents and İstek Acıbadem Nursery School, which has 116 students, collected 2020 waste batteries and delivered them to the recycling unit. Atacan Primary School conducts information studies on the reduction and recycling of waste materials and students who are conscientious in this regard warn students who behave unconsciously in this matter each week. Students in Umutfono Primary School designed an entertaining waste collection bin for the nursery class and first-grade students, and put it into operation in the nursery class. In Doğa Schools, students collect waste materials, which they use to make models in painting lessons. In addition, they hold an annual ‘natural fashion show’, where clothing is made from recycled materials.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>Schools in countries that have different levels of development can participate in the eco-schools programme, although it is impossible to achieve an equivalent level of success in terms of waste management in all eco-school programme member schools. However, reports related to documentation of the activities carried out within the scope of the eco-school programme by the member schools will enable local and global comparisons of these schools to be made. The data obtained will reveal the strengths and weaknesses of these schools and will enable future projections on these issues to be made.</p>
<p>Using the present questionnaire study in which the waste management of those schools located in Istanbul and members of the International Eco-Schools programme (55 schools) was investigated, an attempt was made to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the schools which participated in the study (37 schools). Based on the findings of the study, the following recommendations can be made to enable the progression of eco-schools in Istanbul.</p>

<list-item><p>Based on the findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X10389106">Table 4</xref>, it is suggested that the consumption of office materials should be managed and priority given to ‘products made from recycled materials’ when purchasing stationery materials and single use paper products.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Considering the findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X10389106">Table 5</xref>, it is recommended that 100% collection of battery and paper wastes from other wastes be adopted and to set targets for eco-schools to increase waste collection rates and the range of wastes collected. Where schools are unable to increase waste collection without assistance, it is recommended that they form partnerships with provincial governments and organizations and non-governmental organizations.</p></list-item>
