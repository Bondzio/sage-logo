<abstract>
<p>The present article gives a short analysis of emerging of historical knowledge and its relations to human senses. People are re-constructing history using different cognitive strategies and different approaches to how to use our ability to see, to hear and to touch. People are historically deaf and disabled – we cannot hear an enormous part of our history, and in terms of understanding the world we may learn from really disabled persons – who are fully capable to create images of the surrounding reality accurately and adequately. During the past decades, due to the great development of technology, we have become more powerful in recording and re-constructing our reality – but what have we lost? Proliferation of sounds creates noise and is a big disturbance in some situations – we change our psychological way of being more rapidly than our physiology could accept that change. A myriad of sounds in the present gives us cause to search for the same domain in the past and to describe it in terms of sounds and hearing. Sometimes we do not have enough will and wish to hear our contemporary that we extend our vision and our hearing into the past – but what can we hear from that?</p>

<p>Once I offered my students to make a mental experiment – to imagine World War II – and then I asked them in what colour they saw the images about the object of the experiment. Most of the students claimed that they saw black and white images and were sincerely astonished when I explained to them that this was due to the enormous amount of black and white newsreel and photos; students just did not <italic>realize</italic> this simple fact.</p>
<p>There is nothing new in the claim that our world is structured primarily as visual – we get most of our information relying upon our ability to see, such <italic>hegemony of vision</italic> devalues other senses – hearing, olfactory, touching. And this is quite understandable – by using your eyes you can observe more and faster than while using only hearing or touching. But at the same time – you can hear from every direction, while vision is possible only from certain perspective – you need to turn in order to see something more clear and focused. And the last fact leads us to the first question – are hearing and touching less effective in understanding the world around us? The answer to this question is not as simple as it seems. Data from blind persons of how they perceive the reality and make sense of the world will be very helpful here – but let us first make one step aside into darkness and try to understand what is historical and what is not.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1354067X12456721"><title>Discontinuity: Emergence of history</title>
<p>The expression that we all live in history is widely known. Even in physical experiments, high-technological devices register events that took place in the past – even if they have occurred milliseconds ago. Human history is full of different events, and about most of them we may say in what exactly era or year such an event took place. But how did humankind reach the understanding of the past? How did particular persons on the personal level make sense of what he or she had during some years or even through the life span? In a certain moment of history, humankind realized the borders of inter changeability of events and objects. In ancient period, mythology was only a permanent repetition of the same events, myth was like a “machine for time destruction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354067X12456721">Lévi-Strauss, 1955</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X12456721">Uspensky (1988)</xref> argued that in a <italic>semiotic</italic> perspective, a historical process may be considered as a process of <italic>communication</italic>, where new information (e.g. discoveries in archives, excavations etc.) cause one or another reaction from the societal addressee. Important here is that we have a <italic>language</italic> in a role of code, but language should be understood in wider perspective. Thus, historical process is a process of generation of phrases and reading such phrases by a society (or any part of it) – and this causes the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X12456721">Uspensky, 1988</xref>, p. 67). The main factor here is time (which should here be understood as emanation or duration) – that superimposes difficulties in recoding of phrases, and due to that, different kinds of interpretations are possible. But let’s take this idea further – what if we have several <italic>languages</italic> for interpretation? These different levels of understanding will translate messages accenting different causations, thus “what was important for one cultural whole might not have any meaning in another” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X12456721">Uspensky, 1988</xref>, p. 68).</p>
<p>History, as it is, is semiotic in terms of translating non-sign into sign, non-history into history. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X12456721">Uspensky (1988)</xref> proposed two conditions for such transformation:
<list id="list1-1354067X12456721" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Arranging events in a certain temporal sequence (that is, introducing the factor of time); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Making sense of causality between different events.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>According to these conditions, a historical experience is not the real event that took place in time, or events that are collected into time, but rather, causal relations and connections between different events, which are established due to the currently existing point of view. When we are talking about the past as “it was” – it actually means “it is” but in a different temporal space. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X12456721">Uspensky (1988)</xref> proposed to differentiate historical past from the past as it is – historical past is “alienating past” [in Russian: <italic>otchuzhdayemoe proshloe</italic>] – “history, thus, is connecting the present and the past as different realities that are attributed to different temporal spaces” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X12456721">Uspensky, 1988</xref>, p. 75). But if we consider a historical process as a communication, we also have to take into account the notion that communication is something that consists of utterances (or responses). Every form of human life, or every process in human life, may be described in terms of <italic>dialogical relations</italic> – every living (human) being lives through a continuous relationship with its surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354067X12456721">Salgado &amp; Conçalves, 2007</xref>). Dialogical relations suggest that “differentiation emerges through a contrast that simultaneously unites and separates” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354067X12456721">Salgado &amp; Conçalves, 2007</xref>, p. 609). We turn to others in order to relate to ourselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354067X12456721">Holquist (1990)</xref> also noticed that language use occurs in ways that are always addressed to someone else – yet the need of the speaker is to maintain oneself. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354067X12456721">Bakhtin (1972)</xref>, dialogue persists wherever consciousness emerges – “only clear <italic>mechanical</italic> relations are not dialogical relations” (pp. 72–73).</p>
<p>For dialogue, it is inescapable not to take into account both parts of a dialogue – a person who is speaking (and listening in the same time) and a person (audience on the whole) to whom such utterance is forwarded. We mentioned that inner mechanisms of our dialogical consciousness are opened forward outer dialogues and voices which inevitably become a part of our inner dialogue:<disp-quote>
<p>the word is two-sided act. It is determined equally by whose word it is and for whom it is meant. As word, it is precisely <italic>the product of reciprocal relationship between speaker and listener</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354067X12456721">Voloshinov, 1929/1986</xref>, p. 86)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, the importance of the <italic>other</italic> is crucial here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354067X12456721">1</xref></sup> The importance of the other(s) in a historical dialogue (between the past and the presence) is also critical. Let us illustrate by the very mundane example from everyday life. It is common in many countries to put faces of significant persons on banknotes or coins – such “glimpsing images” may create a very certain feeling against not only a particular person, but rather towards the whole nation. It would be an interesting analysis of countries in their choosing of persons and their portraits for such activity – because we may assume that in some states only strictly national heroes or persons are presented. But other countries don’t. For example, until very recently, in Estonia, the portrait of Karl Ernst von Baer was put on the 2-kroon banknote. Baer is known as a founder of embryology, he was a Russian citizen with rough German background and origin and he worked for many years at Dorpat (Tartu) University for many years, because in those days Tartu was a predominantly German-speaking area in the western part of the Russian Empire. Thus, the everyday-using of paper money created a very rough feeling of being a part of a whole [mythologized] history – notable here is, that Baer died a century before the Estonian national state was firstly created.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1354067X12456721"><title>Historical vs. mythological</title>
<p>Being developed on a rough temporal basics (e.g. change of the seasons of the year) myth itself is beyond any chronology – that is why we may sometimes see how different events may change their places in a historical perspective. The only, and main, relation to the time as a category that myth (or better in this context, mythologized event/person) may have with the time, is to be as a kind of point of reference in categories (before X – in time of X – after X), thus the mythologized event (or personal life if a person is considered as a symbol) obtains a time or substitute the time (in many marginal cases that we have in our culture, e.g. the era of Japanese Emperors or any new calendars established after a deep social change). The last point (being a reference point) is a main difference between the myth as a cultural phenomenon and mythologized event as it exists in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354067X12456721">Figure 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-1354067X12456721" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Historical description.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1354067X12456721-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The process of categorization as any kind of arrangement (imposed from the outside, not from inside event) is a movement towards the completed (locked-in-itself) perception of the event (or biography of the person who’s life is being highly semiotically evaluated and has become a part of national history or even a national symbol, for example Atatürk in Turkey, or Lenin in the former USSR).</p>
<p>Furthermore – if in systems such as the army (where we also may see arrangements in the most common way varying from row soldier to marshal), dialogue may be established “from the high” – while in a case of a person or event (as a combination and aggregation of micro-level events), such a dialogical relation is impossible (everything that due to some criteria will be considered as non-X, even if it is Y, N or Z, will be considered as opposite to main X and <italic>will be</italic> eliminated.</p>
<p>The question is: how does such criteria exist and function? The frame for existing of such criteria that makes it possible to attribute any act or <italic>replique</italic> (in Bakhtinian terms) as belonging to, or not belonging to, the X is a semiotic hierarchy of the events where the reference point BEFORE &lt;&gt; AFTER (NOW) is established around the event (person) who might have the highest semiotic tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354067X12456721">Figure 2</xref>).
<fig id="fig2-1354067X12456721" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Mythological description.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1354067X12456721-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Such <italic>monological</italic> positions where the only voice is acceptable eliminates all other possible ways to describe the phenomenon if such ways will be considered as opposite or destructive according to the specific context (level of semiotic evaluation). Parallel with a human being – who actually subjectively considers his or her life as “before and after my birth”.</p>
<p>Such a monological way of being (and creating a specific reference point BEFORE &lt;&gt; AFTER) gives a unique opportunity to play with the time and the consequence of the events where the other voices are silent or moved into margins – that is why classifications are explicitly <italic>post factum</italic> actions that provides the considering of the history in its own way.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1354067X12456721"><title>Do not touch!</title>
<p>On a very mundane level, we suppose that the ability to see is the most reliable, and that its advantages and hegemony are undeniable. Other ways of knowing the world are less elaborated and less <italic>perceivable</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354067X12456721">Brinkmann and Tanggaard (2010)</xref> argued on traditional Western epistemology actually based on seeing, that – “Knowing is seeing. Learning happens through visual confrontation with something” (p. 244).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354067X12456721">Brinkmann and Tanggaard (2010)</xref> proposed to replace such epistemology by epistemology of the hand, which may be described in three realms – metaphorical, craftsmanship and social practices, and schooling and education. The situation seems to be similar when we are trying to replace epistemology of <italic>written</italic> with epistemology of <italic>spoken</italic> or heard. By making such an allocation, when we put one sense forward and try to replace or recover other senses, this may lead us to misunderstanding and such tremendous error, such misunderstanding, is due to the <italic>fragmentation</italic> of modern psychology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354067X12456721">Toomela (2007)</xref>, in an analysis of the current state in modern cognitive psychology, gave an example of how modern cognitive psychology is out of context the subject it would be involved with:<disp-quote>
<p>Psychology of perception, for example, is among other issues asking how patterns are recognized. The process of recognition includes creation of a sensory image and comparison with information stored in memory … It would be natural to assume that the same ideas are studied in memory psychology, But no, theories of long-term memory discuss issues of episodic and semantic memory or implicit and explicit memory instead. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354067X12456721">Toomela, 2007</xref>, pp. 458–459)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, we assume that the problem raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354067X12456721">Brinkmann and Tanggaard (2010)</xref> may be extrapolated to another domain, rather than the changing of educational systems. Namely, we think that considering the knowledge based either on the hand, the ear or the eye, might be useful for general discourse about those, who cannot see – about <italic>sightless</italic> people. Furthermore – we may extrapolate this distinction in order to describe how such fields like touching or seeing are regulated in culture.</p>
<p>Let’s take very trivial example we all have been encountered with –in museums or galleries we may often see a small plate with an inscription on it –“Please do not touch!” What might it mean? The first explanation is very mundane – touching the objects is very harmful and may completely destroy each object after some time. Secondly – why does this inscription appear? We have completely got used to the idea that vision is the most powerful cognitive ability, and it is, but this ability is not separated from other senses, and that is why being in the specific place (galleries or museums) makes us behave in a specific way (set of ritualistic actions) – and it appears to be very obvious that we are not allowed to do something in such specific areas. At the same time, the “Do not touch!” sign causes the opposition – “X – non-X” (“touch vs. not-touch”) – it literally provokes us to touch. This specific and very spread inscription is in role of a <italic>promoter sign</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>Sign becomes a promoter sign through canalizing future actions; and, most importantly, becoming internalized in the form of feelings. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354067X12456721">Valsiner, 2007</xref>, p. 59)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another example may be given from a very mundane situation as well – when someone is asking us to keep silent in some places (e.g. library, theatre) – for what purpose does such a rule exist? In this case, silence is something that makes it possible to hear what needs to be shared and translated to others. Silence here is rather a <italic>communicative tool</italic> than just an order of things, and silence also is <italic>a condition</italic> that makes such communication possible and tangible.</p>
<p>Nowadays, silence becomes an extremely rare phenomenon, especially in huge cities where it is absolutely impossible to hear anything, and if you experience such a feeling you may rather feel bad or anxious because your visual perception (huge city, city-blocks, long avenues etc.) contradicts the audio image you get. In order to hear something clearly, we need to eliminate other <italic>noises</italic> and thus we need to create silence. In this context, history – as a discipline – is an extreme example of how sensory deprivation (domination of written) makes it possible to create knowledge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1354067X12456721"><title>Blindness between norm and disability</title>
<p>How do <italic>we see</italic> blind people? If we just close our eyes we probably will only be able to <italic>see</italic> (to perceive) something black or dark – but our eyes as organs will work anyway. Thus, our (sighted) image of the blindness is based on this (quite weak, I have to admit) assumption that blind persons perceive something dark. And if we will proceed one step further – we may even make an assumption about what is norm and what is blindness (which is being considered as deviation or deprivation). But for those who are unable to see from birth, even the word “norm” or “normality” cannot be applied – for them it is normal (sic!) to live without seeing, because the idea of blindness as darkness is a construction by the sighted population:<disp-quote>
<p>the only relationship the sighted have with blindness is to close their eyes or stand in a darkened room, the sensation they experience is one of the darkness … In reality, a totally blind person sees nothing – the absence of any visual stimuli. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354067X12456721">Ferguson, 2001</xref>, p. 45)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Coming back to the ability to experience the world using only touching or hearing (and other senses except seeing), we have to admit that there are a lot of examples when blind (totally blind, congenitally blind, later-in-life blind) persons achieved the same level of knowledge and were able to move and to act as successful as the sighted majority (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354067X12456721">Passini &amp; Proulx, 1988</xref>) experiment about spatial orientation in a maze by sighted and blind subjects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354067X12456721">Passini and Proulx (1988)</xref> showed, for example, that blind persons who had never had a visual experience were able to move in a maze and create a geometric representation of the environment they experienced. A blind person is able to construct the image of the world using other available senses – he/she is not disabled, just <italic>different</italic>, the appropriate education and training makes it possible for blind persons to act successfully in our – sighted – world. Of course, the counter-examples are not the exclusion here. Unfortunately.</p>
<p>So – who is blind? In terms of historical knowledge, it is the non-blind who are blind and disabled, they cannot see how the blind can live without vision. We are also blind as of our history – we are blind. The latter make possible to speak about history as about a psychological or (no offence) <italic>psychopathological science</italic>: we have to reconstruct the past using secondary sources (as a blind who is forced by extreme circumstances to develop their touch and elaborate hearing). Most of those sources are written and there you can find evidence about not only thoughts, but also of feelings that people had. Since the emergence of writing in human culture, it has become possible to describe events and feelings using words and letters. Word as <italic>describing remedy</italic> became very useful and powerful, punctuation made it possible to separate neutral from emotional and thus made it possible to <italic>animate</italic> written words.</p>
<p>The latter may be one of the reasons why the power of the word was so tremendous over the human history. Most of the history was a spoken history, not a written history. The inability (or disability?) to make pictures and the rare possibility to make drawings (for some events even much later than they occurred) lead to the great development of words as a describing category. Sounds and human voices, noise of great battles and great cities in the past were described and presented by written – often first spoken and then written – words. At our present time, we have a good possibility to read a correspondence between political leaders or writers and reconstruct events and whole biographies by using this source. But what is now? Nowadays, due to the development of technological devices that may produce and reproduce the reality without any hindrances (e.g. HD videos), and we can see that the power of the <italic>written</italic> has decreased. For example, with the disappearing of the <italic>epistolary genre</italic> in literature, people increasingly suspended writing letters to each other. High technologies made us closer but such proximity only devaluated the worth of personal communication – the whole ritual of writing letters disappeared.</p>
<p>Proliferation of messages (phone, emails) changes the value of the whole set of descriptive practices that persons of the past used to have – for example, compare diaries of travellers from the 19th and the 21st centuries – now, when people just take many pictures and show them after returning from the vacation. The consequence is also purely psychological – the elimination of memory. In the internet era, people do not have to keep in mind huge amount of numbers and facts – they may simply use electronic databases or perform a search on the internet in order to get information. But does the last mean that human has become more educated?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1354067X12456721"><title>Shorter but better?</title>
<p>It is not only the behavioural change (the whole ritual of writing a letter) but rather changes in psychological domain of human being – such as short phrases of phone messages that make it possible to react to everything without grasping the important and its transference through written language to the addressee. We can take a picture of a sunset and send it to a friend, but very few of us can describe the beauty of that sunset and our inner feelings using written words.</p>
<p>I guess the latter is the reason why we started to pay more attention to the secondary sources and strategies such as soundscapes or reconstruction of the noise of the past. Relative silence of history made it possible to hear any breath of a historical wind – our modernity draws a very motley picture and makes possible to save every word and image, and devaluation of senses emerged. If we have too many words, we always have the opportunity not to notice the most important one, silence has become rare and is compared with the nature (the peaceful life in villages or resorts situated in very natural areas) but for primitive man it was the opposite – the nature was an example of an extremely noisy area (e.g. thunder or storms were more loud than any sound human could produce). In Western cities, the sound of a church-bell was possibly the loudest sound, but nowadays it is covered and shadowed by a myriad of other sounds and noises (e.g. rush-hour traffic or industrial areas). On our streets and in buildings, we also may see people using earphones all of the time (working, using a public transport or working out in a gym) – they listen to music or radio, but they might just as well be covering one set of sounds and noises with another, using voice and sound as a curtain, as a coverage, that may protect from disturbing stimuli. Paradoxical here, is that <italic>sound</italic> here plays the role of a silence that also protects from something that is considered as disturbing.</p>
<p>Another example of changes in behaviour (and, thus, in psychological realm), is listening to music in our modern world. Technology has made it possible to save, download and re-produce music in many ways on numerous devices, and we are able to listen again and again to a piece of our favourite composition, quietly and loudly, on public transport and in our houses. And we even cannot imagine what it was like earlier, decades and centuries ago, when people could listen to Beethoven’s 5th symphony only a few times in their life (of course, we can <italic>imagine</italic> that it was possible, but the question is <italic>how</italic>). Music and sound (and thus – hearing as a cognitive process) became more useful, and the necessity of a special exploration of a sound emerged, but as hearing is an inseparable part of our cognitive functioning, as also sounds were and are inseparable parts of human life and history, and putting a special emphasize upon hearing and sound, we may diminish the importance of other senses or superimpose to hearing a greater importance that it deserves – this is a pure <italic>methodological</italic> obstacle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1354067X12456721" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>If we will look at history, we can see more than we can hear from it. Its deafness, its silence is not a disability for us but rather a way to find a compensatory remedy to understand of what has happened. Dialogue between senses and levels of description makes it possible to create a next <italic>replique</italic> in a long-term communication, where the ability to listen and hear is as important as the ability to respond. Silence also may be a response. Only crystallized <italic>monologized</italic> consciousness could not give any change to be heard and to receive an answer. Every <italic>written</italic> was before <italic>spoken</italic> or <italic>listened</italic> – “hearing and speaking are prior to writing and reading” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X12456721">Müller, 2012</xref>, p. 448), silence sometimes is more fruitful than any combination of voices and sounds. History is blindfolded – if we will close our eyes we will hear on a more elaborated level, but the only thing we need is a coordination between senses, coordination that provides a dialogue between us, between the past and the future.</p>
