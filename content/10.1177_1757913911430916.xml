<disp-quote><p>Professor Gill Rowlands from London South Bank University and Chair of Health Literacy Group UK looks at how health and education should work alongside each other in order to ensure good health</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Health literacy is a growing issue in the fields of public health and health promotion. It provides a framework through which to explore how the health and education fields can work together to improve a range of citizens’ skills throughout the life course to achieve and maintain good health.</p>
<p>Health literacy can be defined as: ‘… the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand, and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911430916">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Nutbeam’s seminal paper describes how health literacy can be usefully viewed as a set of skills mirroring literacy theory, including:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911430916">2</xref></sup></p>

<list-item><p><italic>Functional</italic>: literacy and numeracy skills need to be able to function effectively in everyday health situations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Interactive</italic>: more advanced cognitive and literacy skills that can be used to actively participate in everyday activities and to apply new information to changing circumstances.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Critical</italic>: advanced cognitive skills that can be applied to critically analyse health and health-related information, and to use this information to exert greater control over life events and situations.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>An individual’s skills are not applied in a vacuum; society, community and the health care systems will mediate the impact of skills on health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911430916">3</xref></sup> In the health literacy debate, therefore, both sides of the equation need to be considered; the skills that citizens need to become health literate, and the health literacy of society and health and education systems.</p>

<title>Health Inequalities and Health Literacy</title>
<p>Health inequalities arising from remediable social and economic causes are well recognised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913911430916">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913911430916">5</xref></sup> and resistant to change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913911430916">5</xref></sup> Health literacy is increasingly recognised as one of these social determinants of health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913911430916">4</xref></sup> The evidence base for the associations between <italic>functional health literacy</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911430916">2</xref></sup> and health inequalities has been largely undertaken in the USA, where lack of the former has been shown to be associated with higher risks of developing, and developing complications of, long-term conditions such as diabetes mellitus, heart failure and asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913911430916">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913911430916">8</xref></sup> and with higher health care costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913911430916">9</xref></sup> There is currently little or no evidence on the associations between <italic>interactive and critical health literacy skills</italic> and <italic>health outcomes</italic>; while it is reasonable to hypothesize that the health inequalities seen with functional skills are augmented for these more complex skills, research into this area, and potential points for intervention to reduce health literacy-related inequalities, is urgently required.</p>

<title>Health Literacy in Health, Public Health and Community Settings: Shifting the Balance of Power</title>
<p>The settings within which health literacy enquiry and practice take place are central to the definitions adopted and the measures used. In the clinical setting, practitioners and patients are involved in a one-to-one relationship that largely takes place in clinics and hospitals, outside people’s everyday lives, with complex information transmitted from practitioner to patient. The focus for research in this setting, described above, has been on the mismatch between the <italic>functional</italic> literacy and numeracy skills of those receiving and those transmitting health information. The balance of power within this paradigm lies with the practitioners and the health service within which they operate; they are responsible for delivering a service accessible to all, including those with low basic skills; the responsibility of patients is to act on the information they are given.</p>
<p>A public health approach, as seen in Canada,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913911430916">10</xref></sup> takes a different perspective. This highlights the importance of individuals’ lifestyle decisions on promoting health rather than preventing illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757913911430916">11</xref></sup> It shifts the focus away from the practitioner–patient consultation to the skills that individuals employ to evaluate health information within the context of their lives and throughout their life course. The responsibility moves from health practitioners towards the public and policy makers. Policy makers should ensure that societal factors promote equity of access to relevant information, the development of individuals’ skills to understand and evaluate such information, and the environment within which change can happen. Individuals then have a responsibility to, where practical and appropriate, incorporate information-based change into their lives. The balance of power, and hence level of responsibility, moves away from being practitioner-dominant to being a partnership between patients and practitioners; practitioners are a trusted source of information with whom to consult (<italic>interactive health literacy</italic>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911430916">2</xref></sup> while patients are ultimately responsible for decisions concerning their health.</p>
<p>A further shift of power and responsibility occurs when the focus shifts to communities. Levin &amp; Wills have described supporting communities to develop <italic>critical health literacy skills</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911430916">2</xref></sup> with encouragement to exert more control over their environment and social determinants affecting their health and well-being, leading to better health and more effective use of resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911430916">12</xref></sup> Within this setting, medical-information finding can move out to the community. Such an approach may empower patients to manage their own health and long-term conditions, essential if health services are to cope with ever-increasing demands, and hence costs, brought by a combination of increasing life expectancy, rising levels of long-term conditions and advances in modern technology and treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913911430916">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757913911430916">14</xref></sup>

<title>Health Literacy and policy</title>
<p>What are the implications of these different approaches for government and policy makers? All, if adequately funded and appropriately applied, should result in improved health and reduced health disparities, but with significant differences in speed and sustainability that need to be considered.</p>
<p>A clinical/biomedical approach, with identification of individual patient risk combined with approaches to improve communication and simplify health systems, will be faster, easier to implement and cost-effective. Those changing and improving practice are clinicians and managers; federal or national standards and targets could be quickly designed and applied, with improvements likely to be demonstrable within a short (three- to five-year) period. The problem is that this does nothing to address the underlying causes of inequality but simply ameliorates its effects. The personal and societal costs of long-term conditions will thus only increase with an aging population and improving medical technology.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is one of public health/health promotion to develop <italic>interactive</italic> and <italic>critical health literacy skills</italic>. This requires joined-up health and lifelong learning policy, with teachers, health professionals and health promotion experts developing and delivering courses that enable the public to ‘learn how to learn’ through identification and evaluation of information relevant to health and well-being. In addition, it involves developing an understanding of how lifestyle and the environment impact on health, and the skills needed to take control of adverse circumstances. This is a longer-term approach, the major effect being a reduction in the development of long-term conditions; it will take five to ten years before benefits start to show, and a generation for the full effects. This approach is not necessarily more expensive, but requires a shift of policy across government departments and interdisciplinary working within the health and education fields. The potential benefits of such an approach are huge: an informed and empowered citizenry in control of its own health. The ultimate proof would be a reduction in the inequalities in the prevalence of long-term conditions, and more effective medical treatments.</p>
<p>What is needed now is for national debates on the issues, followed by informed and joined-up policy with clear national leadership and measurable outcomes tailored to the approach adopted. Public health and health promotion experts have the skills and expertise to play a leading role in informing such debates, both through engagement with government to influence policy, and through opening public dialogue in this important area.</p>
