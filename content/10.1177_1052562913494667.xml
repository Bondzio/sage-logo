<p>Every instructor is beset with the problem of keeping up-to-date with an ever-increasing body of literature, to both the syllabi taught and innovations in the scholarship of teaching and learning. Remaining current in the management and organizational behavior syllabi is greatly helped by the presence of review articles in the various literatures. But such devices are uncommon in the field of scholarship of teaching and learning reflecting the emerging and still-maturing nature of our field. Recognizing the value of review articles, the <italic>Journal of Management Education</italic> (<italic>JME</italic>) is taking a lead in encouraging their production covering all aspects of management education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562913494667">Billsberry, 2012</xref>). Many topics in the field of management education have now become sufficiently mature, large, rich, and complex that scholars will benefit from review articles that identify the salient, the innovative, and the cutting-edge ideas. The purpose of this short article is to create a typology of review articles, explain the nature of the various types of review article, and focus attention on review articles in the field of management education. Ultimately we hope that you might be inspired to write a review article in the management education domain in which you are an expert. This is a call to arms and one to which we hope you will respond.</p>
<sec id="section1-1052562913494667">
<title>A Surfeit of Information</title>
<p>The usefulness of the review article can be viewed through two different lenses. Firstly, review articles help ease the task of sifting through the available literature to find the most pertinent concepts and constructs for a given purpose. In this sense, review articles can act as a tool to help deal with the surfeit of information that is available in a multitude of repositories. Second, the review article may be a source of the available evidence that supports the use of particular theories or constructs. In this, the second sense, the review article often forms the basis for evidence-based practice (EBP) in either a particular domain or in the scholarship of teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The sheer volume of work that an academic must assimilate is very large indeed. The increased volume of material has lead to specialized areas of knowledge within disciplines that were once unified fields of study. As early as 1859, Theophilus Parsons Jr., son of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, noted the following in a memoir of his father:
<disp-quote>
<p>All science is now so popularized, that it is easy to learn the elements of all, and most well-educated persons do learn them. But if one advances far beyond the mere elements, he must choose his path; for, by attempting to go forward equally in all directions, he would find that in every one of them he fell far short of knowing all that could be known, and all indeed that every one who would be proficient in them must know (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562913494667">Parsons, 1859/2009</xref>, p. 297)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That was 150 years ago. Some of the literatures that we encounter today are truly enormous, and although management education has been a relatively small field, it is maturing and some very large domains have emerged. Trying to get “up to speed” or keeping abreast in some of these fields is very challenging. In management education, the matter is complicated by the presence of education in most other fields. Although there are reasons why management education is special and deserving of focused attention, there is a lot to be learned from other fields as well. So although the field of management education is maturing, it is doing so embedded among many of educational literatures of which we should be aware.</p>
<p>Despite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562913494667">Parsons’s (1859/2009)</xref> note despairing about the tragedy of the size of human knowledge, review articles did not emerge in any volume for about 100 years. The term <italic>review article</italic> began to gain traction only in the 1950s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1052562913494667">Figure 1</xref> shows the relative popularity of the term <italic>review article</italic> compared to <italic>textbook</italic> over the 200-year period ending in 2000 (insufficient time has elapsed to extend the analysis to more recent years).</p>

<p>By the early 1970s, the review article was in ascendancy. In the economic domain the first issue of the <italic>Journal of Economic Literature</italic> in 1969 carried the following rationale for devoting a journal solely to the purpose of publishing abstracts and review articles:
<disp-quote>
<p>At present there are published each year between 1,300 and 1,500 books associated in some significant sense with the discipline. More than 250 journals (usually having four to six issues per year), carrying in total more than 5,000 major articles, are also published each year. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562913494667">Perlman, 1969</xref>, p. iii)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The <italic>Journal of Economic Literature</italic> currently publishes an issue every quarter contained two or three review articles alongside book reviews, an annotated bibliography of new books classified by subject matter, and an annual index of dissertations in North American universities. As the <italic>Journal of Economic Literature</italic> currently has a 5-year impact factor of 9.426, the popularity and usefulness of such reviews are evident. We are not looking to turn ourselves into a review journal, but we can see the benefit of published some articles of this nature.</p>
<p>Within the domain of management learning and education, the four leading journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562913494667">Rynes &amp; Brown, 2011</xref>) are (in alphabetical order) <italic>Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education, Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education, JME</italic>, and <italic>Management Learning</italic>. An examination of all articles published in these journals between 2000 and 2012 reveals far fewer review articles than might be expected. After eliminating articles that use the terms <italic>book review, online review, peer review, review process, reviewer education</italic>, and <italic>project review</italic> in their titles, only 15 of the 2007 articles published have the word <italic>review</italic> in the title and constitute a review article in the sense that the term is used in this article. This state of affairs has not gone unnoticed, with both the editors of <italic>JME</italic> and <italic>Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education</italic> recently emphasizing the importance that they place on review articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562913494667">Billsberry, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562913494667">Brown, 2012</xref>) and the current call by the <italic>JME</italic> for suitable material.</p>
<p>Things might not be as bleak in the management learning and education arena as suggested above. First, the major journals have frequently produced special issues that perform a similar role to extended reviews. In 2012, <italic>JME</italic> published three special issues (New Technological Advances Applied to Management Education, Principles of Responsible Management Education, and Healthy, Wealthy and Wise? Educating Management Students About Stress, Performance and Wellness). Second, publishers of domain specific journals and academic books have been publishing useful material for some time. Nevertheless, there is clearly a pressing need for review articles in the field of management education.</p>

<sec id="section2-1052562913494667">
<title>Evidence-Based Practice</title>
<p>Although the mainstay of most academic journals is the publication of individual empirical studies, these articles are fraught with problems. For example, there may be vagaries about the particular context or sample. There are limitations in how many variables a study may contain. Or there may simply be statistical freakishness in the data; the study might be the 1 in 20 exception confounding the significance statistics. And from the researcher’s perspective, all sorts of biases can cause people to overvalue the significance of their own work. So although single studies are the mainstay of many journals, their individual value is muted, and it is rare that much weight is attributed to a single study, especially if it contradicts previous findings. Thus, research papers, although valuable in themselves, need to be assessed in relationship to prior research; and this is the second valuable role of the review article. The practice of collecting and assessing the practical implications of research has become known as “evidence-based practice.”</p>
<p>EBP has its origin in medical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562913494667">Cochrane, 1999</xref>), where it has been defined as follows,
<disp-quote>
<p>Evidence based medicine is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562913494667">Sackett, Rosenberg, Gray, Haynes, &amp; Richardson, 1996</xref>, p. 71)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The same definition serves equally well in EBP in education where the systematic collection of such material that informs “best evidence” is often by means of review articles.</p>
<p>The advantages of the use of EBP in medicine and education are analogous. In medicine, the advantages have been described thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>Good doctors use both individual clinical expertise and the best available external evidence, and neither alone is enough. Without clinical expertise, practice risks becoming tyrannized by evidence, for even excellent external evidence may be inapplicable to or inappropriate for an individual patient. Without current best evidence, practice risks becoming rapidly out of date, to the detriment of patients. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562913494667">Sackett et al., 1996</xref>, p. 71)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus EBP does not involve merely following a set of rules; the assessment and idiosyncratic knowledge of the scholar or instructor are also vital components of a successful research or teaching project. In other words, EBP involves an interaction between what the scholar sees, experiences, and studies and the advice coming from the accumulated body of knowledge. Hence, it is important that the scholar is a curious practitioner both in studying own circumstances and in the relevant literature. And with the rapidly expanding literatures, there is a key role for the review article.</p>

<p>We are open to all types of review articles. Each has its own purpose and is suited to different circumstances. We welcome all forms. Given the usefulness of the review article, their highly cited nature, and the current dearth in the management teaching and learning journals, we hope that you will consider contributing such articles to us.</p>

<title>This Issue</title>
<p>To “kick-start” our foray into review articles, this issue begins with three review articles. They illustrate different approaches to reviews and thereby demonstrate how flexible the review can be.</p>
<p>The first article is written by Kenneth G. Brown, Sara L. Rynes, Steven D. Charlier, and Andrew Hosmanek. The nature of organizational behavior syllabi is the object of their interest. They focus on the topics featuring in organizational behavior courses taught in MBA programs. Their findings are perhaps unexpected in that they find considerable diversity in the topics taught and the materials used. It is not the case that motivation, leadership, job design, and teamworking feature in all courses. Instead, only leadership (in some form) and teamworking feature in more than two thirds of courses. From a review design perspective, this article is very interesting as it show how empirical a review might be. These authors have chosen a topic where they have had to gather data by visiting the websites and writing to the various institutions in their sample. In effect, their review is a survey and analysis of physical phenomena and as such offers guidance on how descriptive or survey-style studies might be presented.</p>
<p>Laura L. Paglis is the author of the second article. Her interest is in how management skills are taught. She looks at the history, foundations in learning theory, course design issues, and unique challenges in teaching management skills. Whether management courses at university should be skill based is a long-standing issue. Some argue that skill development is anathema to theory-driven management development, other argue against the approach more practically, noting that if every management situation and challenge is unique how can a generic approach be produced? Despite concerns of this nature, the author finds a good deal of support for teaching management skills. This is a classic literature review that has the purpose of giving readers a complete overview of the matter at hand, namely, how management skills are taught.</p>
<p>The third review article is written by Thomas A. Conklin. His review takes the critical approach as he surveys a field with the purpose of extending it and offering new insights. He looks at student experience in teaching environments with a particular focus on Millennial students. Among his conclusions, he argues that adult students need to know why they are learning a topic, that they should be taught experientially and in a problem-solving fashion, and that the learning should be of immediate value.</p>
<p>Two innovations in instruction complete this issue. Diana Lazarova Smrt and Reed Elliot Nelson wrote the first of these teaching innovations. They have revisited an age-old theme in management education—the use of toys, in particular the use of construction toys—and given it a new twist. In their case, they use a Tinkertoy® builder set to introduce students to the job characteristics model. They promise a “quick-paced 75-minute class session.” In contrast, Sarah B. Rosol offers a “long-term, multitask, large group competition” whose purpose is to develop “cooperative learning experience while maintaining the elements of a constructive competition.”</p>
