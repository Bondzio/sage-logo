<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine the inclusion of race-related conversations within educational leadership preparation programs. We consider how students and professors within one preparation program conceptualize the ways in which conversations pertaining to race are present and/or missing within their courses. Specifically, we assess how both entities contribute to the silences that often obstruct conversations pertaining to race. Our findings further support the works of researchers who believe the field of education leadership must revisit the conceptual understandings of conversations and the pedagogical tools used to address issues of race within the classroom.</p>

<p>Since the election of Barack Obama, the first person of color to serve as president of the United States, discussions surrounding race and the role it plays in our daily lives have taken a new form. The centerpiece of these discussions questions whether we may now be living in a postracial society. Although such race-related conversations occur in different venues on a daily basis, they often avoid issues concerning the maltreatment of people based on the color of their skin. This evasion of participating in more purposeful conversations about race is a communicative strategy used to escape what are considered to be uncomfortable race-based exchanges and contributes to those who claim racism no longer plays a critical role within our contemporary society. Moreover, the meaning of race, the definition of racial identity, and the role racism plays within our society is thought of and discussed very differently depending on who is included in the conversation.</p>
<p>Although the United States has a rich historical lineage of persons who have purposefully challenged racism and its detrimental effects, it would be imprudent to make the claim racism is no longer an issue simply because a country founded on racist ideals elected its first president of color. For example, in the field of educational leadership preparation, pedagogies critically examining the multifaceted issues surrounding race and racism are frequently absent in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942775112464962">Dantley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942775112464962">Hawley &amp; James, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942775112464962">Herrity &amp; Glasman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1942775112464962">López, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1942775112464962">Parker &amp; Hood, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464962">Parker &amp; Shapiro, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942775112464962">Rusch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942775112464962">Rusch &amp; Horsford, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1942775112464962">Tillman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1942775112464962">Young &amp; Laible, 2000</xref>), a place where professors are tasked with educating students to work and connect with a wide variety of persons to produce a more tolerant and culturally dynamic citizenry. Many have accepted the notion that racism is a mere by-product of our multicultural society, thus choosing to go about their daily lives without regard to the complexities and outcomes entrenched within issues of race and racism.</p>
<p>The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine discussions pertaining to race as they take place within educational leadership preparation programs, focusing specifically on the <italic>meaning full</italic> essence of silences and how they shape the ways in which students and professors interpret, address, and avoid race-related issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei, 2007</xref>). From this viewpoint, silences are not considered an omission of data, rather they are seen as informative moments, providing qualitative researchers with a wealth of empirical material. bell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942775112464962">hooks’s (2003)</xref> progressive take on education serves as a motivation for this line of inquiry, as she envisions the co-construction of a liberatory experience where students and professors are able to “confront feelings of loss,” and thus restore their “sense of connection” (p. xv). hooks addresses her own attempts to create such a space within her classroom:
<disp-quote>
<p>Whether writing about love and justice, about White people who transform their lives so they are fundamentally antiracist at the core of their being…I work to recover our collective awareness of the spirit of community that is always present when we are truly teaching and learning. (p. xv)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Seeking to extend the antiracist community already in existence, this study is also informed by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1942775112464962">Scheurich and Young (1997)</xref>, as they challenge White scholars to oppose racism by questioning potentially dominant epistemologies. Within this challenge, Scheurich and Young task White scholars to rethink how they approach education through the legitimation of race-based epistemologies. In response to this challenge, our examination of silenced voices pushes the field of educational leadership to consider new ways of investigating the pedagogies present within educational leadership preparation programs. By examining the <italic>meaning full</italic> nature of race-related silences, we are able to offer insights as to how leadership preparation programs may revisit the ways in which pedagogies may better address race-related issues.</p>
<p>To structure our examination of the issues surrounding racialized silences, we conducted focus groups and interviews with professors and students within an educational leadership preparation program. Specifically, we adapted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei’s (2007)</xref> analytical framework of classroom silences, allowing us to examine our qualitative data through the deconstruction of problematic silences. Mazzei’s framework served as a theoretical and methodological guide throughout the study, helping us address the meanings, both spoken and silent, as to why professors and students within an educational leadership preparation program often struggle to participate in conversations directly focused on race.</p>

<title>Review of the Literature and Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Issues of race and racism in the United States cannot be glossed over if our society wishes to collaboratively address the divisive race-related issues continuing to exist. Even as our country grows more racially diverse, students from different racial and ethnic groups find themselves increasingly isolated and separated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942775112464962">Orfield, 2009</xref>). Recent enrollment data show a continued decline in the proportion of White students in public schools, increases in the number of students of color, and higher levels of segregation of Blacks and Latinos by race and poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1942775112464962">Orfield &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Resegregation is growing at an alarming rate in public schools. Social science research suggests racially isolated and segregated schools create noticeable harms for students of color. In addition, racially segregated schools tend to be high-poverty schools with limited resources, which can make a dramatic difference in the education low-income students of color can access (p<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1942775112464962">owell &amp; High, 2007</xref>). In particular, there are still vast disparities in achievement levels for Black and Latino students when compared with their White and Asian counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1942775112464962">Vanneman, Hamilton, Baldwin Anderson, &amp; Rahman, 2009</xref>). According to the results of the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), White and Asian students, on average, received higher scores than Black and Latino students on all assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1942775112464962">Vanneman et al., 2009</xref>), clearly suggesting race is an issue when considering gaps in educational performance and attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942775112464962">Howard, 2010</xref>). Subsequently, until we engage each other in conversations specifically focused on race-related gaps within society, such as employment, housing, and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1942775112464962">Rothstein, 2004</xref>), issues pertaining to academic inequity will continue to persist within public schools.</p>
<p>Given the disturbing disparities in educational achievement between racial/ethnic groups, conversations addressing race must be embedded into the pedagogical dialogue found within educational leadership preparation programs. All scholars must be brought to the table, regardless of race, so educational leaders are better able to address the ways in which race and racism are negotiated in the classroom.</p>

<title>Leadership Preparation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942775112464962">Brown et al. (2003)</xref> claim racism is a permanent fixture in our society, inculcating every institution from the field of education, to policy and politics, to the economy. Yet, educational leadership scholars over the past two decades have called attention to the absence of a sustained discourse on issues of race and diversity within leadership preparation programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942775112464962">Dantley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942775112464962">hooks, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464962">Parker &amp; Shapiro, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942775112464962">Rusch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1942775112464962">Tillman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1942775112464962">Young &amp; Laible, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1942775112464962">López (2003)</xref> asserts educational leadership preparation programs are in fact failing to adequately prepare school leaders, bypassing issues of race in lieu of the “more technical matters of school finance, organizational theory, leadership theory, and other staple topics” (p. 70). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942775112464962">Dantley (2002)</xref> also expresses concern stating, “Educational leadership has subsumed the verities of cultural differences in a grander narrative of control, standardization, and empiricism” (p. 334). Whether this neglect is the result of a purposeful bypassing, strategic control, or a combination of the two, race is often relegated to special topic courses and/or stand-alone seminars within educational administration programs. This type of marginalization casts race as the “theoretical footnote within the larger discourse of educational leadership” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1942775112464962">López, 2003</xref>, p. 70).</p>
<p>Despite the aforementioned critiques, a recent study issued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942775112464962">Hawley and James (2010)</xref> suggests numerous leadership preparatory programs have failed to address the absence of race within the curriculum. Surveying 62 universities affiliated with the University Council for Educational Administration (UCEA), Hawley and James found many educational leadership programs continue to marginalize issues of race and diversity to single course offerings. The exclusion of such issues within higher education programs may contribute to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942775112464962">Rusch and Horsford (2009)</xref> define as a culture of “silence and fear” among professors. Preparatory programs choosing to endorse such a culture are more likely to graduate public school leaders without the skills needed to address the “challenging, but necessary, conversations” connecting to issues of race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942775112464962">Rusch &amp; Horsford, 2009</xref>, p. 303).</p>
<p>Ultimately, the lack of a programmatic and coherent plan as to how leaders should be prepared to address issues of race and diversity has serious ramifications for those called to serve diverse student populations. We assert that if educators truly wish to facilitate change in regard to the inclusion of race-related conversations within the classroom, the pedagogies offered by leadership preparation programs must include strategies that bring race and racism to the forefront of the discussion while encouraging the thoughtful disruption of silences often occuring amongst students as well as teachers when engaging in such conversations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464962">Mazzei, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>A Focus on Silence</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1942775112464962">Young and Laible (2000)</xref> explain that despite the vast amount of scholarship targeting the development of “effective” school leaders, issues of racism continue to be neglected within most educational leadership preparation programs. Although as researchers our own antiracist agendas confront race and racism, we are concerned that conversations surrounding race are often defined by a focus on what is being said rather than what is not. Recognizing silences in conversations can serve to acknowledge the relevance of race just as much as addressing it directly. Scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1942775112464962">Schultz (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1942775112464962">Pollock (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112464962">Ladson-Billings (1996)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942775112464962">Mazzei (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464962">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464962">2011</xref>) have each brought critical attention to the importance of recognizing silences and have provided educators with ideas necessary to consider when confronting silence in the classroom.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1942775112464962">Schultz (2003)</xref>, offering an antiracist framework for teaching across differences, challenges educators to adjust the ways in which they listen to students, to whole groups, to the cues provided by cultural contexts, and to the practices enabling silences to take place. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112464962">Ladson-Billings (1996)</xref>, exploring the purposeful use of silences as a way to stunt race-related conversations, claims teachers should acknowledge what is <italic>not</italic> said in the classroom, thus probing and exploring silences through the use of alternative pedagogical strategies and acting on opportunities to reflect on and improve pedagogy and student–teacher interactions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1942775112464962">Pollock (2010)</xref>, examining the inquiry teachers must use and encourage before they can realize their potential as educators of diverse populations, provides seven specific actions teachers should work through when engaging colleagues in conversations focused on race: (a) examining the four core principals of everyday antiracism in education; (b) considering everyday decisions in terms of moving students toward or away from opportunity and success; (c) uncovering the socially programmed beliefs and values that make us take particular actions toward children; (d) exploring the tensions of embracing an “antiracist” identity; (e) making antiracist conversations an expected, ongoing aspect of discourse in professional communities; (f) confirming for educators that their everyday acts can make a significant difference; and, (g) developing a shared knowledge base to support discussion of race issues in schools.</p>
<p>Each of the scholars mentioned have recognized the importance of participating in race-related conversations within their studies. In addition, each has illustrated the equal, if not more, important aspect of examining the obstacles that too often silence race-related conversations.</p>

<title>A Framework for Investigating the “Problematic of Silence”</title>
<p>As a way to examine the purposeful silences within racialized discourses, this study specifically relies on the theoretical exploration of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei’s (2007)</xref> “problematic of silence.” Mazzei’s theoretical positioning allows scholars to confront the potentially paralyzing complexities educators and students face when confronting issues of race and racism, complexities often blocking, frustrating, and diffusing antiracist aspirations within the classroom and beyond. The always-present obstacles Mazzei addresses in no way call for a disgruntled end to our antiracist project. Instead, Mazzei’s scholarship provides a cautiously optimistic pathway allowing us to pursue our own goal of providing future educational leaders with a blatantly obvious antiracist project. This pathway does not attempt to provide the one best solution but offers an arsenal of critical questions. These questions address the frustrations we have personally witnessed throughout our experiences as practitioners, researchers, graduate students, and teaching assistants. Although void of final solutions, such questions provide the necessary ruptures to cumulatively etch out an ever evolving pathway that will assist us and other scholars as we collaboratively develop antiracist projects to better address efforts to improve educational leadership preparation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei’s (2007)</xref> methodological approach allows for the critical investigation of qualitative data frequently “left out, excluded, and literally silenced” (p. 46). Such exclusions may lead to the violent suppression of thought, emotion, and voice. Mazzei’s project directly addresses this suffocation by asking qualitative researchers to purposefully engage with silences as empirically “<italic>meaning full</italic> and <italic>purpose full</italic>” (p. 2).</p>
<p>By combining deconstructive and poststructural methodologies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei (2007)</xref> attempts to develop a theory of silence, which calls attention to the hidden voices of those who are researched. Framing silence as a rhetorical strategy, Mazzei believes by attending to the “strategic moves” of silences, researchers are able to glean important information from the untold.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei (2007)</xref> defines her deconstructive approach to qualitative research as a shift toward the “problematic of silence” (p. 45). She defines the problematic of silence as a method able to rupture the inscriptions of “meanings and sources of meanings possible in the doing of qualitative research” (p. 45). Mazzei’s problematization of silence is aided by a deconstructive method she defines as “the pursuit of a reading or analysis that seeks the excesses, the breaches, the ruptures, while keeping the analysis destabilized enough that something unexpected, something silent, something impossible may emerge” (p. 15).</p>
<p>This deconstructive method specifically targets the excluded, troubling the concept of fixed beginnings and endings when collecting data. Once a problematic of silence is established, the qualitative researcher’s mission is radically altered. Researchers using this method must pay close attention to how observed silences alter the collection and interpretation of data and must consider how the purposeful search for silence may reconfigure the collaborative nature of interviews, focus groups, and other interactive means of gathering data.</p>
<p>As a theorist who works within the poststructural paradigm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei (2007)</xref> seeks to deemphasize the stabilized “truths” emanating from textual analysis. Citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464962">MacBeth’s (2001)</xref> work, Mazzei calls attention to the dangers of placing too heavy of an emphasis on interpretable words. If we consider words to be decided, fixed, and unmovable, MacBeth claims we are simply engaging in language games that consider what can be observed as the “faithful narrative of what is lived and known” (p. 44).</p>
<p>The refusal to suffice with the fixity of the word/text/voice is beneficial when addressing the multitude of complexities that arise when resting on normalized notions of race and racism. The “monolithic” terms prescribed to racial categories or privileges, and the obstacles confronting antiracist scholars, serve as impediments to those who wish to prepare culturally responsible educational leaders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei’s (2007)</xref> deconstructive unraveling of silences attempts to interrupt ideological stoppages in the hope that scholars are better able to move through and on, continuing to explore the complexities of race, racism, and race relations.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>As stated previously, the purpose of our exploratory study is to examine discussions pertaining to race as they take place within educational leadership preparation programs, focusing specifically on the <italic>meaning full</italic> essence of silences and how they shape the ways in which students and professors interpret, address, and avoid race-related issues. We feel this study has particular significance as graduate students in educational leadership preparation programs are tasked with becoming leaders in a variety of diverse educational settings. With each appointment of an educational leader, it is absolutely critical she or he be prepared to address a multiplicity of issues concerning race, racism, and race relations. This study provides implications for educational leadership preparation programs as they work to prepare tomorrow’s leaders for the highly contentious political environment existent within today’s public schools.</p>
<sec id="section6-1942775112464962">
<title>Model of Inquiry and Data Sources</title>
<p>This study began as a result of feedback we received during a conversational session at the 2008 Annual UCEA Convention. The comments during this session provided invaluable insights into the current state of affairs concerning race, racism, and race relations in the 21st century educational leadership classroom. Specifically, we engaged scholars by leading a purposeful conversation meant to address the variety of challenges surrounding White discourses on White racism; engagement in conversations about racism inside and outside of university settings; confronting White racism, Whiteness, and White privilege; decentering Whiteness when discussing issues of race; and ways in which we can best “call out” professors who are not discussing race, racism, and race relations within their courses, helping them realize the importance of integrating these concepts into their curriculum. Although this particular conversation with scholars was informal and thus was not used in any of our future manuscripts, we transcribed and coded the narratives shared during this experience into themes, providing us with additional direction in our continued exploration of research focused on race, racism, and race relations.</p>
<p>On reflecting on our initial investigations with scholars from the field of educational leadership, we chose to conduct a qualitative study on a purposefully selected educational leadership preparation program to discover how race and racism were being addressed in the classroom. We used convenience sampling to solicit individual participants for this study, choosing to begin our research with a particular program in which we were granted access to students and professors over an extended period of time. Extended access to participants allowed us to lay the groundwork necessary to expand our research efforts to other leadership preparation programs across the country. We conducted two focus groups with student participants, the first occurring after their initial class together as a cohort and the second occurring after the completion of their first full academic year. We believe each of the focus group interactions provided us with an opportunity to identify and examine the underlying meanings of race-related silences. Our choice to conduct two chronologically spaced focus groups allowed us to examine how and why people make certain decisions regarding conversations surrounding race, and gave us an opportunity to witness and interpret the ways in which students’ race-related perspectives evolved due to their exposure to the content and pedagogical experiences made available over the course of three academic semesters.</p>
<p>In addition to focus groups, we interviewed three professors and a graduate assistant, each of who helped construct the design of the leadership preparation program under investigation. The professors interviewed for this study included the director of the principalship program, a clinical assistant professor who helped design the original program, and an associate professor who has also been involved in the development of the principalship program. A separate protocol was developed for the interviews to ensure the same information was collected from each of the participants. Each professor and the graduate assistant were asked to participate in two interviews lasting approximately 1 hour in length. Both the focus group sessions and interviews were tape recorded and transcribed soon after they occurred. Although interviews were conducted to better understand the perspectives of those responsible for the delivery of leadership curriculum, we recognize our subjective interpretations of an interviewed voice cannot fully unpack the lived experiences of principal preparation instructors as concretized truths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1942775112464962">Lather, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>The context of our work took place at a major research university located in the Southwest region of the United States. The leadership preparation program under investigation strives to prepare teachers to become exemplary leaders in urban settings by helping to develop their personal and professional capabilities, skills, and talents. Specifically, the program claims to provide transformational learning experiences for educators by collaborating with surrounding school districts and community organizations, providing a cohort structure in which the students experience the entire program together, and allowing students to complete research projects meant to prepare them for their futures as school leaders. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1942775112464962">Table 1</xref> illustrates the courses required of the students throughout their 2 years within the leadership preparation program.</p>

<p>The cohort of students within the leadership preparation program investigated consisted of 17 students—11 females (7 Whites and 4 Latinas) and 6 males (3 Whites, 2 African Americans, and 1 Latino). Seeking to recruit the entire cohort, we presented our study to all 17 students during one of their regularly scheduled class meetings; however, only 4 students chose to participate. Initially discouraged by the small number of student participants, we added to our investigation an inquiry as to why so few students chose to participate. Subsequently, we found three primary issues prohibiting the majority of students from participating. First, each of the 17 students were employed as full-time teachers or instructional leaders, thus limiting the time they had available outside of regularly scheduled class hours. Second, many of the students were traveling what they considered to be significant distances to attend class and were therefore unwilling to travel on days in which there was no class scheduled. Finally, at the time we first presented this research opportunity to potential participants, they had just viewed a critically oriented film focused on issues of race (see “Findings”), which had caused significant discomfort among many of the students. Yet, although the focus group for this study only included 4 students (2 White females, 1 Latina, and 1 Latino), we approached this project’s status as an exploratory study, and thus we continued our relationship with this cohort as the students progressed through their program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1942775112464962">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The analysis of qualitative data was iterative, allowing us to participate in a reflexive process considered to be both inductive and open-ended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1942775112464962">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1942775112464962">Patton, 1990</xref>). Throughout this process, we transcribed conversations, participated in the reflective analysis of gathered text, revised follow-up questions based on interpretive insights, and conducted additional reviews of the text by re-reading and re-listening to the stories collected. We also engaged in a comparative analysis of gathered stories, thus allowing us to identify emergent patterns and convergences within the text collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1942775112464962">Patton, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>The foundational coding groupings are based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei’s (2007)</xref> categories of silence. These categories seek to address the possible meanings behind why respondents remain silent or hesitant when it comes to conversations involving race. Although Mazzei warns readers that her categories should not function as a preordained list or heuristic, after listening and re-listening to the recordings of the focus groups, we found her categories useful for this exploratory study. Mazzei lists five categories of silence that serve as an illustration of how it is equally, if not more, important to pay attention to what is not being said as it is to what is being vocalized. These categories include (a) <italic>polite</italic> or <italic>comfortable silences</italic>: thoughts not spoken in fear of offense, (b) <italic>privileged silences</italic>: silences grounded in a White privilege that often prevent an awareness of White as a racial category, (c) <italic>veiled silences</italic>: silences concealing racist thoughts or actions, (d) <italic>intentional silences</italic>: when one chooses not to speak, and (e) <italic>unintelligible silences</italic>: purposeful silences, but not really intentional or noticeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To uncover such silences, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei (2007)</xref> suggests researchers first “ask/clarify” what can be considered text. Claiming an understanding of text cannot be bound to a researcher’s observance of the “limiting marks on a page.” Mazzei presses qualitative inquiry to also consider text as that which is spoken. In addition, if what <italic>is spoken</italic> can be considered, Mazzei challenges qualitative inquiry to consider what <italic>is not spoken.</italic> Justifying this approach to inquiry, Mazzei offers the following: “Silences and pauses must now be invited to step forward and take their rightful place in the pantheon of speech acts” (p. 18). Thus, our study is based on Mazzei’s concept of the <italic>meaning full</italic> essence of silences, as we acknowledge silences, are not thought of as absences or voids in the text under analysis but as essential elements in the speech actions of those being observed. Methodologically speaking, the investigation of silences challenged us to inhabit the role of “excessive listeners.” Throughout our careful examination of recorded transcriptions, we paid particular attention to the silence-specific pauses, breaths, and avoidances offered by participants. Again, Mazzei offers justification:
<disp-quote>
<p>The sifting we as researchers employ in our analysis of “speech” and “text” will no longer permit a tossing out of those large chunks of silence that we at one time might have considered to be of little value if in fact we were to have noticed them at all. (p. 23)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With this understanding, our task for this project was to understand how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei’s (2007)</xref> categories of silence provide insight as to what was not being said or vocalized during our conversations about race and racism. Although we acknowledge Mazzei’s warning that by using this type of methodology we may be unintentionally categorizing the silences based we consider this to be an ongoing exploration, one seeking the input of those who are studied and those who continue to engage in similar conversations.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>When presenting the textual interpretations of the participants’ stories, both told and untold, several considerations must be taken into account. First, we acknowledge studied participants may share their own experiences, but these tellings are often colored by the historical discourses that “prefigure, even as they might promise, representation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942775112464962">Britzman, 2000</xref>, p. 32). Second, we fully admit our own positionalities and epistemological stances are governed by the individual discourses of our time and place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942775112464962">Britzman, 2000</xref>). In addition, we view our work as another production of textual identities that cannot, and should not, be considered beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<p>The findings of our study attempt to provide an interpretive picture of the spoken and unspoken discourses shaping discussions surrounding race and racism within a specific educational leadership program. Although the following discussion is bundled within several labeled categories, we realize the fluidity of concepts cannot be bound within any one section.</p>
<sec id="section10-1942775112464962">
<title>An Exploration of Silences</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei’s (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464962">2008</xref>) investigation of silence is meant to bring attention to the qualitative data often dismissed when researchers restrict investigations to what is spoken. This inclusive approach to qualitative interpretation challenges researchers to investigate the <italic>meaning full</italic> essence of what lies between discursive exchanges.</p>
<p>Within this study, we recognize two primary factors contributing to the majority of the silences we were able to identify. First, many of the student-related silences occurred during a structured conversation occurring after they were exposed to a film, <italic>The Color of Fear.</italic> This movie, directed by Lee Mun Wah, details the intimate conversational interactions occuring amongst an interracial group of men. The discussions in this movie are purposefully constructed to initiate a broader conversation about the state of race relations in America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1942775112464962">Wah, 1994</xref>). The supervising professor purposefully chose this film so students would be forced to reflect on their own conceptions of race, racism, and race relations. The conversations, or lack thereof, following the “difficult screening” of this film shaped the interests explored within the first focus group. Second, we found many of the student silences can be attributed to the ways in which the preparation program was structured. Students repeatedly expressed regret that many of the race-related utterances they wished to share were marginalized as these conversations were specifically relegated to particular classroom discussions.</p>
<p>Instead of discussing the observable silences as if they were free-floating entities, we present them in a thematic fashion (cinematic and structural) situating this discussion within the activity and structural specific contexts through which they occurred. Within these findings, we also include comments gathered from our interactions with the professors who developed, and were responsible for implementing, the leadership preparation program curriculum.</p>
<sec id="section11-1942775112464962">
<title>Cinematic silences</title>
<p>During our initial focus group, students spent a significant amount of time discussing a movie documentary viewed at the end of their first enrolled semester, <italic>The Color of Fear</italic>. As stated, the movie examines race through the eyes of a group of men of various racial and ethnic backgrounds. Students claimed although the class was able to eventually engage in an in-depth conversation about the documentary, “the day after we watched the movie was the quietest our group had ever been. Not that no one wanted to volunteer information but it was slow, very slow.”</p>
<p>The silences experienced after the viewing of the movie offers an example of how people often refrain from speaking in fear of the response and judgment they may receive from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei, 2007</xref>). These silences were present even though the cohort had previously established what they considered to be a strong relational bond. One of the students remarked the cohort “had been together every day all day for so many hours all week . . . We were a really close group.” The same student went on to say,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that was the only reason why we were able to feel comfortable and talk the way we talked about those issues. I thought about what if I watched this at my school or with certain people. I don’t know what kind of conversations would come out with different groups of people where it wasn’t so intentionally well-planned.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One of the White students in our focus group stated she felt the class was silent because everyone was being respectful of what each person was thinking.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was very emotional. I know for me being a White person in the group, I didn’t feel like I had a powerful story to share like other people did . . . It was a time for me to listen and learn from what our classmates were saying.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These types of silences are both <italic>intentional</italic> and <italic>privileged</italic>. Although the White student cited “being respectful” as justification for her choice to not participate (<italic>intentional silence</italic>), we also found this silence to be <italic>privileged</italic>, a censoring of her voice based on a White positionality. Certainly not dismissive of this student’s authentic desire to be respectful, as we continued to revisit the data, several questions pushed us toward our interpretation of this silence as <italic>privileged</italic>. What if the student chose not to be silent, thus vocalizing to her peers why she felt she should not contribute to the discussion? Would such vocalizations have provided for a deeper discussion about issues of racism and privilege? Is it a <italic>privileged</italic> convenience for White scholars to withdraw from such conversations, rather than taking a risk by purposefully contributing to such conversations and opening oneself up to potential criticism? Although our answer to any of these questions is interpretive, subjective, and biased by our own privilege, we do believe the meanings within this student’s <italic>intentional</italic> and <italic>privileged</italic> silences deserve recognition. Our reading of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464962">Mazzei (2007)</xref> informed our interpretation of this student’s silence, which states by not acknowledging and vocalizing her Whiteness and the inherent power it carries, the purposeful lack of participation on the part of this student could be considered a <italic>privileged silence</italic>, as she essentially perpetuated a desire to validate her White privilege.</p>
<p>A Latino student provided an alternative reason as to why he silenced himself during the discussion of the movie,
<disp-quote>
<p>The reason I was quiet is because I think that I can kind of relate to the way a White person feels because I’m from (a city in the Southwest region of the United States) and it’s 99.9% Hispanic and you don’t see any White people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We categorized this response as a <italic>veiled silence</italic>. Although this student’s Latino heritage places him within a group that is itself often <italic>othered</italic>, we interpreted his withdrawal from conversations to be informed by a positionality shaped by his upbringing within a homogeneous community. In addition, we interpreted his commiserations with White struggles to be shaped by an upbringing where, as he admitted, he was never challenged to consider his existence as a raced individual. This particular student claimed that before entering graduate school, he lacked an experiential understanding of race and racism, as his interactions with different races were almost completely nonexistent before relocating from his hometown.</p>
<p>The same student also described his first encounters as a racialized person, which occurred when his peers began to make him aware about the ways in which he might be treated differently when traveling to more diverse communities. This particular student’s racial veil had been so fully developed that he failed to internalize these warnings until specific incidents began to occur and were called to his attention by peers. He spoke explicitly about an incident that happened to him as he walked along a curbside. In this particular instance, a White woman, walking toward him on the same side of the street, crossed the street as he neared. He said to his friend, “Is this what you’re talking about?” This comment was not met with silence by his focus group peers but with laughter. We found it somewhat odd that such hearty laughter followed one person’s description of his “first” recalled experience with racism. Perhaps, the laughter itself was a silence, an <italic>unintelligible silence</italic> that, although we are unable to capture the full meaning, served as a coping mechanism allowing students to hide their own discomforts brought about by a peer sharing a personalized discriminatory experience.</p>
<p>Yet another instance of a <italic>veiled silence</italic> was realized as a Latina student began to recall her childhood memories. Referring to the perceived history of <italic>others</italic>, the Latina participant offered the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>I grew up in a predominately White town, so some of the experiences I’ve had were not similar to some of the experiences other people had. So, I even felt like, am I not right for this because I didn’t go through this?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This participant attributed her withdrawal from the conversation to the fact that she sometimes felt “not right” about the discussions addressing race. We interpreted this feeling to be informed by a positionality shaped by this student being raised in what she perceived as a colorblind community. Addressing this colorblind existence, the Latina shared with us that during her childhood, she was never forced to confront her existence as a racialized being. Again, our choice to label this as a veiled silence is our own critical interpretation, but there is some thought this student’s colorblind stance was affirming to our White participants, as it provided them with the reassurance Whites need not always be framed as implicated racists.</p>
<p>Childhood experiences continued to emerge as a primary reason for student silences. When addressing her purposeful choice to not participate, a White female offered the following: “When I think about being White and I think about it being the dominant culture, especially in school and education, we always talk about how there’s the underlying curriculum that this is the way of the world.” Recognizing this student had previously admitted silencing herself during race-related conversations informed our interpretation of her silences as <italic>privileged</italic>. Her choice to not contribute to these difficult conversations appeared to be informed by her feelings of implication and guilt. These feelings encouraged her to not share with the whole group, thus providing her with a shield from any situations where she might be “called out” due to her own self-admitted privilege.</p>
<p>Even as participants recollected the “intense” silence following the screening of the film, new silences were being issued. As students crept around the discomforts experienced during the postscreening discussions, they crafted the “right” recollections during the focus group session. Although not explicitly stated, there were several muted attempts to describe the emotional response of those classmates who chose not to participate in our study. We interpreted this self-censoring as an example of a <italic>polite silence</italic>. It was obvious several of the persons absent from the focus group had been significantly impacted by the content of the movie. Although it appeared focus group members wanted to describe the degree to which certain peers were upset, they censored themselves in an effort not to offend those not present. We also considered this censoring as perhaps a way of not “calling out” a particular race or ethnicity; however, for this we have no proof, as it was clear the students wanted to move forward from this uncomfortable remembrance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1942775112464962">
<title>Structural silences</title>
<p>The data collected through our focus groups also helped us to understand silences occuring as a result of the programmatic structure of the leadership preparation program. During our second meeting with students, we learned 2 months into the third full semester of their program, the students felt the courses they were enrolled in during that particular semester—Special Education: Procedures and Processes for Administration (a curriculum-focused course) and Systems of Observation and Analysis (an instructional leadership-focused course)—failed to provide a venue to discuss issues of race, racism, and race relations. Moreover, the students informed us when they did ask questions regarding race in one of the courses, the professor neglected to provide a clear or direct answer to the students’ questions and quickly moved on to other topics.</p>
<p>The discontinuity of discussions surrounding race, racism, and race relations in the students’ courses may also be a result of the curriculum offerings within the leadership preparation program. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1942775112464962">Table 1</xref>, out of the 11 courses students are asked to complete, excluding their field experience, only 2 focus specifically on issues of values, ethics, and diversity: School Law and Class, Gender, and Race. Although only a couple of the leadership preparation program courses are specifically focused on areas that include conversations about race, racism, and race relations, this does not in any way mean professors teaching other courses not directly related to values, ethics, and diversity can or should not include these topics in their course curriculums. Furthermore, the professors we interviewed recognize the need to weave issues of social justice throughout the entire leadership preparation program and are currently working with other professors in the program toward meeting this goal. One professor told us,
<disp-quote>
<p>But, I think that overall, there is, you know, it has been seen as a need in the principalship program to really work on the curriculum, and there are a series of meetings that have happened already . . . there are a number of professors in our department who have gotten together for those conversations and to get things going on more curriculum redesign. From our background, working together, I’m sure that part of that curriculum redesign is going to use antiracism into the curriculum more.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We consider this to be a key finding within our initial exploration. We are interested in learning more about the presence of discussions surrounding race, racism, and race relations as students progress through their program, particularly in classes focused on special populations where these issues should certainly be discussed.</p>
<p>We also learned that professors’ past academic experiences might influence whether race-related topics are addressed in courses other than those explicitly concentrated on these areas. One of the professors interviewed talked about how her past experiences influenced the ways in which she addresses race and racism in her own courses. This explanation helped us better understand why other professors may choose to take a different approach when designing their courses.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Most people, when they put together a course, start thinking about the topic around which the course is focused. So, economics, law, those all may have things within them that focus on issues of race and it’s like one element. So, instead of thinking about how race is a critical issue within education, so how do I, how do I make sure that students leave this program with that understanding?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another professor addressed the silencing of conversations of race by asking, “Who carries the burden of having the discussion on race?” As an African American, regarding the discussion on race, this professor stated, “For some of us we get pulled in no matter what.” He went on to say,
<disp-quote>
<p>Oftentimes there is this understanding that I’m not going to talk about race if I’m a White person . . . I’ll leave it to the Black person. It’s their burden. . . . They want you to speak for all of the Black people in the world. I don’t know all of the Black people in the world!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly, when it comes to addressing race, racism, and race relations in the classroom, if a course is not directly aimed at speaking to these issues, the likelihood of engaging in conversations about the role of race in the classroom may depend on the individual professor teaching the course. Moreover, professors’ past experiences, interest in the topic, or even the way in which others identify them can determine whether students are receiving the preparatory experiences necessary to lead in racialized contexts. Thus, we can see how the structure of leadership preparation programs as well as the activities students are engaging in within these programs in regard to race, racism, and race relations can result in cinematic and structural silences. Unfortunately, this also means that if students wish to engage in these conversations and professors do not, the burden is then placed on the students to begin the conversation.</p>

<sec id="section13-1942775112464962" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The stories shared by participants in our study often described race-related conversations as “emotionally charged” and personally “challenging.” Our interpretations of data highlight how an individual’s life story, personal biases, and insecurities complicate discussions focused on race. These complexities left students feeling as if they were inadequately prepared to help create a safe space where all participants could share their “true” feelings about racial issues.</p>
<p>The difficult nature of these conversations as described by student participants deserves significant attention, as research has shown that students are frequently better than their professors at engaging in race-related conversations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1942775112464962">Singleton &amp; Hays, 2008</xref>). Our findings from professors seem to support the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1942775112464962">Singleton and Hays (2008)</xref>, as they suggested structural issues (such as curricular planning) and delegation of such conversations to scholars of color may severely limit what conversations filter throughout the program.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether such conversations are difficult to facilitate or perhaps uncomfortable to plan for, there is simply no excuse for these discussions to not occur. Discussing race forces us to confront the troubling realization that our nation’s enactment of democracy is seriously flawed, as we continue to endure the tangible effects of race-related discrimination. Adding emphasis to the need for such conversations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1942775112464962">West (2001)</xref> explains choosing to openly discuss the importance of race and the degree to which it matters allows our nation to examine the core of American democracy.</p>
<p>The radical demographic shifts currently occurring within schools throughout the United States further emphasize the importance of discussing issues of race and racism in the educational leadership classroom. The education of a more diverse student population should provide the impetus for a renewed focus on the ways in which we prepare the leaders of our public schools. Specifically, we should strive to prepare all leaders in a way that they are able to best realize their own antiracist agenda. Speaking to the demographic shifts in our nation’s schools and how education leadership programs may be failing to meet such changes, one student remarked,
<disp-quote>
<p>What do you do because there is this widening gap where you have all of these teachers who are White and have been in the profession for a longtime or even new teachers. What do you do to help them become more culturally responsive and to relate to the students because the demographics are obviously changing. We still haven’t had any good strategies or heard any specifics. I don’t feel like that conversation has happened. We talked a lot about the problems and being made aware of them and our self-awareness but we haven’t talked about any actions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly, although conversations are the important first step in promoting an antiracist education in educational leadership preparation programs, we must not stop there.</p>
<p>Our findings support the works of researchers who believe educational leadership must revisit the conceptual understandings of conversations and pedagogical tools used to address issues of race and diversity, bringing them back into the classroom where concepts can be transformed into pedagogical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942775112464962">Darling-Hammond, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942775112464962">Futrell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942775112464962">Howard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942775112464962">Ladson-Billings, 2000</xref>). In addition, the stories shared by students helped us recognize providing deliberative spaces to address race within the classroom may not be enough, as students may continue to silence themselves for a number of meaningful reasons. Thus, silences occurring in the classroom should never be ignored; rather, they should be purposefully explored. Our experiences within this study support the argument that each silence provides qualitative researchers with an entirely relevant language carrying with it just as much information as speech itself. In fact, it is perhaps through the rupturing of static silences where we may be best able to grasp the strategic purposes of non/language.</p>
<p>Our exploratory interactions with students and professors highlight just a sampling of the many issues that may obstruct the conversational addressing of race, racism, and race relations within the classroom. However, eliciting a sense of optimism, we encountered a positive example of a lead professor who is taking significant steps to move the often-difficult conversations surrounding race away from the margins, thus solidifying such issues as a permanent and central component of the everyday learning provided to tomorrow’s educational leaders. Overwhelmingly, the students praised their lead professor, as they spoke about the professor’s willingness to address such difficult conversations. Speaking to such efforts, one student offered the following: “I always leave learning something new and [the class] just opened up a whole new door for me, and there are just things you can’t get in a textbook.” When stated, this comment garnered what appeared to be unanimous approval.</p>
<p>Our readings of the literature and findings have affirmed our assumption that race is inadequately discussed within the walls of our nation’s universities. In addition, as White scholars desirous of promoting an antiracist research agenda, we acknowledge our privileged positionality and thus find ourselves fumbling toward our own inclusion in the spaces where these conversations may occur. Cognizant of the fact that we must always acknowledge our privileged positionality, we understand we must strive to contribute to these discursive spaces and further unpack what this means for our thinking, our behaviors, our attitudes, and our decisions from the micro, personal level to the macro, social level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942775112464962">Scheurich, 1993</xref>). This exploratory study was yet another step in this journey.</p>
<p>Our plan is to continue a project commenced in 2008 at the Annual UCEA Conference. It was at that conference where we launched to the public (beyond the walls of our own university setting) the promotion of our antiracist agendas. We have undoubtedly stumbled along the way and have made mistakes. However, we continue to read, to learn from others, and perhaps most importantly, we continue to “do.”</p>
