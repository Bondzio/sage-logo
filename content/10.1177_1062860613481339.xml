<p>A Call to Action</p>
<p>The American College of Medical Quality Visit us at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.acmq.org">www.acmq.org</ext-link></p>
<p>As Alan mentioned in the last President’s column, we have just completed two strategic retreats to review our status as a college, and to recommend to the new leadership our action plans to attain our strategic goals. The four consensus decisions are: (1) Address a short term need for aggressive member recruitment, staying focused on physician membership, while expanding our outreach to physicians and PhDs in research and education. We were convinced that our scope of membership should remain physician based: since physicians prefer physician-only groups, we know this membership, and there is a considerable pool of potential physician members yet available. About 75% of the current members are in management positions for providers or payors, and there are a large number of similar physicians in such organizations as the American College of Physician Executives—that is a large pool of potential members. (2) Our Annual Meeting is one of our strengths, since it is a major revenue source, attracts grants, has highly rated content, provides an opportunity to attract new student/resident scholars and talent, and is the one time we convene the membership and allow for networking. That said, we also have decided that having our own freestanding meeting will allow us increased control over the location, cost, and format of the meeting. So for 2014, we will be having our own meeting in Alexandria, VA, at the Monaco Hotel on March 27-29, 2014. The financial projections for this move are positive and it will give increased visibility to the college in a part of the country that we know from experience is very popular. (3) In addition to the Annual Meeting, there was agreement on the importance of pursuing alternative educational opportunities and alternative ways to address and communicate our policies. (4) We need to set targets; track and measure our progress on membership growth, meeting attendance, and participation in our committees and workgroups; and decrease the size of the board and re-purpose the committee structure.</p>
<p>In order for these strategic goals to be accomplished, it was recommended by our expert facilitator that we adjust our governance structure to address these very same goals. So I have taken that advice and limited the size of the Board of Trustees and aligned the committees to address our strategic goals head on.</p>
<p>Besides the recently elected officers of the Executive Committee, I will have the following committees: Education/Annual Meeting, Alternative Education, Membership, Marketing, and Policy. The chairs of these committees will be voting board members. In addition, I will have two At Large Trustees for Young Physicians and the Student/Resident Section. Ad Hoc, nonvoting members will include such areas of activity as the representatives to the AMA and the NQF representative. Of course, our board meetings are open to anyone in the membership that wants to attend as well. And I encourage you to do so.</p>
<p>Below is listed the membership of the new Board of Trustees:</p>
<p>Executive Committee and Officers: Jim Cross, MD, President; Prathiba Varkey, MD, President-elect; Mark Lyles, MD, Vice President; Don Casey, MD, Secretary; John Vigorita, MD, Treasurer; Alan Krumholz, MD, Immediate Past President; Don Fetterolf, MD, Past President.</p>
<p>Committee Chairs: Henry Johnson, MD, Education/Annual Meeting; Beverly Collins, MD, Alternate Education; (Exec Sponsor of Education, Prathiba Varkey, MD); Claudio Loffreda Mancinelli, MD, Membership; Jessica White, MD, Marketing; (Exec Sponsor of Membership/Marketing, Mark Lyles, MD); Paul Bronston, MD, Policy; (Exec Sponsor of Policy, John Vigorita, MD); Peter Lee, MD, Young Physicians; and Heidi Charvet, Student/Residents; (Exec Sponsor of S/R, Jim Cross, MD).</p>
<p>There is now a clear direction that the college is taking and a path that I think will lead to our success. We now need to stay focused and accomplish the goals that we have set. I think there is new energy in the college, and I look forward to working with all of you as your new president.</p>
