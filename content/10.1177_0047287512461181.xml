<abstract>
<p>Research acknowledges the tourist as imperative in creating experience value. Building on this premise, the present study offers an integrated approach to understanding tourists’ experience values and attempts to extend the theoretical and empirical evidence of causal relationships between the motivation, involvement, and the experience value of the destination, hereafter called experience value. Using a sample drawn from tourists in Norway, the research model investigates relationships between the three constructs, using a structural equation modeling approach. The results indicate that motivation and involvement are linked to tourists’ experience value and motivation affects the level of involvement. In order to facilitate for tourists to cocreate experience value then, not only should the industry recognize experiences that tourists value but should also acknowledge motivation and involvement as essential in value creation for tourist experiences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tourists visit a destination in order to fulfill experience-related needs and wants. In spite of the importance of a destination’s ability to meet tourist needs and to provide, deliver, and facilitate valued experiences for the tourist, few, if any, studies have focused on the destination level of experience value for tourists. There is a need to further acknowledge the tourist as resource provider and part-taker in creating experience value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0047287512461181">Vargo and Lusch 2004</xref>). Hence, the present paper outlines the experience value of a destination and subsequently tests the effects of tourist motivation and involvement on the perceived experience value of a destination.</p>
<p>Perceived value has been acknowledged in marketing research as key to grasping consumer behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0047287512461181">Nilson 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287512461181">Ostrom and Iacobucci 1995</xref>), and customer value is defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0047287512461181">Woodruff (1997</xref>, p. 142) as “a customer’s perceived preference for and evaluation of those product attributes, attribute performances, and consequences arising from use that facilitate (or block) achieving the customer’s goals and purposes in use situations.” Perceived experience value has also been outlined and tested in tourism contexts such as hospitality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512461181">Al-Sabbahy, Ekinci, and Riley 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512461181">Kashyap and Bojanic 2000</xref>), among timeshare owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512461181">Bradley and Sparks 2012</xref>), in heritage tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287512461181">Chen and Chen 2010</xref>), cruise experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287512461181">Dumand and Mattila 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0047287512461181">Petrick 2004</xref>), golf tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287512461181">Hutchinson, Lai, and Wang 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0047287512461181">Petrick and Backman 2001</xref>), dining experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287512461181">Oh 2000</xref>), vacation purchase situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0047287512461181">Sànchez et al. 2006</xref>), and adventure tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0047287512461181">Williams and Soutar 2009</xref>). Despite the increased interest in research into qualities of a destination, few have considered the destination itself as an overall provider of value for tourists, that is, the perceived experience value of the destination. An exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287512461181">Moutinho (2011)</xref>, who utilizes destination pull factors in measuring the tourist experience value of a destination and test effects on post-behavioral consequences of the tourist’s destination value perception. Despite the fact that previous research has pointed to the importance of the tourist destination as an amalgam of numerous products and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287512461181">Buhalis 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0047287512461181">Ritchie and Crouch 2000</xref>) and subsequently outlined the importance of the destination as a pull motivator for tourists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0047287512461181">Yoon and Uysal 2005</xref>), there is a lack of knowledge about the drivers of the perceived experience value of a destination. The present paper aims to fill this void by testing underlying motivations and tourist involvement as antecedents of destination value perception.</p>
<p>Experience value is described in terms of being an “interactive relativistic preference experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287512461181">Holbrook 1999</xref>, p. 5). Following Holbrook’s lead, many researchers have explored and tested this value construct in marketing settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0047287512461181">Woodall 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287512461181">Sweeney and Soutar 2001</xref>) and in tourism contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512461181">Bradley and Sparks 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287512461181">Gallarza and Saura 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0047287512461181">Sànchez et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0047287512461181">Williams and Soutar 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0047287512461181">Woodall (2003)</xref> claims the relevance of “personal perception of advantage arising out of a customer’s association with an organization’s offering” (p. 21). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512461181">Bradley and Sparks (2012)</xref> follow the lead of Holbrook and Woodall in perceiving “value as a benefit or advantage, something consumers prize over other things” (p. 191). The present work follows the lead of these authors and acknowledges the current tourist value of a destination experience.</p>
<p>Since tourists are considered to be “value-driven” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287512461181">Levy 1999</xref>), tourist firms and destinations (DMOs) need to acknowledge what their customer’s value in order to be competitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0047287512461181">Woodruff 1997</xref>). Perceived value is consequently depicted as a vital strategic instrument for firms who wish to be competitive in the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0047287512461181">Woodruff 1997</xref>). There has been recent empirical interest in the relationships between antecedents and outcomes of perceived value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512461181">Baker and Crompton 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512461181">Bradley and Sparks 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287512461181">Chen and Chen 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287512461181">Chen and Tsai 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287512461181">Gallarza and Saura 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287512461181">Hutchinson, Lai, and Wang 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0047287512461181">Petrick and Backman 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0047287512461181">Petrick 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0047287512461181">Williams and Soutar 2009</xref>). In other words, value is an important antecedent to satisfaction and customer intention or loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512461181">Anderson, Fornell, and Lehmann 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512461181">Baker et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512461181">Bradley and Sparks 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287512461181">Lee, Yoon, and Lee 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0047287512461181">Williams and Soutar 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287512461181">Chen and Chen 2010</xref>), which firms and destinations should acknowledge in order to be competitive in the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0047287512461181">Pechlaner, Smeral, and Matzler 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287512461181">Petrick 2003</xref>). However, to be able to provide valuable destination experiences for tourists, the drivers of value perception, that is, the tourist’s motivations, should be recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287512461181">Duman and Mattila 2005</xref>). This study therefore focuses on the antecedents of perceived destination value in a pleasure tourism context. This does not exclude the quality of destination attributes, however, which is part of the pull factor of motivation. This study proposes motivation and involvement as antecedents of perceived values of the tourism experience.</p>
<p>Motivation and involvement have been examined as the main constructs of tourism marketing studies. Motivation is depicted as the driving force behind all behavior and directly affects overall evaluation, that is, satisfaction of a tourist vacation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0047287512461181">Yoon and Uysal 2005</xref>). In a similar way, involvement is defined as the tourist’s internal state variable, depicting the amount of arousal, interest, or drive evoked by a product class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287512461181">Bloch and Richins 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287512461181">Houston and Rothschild 1978</xref>), making it a motivational construct. Tourist involvement is therefore also expected to affect tourist experience value of a destination. The degree of a consumer’s involvement is also useful for the examination and prediction of consumer behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287512461181">Broderick and Mueller 1999</xref>); hence, it is of utmost value for the tourism industry to recognize involvement in order to attract tourists so that they can provide valuable experiences while visiting the destination.</p>

<title>Perceived Value of a Destination</title>
<p>Although perceived value has received growing attention in research, researchers seem to vary in their views and definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287512461181">McDougall and Levesque 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0047287512461181">Zeithaml 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0047287512461181">Woodruff 1997</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287512461181">Cravens et al. (1988)</xref> claim that a consumer’s value perception traditionally is seen as the ration amount or trade-off between quality and price. The most commonly referred to definition of perceived value is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0047287512461181">Zeithaml (1988)</xref>, who outlines four types of values (low price; whatever I want in a product; the quality I get for the price I pay; what I get for what I give) and synthesizes the four dimensions into one overall concept. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0047287512461181">Zeithaml (1988</xref>, p. 4) regards value as “consumer’s overall assessment of the utility of a product based on perception of what is received and what it is given.” The conceptualization of value as a trade-off between “get” and “give” has boosted a universal interest in the composite nature of consumer value (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512461181">Bradley and Sparks 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287512461181">Gallarza and Saura 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287512461181">Sweeney and Soutar 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0047287512461181">Woodruff 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>As the destination is the rallying point for products, services, and experiences for tourists, destinations as competing entities have received increasing attention in research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512461181">Crouch and Ritchie 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287512461181">Hu and Wall 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287512461181">Enright and Newton 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512461181">Hunt and Crompton 2008</xref>). From that viewpoint, it is defined as the “process by which an individual receives, selects, organizes, and interprets information to create a meaningful picture of the environment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287512461181">Harrell 1986</xref>, p. 6). A definition of tourist value perceptions of the destination experience might be:
<disp-quote>
<p>The process by which a tourist receives, selects, organizes, and interprets information based on the various experiences at the destination, to create a meaningful picture of the value of destination experience.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Perceived value has previously been operationalized with a single-item scale such as “value for money”; however, a single-item scale does not address the whole concept of perceived value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287512461181">Gallarza and Saura 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0047287512461181">Sweeney, Soutar, and Johnson 1999</xref>). Based on social judgment theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287512461181">Brunswick 1952</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287512461181">Bolton and Drew (1991</xref>, p. 377) suggest that value is the key link between the cognitive elements of perceived quality or performance, perceived monetary sacrifice and behavioral intentions, in that they claim that perceived value is a “richer measure of customers’ overall evaluation of a service than perceived service quality.” Measuring multiple components of perceived value has therefore been recommended by many researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287512461181">Gallarza and Saura 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287512461181">Sweeney and Soutar 2001</xref>). A broader theoretical framework of perceived value is developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0047287512461181">Sheth, Newman, and Gross (1991)</xref>. Following the Sheth, Newman, and Gross’s lead, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287512461181">Sweeney and Soutar (2001)</xref> developed perceived value in a retail purchase context. To measure the on-site perceived value, the researchers argued for four distinct dimensions: emotional, social, quality/performance, and price/value for money. The results indicated that these multiple value dimensions perform better than a single-value item such as “value for money.”</p>
<p>A number of studies have showed that perceived quality and monetary price are the two main antecedents of perceived value in the tourism services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287512461181">Chen and Chen 2010</xref>). Many studies have also supported the idea that quality is the best predictor of perceived value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512461181">Baker et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512461181">Cronin, Brady, and Hult 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0047287512461181">Parasuraman and Grewal 2000</xref>): that is, quality positively affects perceived value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512461181">Cronin, Brady, and Hult 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0047287512461181">Spreng, MacKenzie, and Olshavsky 1996</xref>) whereas perceived price has been found to negatively affect perceived value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0047287512461181">Sweeney, Soutar, and Johnson 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0047287512461181">Zeithaml 1988</xref>). By focusing on changes in value perception among timeshare owners, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512461181">Bradley and Sparks (2012)</xref> studied the quality–value–satisfaction–loyalty chain, revealing that distal factors, as opposed to proximal factors, are antecedents for change in perceived value, that is, consumption experiences, learning experiences, consumer, and product factors.</p>
<p>Most previous predictors of perceived value were cognitive factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287512461181">Dumand and Mattila 2005</xref>) whereas affective–hedonic factors have more often been ignored in research. Some exceptions do exist, however: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287512461181">Petrick (2003)</xref>, for instance, reveals that service quality, emotional response, monetary price, behavioral price, and reputation are significantly linked to perceived value, and subsequently found that all five factors affect perceived value. Recently, Lee, Lee, and Choi (2011) revealed the importance of emotional value in addition to functional value for festival goers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287512461181">Dumand and Mattila (2005)</xref> also found that affective factors, especially hedonic and pleasure, are related to a cruise vacationers’ value perception. They suggested that future research should examine other potential factors that might influence perceived value. Consequently, the present paper hypothesizes tourist motivation and involvement as possible antecedents of tourists’ perceived value of a destination.</p>

<title>Motivation</title>
<p>A review of tourism literature reveals an abundance of studies into motivation. Tourism researchers have examined the motivation to travel in order to better understand and predict travel behavior. The reason for this is that destination marketing would be impossible without an understanding of tourist motivation. As motivation can be defined as the driving force behind all behavior, it is likely that tourist motivation may also affect tourist attitude in general and some salient aspects of behavior such as involvement, perception, and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512461181">Fodness 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287512461181">Gnoth 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of studies have examined the relationship between motivation and involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287512461181">Clements and Josiam 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287512461181">Josiam, Kinley, and Kim 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287512461181">Josiam, Smeaton, and Clements 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512461181">Kyle et al. 2006</xref>). A study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287512461181">Josiam, Smeaton, and Clements (1999)</xref> for example examines the relationship between push/pull motivation and involvement levels by surveying students on their spring break holiday. The results reveal that high levels of involvement are significantly associated with proximal push and distal pull motivation factors, that is, motivation pushed internally by the tourist and externally pulled by the destination. Students who are motivated by push and pull factors were more likely to travel. In a different study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287512461181">Josiam, Kinley, and Kim (2004)</xref> examine the relationship between tourist shopping involvement and demographics, push/pull motivators, shopper-tourist cluster typologies, and the amount of time and money spent on shopping while on a trip. The results reveal that the levels of involvement are significantly related to push and pull motivations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0047287512461181">Yoon and Uysal (2005)</xref> examine the relationships between push and pull motivations, satisfaction, and destination loyalty by using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The research findings indicate significant relationships between pull motivation and satisfaction, satisfaction and destination loyalty, and push motivation and destination loyalty; however, they could not find a significant relationship between intrinsic push motivation and satisfaction. Destination-based pull motivation negatively affects satisfaction, while satisfaction with destination experience and push motivation influences destination loyalty positively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287512461181">Schofield and Thompson (2007)</xref> explored the effects of push and pull motivation on satisfaction and behavior intention. The study results show that only some of the pull and push motivation factors significantly affected satisfaction and only one push motivation affected intention to return. Despite that, these studies point to relationships between motivation, satisfaction, and loyalty constructs; they vary in terms of the relative importance of pull and push motivation on satisfaction and future intention, indicating a missing link in the models.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512461181">Cronin, Brady, and Hult (2000)</xref> clarified and tested the relationships between service quality, value perception, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions. Their study results suggest that the consumer decision-making process for service products is best modeled as a complex system where consumers’ value perception affected behavioral intentions directly and indirectly through satisfaction. Of particular interest is Cronin, Brady, and Hult’s focus on the indirect effects that service quality and service value have on consumer satisfaction, putting forward the relevance of tourist value perception as a mediator in tourist encounter experiences. All in all, previous research has examined relationships between motivation, involvement, value perception, and satisfaction, and there is a consistent result for the path from motivation to involvement and for value perception across industry contexts. Accordingly, the present work puts forward the following specific hypotheses:</p>

<title>Involvement Construct</title>
<p>Involvement is defined as a motivational variable reflecting the extent of personal relevance of the decision to the individual in terms of basic goals, values, and self-concept (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287512461181">Richins and Bloch 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0047287512461181">Zaichowsky 1985</xref>). Involvement is a widely used concept in consumer behavior and is seen as an important psychographic construct because of its potential effects on people’s attitudes toward an activity and their behavior with respect to the activity and to decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287512461181">Arora 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287512461181">Josiam, Smeaton, and Clements 1999</xref>). Knowing the degree of a consumer’s involvement is useful for the examination and prediction of consumer behavior. This is explained in the literature as due to effects on information processing and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287512461181">Broderick and Mueller 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Involvement is also depicted as “a person’s perceived relevance of the object based on inherent needs, values, and interests” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0047287512461181">Zaichowsky 1985</xref>). Involvement is further described in terms of the level of interest of importance a person gives an object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0047287512461181">Zaichowsky 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0047287512461181">Selin and Howard (1988</xref>, p. 237) defined involvement within a recreational setting as “the state of identification existing between an individual and a recreational activity, at one point in time, characterized by some level of enjoyment and self-expression being achieved through the activity.” In a similar way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287512461181">Manfredo (1989)</xref> defines involvement within leisure and tourism contexts as the degree of interest in an activity and the affective response associated with that interest.</p>
<p>The involvement construct has been investigated in a variety of ways, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0047287512461181">Zaichowsky’s (1985)</xref> Personal Involvement Inventory (PII) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287512461181">Laurent and Kapferer’s (1985)</xref> Consumer Involvement Profiles (CIP). Several researchers use these scales in testing leisure and tourism involvement and conclude that they are useful tools for examining tourist participation and behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287512461181">Backman and Crompton 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287512461181">Clements and Josiam 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512461181">Dimanche, Havitz, and Howard 1991</xref>), for studying tourist profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287512461181">Gursoy and Gavcar 2003</xref>), for suggesting a modified involvement scale in tourism contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287512461181">Kyle and Chick 2004</xref>), and for testing relationships between motivation and enduring involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512461181">Kyle et al. 2006</xref>). The original CIP scale includes the following five dimensions of involvement:</p>
<list id="list2-0047287512461181" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Interest: centrality ego importance of the product class</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pleasure: hedonic and rewarding value of the product class</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sign: perceived symbolic value of the product class</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Risk importance: perceived importance of the negative consequences of a mispurchase</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Risk probability: subjective probability of making a mispurchase</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>When the involvement scale is adjusted to fit tourism settings, other items are included and subsequently new dimensions are suggested. Based on a literature review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287512461181">Kyle and Chick (2004)</xref> suggested five leisure involvement dimensions in such as “centrality,” “social bonding,” “identity affirmation,” and “identity affirmation” based on 15 items altogether.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0047287512461181">Park (1996)</xref> investigated the relationship between the fit of a participant’s attitudinal loyalty profiles and involvement profiles using CIP scales, and the results showed a strong relationship between attitudinal loyalty and involvement.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512461181">Jamrozy, Backman, and Backman (1996)</xref> explored the relationship between involvement, opinion leadership, and trip behavior for nature-based tourism. This study used both the PII and CIP scales to determine each involvement scale’s multidimensionality and applicability to travelers interested in nature-based tourism. The results revealed that highly involved nature-oriented travelers tend to be more receptive to information concerning the travel product or destination and that they spread that information willingly.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287512461181">Clements and Josiam (1995)</xref> examined the role of involvement in travel decision making. They tried to assess respondent levels of involvement in the spring break travel decision, to assess the ability of the involvement construct to predict the decision to travel, and to analyze involvement and destination selection. The research findings indicated that individuals with high levels of involvement are more likely to travel than those with low involvement, and that respondents with high levels of involvement are more likely to travel abroad. Moreover, involvement is a significant predictor of some aspects of the decision to travel.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287512461181">Chen and Tsai (2008)</xref> examined the interrelationship between perceived value, satisfaction, and loyalty to TV products considering the moderator effect of involvement. The results revealed that perceived value affects satisfaction and loyalty while satisfaction does not affect loyalty. The moderating effects of involvement significantly affect the perceived levels of value, satisfaction, and loyalty model. The higher the level of involvement, the larger the likelihood that perceived value will lead to greater customer loyalty.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287512461181">Lee and Beeler (2009)</xref> examined the antecedents of satisfaction and future intention. Their results revealed that motivation, service quality, and involvement are good predictors of satisfaction and future intention. They concluded that tourists who are highly involved in the programs or activities offered at a festival are more likely to be satisfied with their experience and express an intention to return in the future: that is, there is a positive relationship between the level of involvement and the level of satisfaction with the experience. Subsequently, based on these studies and on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512461181">Cronin, Brady, and Hult’s (2000)</xref> research that pinpoints the mediating factor of value perception in consumer behavior, the following hypothesis is put forward:</p>

<title>Study Population</title>
<p>Tourists visiting one of six different nature-based visitor attraction centers in Northern Norway were involved in the study. These tourists could be considered nature-based tourists, in that nature-related elements always score highest in surveys regarding tourist motivation for visiting Norway (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287512461181">Mehmetoglu 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512461181">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0047287512461181">Prebensen, Larsen, and Abelsen 2003</xref>). The six visitor attractions chosen for the present study are in three different counties of Northern Norway (Nordland, Troms, and Finnmark) and include both natural and cultural attraction elements. However, two of the visitor attractions, to a greater extent, focus on nature-based elements more than cultural elements; that is, one is a lift to the mountain where visitors can enjoy the scenery of the city and surrounding nature, and the other is an aquarium. The other four visitor attractions also have nature as their core idea but also include historical and cultural elements (i.e., a zoo with stories about Far North living, a visitor center including an aquarium, a movie, displays of Far North nature and culture, and a Viking museum with live actors and displays of history, culture, and nature from prehistoric days). All six visitor attractions charge entrance fees to visitors. These visitor attractions are developed and managed as both nonprofit and profit-based.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0047287512461181">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>A survey was selected as the data collection method, using structured questionnaires measuring tourist value perceptions of a destination, motivation and involvement elements, as well as demographic and geographic background variables. The data collection instrument was based on validated scales (provided in English in existing research) and translated into Norwegian and German. The questions (wording) were developed in Norwegian and tested on a group of 20 academics, and then translated into English and German. Professional translators were included in the process. The self-administrated intercept survey was conducted by a professional consultant company and well-trained research assistants. Subjects visiting one of the six visitor attractions at the different locations in Northern Norway, during a period of three months (from June to September) in 2011 were asked to answer the questionnaire. The data collectors were also advised that a minimum of 150 valid questionnaires from each visitor attraction would be randomly generated in order to populate the sample of each attraction. This was done to ensure a large enough sample so that subsequent and meaningful data analyses could be achieved while still maintaining the randomness of the sample generated in each attraction. The questionnaires were randomly handed out to potential respondents at the entrance and at cafes in visitor centers, and were immediately collected on completion. The collectors also provided a brief explanation of the importance of filling out all questions, if possible, to the respondents. Incentives such as candy and pens were given out at the data collection stands and the respondents had a chance of winning gifts (if they participated). A total of 1152 usable questionnaires were generated from the pool of 2000 distributed questionnaires, revealing a return rate of roughly 58%.</p>

<sec id="section9-0047287512461181">
<title>Measurement of Construct</title>
<p>The constructs examined in this study were mainly operationalized using scales found in the existing literature.</p>
<p>Perceived value was measured using scales developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0047287512461181">Williams and Soutar (2009)</xref>, who mainly mirrored the work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287512461181">Sweeney and Soutar (2001)</xref> and partially from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287512461181">Bello and Etzel (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287512461181">Weber (2001)</xref> with semantic scales of “to very little extent” (1) and “to a great extent” (7). Examples of items include “This attraction has consistency quality” and “This attraction is exciting.”</p>
<p>To measure tourist motivation, this study utilizes 14 push motivation items based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287512461181">Beard and Ragheb’s (1983)</xref> scale representing the four subscales: Intellectual, Social, Competence-Mastery, and Stimulus-Avoidance. The Beard and Ragheb scale is replicated and delineated as a valid research instrument in many tourism studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0047287512461181">Ryan and Glendon 1998</xref>) and therefore was used for the present study.</p>
<p>Involvement was measured by applying items adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287512461181">Laurent and Kapferer (1985)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512461181">Kyle et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287512461181">Kyle and Chick (2004)</xref>. The scales (overlapping because Kyle used Laurent and Kapferer’s scale as a foundation) were tested among 20 academics and 7 representatives from the tourism industry, revealing a focus on nine of the items among those with highest alpha scores in the scales. These items reflect four of the dimensions put forward in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512461181">Kyle et al. (2006)</xref> study: Centrality, Social Bonding, Identity Affirmation, and Identity Expression. They reflect three of Laurent and Kapferer’s dimensions as tested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287512461181">Gursoy and Gavcar (2003)</xref> study on leisure tourists: Pleasure/Interest (one item), Risk Probability (two items), and Risk Importance (two items).</p>
<p>Tourists were asked to indicate their level of agreement with statements related to their involvement, using assigned values ranging from 1 (to very little extent) to 7 (to a great extent).</p>

<title>Data Analysis and Results</title>
<p>Given the main purpose of this study, the structural equation model (SEM) procedure was an appropriate method for evaluating how well a proposed conceptual model that contains observed indicators and hypothetical constructs explains or fits the collected data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287512461181">Bollen 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0047287512461181">Yoon, Gursoy, and Chen 2001</xref>). The properties of the three research constructs, motivation, involvement, and experience value in the proposed model were tested with PRERIS 2.80 and LISREL 8.8 Student version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287512461181">Joreskog and Sorbom 2001</xref>). The maximum likelihood (ML) technique, which has been widely used in the research of SEM, was applied in this study as the assumption of multivariate normality of the study data was confirmed.</p>
<p>In this study, the collected data were quite large (<italic>n</italic> = 1152) and the normal distribution of observed variables was met based on the results of skewness and kurtosis. Missing values, outliers, and multivariate normality checking were examined to reduce systematic errors using SPSS 17.0 version. Multivariate normality, which is one of the requirements of the maximum likelihood (ML) technique, was tested and the results showed that relative multivariate kurtosis (1.156) was smaller than 2.0, which meant the distribution of all combinations of variables was normal. Outliers were examined using the DeCarlo Macro (SPSS 17.0 Version) since Decarlo’s SPSS works well for multivariate applications such as SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287512461181">DeCarlo 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512461181">Kleijnen, de Ruyter, and Wetzels 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0047287512461181">Xu, Li, and Weaver 2010</xref>). The results revealed no significant outliers.</p>
<sec id="section11-0047287512461181">
<title>Exploratory Factor Analysis</title>
<p>Three constructs (motivation, involvement, and perceived value of destination experience) were measured for a number of observed variables. An exploratory factor analysis was performed for each construct prior to the SEM analysis for purposes of reducing the number of variables. Using SPSS 17.0 version, three different exploratory factor analyses were conducted. Using Varimax rotation, the latent root criterion of 1.0 was used for factor inclusion and a factor loading of .45 was used as the benchmark for including items in a factor. The items included within a factor were then calculated to create a composite factor score. These composite factor scores were considered as observed indicators to measure the relevant constructs of the study.</p>
<p>Among 14 motivation indicators, five motivation indicators were cross-loaded on more than one factor. After deleting these indicators, the factor analysis of nine motivation items resulted in two groupings of motivation factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512461181">Table 1</xref>): Relaxation and Socialization. These two factor groupings explained 58% of the variance in motivation and all nine items had factor loadings greater than .50.</p>

<title>Measurement Model</title>
<p>Before investigating relationships between constructs in the hypothesized model, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test whether the collected data were consistent with a constrained hypothesized model or a priori specified model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512461181">Byrne 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287512461181">Hair et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The overall measurement model fit with the total of three constructs and seven observed indicators was tested by CFA. An initial estimation of the overall measurement model did not result in good model fit. The chi-square value was 174.48 with 11 degrees of freedom (<italic>p</italic> = .00) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; recommended value is .05) value was .11. Various different types of fit indices were used in this study to measure the fit of the tested model. These selected fit indices are absolute fit indices, incremental fit indices, and parsimonious fit indices. The absolute fit indices directly evaluate how well an a priori model fits the sample data. The incremental fit indices compare the target model with a baseline model to measure the proportionate improvement fit, and the parsimonious fit indices measure whether model fit has been achieved by overfitting the data with too many coefficients. Other fit indices indicated that the specified original model was not a good fit and needs to be specified and revised (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0047287512461181">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability can be used to measure internal consistency. The composite reliability of each measurement scale ranged from .66 to .86, demonstrating internal consistency for motivation, involvement, and experience value. Discriminant and convergent validity were also considered. The average variance extracted (AVE) of motivation and perceived value exceeded the minimum criterion of .5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287512461181">Fornell and Larcker 1981</xref>). However, the average variance extracted for the involvement construct was slightly below the .5 cutoff. The average variance was slightly below the cutoff; however, all three constructs in this research were considered acceptable.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine tourists’ experience value and attempt to extend the theoretical and empirical evidence about the causal relationships between motivation, involvement, and experience value. The effects of push motivation and involvement on perceived value are supported. Moreover, motivation positively affects involvement. That is, more motivated tourists are more involved in their trip experience while less motivated tourists are less involved.</p>
<p>Our results support the idea of including value perception as an intermediate variable in tourist experience models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512461181">Cronin, Brady, and Hult 2000</xref>); therefore, the results both support and build on the extant literature. The findings of the present paper indicate that both motivation and involvement are important antecedents of tourist value perceptions of destination value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512461181">Cronin, Brady, and Hult 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287512461181">Josiam, Kinley, and Kim 2004</xref>). The results provide empirical support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0047287512461181">Woodruff’s (1997)</xref> conceptualization of individual value perception. From a managerial viewpoint, this underscores the importance of perceived value as a strategic imperative and supports recent research on the construct. The study results also add to theory by disclosing that value perception of a destination as a theoretical construct is an important evaluative element for tourists. The findings further justify the efforts to acknowledge tourist motivation and involvement as means to improve the value perception of a destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287512461181">Gale 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Selected previous research shows that perceived value affects satisfaction and behavior intention. To provide high experience value, therefore, tourism marketers and developers should strive to increase perceived value by investigating tourist motivation and involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287512461181">Lee and Beeler 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512461181">Cronin, Brady, and Hult (2000)</xref> additionally show the importance of including value perception in order to acknowledge both direct and indirect effects on satisfaction and future intentional behavior, in addition to the importance of motivation. Hence, the present work supports these findings by exploring the importance of tourists’ perceived value of destination, and the effects its antecedents, that is, motivation and involvement, have on value perception.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0047287512461181">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>As the present work reveals the importance of motivation and involvement as antecedents of tourist destination value perceptions, other value-adding elements, that is, on-tour, should be further studied, such as the degree of participation in creating experience value, other tourists, servicescapes, and the surroundings. To understand the value perception construct better, it would be of interest to compare the value perception of products, services, and experiences with the overall value perception of a destination.</p>
<p>Research should explore the cost and benefit construct further, for example, what is perceived as a cost versus a benefit for the tourists or the recreationist compared to other services, such as a person buying cleaning services, medical help, or even student learning programs. The idea of considering the time and the effort tourists spend on planning, undertaking, and recalling vacations as a cost is problematic, in that most tourists perceive these activities as attractive and enjoyable. Although the current study has not expanded the model to test the role of different product offerings between attractions either as a moderating variable or control variable because of the small sample size of each attraction, future research should use appropriate samples to explore variations in experience values that may emerge as a function of the unique features of different products or attractions. We hope that this study will further encourage researchers to examine the degree to which the determinants of value creation in the tourism experience can be enriched by bringing in moderating variables such as different attraction settings, seasonality, and nationality and also linking experience values to more nonconventional consequences of tourist experience such as quality-of-of life constructs—the sense of well-being or happiness that may be induced by tourism activities in different settings.</p>
