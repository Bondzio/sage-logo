It proposes that four concrete forms of glocalization can be observed: vernacularization, indigenization, nationalization and transnationalization. Each of these offers different combinations of universal religiosity and local particularism. The salience of this interpretation is demonstrated through a cursory analysis of the historical record of Christianity’s fragmentation. It is argued that the very construction of distinct religious traditions (Eastern Orthodox Christianity and Roman Catholicism) is an expression of this broader process. Finally, the historical record of Eastern Orthodox Christianity is examined in order to provide for additional historical instances of these forms of glocalization.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>culture</kwd><kwd>globalization</kwd><kwd>glocalization</kwd><kwd>Eastern Orthodox Christianity</kwd><kwd>nationalism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The relationship between religion and globalization has been the subject of a voluminous scholarship that has explored a wide array of its facets (for recent examples, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368431012459694">Beckford, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368431012459694">Beyer and Beaman, 2007</xref>; for a compilation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368431012459694">Altglas, 2010</xref>). This article argues that multiple glocalizations offer a novel means for interpreting the varied historical entanglements between local cultures and world religions within the context of world-historical globalization. The article’s opening section offers a conceptual exposé of four glocalizations (vernacularization, indigenization, nationalization and transnationalization). In the second section, this framework is applied to Christianity’s historical record, whereby the construction of its main branches of Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism is explained in terms of glocalization. In the next section, Eastern Orthodox Christianity’s record is further used for the purposes of illustrating the various glocalizations that have permeated this particular religious tradition. The result is a perspective distinct from the conventional narrative of Western-inspired modernization, setting forth a conceptual framework that is portable and applicable to other cases and religious traditions.</p><p>By way of introducing the article’s problematic, it is necessary to acknowledge that sociology of religion at large relies heavily on theoretical paradigms derived from and applied to a small and selective group of Western nations, while ignoring non-Western regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1368431012459694">Riesebrodt and Konieczny, 2010</xref>: 159–60). This parochialism is connected to the prevalence of secularization as the field’s central theoretical focus. The secularization paradigm is in turn derived from the broader modernization paradigm that has been the target of numerous criticisms over the past 40 years. One of its major shortcomings is its extensive reliance upon the image of the ‘isolated individual’ and its use of culture as a residual category invoked only as a defence against secularism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368431012459694">Martin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368431012459694">Bruce, 2011</xref>). Such a perspective fails to incorporate the cultural dimension of religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368431012459694">Besecke, 2005</xref>) and offers instead a theoretical model that naturalizes Western cultural specificity. When considering Orthodox Christianity, this model’s limits become apparent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1368431012459694">McMylon and Vorozhishcheva, 2007</xref>). For example, in the classification system generally in use in North America and Western Europe, Christianity is divided into Western (Protestant and Roman Catholic) and Eastern (Oriental and Orthodox). This classification is but a retrospective interpretation that does not correspond to the chronological succession of the splits experienced within Christianity; but groups together different families of churches (the so-called Eastern churches) that experienced a split long before the division between Orthodox and Catholics. It furthermore constructs a ‘Western’ Christianity as an <italic>a priori</italic> – instead of allowing for its emergence in historical time. Against such essentializing views of cultural traditions, sociological theorizing should take to heart MacCulloch’s (2009: 7) insightful observation that ‘the Bible … embodies not a tradition, but many traditions’ and that these are intimately interwoven to the fabric of cultures and identities.</p><sec id="section1-1368431012459694"><title>Globalization in history: four glocalizations</title><p>A relatively understudied dimension of the relationship between religion and globalization pertains to the <italic>historical </italic>intertwining between the two (for exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368431012459694">Beyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1368431012459694">Warburg, 2006</xref>). The historical dimension contains important challenges to conventional perspectives. Instead of interpretations that view globalization as a historically recent phenomenon, a long-term view of globalization necessarily entails de-centring the conventional narrative of Western modernization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1368431012459694">O’Brien, 2006</xref>). Such a perspective involves the notion that pre-modern globalization was both important and consequential for humanity (see, for examples, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368431012459694">Hobson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1368431012459694">Hopkins, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1368431012459694">Robertson, 2003</xref>). This more historically sensitive orientation encompasses the pre-modern eras of globalization, which involved the construction and proliferation of world religions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368431012459694">Eisenstadt, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1368431012459694">Kurtz, 1996</xref>).</p><p>If it is globalization, and not modernization, that provides the overall conceptual framework, there is no single monolithic master narrative of modernization and secularization that is universally applicable. In contrast to conventional narratives that are based on the theorization of the Western experience alone (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368431012459694">Bruce, 2011</xref>), a global-historical perspective enables the inclusion of different historical cases without framing their historical trajectories in terms of convergence or divergence from Western modernity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368431012459694">1</xref> </sup>Thus, from such a perspective the ‘rise of the West’ and the emergence of Western modernity itself occur <italic>within</italic> a far more encompassing world-historical globalization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1368431012459694">2</xref></sup> In this sense, the use of globalization offers the possibility of transcending the conventional Western self-image implicit in conventional narratives of modernity.</p><p>This use of globalization offers the opportunity to address the vexing issue of naturalizing the Western self-image by developing an approach sensitive to cultural specificity. This issue is directly linked to the theoretical turn from the global to the glocal. Since the late 1980s and early 1990s, the concept of glocalization has been used in several and diverse fields (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368431012459694">Guilanotti and Robertson, 2012</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1368431012459694">Roudometof, 2003</xref>). Instead of destroying local life-worlds and traditional local structures and settings, globalization is interacting with them and hence the entire process is more accurately referred to as ‘glocalization’. This interplay between the global and the local has been expressed through the dialectic of de-territorialization and re-territorialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1368431012459694">Scholte, 2000</xref>). That is, old forms of territorial attachments are decoupled and new forms of such attachments are forged. This dialectic is prominently displayed both in trends toward greater ecumenical orientation as well as in transnational religion, and reshapes the world’s religious geography through increased cross-cultural contact. The worldwide spread of various religions involves their simultaneous localization: they are reconstituted in new locales and reconstruct communal attachments in new forms. This might lead both toward forging global forms of religiosity or an ecumenical orientation that decouples particularistic attachments in favour of a global religious community or to the construction of new branches of a religion or religious varieties. The above are <italic>not</italic> an exclusively contemporary phenomenon. The creation of distinct branches of Christianity – such as Orthodox and Catholic Christianity – bears the mark of this particularization of religious universalism. The interactions between different civilizational or cultural constellations or political–military empires offer the opportunity to account for the articulation of cultural difference vis-à-vis others.</p><p>As religions are thus reconfigured, new formations emerge in historical time. These new formations are <italic>cultural hybrids</italic> that blend religious universalism with several forms of local (national or ethnic) particularisms. Through these processes, the conventional association of religion with a specific geographical region – a prominent feature in revivals of civilization analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368431012459694">Huntington, 1996</xref>) or in multiple modernities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368431012459694">Eisenstadt, 2002</xref>) – is destabilized. Arguing along these lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368431012459694">Beyer (2007</xref>) suggests that globalization involves <italic>multiple glocalizations</italic>: universal religion is thematized alongside local particularity. These multiple glocalizations should not be seen as mechanically connected to specific historical eras or periods but, rather, as occurring <italic>both</italic> across historical eras and, synchronically, subject to the specific cultural and political conditions of a given milieu. Although not claiming to offer an exhaustive account, the four glocalizations presented here are historically concrete examples that involve a fusion between religious universalism and local particularism. These glocalizations are <italic>vernacularization</italic>,<italic> indigenization</italic>,<italic> nationalization</italic> and <italic>transnationalization</italic>. Although further research can expand this list, these processes are viewed as specific forms of the broader notion of glocalization. Each represents a specific form of blending universal religion along particular human configurations (e.g., empire, ethnicity, nation-state and transnational migration). But they are not distinct simply because of their historical specificity; they are distinct because each of them offers a discrete analytical ordering or combination of the global and the local. In other words, each of them offers a different means for negotiating and ordering the global/local blend into cultural stable and concrete formats.</p><p><italic>Vernacularization</italic> blends religious universalism with specific vernacular languages – which are endowed with the privileged ability of offering communication with the sacred. This glocalization is certainly far more common in pre-modern or pre-literate cultures, whereby access to sacred texts was limited and religious efficacy could be tied to specific language. Perhaps the most prominent example of such vernacularization comes from Islam, whereby Arabic serves as the religion’s sacred language – even in cultural contexts outside the Arab world. Vernacularization is not identical to and should not be confused with <italic>indigenization</italic>, the key difference being that access to a sacred language is an issue quite distinct from membership in a tribe or ethnicity. Indigenization blends religious universalism with local particularism by adopting religious ritual, expression and hierarchies into the specifics of a particular ethnicity. Most often, the sense of distinction thus constructed blends religious and ethnic difference. Although pre-modern kingdoms and principalities made regular use of this process in order to bolster their rulers’ legitimacy, the ties constructed often endured far beyond the specific regimes or states. However, it would be a mistake to view indigenization as simply the result of local rulers who use religion instrumentally: In some instances, such indigenization has persisted for centuries in the absence of political authority. Furthermore, in the contemporary sociology of religion, prominent examples of indigenization come from Brazil and the Caribbean, places in which African traditional forms of religiosity have blended with Christianity. In such forms of religiosity, group membership is far more closed than in vernacularization; if vernacularization has been associated with empires, indigenization has been associated with ethnic and cultural reproduction and survival.</p><p><italic>Nationalization </italic>is another form of blending universal religion and local, national particularism. Its principal difference from the previous forms is that the nation serves as the foundation for the religious institutions’ claim to legitimacy. Nationalization operates through the use of religion as a potential source for nation formation or the intertwining between confessional membership and modern national identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368431012459694">Brubaker, 2012</xref>). The Church of England is perhaps emblematic of such a relationship, and but it is not an isolated example (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368431012459694">Gorski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368431012459694">Hastings, 1997</xref>). Although societies can become more secular, the semiotic significance of religion and its importance for public expression remain central to national life. Even within Western Europe, confessionalization involved the establishment of a formal relationship between specific confessions and territorial rulers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1368431012459694">MacCulloch, 2009</xref>: 639). As a result, people might belong to a national church without necessarily being religious adherents – religion’s significance might be semiotic. That often is the source of considerable difficulty for social researchers who cannot use indicators of religious participation as valid measurements for the importance of religion.</p><p>The difference between indigenization and nationalization rests in part on the civic nature of the nation, whereby the people are active citizens conferring legitimacy on political authority and are not mere subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368431012459694">Bendix, 1978</xref>). While this might be evident for nations with a prominent civic dimension, the situation is far more complex for nations that coalesce around culturally defined or ethnic membership. In such cases – ranging from Poland to Greece – religion is used as a marker signifying national membership. To the extent that nations are viewed as identical to ethnic groups, the distinction between indigenization and nationalization is erased. For followers of modernist interpretations of nationalism, the difference between vernacularization and nationalization is self-evident. But even ethno-symbolist interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1368431012459694">Smith, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1368431012459694">2001</xref>) accept the existence of a conceptual distinction between <italic>ethnie</italic> (ethnic communities) and modern nations. Only primordialists could therefore argue against the salience of the conceptual distinction between indigenization and nationalization.</p><p><italic>Transnationalization </italic>is the other face of nationalization: The global construction of nation-states and the nationalization of their citizens have necessarily created a ‘residual’ category of ‘transnationals’ (i.e., all those currently residing within a host state but who are not viewed as belonging to the host nation). In the United States, for example, religion has been absorbed in the nation’s fabric to such an extent that since the 1870s it has been – and still is – invoked in the ‘WASP’ (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) category. In such a classification, religious nationalization is naturalized and, hence, left understudied. In contrast, the religion of immigrants is, to this day a widely researched topic in North American scholarship. International migration has thus offered the scholarly context in which it became possible to theorize the relationship between people and religion in a transnational context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431012459694">Casanova, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368431012459694">Ebaugh and Chafetz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1368431012459694">Levitt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1368431012459694">van der Veer, 2002</xref>).</p><p>At the same time, the notion of transnationalism has been extended beyond the sheer movement of peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368431012459694">Kennedy and Roudometof, 2002</xref>). It is possible to speak of institutional transnationalism – such as, for example, the case of the post-1990 Russian Orthodox Church, which claims ecclesiastical jurisdiction in territories outside the borders of the Russian Federation (Estonia, Moldova and Ukraine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368431012459694">Cava, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431012459694">Curanovic, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368431012459694">Fajfer and Rimestad, 2010</xref>). Such instances of trans-border claims are often connected to long-distance or transnational nationalism – and clearly these do not involve population movements.</p><p>To the extent that the very label of transnational religion is a means of describing solutions to newfound situations that people face as a result of migration, it comes as two quite distinct blends of religious universalism and local particularism. First, it is possible for religious universalism to gain the upper hand, whereby religion becomes the central reference for immigrant communities. In such instances, religious transnationalism is often depicted as a religion ‘going global’. In cases in which immigrants share the same vernacular or are members of a church with a centralized administration (such as the Catholic Church), the propensity for such a pattern inevitably increases. Migrants participate in religious multi-ethnic networks that connect them to their co-religionists locally and globally. Their main allegiance is not to their original homeland but to their global religious community; religion in this sense offers a means for ‘transnational transcendence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431012459694">Csordas, 2009</xref>) of identities and boundaries. Second, it is possible for local ethnic or national particularism to gain or maintain the most important place for local immigrant communities. In such instances, transnational national communities are constructed and religious hierarchies perform dual religious and secular functions that ensure the groups’ survival.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1368431012459694"><title>The glocalizations of Christianity</title><p>In order to offer a historical application of this model of multiple glocalizations, this section uses the case of Christianity – while the next section uses the case of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. This does not mean that other religions do not offer suitable examples for this model. But, ever since Durkheim’s writings, Christianity has provided a paradigmatic case for the articulation of conventional modernization perspectives. The conceptual insights gained by the application of the multiple glocalizations model in history are made quite visible when the same historical case is used.</p><p>The spread of Christianity across Eurasia resulted in its vernacularization and indigenization. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1368431012459694">Therborn (2000</xref>) argues, a major pre-modern wave of globalization operated historically through the formation and diffusion of world religions and the establishment of transcontinental civilizations. Between the fourth and the seventh centuries <sc>ad</sc>, Christianity became the Roman Empire’s official and dominant religion – famously so during the reign of Constantine I the Great (306–337 <sc>ad</sc>), who also founded Constantinople as the new seat of the Roman Empire. When the Council of Chalcedon (451 <sc>ad</sc>) introduced the formula of Christ having two natures united yet completely distinct, the result was a major split between Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian forms of Christianity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1368431012459694">3</xref></sup> The Chalcedonian churches started using the term ‘Orthodox’ (literally meaning the correct doctrine) to designate themselves. For both Catholics and Orthodox Christians, their Declaration of the Faith states that they believe in a single ‘Orthodox’ (i.e., correct) and ‘Catholic’ (that is, universal) Church.</p><p>Instead of speaking of a ‘Western’ and ‘Eastern’ Christianity (as the Western-centred modernization paradigm does), initially, there was a <italic>single</italic> Chalcedonian Christianity that included Christians in both parts of the Mediterranean basin (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368431012459694">Clendenin, 2002</xref>: 34–7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1368431012459694">McGuckin, 2008</xref>: 18–20), which at that time was still largely united under the auspices of the Roman Empire. In due course, Chalcedonian Christianity was fragmented into the branches or traditions that are conventionally designated as Orthodox Christianity and Roman Catholicism. Vernacularization offers the theoretical means to interpret the fragmentation of Chalcedonian Christianity and the formation of distinct Orthodox and Catholic religious traditions. Chalcedonian Christianity’s vernacularization involved the rise of high-culture languages with their own script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1368431012459694">Therborn, 2000</xref>: 160). Even before the rise of Christianity, Greek and Latin were high-culture languages in the eastern and western parts of the Mediterranean. After the spread of Christianity, their status as high-culture script languages further amplified cultural differences that became encoded in religious categories. The use of the two main vernacular high culture languages of the era – Greek and Latin – is responsible for the construction of the religious traditions that have become embedded in the terms ‘Greek East’ and ‘Latin West’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1368431012459694">Sherrard, 1992</xref>). From these terms, in due course of time, emerged the branches or traditions conventionally designated as Orthodox Christianity and Roman Catholicism. Their crystallization was instrumental for the notions of ‘East’ and ‘West’ within Europe – and the legacy of this historical division remains important to this very day.</p><p>The formation of Chalcedonian Christianity’s distinct branches (Roman Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity) was a protracted process that lasted roughly from the eighth century until the fifteenth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1368431012459694">4</xref></sup> Although a comprehensive comparative-historical analysis of these branches cannot be undertaken here, parallel developments – such as, for example, the rise of monasticism and the growing ability of the religious hierarchy to withstand political interference – are readily observable in both parts of the Mediterranean after the turn of the first millennium. This was an era marked by the slow consolidation of notions of ecclesiastical hierarchies, constructions of dogmas and theologies, and the formation of religious orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368431012459694">Asad, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1368431012459694">Morris, [1989] 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1368431012459694">MacCulloch, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Vernacularization exacerbated divergences between the Greek East and the Latin West. These include: the difference in the number and status of ecclesiastical hierarchs (patriarchs and the pope), the role of Latin and Greek in serving as languages of communication, the contrast between the two regions’ cultural milieu and the role of imperial authority in determining the range and potency of ecclesiastical authorities – or the relationship between <italic>sacerdotium</italic> and <italic>imperium</italic>. When, in the fourth century, Christianity became the Roman Empire’s official religion, complementarity (or <italic>symphonia</italic>) provided the basic principle of governing the relationship between church and state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1368431012459694">5</xref></sup> The ecclesiastical establishment assisted the emperor in the execution of his duties. The high clergy provided spiritual leadership and exercised moral control upon state authority, while the emperor was expected to play a role in protecting, expanding and serving Christianity. This complementary relationship did not imply confusion between the different realms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1368431012459694">6</xref></sup> The emperors were the guardians of the faith, and consequently they were empowered to intervene in religious affairs.</p><p>This original <italic>symphonia</italic> between the Roman emperor and Christianity’s high clergy involved a conception of ecclesiastical governance by the so-called <italic>pentarchy</italic> – the participation of the five ancient patriarchates of Rome, Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem and Constantinople. To be acceptable, ecumenical church councils required the participation of these patriarchs or their representatives. From the imperial point of view, which subsequently became also the Orthodox viewpoint, the bishop of Rome was <italic>primus inter pares</italic> (first among equals). In effect, between the sixth and eleventh centuries, eastern Roman imperial authority contributed extensively to the prestige of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1368431012459694">Meyendorff, [1982] 1990</xref>: 25), which, while second in rank, was Rome’s chief rival. In contrast, the Papacy considered its status as deriving from St Peter, the first among the apostles and first bishop of Rome, whereby the pope, as St Peter’s successor, held a position above other bishops, who in turn should yield to his authority.</p><p>These historically specific differences contributed to the articulation of differences in ecclesiology that eventually became entrenched. In the western Mediterranean, the rise of the Carolingian dynasty contributed to a reinterpretation of religious doctrine (in the form of the <italic>Filoque</italic> and the powerful forgery of the Donation of Constantine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368431012459694">Herrin, 1987</xref>: 105). In the eastern Mediterranean, the conclusion of the Iconoclast controversy (726–843) brought about an incipient sense of religious divergence, of <italic>Christian Orthodoxy</italic> in the East as distinct from the Christian tradition of the West. This sense was originally codified in the <italic>Synodikon of Orthodoxy</italic> (843), the religious document produced to codify the correct faith at the final conclusion of the Iconoclast controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1368431012459694">Louth, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The aforementioned developments signified the emergence of two distinct traditions in the respective parts of the Mediterranean. It is important to stress the degree to which the Eastern Roman Empire, at least until 1204, was not an ethnically defined state. Its Hellenistic cultural heritage and Orthodox faith were features universally accessible to all those who entered into its cultural universe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368431012459694">Geanakopoulos, [1979] 1993)</xref>. It is in this sense that the difference between vernacularization and indigenization emerges as crucial and consequential. Vernacularization made it possible to incorporate intruders and barbarian tribes – just as it made it possible to carry out ‘civilizing missions’ in terms of conversions to Christianity. Indigenization as a process has a strong elective affinity with Orthodox Christianity. In contrast to Roman Catholicism, there are specific features of Orthodoxy (such as decentralized administration) that made it far more susceptible to indigenization. Moreover, in Western Europe, Latin remained the Church’s liturgical language; whereas, in the Eastern Mediterranean, Greek was an imperial language but its status was never that of a sacred language. The use of Aramaic in Syria and Old Georgian in Georgia demonstrate this lack of sacred status per se.</p><p>As a result, Orthodoxy has been far more susceptible to <italic>indigenization</italic>, that is, the absorption of the faith into local ethnic identities. Medieval Georgia, Bulgaria, Russia and Serbia offer examples of such indigenization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368431012459694">Gonis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368431012459694">Gvosdev, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1368431012459694">van den Bercken, 1999</xref>). The construction of the Cyrillic alphabet and the use of Old Slavonic for liturgy illustrate this flexibility of Orthodoxy. But the indigenization of Orthodoxy was not predicated solely on the creation of a distinct liturgical language. It was further strengthened by the initial processes of granting autonomy or autocephaly to various archbishoprics related to or offered in direct negotiation with Bulgarian, Serb, or Russian rulers. The foundation of these seats offered local rulers a sacred element to their authority and strengthened acceptance and legitimacy of their rule. Sacred authority and public authority were used concurrently as elements that would therefore foster a sense of identity and cohesion among the population. In this sense, Orthodoxy contributed heavily to the construction and reproduction of ethnicity among Russians, Ukrainians and the southern Slavs.</p><p>At the turn of the first millennium, the Eastern religious tradition remained closely intertwined with the Eastern Roman Empire, which still operated under the guise of Christian universalism, whereas the Western tradition was affiliated with the emerging Western European ‘Christendom’. The Crusades provided the major historical episode that brought about open conflict between the two sides. It culminated in the 1204 fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade, the conquest of the Eastern Roman Empire and its replacement by a short-lived Latin Empire (1204–1261) (for a lucid analysis, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368431012459694">Angold, 2003</xref>). However, the West’s military victory set in place a series of further historical developments that contributed to the emergence of Orthodox Christianity as such.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1368431012459694"><title>The glocalizations of Orthodox Christianity</title><p>In this section, attention is focused more on the consolidation of Eastern Orthodox Christianity and its post-1204 glocalizations. The success of the Fourth Crusade fostered the abandonment of the former unity between religion and empire and the willingness of the Orthodox establishment to move beyond the imperial ideal. The notion of sister churches related to different rulers or states strengthened the sense of ‘unity in plurality’ that henceforth became a foundational principle of Orthodox Christianity. Its application further pushed it away from the Catholic understanding of a single ecclesiastical hierarchy.</p><p>After 1204, three major factors shaped the crystallization of Orthodox Christianity. First, the ecclesiastical leadership established a network of contacts and relationships throughout the Orthodox eastern part of Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1368431012459694">Hussey, [1986] 1990</xref>: 286–90). These entailed the reorganization of bishoprics to fit new circumstances, answering inquiries from external potentates and churchmen, adjudicating disputes and efforts at setting the law in ecclesiastical affairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1368431012459694">Shepard, 2006</xref>: 22). The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople became deeply engaged with politics and ecclesiastical arrangements in Serbia, Bulgaria, Russia, Lithuania, Wallachia and Poland, while it further mediated in disputes over bishoprics in Lithuania and Moscow. Second, after 1204, there was a further articulation of Orthodox Christianity’s doctrinal divergences vis-à-vis Roman Catholicism, famously codified within the context of the fourteenth-century Hesychasm controversy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1368431012459694">7</xref></sup> These divergences involved the articulation of the Orthodox notion of <italic>theosis</italic> or deification as a legitimate strategy to obtain union with God. In its endorsement of mystical contemplation as a viable route to salvation, Orthodox Christianity increased its mystical tenets at the expense of its more rational elements.</p><p>Third, there were further liturgical and spatial developments in Orthodox liturgy and church organization that clearly distinguished Orthodoxy’s format and ritual from that of Catholicism. Monasticism was instrumental in the adoption of the hymnody in church services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1368431012459694">Sevcenko, 2006</xref>: 146–52) and in the spatial organization of the Orthodox churches. Already in the eleventh century, the usual temple screen was closed at floor level but still open above. Although originally ‘a low and fairly open parapet, by the 13th century [the temple] had become taller, consisting of colonnettes carrying an epistyle. Parapet slabs occupied the lower inter-columnar parts and curtains, and eventually icons in its upper parts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1368431012459694">Marinis, 2010</xref>: 293). By the thirteenth century, the initially monastic custom of a temple separating the <italic>naos</italic> or main part of the church from the sanctuary was gradually extended to all churches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368431012459694">Gerstel and Talbot, 2006</xref>: 85). The temple indicated the limits of the sanctuary. This practice served a dual function: It marked a sacred space inaccessible to anyone but the clergy, and because it obstructed the congregation’s visual contact with the sanctuary, it elevated the Eucharist’s sense of mystery and sanctity. By the fourteenth century, the closed temple was decorated with holy icons. Therein lies the birth of the icon screen (<italic>iconostasion</italic>) – a temple of icons from floor to top – that from that time forward has become the standard decorum of Orthodox churches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1368431012459694">Sevcenko, 2006</xref>: 133). The <italic>iconostasion</italic> offered a symbolic representation of the divine order and tangibly expressed the era’s pervasive symbolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1368431012459694">Taft, 2006</xref>). It spatially distinguished the Orthodox churches from Roman Catholic ones and stressed the centrality of icons in worship.</p><p>These factors contributed to the crystallization of Orthodox Christianity – that is, the faith assumed its fundamental features, readily recognizable to this day. As a distinct religious tradition, then, Orthodox Christianity was itself produced or resulted through the coalescence of (a) different long-term glocalizations of Christianity in the Western or Latin and the Eastern or Greek parts of the Mediterranean; and (b) the violent confrontation between Western European ‘Christendom’ and the Eastern Roman Empire. Between the thirteenth and the sixteenth centuries, Orthodox ecclesiastical leadership steadily pursued the standardization of religious format across the Orthodox Commonwealth of the eastern part of Europe. During these centuries, the Orthodox lands came under the control of the Russian and the Ottoman Empires. Within them, Orthodox institutions developed their own modes of adaptation to divinely ordained monarchies. In both cases, there is a notable absence of the complementarity that used to be central feature of church–state relations in earlier centuries. In its subsequent adaptations, Orthodox Christianity was deeply shaped by indigenization and vernacularization.</p><p>In the Ottoman Empire, vernacularization contributed heavily to the organization of the Orthodox Christians’ confessional community (<italic>Rum millet</italic>). This vernacularization was predicated upon the unity of Greek letters and Hellenic legacy with the Orthodox faith – but while this synthesis previously operated under a Christian empire, it had to operate now under Muslim rule. It might seem paradoxical that vernacularization operated under <italic>both</italic> Christian and Muslim rulers. However, both the legitimizing mythologies of the Eastern Roman and the Ottoman Empires involved authority sacralization: The Eastern Romans were under God’s protection; Ottoman rule was justified as punishment for their sins. Moreover, the Ottoman regime’s geopolitical interests coincided with the anti-Catholic agenda of the Orthodox Church’s hierarchy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368431012459694">Clogg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1368431012459694">Kitromilides, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1368431012459694">Livanios, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1368431012459694">Roudometof, 1998</xref>). The consolidation of this confessional community under Muslim rule was also gradual, slow and at times contested. Its institutionalization decreased the significance of ethnic differences among Orthodox Christians (Serbs, Greeks, Bulgarians, and so on) in favour of religious categories of classification.</p><p>In contrast to the Ottoman Empire’s vernacularization, the historical experience of the grand duchy of Moscow offers the most spectacular instance of post-1204 indigenization. In fact, these regional historical trajectories demonstrate the <italic>simultaneous</italic> pursuit of two different glocalizations around the same historical era. Thus, they demonstrate the analytical salience of the proposed distinction and offer evidence against viewing different glocalizations as inexorably connected to specific historical eras. In the aftermath of the 1438–1439 aborted union with Rome and the 1453 (second) fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans, Moscow’s ascent and the consolidation of the Russian Empire were closely intertwined with the sense of Russia as the sole inheritor of the true and correct faith. Indigenization was thus officially sanctioned. It also furthered the Russian rulers’ notion of sacred imperial monarchy. Although the amicable relationship between the patriarch and the tsar echoed the pattern established in the Eastern Roman Empire, it is clearly a mistake to interpret this relationship as merely duplicating the original <italic>symphonia</italic> between the Roman emperor and the religious order. The Russian tsars eventually were able to curtail the Church’s independent sphere of action and authority, paving the way for the 1721 abolition of the Patriarchate. Russians’ view of Moscow as the last depository of Christianity added legitimacy to various popular indigenized forms of Orthodoxy. With the Russian Orthodox Church unable to effectively police its own parishioners, a variety of local practices emerged. When in the seventeenth century imperial authority prompted the forced standardization of rituals and liturgical books according to contemporary Orthodox standards (as these existed in the rest of the Orthodox East), it caused Russian Orthodoxy’s major historical schism and the subsequent formation of the Old Believers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1368431012459694">8</xref></sup> This forced realignment served the Russian tsars’ role as guardians of all Orthodox Christians and contributed to the absorption of Ukraine into the Russian Empire. But it weakened the Russian Orthodox Church’s acceptance among its own parishioners.</p><p>Increasingly, from the seventeenth century onward, modernization and the impact of Western modernity became paramount in shaping the fate of these two empires. The Russian Empire’s modernization ‘from above’ extensively influenced the Russian Orthodox Church through its subjugation under direct state control. In the Ottoman Empire, the Church hierarchy and several intellectuals (including clergymen) were sympathetic to Western European intellectual currents. The Church’s official attitude shifted greatly in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Ultimately, though, the most influential Orthodox response to modernity was the eighteenth-century monastic revival that originated in Mt. Athos but subsequently succeeded in obtaining a transnational following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1368431012459694">Kitromilides, 2007</xref>: 363–4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1368431012459694">Pospielovski, 1998</xref>: 128–30). From the nineteenth century onward, the impact of modernity was acutely felt in the Orthodox lands. The introduction of the doctrine of modern nationalism as the world’s main legitimizing force altered the social bases of societies around the globe, and the Orthodox part of Europe was extensively affected. The adoption of the nation-state form is one of the major aspects of the diffusion of world culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368431012459694">Boli and Lechner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1368431012459694">Meyer et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>In the case of Orthodox Christianity, nation-state formation inaugurated a third glocalization: the <italic>nationalization</italic> of Orthodoxy. Although indigenization connected a faith to a specific ethnicity and it contributed to maintaining and reproducing ethno-national bonds, it did not involve the Church having to <italic>relate</italic> to a nation; a nation involves politically active citizens who remain the ultimate source of authority. This form of democratic legitimacy was not present before the 1776 American and 1789 French Revolutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368431012459694">Bendix, 1978</xref>). The adoption of the nation-state form in the Orthodox part of Europe was temporally uneven. Although the Orthodox nation-states of South-eastern Europe adopted this model in the course of the nineteenth century, the Russian Empire never successfully adopted it. The Soviet Union, which superseded the Russian Empire, remained formally opposed to modern nationalism. The exceptions involved brief intervals during World War II and the tactical use of territorial sovereignty in peripheral states (Ukraine, the Baltic states, etc.), which was employed as a means of strengthening communist control. Thus, one has to conclude that Orthodoxy’s engagement with modern nationalism has a longer history in South-eastern Europe than in the former Soviet Union.</p><p>In the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the religious markers of earlier centuries were reconfigured in order to relate to each local nation (Bulgarians, Greeks, Serbs and Romanians) (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368431012459694">Kitromilides, 2006</xref>). Out of this geographical re-territorialization and the concomitant relativization of religious identity came the modern synthesis between Church and nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1368431012459694">Roudometof, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1368431012459694">2010a</xref>). This modern synthesis entailed a fusion between local national traditions (‘invented’ or not) and a formerly universalistic religion, global in its scope and reach and, in principle, indifferent to a person’s national or ethnic identity. This model’s ascent was made possible through the strategic use of the principle of canonical territory, whereby each state authority was henceforth entitled to claim an autocephalous ecclesiastical institution. But the quest for autocephaly always has been a means to an end in the modern world of nation-states. In the Orthodox nation-states of South-eastern Europe, the nationalization of Orthodoxy involved both a cultural transformation (expressed through the logic of a Church–nation link) as well as a structural transformation (expressed in the construction of autocephalous churches). It is important to stress that the cultural transformation has been of critical importance, whereas the structural transformation was limited only in the cases of new state structures. In Cyprus, for example, the Orthodox Church’s nationalization did not entail the construction of new administrative structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1368431012459694">Roudometof, 2010b</xref>).</p><p>In both contexts, the Orthodox Church’s nationalization caused these institutions to relate to the nation by adopting elements of past indigenization for the purposes of modern nation formation. This nationalization is very much a recent historical event and, in many cases, it is still an ongoing affair – after all, nation formation processes in the Orthodox part of Europe are, historically speaking, relatively recent. Although, in 1872, a Pan-Orthodox Synod officially condemned the doctrine of ethnic nationalism as antithetical to Christian universalism, the Church’s ability to develop theologically sanctioned and popularly accepted interpretations that would transcend national fragmentation has remained limited. As a result, Orthodoxy’s national role is prominent today in its historical heartlands, where a symbiotic relationship has developed between the faith and the nation. But this is not an Orthodox peculiarity, given that this symbiotic relationship is present throughout European countries with large Christian populations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1368431012459694">Kunovich, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Orthodoxy’s modern synthesis might have originated in South-eastern Europe, but its logic has provided a portable cultural model that has expanded concomitantly with the successful implementation of the nation-state model in Eastern Europe. This model therefore offers a means for decoding and interpreting the former Soviet Union’s post-1991 ecclesiastical politics and, specifically, the relations of the Moscow Patriarchate with Moldova, Estonia and, most importantly, Ukraine. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the <italic>modus operandi</italic> of the Orthodox national churches – already implemented since the nineteenth century in South-eastern Europe – has been transferred to the ecclesiastical politics of the post-Soviet states, especially in connection with the overnight construction of a (putative) ‘transnational’ Russian Orthodoxy and subsequent ecclesiastical disputes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1368431012459694">9</xref></sup> The post-Soviet Russian Orthodox Church is using the Church–nation link in order to accomplish a re-sacralization of its authority. The extent to which this will be a successful strategy is contingent on post-1991 Russia’s successful nationalization of Orthodoxy. In contrast, national authorities in Ukraine, Moldova and the Baltic states have sought the establishment, reconstruction and recognition of separate national Orthodox churches as a means of showcasing these nations’ formal and effective independence from Moscow (and the Russian sphere of influence). In several instances, these national Churches were originally established before 1945, concomitantly with the original establishment of independent nation-states but their operation was suspended once their respective countries were incorporated into the USSR (for discussions of individual cases, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1368431012459694">Leustean, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>transnationalization</italic> of Orthodoxy emerged historically as a consequence of the spread of the Orthodox faith across the globe and farther away from its original European heartlands. In order to avoid terminological confusion, it is necessary to differentiate the various dispersed Orthodox populations into two groups: on the one hand, there are those groups who have operated as minority groups or national minorities of neighbouring nations in South-eastern or Eastern Europe, and, on the other hand, there are those groups that were created as a result of Orthodox international migration. Most often, the first group did not cross borders to become transnational; the borders changed around them, with new nation-states emerging in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This group’s experience does <italic>not</italic> in fact fit well with the agenda of Transnational Studies. In contrast, it is the second group of Orthodox immigrants who moved away from their original homelands and into new, and often radically different, cultural milieus that most accurately resemble the groups of people referred to as ‘transnational’ in the social scientific literature.</p><p>Although rarely mentioned as an example of transnational religion, in the course of the last two centuries hundreds of thousands of Orthodox Christians have migrated outside their historical heartlands and into the immigrant societies of Australia, Canada and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368431012459694">FitzGerald, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1368431012459694">Krindatch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1368431012459694">Stokoe and Kishovski, 1995</xref>). This transoceanic population movement contributed to the export of Orthodox Christianity into new social and cultural contexts. The prevailing pattern of transnational Orthodoxy has been the construction of immigrant communities in which Orthodoxy offers a prime source of maintaining and reproducing ethno-national identity in new, culturally different environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368431012459694">Hammerli, 2010</xref>). This is displayed prominently in the United States, Australia and Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368431012459694">Danforth, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368431012459694">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1368431012459694">Roudometof, 2000</xref>). The experience of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and the post-World War II communist takeover of Eastern Europe contributed heavily to the proliferation of <italic>de facto</italic> or <italic>de jure</italic> ecclesiastical autonomy or independence among Orthodox immigrant populations.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1368431012459694"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This article extends the logic of multiple glocalizations into the historical record and proposes a tentative list of such glocalizations. The line of analysis proposed in the article is explicitly oriented away from the conventional focus on secularization and toward a historical interpretation of the intertwining between world religions and local cultures. It further offers two advantages. First, it enables a view of globalization that does not reduce it to a recent historical process but, rather, frames it as a long-term process that pre-dates the rise of the West. The proposed framework does so through the incorporation of the pre-modern era of globalization. Second, the proposed interpretation highlights the spatial dimension of globalization: instead of bringing about uniformity, globalization involves the spatially based construction of cultural hybrids of the local and the global. The result is the construction of glocal forms that blend religious universalism with local (ethnic, vernacular or national) particularism. Hence, the relationship between the sacred and the profane is continuously reconfigured through the ongoing construction and reconstruction of glocal forms of religiosity. This article identifies four glocalizations: vernacularization, indigenization, nationalization and transnationalization. Each represents different combinations of the local and the global. In addition to an analytical outline, the article further illustrates the use of the proposed framework through an examination of the historical trajectory of Christianity – and more specifically of its Eastern Orthodox branch.</p><p>Both Roman Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity represent religious traditions that emerged in the context of Christianity’s long-term vernacularization. In this sense, these traditions are themselves the products of historically formed combinations of universalism and particularism. Moreover, several forms of Christianity have displayed the historical tendency toward indigenization, whereby the contours of universal Christianity were fused with local, regional or ethnic identities. Several historical examples were mentioned.</p><p>Eastern Orthodox Christianity was consolidated in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade and its successful 1204 sack of Constantinople. Initially, its institutions were deeply intertwined with the Russian and Ottoman Empires, but, over time, it was further subjected to nationalization. This nationalization of Orthodoxy, it is argued, led to its redeployment as a facet of local national identities. This historical process was initiated in nineteenth-century South-eastern Europe and was belatedly applied to the post-1989 post-Soviet constellation. Several contemporary ecclesiastical disputes (in Estonia, Ukraine, or Moldova) reflect this application of a modern synthesis between Orthodoxy and nationality. Far from reflecting a cultural backwardness or an anti-modern reaction, the nationalization of Orthodoxy reflects the continuing ability of a religious tradition to continuously relate to new emerging cultural forms – such as the nation-state. This nationalization is accompanied by transnationalization; in fact, the two are intimately related. Through the construction of nation-states and international migration, new categories of transnational peoples are created. In the case of Orthodoxy, the nationalization operated not only in the countries of South-eastern and Eastern Europe, but also in the numerous transnational communities of Orthodox immigrants in their transatlantic destinations (Australia, Canada and the United States). In most of these cases, the immigrants’ transnationalism does not privilege religious universalism, but rather, it uses religion as a symbolic means to maintain and reconstruct national relations to the original country of origin.</p><p>Although the four glocalizations might appear mostly connected to distinct historical eras, it is important to stress that these are not inexorably tied to specific historical eras: the pursuit of vernacularization in the Ottoman Empire took place around the same era as did the pursuit of indigenization in the Russian Empire. These regional historical pathways show that it is theoretically possible to have different glocalizations present synchronically; the prevalence of one does not negate the possibilities for the existence of another. Certainly, Orthodox Christianity’s historical record suggests that vernacularization and indigenization have been predominant in the pre-modern era whereas nationalization and transnationalization are far more common in the modern era. But this is the result of historical contingency and not a quality inherent in the concepts as such. Of course, insofar as the nation-state serves as the central organizational template for humanity and as the main regulatory agent for religious institutions, it simultaneously generates the very processes responsible for both the nationalization and the transnationalization of religion. Finally, the four glocalizations are empirical constructs – they represent theoretical generalizations derived from a partial view of the historical record. It is always theoretically possible to add additional combinations of the local and the global to the list.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-1368431012459694"><label>1.</label><p>An earlier version of the article was presented at the conference on Cultures and Civilisation in the Contemporary World (Trento, Italy, 28–29 June 2012).
