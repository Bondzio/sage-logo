<abstract>
<p>Laser bending is realized by local plastic deformation based on non-uniform thermal stress resulting from laser beam radiation. The aim of laser bending is to achieve bending deformation of a plate; however, the bending angle varies along the scanning line greatly affecting assembly accuracy in real industry applications. To control the forming accuracy in multi-scanning laser bending, several heating methods are proposed in this article. It is evident that the heating methods have a significant influence on the forming accuracy. The experimental results show that the bending angle variation can be reduced using the proper heating methods.</p>

<p>Laser bending of a plate is realized by laser beam to generate non-uniform thermal stresses along the thickness direction. As a flexible and dieless forming method, laser bending is suitable for low volume production and forming of hard and brittle materials, and has potential applications in fields such as the shipbuilding, automotive and electronic industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954408912458199">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954408912458199"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954408912458199"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954408912458199">4</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec3-0954408912458199"><title>Finite element model</title>
<p>The numerical simulation was carried out using the commercial finite element software ANSYS in order to quantitatively analyze the variation of temperature, stress, strain and displacement. The FEM simulation was carried out by thermal-mechanical analysis accounting for the temperature dependency of the thermal and mechanical properties of the material, including thermal conductivity, the density, the specific heat, the yield stress and the Young’s modulus. The numerical modeling established in this article is based on the following assumptions. The material of the metal plate used is uniform and isotropic. No external forces are imposed on the plate, and the weight of the plate is ignored. The peak temperature in laser forming is less than melting temperature of materials. The von Mises criterion and the plastic flow rule are applied in the simulation process. Thermal-physical properties and mechanical properties of metal plate are only functions of temperature and have nothing to do with the heating position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954408912458199">7</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec4-0954408912458199"><title>Experiments</title>
<p>Experiments of the straight-line laser bending were conducted with an HJ-3000 CO<sub>2</sub> laser system in a continuous wave mode, which has maximum output power of 3 kW. The laser scanning path is along a centreline and the heated surface was coated with graphite to enhance the absorption of laser energy after cleaning with acetone. The material investigated was low carbon steel DC01. The geometry of the sample was measured after laser forming using a laser placement sensor LK-081CCD.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0954408912458199"><title>Analysis of bending angle variations</title>
<p>In the laser bending process, a sharp thermal gradient in the thickness direction is produced due to the short duration of laser scanning under the temperature gradient mechanism, which induces the differential thermal expansion. The compressive plastic deformation occurs with the increase of the compressive stresses. However, the magnitude of compressive plastic deformation along the thickness direction is various for the different temperature distribution. The material of heated area in the cooling stage is shrunk because the plastic deformation of plate can not recover, which cause the plate to bend toward the laser beam.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408912458199">Figure 1</xref> shows the peak temperature reached at the top surface with the dimensions of 40 × 40 × 2 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954408912458199">3</xref></sup> under the laser forming condition of 600 W for power, 15 mm/s for velocity and 6 mm for spot diameter. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408912458199">Figure 1</xref>, it can be seen that the temperature distribution is non-uniform. Apparently, the peak temperature of two edges is different from that of the middle due to different heat input and dissipation, and the peak temperature away from the two edges is basically stable. This non-uniform peak temperature distribution from edge to edge along the heating line will affect through-thickness temperature distribution that determines the final bend angle variation. The bending deformation of the plate depends mainly on the <italic>Y</italic>-axis plastic strain. The through-thickness <italic>Y</italic>-axis residual strains are predominantly responsible for the desired bending deformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954408912458199">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954408912458199"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954408912458199">19</xref></sup> Plastic strain in the <italic>Y</italic> direction along the heating line both at the top surface and at the middle surface is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954408912458199">Figure 2</xref>. It can be seen in the figure that the <italic>Y</italic>-axis plastic strain at the two edges is less than that at the middle. Despite the fact that the temperature distribution in the quasi-stable state is held constant, there were still greater differences for the <italic>Y</italic>-axis plastic strain. It is not difficult to find that restraining force from the surrounding cool material plays an important role.

<p>On the face of this, the bending angle variations mainly result from the non-uniform temperature distribution and the geometry constraint variations.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0954408912458199"><title>Scanning methods</title>
<p>The bending deformation of a plate is mainly dependent on the temperature field in the laser bending process. To reduce the bending angle variation, an attempt to vary the temperature distribution of the plate to balance the mechanical restraining force was made. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954408912458199">Figure 3</xref> shows four scanning methods for the multi-scanning laser bending, where a single quote (’) and a double quote (’’) denote the first scan and the second scan, respectively, the arrow denotes the heating direction, and the second scan is shown shifted down for convenience of expression. Scanning method 1 is a conventional heating method in which every scan is along the same direction, whereas the bending angle variation is increased as the number of heating passes is increased. Scanning methods 2 to 4 are proposed as new methods in order to reduce the bending angle variation.
<fig id="fig3-0954408912458199" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Multi-scanning method of laser bending: (a) scanning method 1, (b) scanning method 2, (c) scanning method 3 and (d) scanning method 4.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408912458199-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The experiments and numerical simulations were conducted with laser power of 900 W, a velocity of 20 mm/s and a spot diameter of 6 mm. The plate size was 100 × 50 × 1.92 mm<sup>3</sup>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954408912458199">Figure 4</xref> shows numerical results of peak temperature on the top surface along the heating line with the four heating methods. From the temperature distribution, it is can be founded that the peak temperature produces a great change for the different heating methods. At the left edge point, the peak temperature using the heating method 1 is apparently lower than that of other heating methods. Compared with the heating methods 1 and 2, at the middle the peak temperature of the heating methods 3 and 4 is lower, but that is where the geometric constraint is the strongest. In addition, time reached to the peak temperature for the edge point is different under the different heating methods, which has an influence for the bending angle variation. The experimental results of bending angle along the heating line with the four heating methods are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954408912458199">Figure 5</xref>. The bending angle variation using the heating methods 3 and 4 decreases compared with the heating method 1 and 2. The relative variations of bending angle <italic>η<sub>α</sub></italic> in the bending angle are 16.22%, 13.51%, 9.61% and 8.53% when the heating methods 1–4 are used, respectively. The relative variation of bending angle <italic>η<sub>α</sub></italic> is defined as <italic>η<sub>α</sub></italic> = (<italic>α</italic><sub>max</sub>-<italic>α</italic><sub>min</sub>)/<italic>α</italic><sub>ave</sub>, where <italic>α</italic><sub>max</sub> is the maximal bending angle, <italic>α</italic><sub>min</sub> is the minimal bending angle and <italic>α</italic><sub>ave</sub> is the average bending angle. Consequently, the bending angle variation can be reduced using the new heating methods.
