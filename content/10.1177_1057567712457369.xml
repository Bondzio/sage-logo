<p>Jody Madeira’s book <italic>Killing McVeigh: The Death Penalty and the Myth of Closure </italic>chronicles the experiences of survivors and family members of those who were murdered in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma (OK) City in April 1995. Based on interviews of 33 survivors and family members, Madeira’s book provides a detailed account of how primary and secondary victims of the bombing reacted to this event and their struggle to make sense of why the bombing had occurred. In addition, survivors and family members sought information about the personalities and motivations of the bombing’s main perpetrator, Timothy McVeigh as well as McVeigh’s coconspirators, Terry Nichols and Michael Fortier. In telling the story of the OK City bombing from survivors’ and family members’ perspectives, Madeira challenges a culturally held notion of “closure” or emotional finality following a traumatic event. She instead redefines closure as a fluid and complex process which rarely if ever ends with a traumatized individual forgetting about or completely eradicating the experience from their lives. Rather, those who are affected by a traumatic event seek therapy through gathering information about and narrating the event from commission of the crime, to the execution and beyond, a process known as memory work.</p>
<p>For survivors and family members, memory work began with the consumption of continuous media coverage of McVeigh’s “perp walk” or the journey from the Perry, OK jail in which he was initially held to the vehicle that would transport him to a more permanent facility. One of the most common observations made by survivors and family members was of McVeigh’s stoic, militaristic appearance. Other survivors and family members commented that their initial impressions of McVeigh as an ordinary individual differed from what they had expected someone capable of committing such an offense to look like, many commenting that they had expected him to be more monstrous and vile. McVeigh's perp walk, however, was only the first step in the process of memory work and coping.</p>
<p>Other strategies employed by survivors and family members to create a narration of events and to assist with coping (i.e., assisting in memory work) were joining advocacy groups, gathering information about McVeigh, Nichols, and Fortier from media coverage, and attending each person’s trial, especially McVeigh’s.</p>
<p>In joining advocacy groups, survivors and family members found community in one another and were instrumental in the construction of a permanent memorial on the grounds of the Murrah Building as well as in the passage of important victims’ rights legislation such as the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Following McVeigh’s trial, one advocacy group organized a visit to OK City for the jurors in McVeigh’s trial in order to thank them and to better understand the trial from their perspective, also assisting in memory work.</p>
<p>Media coverage reinforced survivors’ and family members’ initial view of McVeigh as callous and unsympathetic while Nichols and Fortier were viewed as subordinate, less dominant personalities under McVeigh’s command. If McVeigh’s clean cut appearance made him seem like an unlikely suspect in the bombing in the eyes of survivors and family members, Nichols’ passive, family man persona made him even less likely to be involved in the bombing. Survivors and family members placed Nichols’ culpability as only slightly less than McVeigh’s, given that he was instrumental in gathering the bomb making materials. Further, survivors and family members formed an opinion of Fortier as drug addicted and backward. Their feelings of Fortier’s culpability ranged from only somewhat involved (given that he failed to notify authorities of the bomb plot) to as culpable as McVeigh. All of this information gathered from the media assisted survivors and family members in their memory work by helping answering the question, “who?”</p>
<p>Survivors and family members also attended McVeigh’s trial in order to fill some of their gaps in knowledge that could not be obtained from the media. For many, attending the trial reinforced their perceptions of McVeigh as callous and unsympathetic. Several survivors and family members commented not only on McVeigh’s stoic demeanor throughout the proceedings but also derided McVeigh for laughing and joking with his attorneys. Some family members sought some sort of interaction between themselves and McVeigh, and most never received it. The primary motivation for their attendance however was the perception that they were playing part in the justice process and “seeing justice done.”</p>
<p>Following McVeigh’s conviction, some survivors and family members were afforded the opportunity to provide victim impact testimony during the sentencing phase. For most, this was seen as having a positive benefit and assisting in memory work. Upon McVeigh being given the death penalty however, survivors and family members had to grapple with the decision as to whether to attend McVeigh’s execution and whether this would provide a positive benefit to their memory work. Ultimately, only 10 survivors and family members were selected to view the execution live in Terre Haute, IN while many others would have the opportunity to view the execution via closed circuit television in OK City. Following the execution, survivors and family members differed greatly in their feelings. Many felt the punishment was too easy, those who favored the death penalty were generally glad to see justice done while those who were antideath penalty were relieved that McVeigh’s media coverage would dwindle and that they would no longer be constantly reminded of his “toxic presence.”</p>
<p>
<italic>Killing McVeigh: The Death Penalty and the Myth of Closure </italic>provides support for the notion that survivors and family members of traumatic events may never reach complete closure or finality as such terms are defined in contemporary American culture. Rather than closure, survivors and family members seek therapeutic narration and understanding of the event, resulting in a return to a sense of normalcy.</p>
<p>Overall, Madeira’s book provides numerous avenues for future research inquiries with regard to survivor and family member responses to traumatic events involving the death of associates and loved ones. Madeira’s work could be expanded to include family members of murder victims in nonculturally traumatic, mass murder events such as the OK City bombing to enhance our understanding of how family members make sense of and deal with the murder of a loved one. However, her book provides one of the best accounts to date of how survivors’ and family members’ lives are affected by mass murder from commission of the crime, to the end of the criminal justice process and beyond. This book would be an excellent addition to any graduate-level death penalty course in criminal justice. The book addresses capital punishment from the perspectives of all too often neglected groups, the surviving family members, and others intimately affected by the crime and the death penalty process.</p>
