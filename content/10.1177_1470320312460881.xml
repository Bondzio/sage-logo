<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although sulfonylureas have long been therapeutically utilized for their hypoglycemic properties in type II diabetic patients, there is a lack of clinical or experimental data that suggest that this class confers a benefit on the course of diabetic renal disease.</p>
<p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of kidney disease in patients and affects approximately 40% of type I and type II diabetic patients. Over the last 35 years, an increasing number of patients with type II diabetes mellitus have developed advanced renal disease, and they require dialysis. The explanation for the increase in the number of patients with type II diabetes mellitus in end-stage renal disease programs is not completely clear. The basis for the prevention of DN is the effective treatment of its known risk factors: hypertension, hyperglycemia, smoking, and dyslipidemia. These risk factors should be vigorously treated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320312460881">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Kvetny et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320312460881">2</xref></sup> found that the use of perindopril for 3 years in normotensive, normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients delayed the increase in albuminuria. Similarly, Lindholm et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320312460881">3</xref></sup> reported that in patients with type 2 diabetes, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers both diminish the risk for DN. Blockade of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) was proved to delay or prevent the onset of microalbuminuria, and attenuate progression of DN even in advanced stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320312460881">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also evident that prolonged tight glycemic control slows down the progression of DN in type 2 diabetes. Sulfonylurea compounds were the first available oral anti-diabetic agents, and they remain an important tool for optimal glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320312460881">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beesley et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320312460881">6</xref></sup> demonstrated the presence of a functional rat mesangial K<sub>ATP</sub> containing unique receptors for sulfonylureas. However, little is known about their possible functional and metabolic effects, independently of the increased insulin secretion and decrease glycemia induced by these compounds.</p>
<p>Asano et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320312460881">7</xref></sup> demonstrated specific binding of the sulfonylurea glibenclamide (Glib) to mesangial cell (MC) membranes and, following exposure to it, there is increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and intense MC contraction. On the other hand, Cortes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320312460881">8</xref></sup> reported that MCs treated with high concentrations of tolazamide increased glucose uptake, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 secretion, and matrix accumulation, suggesting that this drug could aggravate diabetic glomerulosclerosis.</p>
<p>Therefore, because the initial observations regarding the effect of sulfonylureas on DN were contradictory, the present study has been undertaken to examine the effect of glibenclamide treatment on the progression of renal biochemical and histological changes in streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus in rats, to determine whether therapeutic intervention with glibenclamide would prevent the onset and progression of renal complications independent of its effect on blood glucose, and to compare the results with a standard group of drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) used in treatment of DN.</p>

<sec id="section8-1470320312460881">
<title>Experimental animals</title>
<p>Male adult albino rats weighting 250–275 g were used throughout the study. Rats were housed in wire-topped plastic cages, five animals per cage, and kept under standard laboratory conditions with controlled temperature, 12 h light/dark cycle and given free access to a standard diet of rodent chow (12–15 g/d) and water ad libitum. The temperature inside the chambers was 22°C (± 2) with relative humidity from 40–60%. They were left to acclimatize for 1 week before the experiment was started. Animal care was carried in accordance with institutional guidelines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1470320312460881">
<title>Test drugs</title>
<p>Streptozotocin (STZ) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was freshly prepared in citrate buffer; glibenclamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), provided as powder, was dissolved in water; and captopril (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), provided as powder, was dissolved in water.</p>

<sec id="section10-1470320312460881">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section11-1470320312460881">
<title>Induction of diabetes mellitus</title>
<p>Diabetes was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of STZ (60 mg/kg body weight) after 18 h fasting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320312460881">9</xref></sup> STZ was dissolved in 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.5) immediately before use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320312460881">10</xref></sup> Tail blood samples were obtained 72 h after the injection, in order to measure blood glucose concentration by using glucometer (Smart-DC, Germany), to ensure the successful induction of diabetes in STZ-treated animals. Animals were classed as diabetic when glycemia exceed 11 mmol/l (1 mmol = 18 mg glucose).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320312460881">11</xref></sup> Animals with blood glucose levels above 200 mg/dl were selected for study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1470320312460881">
<title>Animal grouping</title>
<p>The rats were divided into two main groups. Group [I] was subdivided into four subgroups (48 rats each). In subgroup (Ia), rats were given distilled water orally in the same timing that drugs were administered to the other groups, and served as control group. In subgroup (Ib), rats were injected intraperitoneally with equivalent volumes of 0.1 M citrate buffer, and served as vehicle control. In subgroup (Ic), rats were given glibenclamide in a dose of 0.04 mg/kg/day orally,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320312460881">12</xref></sup> and subgroup (Id) rats were given captopril (17.5 mg/kg/day) and served as a standard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320312460881">13</xref></sup> Group [II] (STZ-induced diabetes mellitus) rats were rendered diabetic by single intraperitoneal injection of STZ in a dose of 60 mg/kg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320312460881">9</xref></sup> The diabetic rats were randomized into three subgroups (48 rats each). Subgroup (IIa) served as untreated diabetic rats. Subgroups (IIb and IIc) rats were treated with glibenclamide or capropril, respectively, at the same doses previously mentioned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1470320312460881">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Six rats were randomly selected from each subgroup after 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of treatment. The following parameters were measured: arterial blood pressure, serum glucose and creatinine levels. In order to determine urinary protein and albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 24 h urine was collected from individually caged rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320312460881">14</xref></sup> After sacrifice, the kidney:body weight ratio was determined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1470320312460881">
<title>Measurement of blood pressure</title>
<p>Blood pressure was measured in conscious rats, the day before sacrifice, using a tail-cuff monitor (model 65-12 manual scanner; IITC Life Science, Woodland, CA, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1470320312460881">
<title>Urine collection</title>
<p>For analysis of urine, 24 h urine volume was measured. Urine was centrifuged and 1 ml was stored at -20°C until the time of biochemical analysis of urinary albumin excretion (UAE), urinary creatinine level and determination of albumin:creatinine ratio.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1470320312460881">
<title>Blood sampling</title>
<p>A fasting blood sample was withdrawn from the retro-orbital venous plexus before scarification at 10 am for estimation of blood glucose. Sera was separated and stored at -20°C until the time of biochemical analysis of serum glucose and creatinine levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1470320312460881">
<title>Ratio of kidney weight relative to body weight (KW:BW)</title>
<p>The average weight of the animals was recorded on the day of sacrifice. The weight of the right kidney was determined, and hypertrophy of the kidney was estimated by comparing the weight of the kidney to the body weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320312460881">15</xref></sup></p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section18-1470320312460881">
<title>Histological assessment of kidney injury</title>
<p>At the end of the experiment, right kidneys from each group were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and processed for 5 μm paraffin sections for Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, Masson trichrome staining and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction. Morphometric measurements of stained sections were performed in an image analysis system (Leica Qwin Imaging System, Ltd., Cambridge, England). All quantification was blinded.</p>
<p>For PAS-stained sections, glomerular sclerosis was evaluated as incremental degrees of PAS-positive substances, disappearance of cell components, collapse of capillary lumina, and entrapment of amorphous hyaline material associated or not with adhesions to Bowman’s capsule as indicators, and was classified according to the criteria of Romero et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320312460881">16</xref></sup> At least 50 glomeruli were randomly chosen and evaluated per biopsy at a magnification of ×400 using Leica Qwin image analysis software. Sclerosis involving more than 80% of the glomerular tuft was considered global, and sclerosis involving less than 80% was considered segmental. Results are expressed as the percentage glomeruli examined showing segmental or global sclerosis.</p>
<p>The glomerular sclerosis index (GSI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320312460881">17</xref></sup> (mesangial expansion)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320312460881">18</xref></sup> was analyzed using PAS-stained kidney sections. At least 50 randomly chosen glomeruli were selected at a magnification of ×400. Using Leica Qwin imaging system software, each glomerulus was traced inside the basement membrane of the Bowman’s capsule. The sclerotic index was obtained by measuring the total area (µm<sup>2</sup>) of each glomerulus and then measuring the area of the PAS-positive magenta-stained regions within the glomerulus. The sclerotic index was calculated for each glomerulus by dividing the total PAS-positive area (µm<sup>2</sup>) by the total area (µm<sup>2</sup>) of the glomerulus multiplied by 100. A mean sclerotic index was calculated for each animal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320312460881">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Severity of tubular degeneration and atrophy, as well as tubulointerstitial infiltration (hematoxylin and eosin staining) and interstitial fibrosis (trichrome staining), were evaluated individually, determining the percentage in the biopsy section and scored using the criteria of Romero et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320312460881">16</xref></sup> The severity of the tissue damage consists of the following five grades (scores) based on the ratio of the lesion area to the total area of the renal tissue in the visual field as follows; 0: lesion area &lt; 10%; 1: 10% &lt; lesion area &lt; 20%; 2: 20% &gt; lesion area &lt; 40%; 3: 40% &gt; lesion area &lt; 60%; 4: 60% &lt; lesion area &lt; 80%; 5: lesion area &gt; 80%. The average score obtained in the sections of each biopsy (10–15 sections per biopsy) was used as the score of the biopsy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study examined the effect of glibenclamide treatment on the progression of renal biochemical and histological changes in diabetic rats. It was designed to determine whether therapeutic intervention with these agents would prevent the onset and progression of renal complications or not compared with a reference drug, captopril, in the prevention of DN.</p>
<p>The STZ-diabetic animals represent a good experimental diabetic state with residual or remnant insulin production by pancreatic β-cells. Further, STZ-induced diabetes in rodents results in development of nephropathy, similar to early stage clinical nephropathy. Therefore, this animal model was selected for the study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320312460881">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our data revealed that 2 weeks after induction of diabetes mellitus, rats exhibited an increase in kidney weight relative to body weight, which accounts for early evidence of DN as reported by Mogensen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320312460881">20</xref></sup> The increase in rat kidney weight could be due to sustained hyperglycemia, either through direct toxicity to cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320312460881">21</xref></sup> or indirectly mediated through activation of protein kinase C (PKC)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470320312460881">22</xref></sup> polyol pathway,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470320312460881">23</xref></sup> advanced glycation end products (AGE),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470320312460881">24</xref></sup> and oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470320312460881">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data from the present work demonstrated that treatment with glibenclamide produced a significant reduction in rat kidney weights and in kidney weight relative to body weight compared with the diabetic rats. This finding could be explained by Biederman et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470320312460881">26</xref></sup> who postulated that up-regulation of mesangial α-endosulfine in the hyperglycemic milieu of insulin-deficient diabetes may retard glomerular extracellular matrix formation and mesangial expansion, hence prevent renal hypertrophy. Captopril, through blockade of the RAS, was proved to attenuate progression of DN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320312460881">4</xref></sup> There was no significant difference between diabetic rats receiving glibenclamide and the renoprotective comparator captopril as regards kidney hypertrophy. On the contrary, Katoh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470320312460881">27</xref></sup> demonstrated that captopril failed to inhibit renal hypertrophy and elevation of creatinine clearance.</p>
<p>It is known that diabetic patients may develop variable degrees of glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470320312460881">28</xref></sup> However, structural glomerular changes such as glomerular hypertrophy may be difficult to note unless careful measurements are made.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470320312460881">29</xref></sup> Nakagawa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470320312460881">30</xref></sup> reported that glomerular hypertrophy was quantified as the glomerular tuft cross-sectional area.</p>
<p>Glomerular sclerosis was defined as an increment in intra-glomerular PAS-positive material associated with collapse of capillary lumens and amorphous hyaline material with or without adhesions to the Bowman’s capsule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320312460881">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consistent with the results of Biederman et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470320312460881">26</xref></sup> the morphometric measurements in the present study showed glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial expansion and focal interstitial fibrosis in the case of diabetic non-treated animals as GSI was increased in comparison with the control animals. Meanwhile, the degree of glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial expansion for the diabetic treated animals was less than that seen in diabetic rats.</p>
<p>Giannico et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470320312460881">31</xref></sup> suggested that glibenclamide might directly attenuate diabetic glomerular disease, possibly by inhibiting plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression. Excess glomerular PAI-1 allows the accumulation of extracellular matrix, leading to glomerulosclerosis. These results have therapeutic implications for DN as well as for proliferative mesangial diseases of the kidney.</p>
<p>In the present work, a significant increase in the mean arterial blood pressure was observed in the diabetic non-treated rats. These findings are consistent with the observations of Stefan et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470320312460881">32</xref></sup> who found that mean arterial blood pressure was markedly increased in diabetics; on the other hand, the present results revealed that treatment with glibenclamide produced a non-significant reduction in elevated mean arterial blood pressure throughout the study period, unlike the data of Moreau et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470320312460881">33</xref></sup> who reported that the glibenclamide-induced blockade of vascular potassium channels caused a vasoconstriction in the systemic and splanchnic vascular beds and hence an increase in blood pressure. Williams et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470320312460881">34</xref></sup> reported that night-time systolic blood pressures were significantly higher during glibenclamide treatment than they were with placebo. Kulkarni et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470320312460881">35</xref></sup> reported that glibenclamide significantly prevented alloxan-induced hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia, but it failed to alter hypertension. In contrast to the present data were the data of Yosefy et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320312460881">13</xref></sup> that glibenclamide worsened blood pressure control possibly by activation of the sympathetic system. On the other hand, Kamata et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470320312460881">36</xref></sup> reported that glibenclamide suppressed sodium-induced hypertension through sodium excretion from the kidney resulting from accelerated secretion of urinary kallikrein.</p>
<p>Administration of captopril to diabetic rats significantly decreased mean arterial blood pressure at 4 weeks and prevented renal hypertrophy. Mogensen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470320312460881">37</xref></sup> reported that the renoprotective effect of captopril is independent of blood pressure reduction, while in the present study glibenclamide protected against renal hypertrophy without affecting mean arterial blood pressure. This means that the renoprotective effect of glibenclamide is not in part due to its effect on blood pressure. Captopril significantly reduced mean arterial blood pressure in normotensive dogs via a nitric oxide-independent mechanism, and did not affect postprandial glucose level in normoglycemic dogs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470320312460881">38</xref></sup> Captopril significantly reduced blood pressure of diabetic mice at 28 days after the start of drug treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470320312460881">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results of the present work showed that administration of glibenclamide following induction of diabetes decreased blood glucose levels in STZ-treated rats, while blood glucose in the captopril-treated diabetic did not show significant decrease compared with the diabetic group. Sulfonylurea improves peripheral glucose uptake and decreases endogenous glucose production independent of its insulin secretagogue action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470320312460881">39</xref></sup> The decrease in glucose level may also be due to an increased sensitivity of peripheral tissues to released insulin and to insulin-like extrapancreatic effects; moreover, it could be due to an intensification of the transmembrane transport of glucose and an increase in glycolysis activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470320312460881">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present data demonstrate that diabetes mellitus produced a significant increase in serum creatinine compared with the control group, and showed that serum creatinine levels were significantly lower in the diabetic group receiving glibenclamide or captopril compared with their respective diabetic group. Induction of diabetes produced a significant increase in the 24 h urine volume, urinary protein excretion and urinary ACR compared with control rats. However, glibenclamide or captopril significantly decreased urine volume compared with the diabetic group. In addition, it decreased significantly both proteinuria and urinary ACR. Captopril-treated rats did not show significant changes relative to controls.</p>
<p>Diabetic rats in the present study experienced proteinuria and microalbuminuria. Microalbuminuria is an established marker of diabetic nephropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470320312460881">41</xref></sup> However, these markers decreased following treatment with either glibenclamide or captopril. This could be explained as follows. The predominant action of angiotensin II is confined to the efferent arteriole, thereby inducing a rise in glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure. Conversely, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition diminishes glomerular capillary pressure in animals, and probably also in man. As albuminuria is dependent on glomerular hydraulic pressure, subsequently captopril reduced albuminuria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470320312460881">42</xref></sup> The major source of oxidative stress in diabetes is reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from the superoxide anion that is produced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) oxidase. Because angiotensin II stimulates NAD(P)H oxidase expression and activation in vasculature and in the kidney, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor can effectively suppress NAD(P)H oxidase and decrease microalbuminuria in diabetic rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470320312460881">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>In insulin-deficient diabetic rats, sulfonylureas significantly reduced the enhanced albumin excretion, because glibenclamide may improve the afferent arteriolar dilatation, thereby reducing glomerular hyperfiltration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470320312460881">26</xref></sup> Recently, Tanwar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470320312460881">44</xref></sup> reported that glibenclamide as a reference anti-hyperglycemic compound attenuated renal dysfunction by significantly decreasing urine volume and albuminuria in STZ-induced diabetic rats. In contrast, Nakamura et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470320312460881">45</xref></sup> reported that glibenclamide did not reduce urinary albumin excretion in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients with microalbuminuria.</p>
<p>In the present study, the kidneys of diabetic non-treated rats revealed focal tubular degeneration at multiple points along the nephron, with large skip areas in between, often accompanied by the presence of casts in tubular lumina. The casts were eosinophilic and hyaline. Furthermore, interstitial fibrosis and mononuclear infiltrating cells around dilated blood vessels and degenerated tubules were demonstrated. However, treatment with glibenclamide and captopril mostly preserved the morphology of the glomeruli and tubules. Zafiriou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470320312460881">46</xref></sup> settled the hypothesis that elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels may play a role in the development of tubular pathology. Concurrent exposure to albumin and LDL might result in reduced albumin uptake and hence tubular degeneration. So, the reduction in proteinuria following treatment with glibenclamide and captopril would reduce tubular degeneration.</p>
<p>It could be concluded that glibenclamide attenuated some biochemical and histological changes produced by DN. It resulted in a reduction in renal changes that accompany diabetes, despite persistent hyperglycemia and hypertension. It could be suggested that the protective effect of glibenclamide in DN is independent of its effect on blood glucose level. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the protective effect of glibenclamide could be due to its direct effect on sulfonylurea receptors (SUR2B) in the kidney. Based on the obtained results, a potential new therapeutic field is opened for the study of protective tools in DN; one could recommend that human clinical trials are necessary to prove this protective effect.</p>
