<p>I had an exciting experience recently visiting Hiroshima, Japan, attending the 1st International Conference on Caring and Peace sponsored by Red Cross Hiroshima College of Nursing and the Watson Caring Science Institute. An initiative also was signed for shared educational development between the Red Cross Hiroshima College of Nursing and the University of Colorado College of Nursing where Dr. Madeleine Leininger began her journey to advance the discipline of transcultural nursing 50 years ago. This experience illuminated for me the significant role that transcultural nurses can play in healing the wounds of war and ultimately “blazing the trail” for human rights, social justice, and peace in the world. A peace ceremony was held at the Hiroshima A-Bomb museum. It seemed like at the ceremony, the “heavens were crying”; there was a steady downpour of rain, reminding us of past pain and continued sorrow generated by conflict and war. A hush came over the event, even the rain subsided for a few moments, when the delegation of attendees lighted a candle and began to pray, each in their own way, as a wreath of white flowers was laid at the foot of the A-Bomb memorial site.</p>
<p>The Transcultural Nursing Society is committed to advancing the millennium goals of the United Nations. These goals highlight issues related to justice, peace, and global health. Improving maternal child health, eradicating poverty and hunger, combating HIV/AIDS and other diseases, and seeking partnerships for action are only a few of the objectives for securing global health and political and economic security among nations. In June 2012, my doctoral student and I had the opportunity to participate with diplomats at the United Nations in New York under the auspices of the School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Seton Hall University. One thing I learned as a transcultural nurse is the nature of the structure of community worldwide. The processes to reach the UN goals can only be advanced by discovering and seeking understanding of sociocultural, spiritual, political, and economic interconnectedness. Only then can we cocreate authentic ethical transcultural policies. Choosing to be ethically responsible for one another through transcultural caring requires of us, and especially transcultural nurses, a recommitment to what it means to protect humanity. Moral acumen (respect for humanity, integrity, cultural humility, and devotion to making things work through love and forgiveness) can lead in national and global transformation and building the global civic culture.</p>
