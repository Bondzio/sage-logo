<abstract>
<p>A retrospective study was undertaken to review the outcomes of a consecutive series of patients treated using pyrocarbon surface replacement arthroplasty by the same surgeon. We analyzed the results of this procedure in 24 proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints in 19 hands of 16 patients. The minimum follow-up was 3 years. The study showed that pyrocarbon PIP joint replacements provided excellent pain relief and high patient satisfaction. More than two-thirds of patients subjectively rated postoperative range of motion and functional outcomes as better than preoperatively. Objective assessment showed a modest improvement in the active range of motion, which did not achieve statistical significance, although we did observe a statistically significant increase in passive range of motion. The results are encouraging for those surgeons who seek an alternative to silicone implant PIP joint arthroplasty in high-demand patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are hinge joints, with functional stability throughout their arc of motion. Under normal conditions, the PIP joint has a 105° range of motion (ROM); whereas, functional motion is between 36° and 86° (mean 60°) for most activities of daily living (Hume et al., 2002).</p>
<p>Patients suffering from PIP joint pain or stiffness secondary to arthritis may benefit from arthrodesis or joint replacement. Surgery is indicated when medical management has failed to relieve symptoms and the affected digits interfere with hand function. Arthrodesis provides excellent pain relief and stability, but at the cost of loss of finger motion and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412443044">Burton et al., 2002</xref>). The goals of implant arthroplasty of the finger joints are pain relief with preservation of functional ROM. Since the 1950s, over 30 different designs of finger joint implants have been reported. Since the original silicone implant designed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412443044">Swanson (1972)</xref>, several alternative PIP joint implants have been marketed, including the Nuflex (DePuy Orthopaedics Inc., Warsaw, Indiana) and the Sutter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412443044">Joyce et al., 2003</xref>). The shortcomings of the silicone spacers include implant fracture, dislocation, and silicone synovitis. Implant fracture tends to occur at the junction of the distal stem and hinge of the prosthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412443044">Joyce and Unsworth, 2002</xref>); however, this does not necessarily result in loss of function once the encapsulation around the prosthesis has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412443044">Goldfarb and Stern, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the past three decades of clinical use, pyrolytic carbon has proven to be biocompatible, strong, durable, and to have minimal wear with in vivo use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412443044">Haubold, 1994</xref>). Pyrocarbon joint implants also have the advantage of a favourable modulus of elasticity that is better matched to bone than alternative replacement materials for the metacarpophalangeal and PIP joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412443044">Beckenbaugh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412443044">Bravo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412443044">Cook et al., 1999</xref>), a factor that may help with implant survival in the longer term. Studies undertaken before the joint was used clinically revealed that the Ascension PyroCarbon surface replacement arthroplasty (SRA) PIP joint arthroplasty (Ascension Orthopaedics, Austin, Texas) was capable of providing functional joint motion and adequate grip and pinch strength in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412443044">Ascension Orthopedics Inc., 2002</xref>). The aim of this study was to critically assess the medium-term outcomes of a consecutive series of patients undergoing SRA of the PIP joint using this implant.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The senior author (M.A.P.) carried out 24 surface replacement SRAs of the PIP joint using the Ascension PyroCarbon implant in 16 patients from November 2003 to June 2008. Using clinical records, we retrospectively completed a pro forma for each case, which included basic demographic information, indications/symptoms, examination and radiographic findings, and operative details, as well as complications and treatment. An outcomes questionnaire was completed by all patients and used to rate pain relief, hand function, movement, and appearance as better, worse, or unchanged. At final review, pain relief was assessed using a visual analogue score (VAS) on a scale of 0 to 10 (10 being the worst pain). Patients were also asked about their satisfaction with the procedure and whether they would recommend it to a friend with similar symptoms. At final review, patients’ ROMs were determined using a goniometer. A Jamar and pinch dynamometer were used to measure power grip strength, and lateral key and tripod grip strengths. Unfortunately, we did not have complete pre-operative records of power grip strength, and lateral key and tripod grip strengths measurements, so we were unable to compare these with postoperative results. The stability of treated joints was clinically assessed by applying lateral and anterior-posterior stress to the treated PIP joint. Radiographs were taken for assessment of the operated digits preoperatively and at follow-up for the purposes of the study.</p>
<p>A paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used for statistical analysis</p>
<p>A dorsal, extensor-tendon-splitting surgical approach was used, as advocated by the implant manufacturer (Ascension PyroCarbon implant, Ascension Orthopedics, Plainsboro, New Jersey). A single dose of prophylactic antibiotics was routinely administered on-table, and a lateral radiograph was taken at the conclusion of each procedure (with the hand splinted and bandaged) to confirm joint reduction.</p>
<p>We routinely used a conservative (0–30°) short arc of motion (SAM) therapy regimen after resting for 1 week. The arc of motion was gradually increased to 50° by the end of the fourth week, after which full active tendon gliding exercises were started. By the end of 8 weeks, composite passive motion was started, and at the end of 12 weeks, patients were allowed to return to full function including contact sports (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412443044">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Data from 16 patients with 24 PIP joint SRAs (19 hands) were reviewed. Five patients were treated with multiple PIP joint replacements: two patients with two fingers each in the same hand operated simultaneously; one patient with two fingers in different hands operated on two separate occasions; one patient with three fingers treated on separate occasions; and one patient who had operations on three fingers of the same hand simultaneously and another finger on the other hand treated on a separate occasion. All patients were female except one. Mean age at time of surgery was 60 years (range 49–71). The most common indication for surgery was osteoarthritis (13 patients); two patients had rheumatoid arthritis and one had post-traumatic arthritis. The most common implant sizes used were 20P/20D. Patients were followed up for an average of 4 years (range 3–5). Minimum follow-up was 3 years.</p>
<p>The average active ROM in the affected PIP joints was 36° preoperatively (mean arc 13–50°) and 46° postoperatively (mean arc 12–57°); this net gain of 10° was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.27). The mean passive ROM in the affected PIP joints was 37° preoperatively (mean arc 12–50°), which was increased to 58° postoperatively (mean arc 8–60°), a net gain of 21°, which was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01).</p>
<p>Mean postoperative lateral key pinch strength was 7.7 kg; tripod pinch and power grip strengths were 7.5 and 15 kg, respectively.</p>
<p>Radiological assessment revealed lucency around the stem of the distal component of the implant in three patients, but no implant migration or fracture was noted. Two patients developed new osteophytes on the palmar aspect of the distal part of the proximal phalanx, and one patient had progression of residual osteophytes at final review.</p>
<p>Complications occurred in 9 of 24 fingers (five patients) with flexion contracture being the most common (5/24 fingers), followed by intermittent squeaking (4/24 fingers) and joint instability. One finger was found to have dislocated dorsally at the first outpatient review; reduction was easily obtained by manipulation under local anaesthesia. Three patients had two or more complications in fingers treated asynchronously. Three patients with stiffness underwent tenoarthrolysis to try and improve ROM (the other two patients declined further surgery). The arc of motion improved by 43° in one finger (from 8–25° preoperatively to 5–65° postoperatively) and 36° in another finger (from 10–26° preoperatively to 0–52° postoperatively), while there was a slight loss of mobility in a third finger. Squeaking was tolerated as a novelty by the patients whose joints were so affected.</p>
<p>Pain relief was excellent in all patients who had an average postoperative score of 0.9 on the visual analogue scale of 0–10.</p>
<p>Twelve of 16 patients rated ROM and functional outcome as better than preoperatively, whilst three patients reported that these had worsened and one patient did not notice any change in ROM. Half of patients stated that the appearance of the finger had improved; however, five were not happy with the appearance and three did not notice any change. Interestingly, the patients who were unhappy with the final appearance of the digit were also dissatisfied with this aspect preoperatively. All patients agreed that they would recommend the procedure to a friend in similar situation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several clinical studies have assessed pyrolytic carbon PIP joint implants, demonstrating that they reliably reduce pain, improve ROM, and are functionally superior to arthrodesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412443044">Bravo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412443044">Hormel and Beckenbaugh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412443044">Moutet et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412443044">Munshy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412443044">Schulz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193412443044">Stutz et al., 2005</xref>). One potential disadvantage is that although pyrocarbon is hard, it is also brittle and may be susceptible to breakage during impaction, which appears to be a rare phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412443044">Skie et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412443044">Munshy et al. (2003)</xref> reported improvement in the mean arc of motion in post- traumatic pyrocarbon arthroplasties at 18 month review. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412443044">Hormel and Beckenbaugh (2002)</xref> reported reduced pain, and improved ROM and stability in 12 months of follow-up. Five of their patients required secondary procedures for subluxation, flexor tenolysis, and palmar plate tightening. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412443044">Harrison et al. (2006)</xref> reported no improvement in average ROM, but good pain relief and improved appearance, despite a high complication rate: five contractures, eight squeaky joints, two dislocations, and two loosenings in 13 months follow-up. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412443044">Nunley et al. (2006)</xref> stopped their study early because of poor outcomes; average ROM decreased by 10°. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412443044">Bravo et al. (2007)</xref> found good pain relief and overall patient satisfaction at 2 years of follow-up, but no significant improvement in ROM. Of their patients, 28% underwent secondary procedures including revision arthroplasty (8%). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193412443044">Wijk et al. (2010)</xref> reported decreased pain, but no improvement in ROM and grip strength after a mean follow-up of 24 months. Seven of their patients needed a secondary surgery. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412443044">Chung et al. (2009)</xref> reported decrease in active ROM, but improved mean grip strength from 11.3 to 15.1 kg, and mean key pinch strength from 6.6 to 9.2 kg at 12 months of follow-up. They reported three squeaking joints and three dislocations of the pyrolytic carbon joint.</p>
<p>Our results are broadly similar to these earlier reports. Many of the published series of pyrolytic carbon PIP joint SRA have few patients, which may reflect the fact that it is a recently introduced procedure. The patients in our series were followed for an average of 4 years (range 3–5), which is so far the longest follow-up. Although the gain in active ROM in affected PIP joints (10°) was not statistically significant, the average passive ROM in these joints showed a net gain of about 21°, which was statistically significant. However, in three patients in our series ROM was reduced postoperatively. The functional benefit of this net increase in passive ROM is uncertain. Only a few other published series of pyrolytic carbon PIP joint SRA have documented a significant increase in postoperative active arc of motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412443044">Hormel and Beckenbaugh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412443044">Munshy et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193412443044">Swanson et al. (1985)</xref> reported a net gain of 7° ROM in silicone implant arthroplasties in patients with osteoarthritis, which was not statistically significant. Similar results were shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412443044">Takigawa et al. (2004)</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412443044">Branam et al. (2007)</xref> compared the outcomes of silicone PIP joint arthroplasties with pyrolytic carbon SRAs in patients with osteoarthritis and concluded that both implants provided excellent pain relief, but that the results (including ROM) did not demonstrate superiority of one implant over another.</p>
<p>We have evolved a postoperative rehabilitation protocol for the Ascension PyroCarbon PIPJ arthroplasty that is less restrictive than the manufacturer’s guidelines and incorporates active and passive motion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412443044">Table 1</xref>). The mean postoperative lateral key and tripod pinch strengths in our series was about 7.5 kg and grip-strength was 15 kg. Unfortunately, we did not have any preoperative records to compare with the postoperative results. However, these strengths are comparable with those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412443044">Chung et al. (2009)</xref>, who demonstrated a significant improvement in postoperative grip strength.</p>
<p>There is an agreement that pain relief and patient satisfaction are generally good after pyrocarbon PIP joint SRA. Our results are consistent with this finding. Patients who were unhappy with the appearance of the treated digit in our series were often dissatisfied with this preoperatively too, so surgery probably did not lead to deterioration in cosmesis.</p>
<p>The most common complication in our series was flexion contracture. We used the dorsal approach to the PIP joint. Some surgeons prefer the flexor approach to avoid disrupting the extensor mechanism, which may lead to extensor tendon adherences with consequent flexion deformities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412443044">Duncan et al., 2009</xref>). Others use a lateral surgical approach, especially for silicone implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412443044">Segalman, 2007</xref>). Intermittent squeaking occurred in four fingers, which seemed to be related to extreme flexion at the PIP joint; however, patients were tolerant of this. Radiographs revealed lucency around the implant stem in three patients; however, there were no clinical consequences. There was also development of osteophytes on the palmar aspect of the distal end of the proximal phalanx in three patients. This may be due to ongoing osteoarthritis in these patients.</p>
<p>The results of this retrospective study have demonstrated excellent pain relief and a functional ROM with acceptable complications after a minimum follow-up of 3 years in a series of 24 PIP joints treated using the Ascension PyroCarbon SRA. Complications such as implant migration, loosening, and progressive stiffness have been reported and we acknowledge that longer term results are required. However, from our mid-term results, we feel that Ascension PyroCarbon arthroplasties provide an alternative treatment option, as opposed to typical silicone implant arthroplasties, in patients with symptomatic digital joints and high functional demands.</p>
