<p>I remember the last time I heard someone say grace in a restaurant. My husband and I were at Applebee’s in rural Southern Virginia 2 years ago where I was working on a research project. When we sat down, a couple a few tables down from us bowed their heads, clasped hands, and gave thanks to God. They then ate their dinner and sang gospel songs on the restaurant’s karaoke machine. Reading Putnam and Campbell’s book <italic>American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us</italic> (2010), I immediately thought back to this moment and the way that this public display of grace was a signal of who those other diners might be and who my husband and I are.</p>
<p>In <italic>American Grace</italic>, Robert Putnam and David Campbell use the saying of grace before a meal as an illustration of how differences in religiosity present themselves in actual ritual, and they find that the saying of grace “predicts many other [religious] attitudes and behaviors . . . [and] has a strong connection to one’s partisan politics” (p. 10). They argue that whether you say grace before dinner is reflective of who you are in many other ways, and that by understanding dinner grace you can begin to understand the shifting role of religion in American life over the last 50 years. Using a wide variety of survey data from their own <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764012442817">Faith Matters Survey (2010)</xref>, from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0899764012442817">General Social Survey (2010)</xref>, as well as a series of “vignettes” that closely examine specific congregations through field work and in-depth interviews, Putnam and Campbell offer two main findings in their extensive work. First, they argue that religion in the United States over this time period has been affected by a series of shocks and aftershocks that have left Americans deeply divided, religiously and politically. Second, they argue that although these shocks have left Americans <italic>divided</italic>, they have not left us <italic>segregated</italic>. Instead, Putnam and Campbell argue that although religion is a good predictor of partisan politics, religion in the United States is also “highly fluid [and] religions compete, adapt, and evolve as individual Americans freely move from one congregation to another, and even from one religion to another” (p. 4). Thus, according to their analysis, Americans find themselves in a seemingly contradictory position, one in which young Americans are constantly exposed to other people with beliefs different from their own, leaving them more accepting of religious diversity, and more religiously tolerant than any previous generation. However, they “have increasingly sorted themselves out religiously according to their moral and political views, leaving both the liberal, secular pole and the conservative, evangelical pole strengthened and the moderate religious middle seriously weakened” (p. 132). So while Americans tolerate the religions of others because of exposure, they choose to spend more and more time with people who are like themselves both religiously and politically.</p>
<p>To understand how this has occurred, Putnam and Campbell examine the following shocks and aftershocks over the last 50 years in American religious life. First, the sexual revolution in the 1960s shook the foundations of American life, creating a new secular American that easily disposed with religious concerns. The second shock, or what they describe as an “aftershock,” was the birth of the modern evangelical movement, a response to counter what many evangelical Protestants viewed as American moral decay brought on by the sexual revolution. This aftershock began in the late 1970s and began its decline in the 1990s (something I would contend with). The final shock was the response, largely by younger Americans, to the increasing presence of evangelical religion in politics. These three shocks have sent Americans on a trajectory away from mainline Protestant religion (such as Lutherans and Presbyterians) and toward a new direction in American religion that, like many other things in American life, is divided between two groups, with a vast middle in between that is often hard to characterize. Putnam and Campbell argue that these shocks and aftershocks have had considerable impact on American political life, social policy, and religious practices shaping a new religious frontier where two groups now dominate: “nones” and evangelicals. In light of recent Pew Data showing the amount of money religious organizations use to lobby congress as being in the hundreds of millions every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764012442817">Pew Research Center, 2011</xref>), the disconnect and adversarial nature of the role of religion in politics is something that needs more research. Religion has always played a key role in American politics. There is no social movement in the United States that does not have either its roots or key allies in some religious tradition. However, what Putnam and Campbell find is that these shocks have created significant and perhaps insurmountable cleavages between what Putnam and Campbell see as tolerant, but much more secular youth, and the conservative, highly religious evangelicals. Reading their data, it is impossible to not come to the conclusion that these demographic shifts will continue to grow and shape policy and political debates, creating two Americas that see the role of religion as either <italic>central</italic> to American way of existence or <italic>antithetical</italic> to it.</p>
<p>Putnam and Campbell’s impressive array of survey data, along with some qualitative illustrations, is a welcome addition to the sociology of religion. The book’s comprehensive examination of the last 30 years of shifts and changes in American religious life, along with its easy to understand explanations of differences in religious affiliation and denomination, make it an essential read for those starting out their investigation into American religion. This book (or segments of it) would be an excellent text for undergraduate-level courses that examine the relationship between religion and politics, religion and social service, and religion and community. In addition, graduate-level courses in political science, sociology, and public policy may find the book useful when examining the role of religion in politics.</p>
<p>Although I find their overriding argument and claims exactly right, there are two issues that should be addressed. At the end, they conclude that while there are important differences in American religious practices, the overriding commitment to pluralism will keep these differences from creating insurmountable religious divisions. While this may be true to a certain extent, they tend to gloss over important differences between religious traditions. For example, why do some religious groups encourage saying grace at dinner and in public while others do not? Second, and this issue I believe is part of a larger problem, is the lack of attention to lived religion or how faith transcends belief and doctrine, and becomes part of daily life. The vignette series does not get at the complexity of how religion matters in most people’s everyday interactions. However, the extensive data presented here leave a welcome opportunity to explore their claims through in-depth field research and qualitative interviews.</p>
<p>They conclude the book by emphasizing that religion will always be a part of America and that many Americans appreciate its religious diversity. As Americans are constantly exposed to people of other religions, whether through family, friends, or the community, they argue that our religious melting pot will continue to flourish. “As Americans have come to live by, make friends with, and wed people of other religions, their overlapping social relationships have made it difficult to sustain interreligious hostility” (p. 550). This is how Putnam and Campbell believe the United States has handled the issue of religious pluralism and religious polarization and it is what they call “America’s grace” (p. 550).</p>
