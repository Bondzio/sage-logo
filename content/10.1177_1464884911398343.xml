<abstract>
<p>This article investigates whether Roger Silverstone’s notion of ‘proper distance’ provides the conceptual tools which are needed to assess the qualitative nature of radio listeners’ responses to mediated representations of suffering – a vital issue in radio research, given the dependence of most critical theory about journalistic depictions of suffering on ideas of the visual.</p>
<p>Specifically, it seeks to address practitioners’ and theorists’ concerns about the impact of framing on audience reactions, by using an audience study to examine whether beginning a series of packages of the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo with a ‘human interest’ interview generated different kinds of responses to those generated when other kinds of framing methods were used. The series, which was broadcast on BBC Radio Four’s <italic>Today</italic> programme, produced one of the greatest volumes of audience response in the programme’s history.</p>
<p>But rather than recommending ‘proper distance’ as the best theoretical tool with which to explore this phenomenon, this article advocates caution: questioning the ‘workability’ of Silverstone’s ideas, their cross-cultural applicability, and their sensitivity to empirical evidence about radio listening.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Roger Silverstone’s notion of ‘proper distance’ appears to have great potential for radio researchers: holding out the possibility of discussing the stances taken by media producers and audiences towards the mediation of suffering without recourse to visually orientated theory. This prospect should be particularly exciting for researchers of radio <italic>news</italic>, as most critical work about news representations of suffering has been heavily dependent on ideas of the spectacle and the gaze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911398343">Chouliaraki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911398343">Ignatieff, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884911398343">Seaton, 2005</xref>). So it’s surprising that ‘proper distance’ has not yet been explored in relation to radio news, particularly since Silverstone began <italic>Media and Morality</italic> by praising an item on BBC Radio Four’s <italic>The World At One</italic> programme (2007: 2).</p>
<p>Given the lack of critical attention usually paid to radio, the temptation is to seize upon ‘proper distance’ immediately – and with a degree of glee at one’s field being noticed by such a prestigious media scholar. Yet to do so would be pre-emptive because the explanatory power of ‘proper distance’ as regards radio is as yet untested. As a Critical Realist, I would argue that an integral part of this testing should be an examination of how well ‘proper distance’ ‘fits’ the realities of radio production and reception, in terms of its ability to offer insights into patterns of perception and action which <italic>could</italic> actually take place, and/or which <italic>do</italic> actually take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884911398343">Wright, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the enormity of such a project, this article will focus on one particular area: radio reception. It begins by outlining ‘proper distance’ to readers unfamiliar with the term, before considering whether attaining this stance would be possible for radio producers or audiences within the context of Silverstone’s vision of a transnational ‘mediapolis’ – paying particular attention to the impact of imbalances of power and the diversity of media production and reception practices around the world. It then moves on to evaluate whether Silverstone succeeds in justifying his prescription of ‘proper distance’ as the only moral stance to the mediation of suffering via human rights discourse. Finally, it explores Silverstone’s claim that ‘proper distance’ be regarded as both a ‘descriptive’ and a ‘normative’ term (2002: 6), by discussing whether indications of ‘proper distance’ were found within an audience study of a much more circumscribed group of radio listeners, and whether ‘proper distance’ was able to offer feasible ways forward regarding moral and professional dilemmas this instance of radio production/reception threw up.</p>
<sec id="section2-1464884911398343">
<title>Practice-based Inspiration</title>
<p>The dilemma which prompted this article was brought to my attention by a former colleague, Mike Thomson, who is the foreign correspondent for BBC Radio Four’s <italic>Today</italic> programme (interview with author, 30 April 2008). He was delighted by the high volume of audience correspondence following the broadcast of a series of his on the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in May 2007, and particularly by the way in which so many had written about their desire to ‘help’.</p>
<p>The item which garnered the most audience attention in this respect was a ‘human interest’ interview with a Congolese woman (Zawadi Mongane), who survived being kidnapped by local militia (broadcast 11 May 2007). But although Thomson was pleased by the emotional closeness which listeners said they experienced to Mongane (saying that ‘it was like she had fallen down right in front of them’), he confessed that he was also ‘a bit troubled’ by the way in which some of them seemed to only feel responsible for Mongane – rather than for the thousands of Congolese civilians suffering alongside her.</p>
<p>So Thomson wanted to know if the way in which he framed the follow-up series in 2008 – beginning with the Mongane interview on the Monday, rather than ending with it on the Friday, as he did in 2007 – would help <italic>Today</italic>’s audience pay more attention to other, more contextually-based items in the series. He also wanted to know whether it would help listeners to attend in a different way, gaining more informed perspectives without losing their desire to ‘actually do something’ in response. He thought it would, arguing that:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>You say to people there’s no law in the Congo and they’ll say, ‘Well, I can see why that would be’. But you show people <italic>what it might be like to live like that</italic> – then they understand what it means. Then later you can go on to do other pieces about why there’s no justice in Congo and so on and it just – it sits differently.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Given the critical description of radio as a ‘flow’, which has a cumulative influence on listeners over a period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911398343">Crisell, 1994</xref>), the nature and volume of audience responses to the Congo pieces, and Silverstone’s stress on the purpose of ‘proper distance’ in creating and sustaining a ‘duty of care, obligation and responsibility as well as understanding’ (2007: 47), Thomson’s questions about how best to frame a weekly series seemed to provide a reasonable basis for investigating the existence of ‘proper distance’.</p>
<p>In addition, by blending journalistic and academic concerns, such an investigation has wider repercussions for journalism studies, as it explores ‘how practice, and the perspectives of practitioners’ might influence theoretical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911398343">Greenberg, 2007</xref>: 295–6) in three significant ways. First, it uses Thomson’s typo - professional/moral dilemma as the springboard to academic research. Secondly, it draws upon his ‘working theories’ alongside Silverstone’s academic theories, in order to construct the conceptual framework of this study. And finally, it uses empirical evidence about reception practices to critique, and suggest modifications to, a specific academic theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884911398343">Layder, 1998</xref>: 19–40).</p>

<title>Considering ‘proper distance’</title>
<p>‘Proper distance’ is (properly speaking) not <italic>one</italic> concept, but a dense network of several: any author attempting to introduce it to those unfamiliar with Silverstone’s work thus runs the risk of treating it reductively. Nevertheless, it <italic>is</italic> possible to outline some of the central features of ‘proper distance’ in terms of three interlinking ‘stages’. The first, involving the <italic>apprehension</italic> of suffering, was portrayed by Silverstone as a form of ‘co-production’ between media producers and audiences with both working together to create ‘meaning’ (2007: 38, 107–8). The purpose of this active emotional and imaginative involvement was, he argued, to make the experiences of those suffering ‘appear’ in mediated form; thus creating a sense of ‘proximity’ between audiences and those suffering far away (2007: 25–9). But he didn’t think that ‘closer’ was ‘better’: insisting that media producers/audiences needed to maintain enough critical ‘distance’ to recognize the differences of those represented, including their personal agency (2007: 80–105), in order to avoid the ‘cultural neo-imperialism’ of assuming that others are just ‘like us’, or at least, ‘that they can be made to be like us’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464884911398343">Silverstone, 2002</xref>: 284).</p>
<p>The second stage, <italic>deliberation</italic>, was depicted by Silverstone as involving media producers and audiences contemplating the contexts relevant to the particular case of suffering portrayed, including those of its mediation (2007: 120–2) and alternative views on the situation (2007: 47). The purpose of this, he claimed, was to reach a more ‘generalised’, political perspective (2007: 131), although it is somewhat unclear what Silverstone thought the nature and scope of such a ‘generalisation’ should be. What <italic>is</italic> clear is that Silverstone thought that media producers’ and audiences’ ‘generalisations’ should lead them to evaluate the kinds of action they could take in response, in the spirit of a sustained ‘duty of care, obligation and responsibility’ towards suffering others (2007: 47). He then portrayed actually taking action - rather than just thinking about it- as the final component of ‘proper distance’. But not just any kind of action: Silverstone asserted that only <italic>public</italic> actions would suffice, since ‘the space of appearance only has meaning, only has effectiveness, when human beings think, speak and act in relation to each other, for each other’ (2007: 38).</p>
<p>The construct of ‘proper distance’ thus draws on a rich body of theoretical work, including Boltanski’s differentiation of publicly orientated ‘pity’ from private ‘compassion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911398343">1999</xref>: 184–5), Derrida’s notion of ‘hospitality’ towards ‘the strange and the stranger’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398343">2002</xref>), and Arendt’s reworking of Kantian ideas about the moral function of the imagination, as well as her vision of the ‘polis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911398343">1998</xref>). But Silverstone’s vision differs from Arendt’s, in particular, in terms of his guarded optimism about the possibility of mediation operating as a politically aware space – a ‘mediapolis’ (2007: 29–35). For even though Silverstone accepted that mediated ‘space’ couldn’t be truly global, because of its inaccessibility to non-elites; it couldn’t be united, because of the different publics and platforms involved; and engagement in it couldn’t be conducted on equal terms, because of the internal and external structures of power which inevitably shape the media industry (2007: 186), he asserted that it <italic>could</italic> still offer an arena in which audiences could encounter unfamiliar voices and alternative viewpoints, in order to make better decisions about cross-cultural action (2007: 29–35).</p>
<p>However, although Silverstone was not alone in insisting that the processes of mediation needn’t cripple media producers’ or audiences’ responses to suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911398343">Frosh and Pinchevski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884911398343">Seaton, 2005</xref>), his proposal is questionable on a number of counts. Firstly, although he mentioned the impact of real-world power imbalances on some people’s ability to access the media (2007: 136), he failed to consider how seriously this might affect the media’s ability to include ‘unfamiliar voices’ and ‘alternative viewpoints’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464884911398343">Tester, 2010</xref>: 43–6). Secondly, he avoided addressing the lack of editorial control which marginalized peoples have over how they are represented, even when they are given ‘access’ to the media (2010: 43–6). Thirdly, in stressing the transnational nature of the ‘mediapolis’, Silverstone failed to consider <italic>which</italic> media (and by implication, which media producers and audiences) he was talking about: tacitly privileging ‘high modern’ forms of journalism over more local and/or indigenous frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884911398343">Karppinen, 2008</xref>: 29). Thus Silverstone exhibited a curious lack of critical ‘distance’ from his own assumptions as a member of a wealthy, British elite.</p>
<p>Indeed, although Silverstone insisted on the need to welcome plurality, he repeatedly failed to consider the ways in which the responses of media producers and audiences are simultaneously made possible and constrained by particular ‘position-practice systems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911398343">Bhaskhar, 1979</xref>: 40–1). Such systems include those pertaining to specific kinds of media, specific kinds of media organizations, media genres, narrative frames, and even particular programmes. These are both materially situated, having political and economic dimensions, and culturally situated within specific social traditions and linguistic frameworks. Up to a point, Silverstone seems to have been aware that this might cause problems for his thesis, remarking that:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The media ….both construct a world, and are constructed within and by that world. And of course the world is plural not singular. The world as it appears on Al-Arabiya is different from that on CNN … Experience, both mediated and non-mediated, is culturally specific. (2007: 6)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>But he then omitted to follow his own argument through by considering whether this invalidates his notion of a single ‘mediapolis’, and of ‘proper distance’ as the only moral stance towards mediated representations of suffering.</p>
<p>This is not to somehow imply that all forms of morality are culturally relative and therefore equally valid, nor is it to deny that suffering itself has a reality independent of our social constructions of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884911398343">Wright, 2011</xref>). Rather, it is to stress that our knowledge about others’ suffering, as well as our understandings of how we should or could respond, does not exist independently of our location within specific cultural, political and economic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884911398343">Wright, 2011</xref>). So media producers’ and audiences’ attitudes and actions towards the representations of suffering can be evaluated as a series of (conscious or unconscious) choices, which relate to underlying social mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911398343">Archer, 2003</xref>), including the norms of media production and reception, and the specific media texts in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884911398343">Toynbee, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Omitting a more detailed discussion of the interrelatedness of social structure and individual agency leads Silverstone to adopt an untenable position: dismissing <italic>all</italic> of those who do not respond to the mediation of suffering in a manner consistent with ‘proper distance’ as ‘deferring their responsibility’ and even participating in ‘denial’ (2007: 130). This presumes a coherence of media production and reception practices across diverse locations, as well as a mass, cross-cultural consensus about the nature and extent of media audiences’ ‘responsibility’ towards suffering others – none of which exist.</p>
<p>The root of the latter problem stems from Silverstone’s articulation of ‘proper distance’ within the conceptual framework of social justice and cosmopolitanism (2007: 144–55), locating it within a particular strand of human rights theory concerned with discourse ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911398343">Benhabib, 2006</xref>), and ‘information flow’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884911398343">MacBride, 1980</xref>). But his notion of the ‘right’ to participate in ‘a global system of mediated communication’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911398343">Silverstone, 2007</xref>: 147) – as well the accompanying ‘obligation to listen’ (2007: 14) – is founded on shaky theoretical ground. For in common with other positive rights, it lacks specificity: too many people can be seen to have had these rights violated and too many can be argued to be violators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911398343">Easterly, 2009</xref>). Moreover, no mechanisms exist with which to enforce any such obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911398343">Ignatieff, 2001</xref>). Normative ideas about positive rights must therefore rely on their general discursive authority: a serious problem given that human rights discourse itself is contested by some Islamic and Asian groups who argue that it naturalizes northern/western individualism, and conflates morality with liberal, democratic, and interventionist, forms of politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911398343">Ignatieff, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to this general problem with positive rights, there are specific problems attendant on the idea of a ‘right’ to participate in ‘a global system of mediated communication’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911398343">Silverstone, 2007</xref>: 147). For not only would many bounded political and/or religious communities view some, or all, kinds of media participation as corrupting or dangerous rather than a ‘substantive good’ (2007: 147), even those which are positively inclined towards media participation would have a hard job arguing that it directly affects an individual’s well-being in the same way as the right to clean water, for instance, or to a family life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Silverstone’s articulation of ‘rights’ within the context of ‘responsibility’ which is substantive (for others as well as for one’s own actions) and undiscriminating (being equally responsible for all) would be impossible to achieve in the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884911398343">Dayan, 2007</xref>: 117). For how could media producers shoulder the phenomenal workload this would involve, let alone justify such costs to their shareholders or licence fee payers? And how could audience members find the time and energy to respond to every mediated representation of suffering they encountered, amongst the demands of daily living? Such a stance makes no allowance for other priorities or prior commitments – for real life, in other words.</p>
<p>It would be far better to openly admit that if journalists’ and audiences’ attention is to be gained by the prospect of mediated suffering at all, it can only be gained in a patchy and inconsistent manner: depending on a range of inter-related factors, including the appeal of particular narrative forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911398343">Ignatieff, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884911398343">Seaton, 2005</xref>), and their capacity to shape audiences’ ‘dispositions’ to feel, think and act in particular ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884911398343">Chouliaraki, 2008</xref>). Finally, it must be stressed that the ability of media producers and audiences to respond to the suffering of those far away on an individual basis is extremely limited. <italic>Collective</italic> action has a much greater potential to exert such influence, and this usually occurs via mediating bodies like national governments, the United Nations and International Non-Governmental Organisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911398343">Shue, 1988</xref>) – although such bodies often have objectives which don’t conform to moral ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884911398343">Natsios, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, if ‘proper distance’ is to be effective then it must be located in the context of particular social groups with a better chance than others of influencing these mediating bodies. It must also be located in the context of groups likely to share Silverstone’s assumptions about the nature of an individual’s ‘responsibility’ vis-a-vis the mediation of suffering. Such groups are most likely to be found amongst the privileged elite of wealthy, European and North American countries, so any search for indicators of ‘proper distance’ needs to be conducted within the confines of <italic>their</italic> imagined, sporadic (and more or less one-sided) ‘relationships’ to less powerful, suffering groups, as they emerge from, and feed back into, specific practices of media production and reception.</p>

<title>Considering listening to <italic>Today</italic></title>
<p>Listeners to <italic>Today</italic>, BBC Radio Four’s flagship news programme, certainly qualify as such an elite group, as they are predominantly male, white, of AB socio-economic status and based in the wealthy south-east of England.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464884911398343">1</xref></sup> In addition, the programme itself has long been considered a bastion of political power, setting the news agenda for the rest of the media, and holding policy-makers to account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911398343">Hendy, 2007</xref>: 324). So the decision to broadcast an interview with Zawadi Mongane, a low-status, ‘stranger’ from the DRC, was highly unusual – particularly since Mongane’s interpreted voice<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464884911398343">2</xref></sup> did not just feature in a brief clip, but ran for five minutes and nine seconds of an eight-minute 50-second sequence, as the lead item in the most popular half-hour of the show (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911398343">Luckhurst, 2001</xref>: 75). Moreover, during this time, she was allowed to exhibit a remarkable degree of agency and difference: detailing her choices, moral beliefs and political judgements – the full range of ‘voice’ as defined by Chouliaraki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911398343">2006</xref>: 89).</p>
<p>However, <italic>Today</italic> listeners’ responses to such a representation are bound to be shaped by the norms of radio reception in the UK, which involve an almost mirror-reflection of the potential moral disadvantages Silverstone ascribed to television reception. For if TV creates <italic>too much</italic> ‘distance’, with the screen separating the ‘secular’ space of the audience from the ‘sacred’ space of the TV text, so that its contents don’t permeate their domestic lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911398343">Silverstone, 2007</xref>: 20–21), then radio may be in danger of creating <italic>too little</italic> ‘distance’, precisely because of its penetration into listeners’ domestic lives. For, as an invisible medium, radio tends to play in the background: fitting in with listeners’ daily rhythms through the careful choice of tone, pace and format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911398343">Scannell, 1986</xref>) and structuring their everyday routines. As former <italic>Today</italic> Editor, Tim Luckhurst, recounts there was always a flood of complaints if anticipated items were late because:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… the end of the 7.00am news bulletin is time to get out of bed; if one has not shaved before the 7.25 sports report, the children are likely to be late for school; and the second piece of toast must be consumed before the end of ‘Thought for the Day’. (2001: 76)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Certainly, the tendency of radio to envelope listeners in sound, so that its content almost ‘sneaks under the radar’ of conscious thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911398343">Crisell, 1994</xref>: 224), doesn’t seem conducive to the robust critical judgement necessary for ‘proper distance’.</p>
<p>However, more active forms of radio reception may have greater potential for the production of ‘proper distance’ than television reception. For Silverstone claimed that TV’s focus on outward, visual representation prevented viewers from comprehending others’ experience in a more imaginative way, through their narratives (2007: 21, 46), and radio is often celebrated for using its listeners’ imaginations to ‘fill in the blanks’ of what they cannot see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884911398343">Valkenburg and Beetjes, 1997</xref>). Unfortunately, as far as ‘proper distance’ is concerned, far from enabling narrative-based encounters with ‘strangers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911398343">Silverstone, 2007</xref>: 46), such active forms of radio listening usually serve to foster imagined relationships with regular presenters, or with radio itself-which is often portrayed by listeners as a kind of ‘friend’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884911398343">Shanahan, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This ‘friendship’ depends on the regular fulfilment of audience desires for consistency and familiarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884911398343">Shanahan, 2002</xref>), which are thought to be heightened at times when listeners may feel more vulnerable. As veteran <italic>Today</italic> presenter, Sue McGregor, put it, she was always careful to respect ‘the intimacy of it’, as radio is ‘a companion to you in the early morning’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911398343">Luckhurst, 2001</xref>: 78). So any <italic>Today</italic> journalist would have their work cut out for them if they wished to make the sufferings of those in the DRC ‘present’ for their audience, without their being rejected for being too strange (a problem of too much ‘distance’), or assimilated, so that their agency and difference were erased (a problem of too little ‘distance’).</p>
<p>Since <italic>Today</italic> is a flagship news programme, journalists would also face the additional problem of how to articulate coverage of suffering in the DRC as news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911398343">Galtung and Ruge, 1965</xref>). In the past, British journalists have tended to adopt one of two strategies towards long-running conflicts on the continent. First, they have tended to only cover them during peaks of violence which fulfil the news criteria of ‘frequency’, as well as providing arresting images and/or actuality. Second, they have focussed on the news value of ‘personalisation’, often focussing entirely on one individual, by using a ‘human interest’ frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911398343">Franks, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911398343">Marthoz, 2007</xref>). Both strategies lend themselves to the erasure of difference, agency and context which Silverstone associated with too little ‘distance’: with infrequent coverage often leading to stereotypical ‘victim’ imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911398343">Franks, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911398343">Marthoz, 2007</xref>) and ‘human interest’ frames diverting attention from broader, political issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911398343">Dunn, 2003</xref>). A study of print journalism also suggested that ‘human interest’ frames may result in poor information recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884911398343">Valkenburg et al., 1999</xref>), which would hamper listeners’ ability to deliberate on any contexts which <italic>are</italic> given – creating another serious problem for ‘proper distance’. So the framing of the Mongane piece as a ‘human interest’ story, together with existing norms of news production and radio reception, seems likely to predispose <italic>Today</italic>’s audience to experience far more ‘closeness’ than ‘distance’ to the kind/s of suffering represented – which could be problematic for the production of ‘proper distance’.</p>
<p>But when Silverstone’s theory was explained to Mike Thomson at the end of this study, he didn’t agree that this was necessarily a problem, arguing that Silverstone’s stress on the acknowledgement of difference might ‘in some ways be the enemy of good journalism’, by preventing listeners’ ability to relate to speakers. However, when Thomson had described what he wanted to achieve originally, he did not phrase it in terms of how much he wanted the audience to discover how <italic>like</italic> them Mongane was, but <italic>what it would be like to be</italic> Mongane – a very different moral stance, and one far more in keeping with ‘proper distance’. As he put it:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Some people know that Africans are suffering and it’s just … they think it’s what people in Africa <italic>do –</italic> as if they’re used to it somehow. But if someone had killed half your family and tried to rape you … well, you wouldn’t be used to it, would you?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In addition, by embedding the Mongane interview within a two-way between himself and the presenter, Thomson ensured that the audience was exposed to a number of different contexts, including more general details of the impact of the DRC conflict on civilians; the editorial decisions which went into the construction of the piece (such as what was edited out and why), and potential difficulties involved in the reception of the piece (discussed as the difficulty of ‘imagining oneself’ in Mongane’s position). That sequence was then situated within a weekly series on the DRC, which included packages containing other voices (such as politicians, aid workers, and former militia members), and since the average <italic>Today</italic> listener tunes in three to four times a week, for an average of 75 minutes on a weekday, they were likely to have been exposed to at least some of these other items.</p>
<p>Therefore Thomson’s values-in-action, as well as his original reflections-on-action, indicate that his initial intentions had significant parallels with ‘proper distance’. Nevertheless, these intentions may well have been undercut by the lack of critical ‘distance’ attendant on the norms of producing news about Africa, particularly the use of ‘human interest’ frames; the lack of ‘distance’ attendant on passive modes of radio reception; and listeners’ desires to encounter familiarity, rather than strangeness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1464884911398343">
<title>Trying to map ‘proper distance’ empirically</title>
<p>Although the processes of mediation and the nature of media texts shape radio listeners’ ‘dispositions’ to feel, think and act in particular ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884911398343">Chouliaraki, 2008</xref>), they don’t <italic>determine</italic> them: so it is necessary to investigate the interaction of listeners’ individual agency with these preceding structures. As this is uncharted critical territory in radio, a pilot study was designed which used empiricist indicators to try and locate some of the ways in which ‘proper distance’ may (or may not) have been ‘co-produced’ between radio text/s and listeners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911398343">Silverstone, 2007</xref>: 107–108), in order to inform future research. Although the complexity and open-endedness of society militates against such indicators ‘proving’ anything definitively, it was hoped that, by exposing focus groups to contrasting frames, ‘demi-regularities’ would emerge which might allow me to ‘plausibly infer that significant causes are at work’ (Lawson, 1998, as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884911398343">Toynbee, 2008</xref>: 268).</p>
<p>Specifically, this study used Thomson’s questions about framing to construct three contrasting focus groups: one which would hear the Mongane piece first in a series of packages (Group A), one which would hear it last (Group B), and one which would only hear more contextual packages (Group C), in order to assess general cumulative impact. This allowed for an investigation of whether Thomson was right that participants would pay more attention to subsequent reports on the Congo, if they heard the Mongane interview first, as well as whether their apprehensions, deliberations and actions would be <italic>qualitatively</italic> different. Listeners’ responses were then evaluated against Silverstone’s criteria of ‘proper distance’, and the data which were thus produced were used to examine the validity of ‘proper distance’ as a conceptual framework.</p>
<p>As this study is an exploratory pilot, a small sample was needed, and as a small sample couldn’t be representative, participants were sought who fitted the profile of a typical <italic>Today</italic> listener. Typicality was determined by how often and for how long listeners tuned in, as well certain theoretically significant factors. These were:</p>
<list id="list1-1464884911398343" list-type="bullet">

<p>Volunteers were sought from professional organizations, ‘The Voice of the Listener and Viewer’, and community, educational and business organizations in south-east London, where I live. Numbers were then increased by snowballing, although those gained in this way were separated into different focus groups. The final sample size decided upon was 6:6:6, because of the amount of work involved in participating. Those likely to be influenced by professional knowledge, such as journalists, development or foreign policy-workers, and academics in related fields were not considered, as well as those who knew me personally. Although personal experience of the DRC would also influence responses, asking this question before the study would have prompted listeners to pay more attention to Thomson’s reports; so this question was asked <italic>after</italic> the study was completed. One participant was excluded for this reason.</p>
<p>The packages used in this audience study were drawn from <italic>Today</italic>’s 2007 series<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464884911398343">3</xref></sup> because it was so unusual editorially, because it generated such a massive audience response, and because it was the stimulus to Thomson’s questions about framing. It was also broadcast over a year from the start of the study, so it had the dual advantage of being sufficiently long ago that subjects were likely to have forgotten the exact details of the reports, but not to be ‘old news’ – violence in the Congo was sadly still ongoing at the time of writing. The 2007 series also allowed for study consistency, as all the pieces were similar lengths: something which is unusual in a series, as studio-producers often take one of any number of ‘pot-cuts’ whilst on air, according to breaking news and the duration of live items. The packages in the 2007 series were also very similar structurally: beginning with clips of Congolese civilians before broadening out into context. The duration and type of actuality used was also similar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464884911398343">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Subjects were posted three numbered CDs containing 15-minute excerpts of <italic>Today</italic>, beginning with the DRC pieces and followed by two other items on unrelated, domestic issues. Time-checks were deleted, so that they were not prompted to pay more attention to ‘lead’ items. Subjects were then asked to listen to the CDs on consecutive weekdays, beginning with CD 1 on Wednesday. The CDs each group were given are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884911398343">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>As the pieces were designed to be self-contained, changing the order should not have affected listeners’ cognitive understanding. However, packages did differ in emotional intensity. The 8 May 2007 package included refugees’ accounts of trying to dispose of corpses; the 9 May 2007 piece dealt with a family’s inability to afford to send their children to school; and the 10 May 2007 piece provided an introduction to the main themes of the Mongane piece (11 May 2007) – legal impunity and the account of a female rape victim. This focus on an individual woman’s suffering could be expected to elicit the most intense emotional responses from audiences because of the cultural norm of women as ‘innocent’ victims in conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911398343">Hoijer, 2004</xref>). Therefore Group A listened to the reports in order of decreasing emotional intensity; Group B heard them in order of increasing emotional intensity; and Group C heard reports which followed an inverse bell curve of intensity.</p>
<p>Immediately after each CD, participants were asked to open a sealed envelope containing a questionnaire. Questionnaires were necessary because an interviewer’s presence would have disrupted normal listening behaviour and subjects had to complete tests regarding their retention of significant facts immediately after listening, in order to be consistent with related studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884911398343">Valkenberg and Beentjes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884911398343">Valkenberg et al., 1999</xref>). The questionnaires themselves incorporated several different methods, including five-point semantically enhanced scales, and seven-point ‘Inclusion of the Other in the Self’ diagrams – both of which are used in social psychology research into altruism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911398343">Batson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911398343">Cialdini et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The method of using multiple-choice questions to test factual retention was drawn from a related study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884911398343">Wulfemeyer and McFadden, 1985</xref>) and tailored to ‘proper distance’ by testing listeners’ retention of contextual information (i.e. details about the causes and contexts of the civil war, and its impact on Congolese people) and agency-orientated information (i.e. details about the Congolese subject’s choices or judgements). These categories were checked by a second coder, and questions designed by a panel of five news experts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1464884911398343">5</xref></sup> Pre-piloted multiple-choice questions were also used for listeners to indicate any actions they took, but a blank space was left for them to describe the factors which influenced their decision-making, in order to avoid limiting responses.</p>
<p>Ecological validity was sought by instructing participants to simulate ‘real’ radio listening by listening to CDs at the same time and in the same room as they would normally listen to <italic>Today</italic>, while continuing their normal activities. They were asked to pay no more attention to the CD than they normally would to <italic>Today</italic>, and to turn off if they wished. Because this study scenario was not observed, subjects may not have followed the guidelines exactly. In addition, there are potential theoretical problems with endeavouring to reconstruct a ‘phenomenon in context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884911398343">Robson, 1993</xref>: 52). However, as discussed earlier, it would be impossible to ensure the consistency of package durations in a real-time case study, so compromises had to be made.</p>
<p>All field-work was carried out within a three-week window (9–25 July 2008), which was determined by participants’ availability. It is worth noting that this was a period when increasing violence in Zimbabwe, following a rigged election, was prominent on the news agenda. This may be significant given findings about the correlations between news coverage of violent events in developing countries and audiences’ feelings of hopelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911398343">Philo, 2002</xref>: 186), although empirical studies of the longitudinal impact of negative news on TV audiences’ attention and memory have had mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911398343">Lang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884911398343">Newhagen and Reeves, 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>Audience apprehensions</title>
<p>Silverstone argued that the first stage of ‘proper distance’ involved the imagined ‘appearance’ of those suffering to the audience, accompanied by a recognition of their difference (2007: 1, 25–29). This is clearly dependent on radio listeners <italic>paying attention</italic> to the piece, rather than leaving it playing in the background of their domestic lives. Thomson believed that placing Mongane first in the series would result in listeners paying <italic>more</italic> attention overall, but unfortunately it was not possible to tell whether he was right about this. For although Group A did report that they paid more attention to the series than other groups, this could have been caused by their greater interest in African news (four participants cited this as a reason for their level of attention, compared with three each in Groups B and C). Certainly, Group A did not pay more attention to the Congo series than to other items on the CDs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884911398343">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>However, placing the Mongane interview first <italic>did</italic> prevent one of the major obstacles to listener attention, for listeners in Group B stressed how difficult it was to continue listening as the reports grew more and more emotionally intense. Indeed, two respondents in Group B switched off before the Mongane interview even began for exactly this reason. In contrast, only one listener from Group A turned the Mongane interview off, and she listened half-way through before becoming too distressed to continue. She also said she gave the item her maximum attention until then, as well as awarding the maximum score for how ‘close’ she felt to Mongane, and how ‘like’ her she thought she was. Participants did not switch off any other piece in the study.</p>
<p>Interestingly, all of those who turned off described their listening experience in terms of painfully close proximity, and even intrusion (‘having it shoved down my throat’, ‘like someone shouting in my ear’ or ‘like poking a sore’). But only the woman who heard Mongane first seemed to suffer from what Silverstone classed as too little ‘distance’, by identifying with Mongane so closely that she failed to recognize her differences (2002: 284). The ‘over-closeness’ described by the other participants seemed to have more to do with their anticipation of the combined effects of the ‘human interest’ frame, the enveloping nature of radio listening, and feeling vulnerable first thing in the morning. As one wrote:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>There is something deeply distressing to me about half-listening to individual testimony while eating breakfast, waking the kids up, doing make-up etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This finding suggests that Silverstone’s terminology needs refining if it is to be used in radio research, as it is necessary to differentiate between these separate, but potentially interlinked, forms of ‘closeness’.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, those who heard Mongane first (Group A) <italic>did</italic> show signs of experiencing the patterns of perception which Silverstone associated with too little ‘distance’. For they continued to think that the Congolese speakers were more ‘like them’ throughout the series than Group B, who seemed able to feel moderately ‘close’ to Congolese speakers, whilst remaining more aware of their differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464884911398343">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1464884911398343">2</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition, those who heard Mongane first remembered fewer details about her agency than those who heard her last, as well as fewer contextual facts – despite their greater interest in African affairs and higher rates of attention (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884911398343">Table 3</xref>). This may be significant as Silverstone saw the acknowledgement of others’ agency as crucial to the recognition of their difference (2007: 80–105), and the second stage of ‘proper distance’, deliberation, as involving the consideration of relevant contexts (2007: 47).</p>

<p>Finally, the group who performed worst of all in the memory tests was Group C, who only heard contextual packages. Although as this group, and those who heard Mongane first, had far more occasions when listeners were ‘out of earshot’ this is likely to have damaged their scores (four occasions each, compared with one for Groups A and B). So it is not possible to judge from these indicators alone whether Thomson was correct in hypothesizing that placing the Mongane interview first would result in listeners having <italic>qualitatively different</italic> responses to the rest of the series, in the sense of their being better able to retain the facts necessary to obtain ‘proper distance’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1464884911398343">
<title>Audience deliberations</title>
<p>Evidence about the nature of listeners’ deliberations was much more compelling. For although those who heard Mongane first were just as likely as those who heard her last to say they felt inclined to ‘do something’ in response to that specific interview, <italic>only one</italic> participant said she wanted to ‘do something’ in response to <italic>more</italic> than one report. This represents a ratio of 1:6 respondents, far lower than that found in other groups (2:4 remaining listeners in Group B and 3:5 in Group C).</p>
<p>Those who heard her <italic>first</italic> also <italic>did not</italic> consider a range of contexts in order to reach a more generalized political perspective, as Silverstone advocated (2007: 47, 131), as they only reflected upon their immediate thoughts and/or feelings. The woman who identified with Mongane had the most restricted deliberations of all, discussing the factors influencing her decision to ‘do something’ in purely personal and emotional terms (‘empathy, horror’ or ‘not very emotionally involved’). In contrast, those who heard Mongane <italic>last</italic> deliberated on a <italic>number</italic> of different personal and political contexts: spiralling outwards from what they had heard about the DRC, to personal memories of related experiences (such as interactions with Congolese students at their college or with family members who had spent time in Africa); and then on to an evaluation of different means of intervention (such as international diplomacy or aid work). Potential actions were then evaluated in the light of these considerations.</p>
<p>Finally, those who <italic>only</italic> heard contextual packages tended to focus on the ‘fit’ of the Congo pieces to the rest of the programme. For example, five commented on the ‘tastelessness’ of following one of the packages with a ‘lightweight’ item; three considered whether ‘in-depth’ pieces suited <italic>Today</italic>’s format and style; and one discussed the difficulty of making the DRC conflict ‘news’. Although these deliberations involved considering the context/s of mediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911398343">Silverstone, 2007</xref>: 120–122), their reactions were restricted to the ‘play’ of mediation itself, rather than resulting in wider, political perspectives, so they can’t be seen as evidence of ‘proper distance’ (2007: 130). Nevertheless, two participants in this group did seem to believe in the individual’s moral ‘duty’ to care and understand about others’ suffering (2007: 47) – although they also believed they had failed to live up to it. As one wrote:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I am amazed by how little I remembered … it’s really not good enough … [and] I am disappointed by my attitude too. Day by day I became less engaged with these people’s plight. Three days was just too much for me!</p>

<title>Audience actions</title>
<p>Emails were sent a month later to establish what participants had actually <italic>done</italic> following their exposure to Thomson’s series. This revealed that those who heard Mongane <italic>last</italic> carried out fewest ‘public actions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911398343">Silverstone, 2007</xref>: 38): one participant, compared with two in each of the other groups. But this doesn’t necessarily mean that they were poorest at attaining ‘proper distance’, as the kinds of actions all but one of the participants in other groups described were almost entirely self-focussed. For example, three talked to a friend or colleague about what it was like to participate in an academic study, and the woman who was distressed by the Mongane interview sought comfort from friends. The only participant who sought to ‘inform’ someone about the situation in the DRC was from Group B, who heard Mongane last.</p>
<p>This begs the question of whether public action is an appropriate measure of audiences’ morality. Indeed, those from Groups B and C whose reactions were closest to ‘proper distance’ in other ways put considerable effort into private actions – seeking out extra information, thinking more deeply, and paying more attention to subsequent media pieces on the DRC. Their reason for this was a wish to consider what would constitute what Seaton calls ‘effective remedial action’ (2005: 276), rather than, as one participant put it, a ‘knee-jerk reaction to make <italic>me</italic> feel better’. So it seems unfair of Silverstone to damn their lack of ‘public action’ as a deferral of real-world responsibility or ‘denial’ (2007: 130).</p>
<p>Indeed, such participants can be seen to have demonstrated considerably <italic>more</italic> commitment to engaging with real suffering than Silverstone did: for whereas he only conceptualized effective moral responses as ‘think[ing], speak[ing] and act [ing] in relation to each other, for each other’ (2007: 38), these radio listeners tried to consider how they might be able to influence the bodies which could alleviate the suffering of Congolese civilians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911398343">Shue, 1988</xref>), given their differing priorities and the potential disadvantages of intervention for the Congolese. For example, one respondent asserted that a ‘stronger intervention’ than aid was needed if civilians were to be protected, but that there was little point in lobbying his MP because the UK lacked strategic imperatives for involvement. He then wondered about how he could pressurize the UN, but thought that they were also unlikely to become more involved because of troop commitments elsewhere. Finally, he concluded by wondering whether additional military intervention might not cause additional problems for the Congolese, by making weaponry more available to local militia and causing tensions with neighbouring countries. Therefore the best this participant, and others like him, thought they could do was ‘keep informed’ in case there was anything they could do which might be effective in helping the Congolese in future.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>‘Proper distance’ is conceptually flawed by its location within Silverstone’s vision of a single, cross-cultural ‘mediapolis’, as well as by its inability to address the limitations of real-world engagement and action. There are also problems with attempting to apply ‘proper distance’ specifically to radio reception, because of its elision of audience members’ perceptions that those represented are ‘like’ them, with the intimacy involved in particular kinds of listening. Nevertheless, Silverstone’s work did permit a differentiation between the responses of <italic>Today</italic> listeners who heard a ‘human interest’ piece first and those who heard it last – thus addressing real practitioner concerns about the ‘framing’ of the series.</p>
<p>Specifically, those who heard the Mongane interview <italic>last</italic> exhibited some indicators of ‘proper distance’: imagining a relationship of moderate proximity to those suffering, whilst continuing to appreciate their difference and agency, and considering a greater number of relevant contexts. Such patterns could be argued to be of more potential benefit to those suffering in the DRC than others, as they resulted in measured deliberations about potential actions, while taking into account real-world restrictions and the possibility of unintended, political consequences.</p>
<p>In contrast, those who heard Mongane <italic>first</italic> demonstrated patterns of attitude or behaviour which Silverstone associated with too little ‘distance’: believing that Congolese speakers were more ‘like’ them, and failing to gain a broader political perspective because of their preoccupation with their immediate, emotional responses. One listener in particular was quite extreme in this regard: seeing little difference between herself and Mongane, becoming so emotionally overloaded that she had to turn the interview off, and only engaging in subsequent actions to console herself, rather than to address the suffering of the Congolese people.</p>
<p>This example, together with the responses of three other participants who engaged in self-focussed conversations, highlights the inadequacy of Silverstone’s reliance on ‘public action’ to define ‘morality’. In addition, Silverstone’s stress on the morality of ‘public action’ made it difficult to investigate the importance and meaning/s of listeners’ private activities, as well as failing to address their thoughts about the potential effectiveness of individual action. The most considered responses in this study were from those radio listeners who understood that they were not just ‘human beings’ thinking, speaking and acting in relation to other ‘human beings’, as Silverstone would have it (2007: 38). Instead, they portrayed their choices as being simultaneously enabled and limited by their positioning within certain groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911398343">Archer, 2003</xref>), as well by the nature and priorities of powerful mediating organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911398343">Shue, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>However, Silverstone’s depiction of audiences’ ‘responsibility’ towards suffering others as substantive and unlimited may still be of use to radio researchers, given some listeners’ disappointment regarding their <italic>lack</italic> of care and understanding – after all, even flawed ideas can still be crucial in determining why people think or behave the way they do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911398343">Danermark et al., 2002</xref>: 36–37). But the ability of ‘proper distance’ to offer ways forward to radio producers is more limited. For although beginning a series with a human interest piece seems to have resulted in less critically aware and more self-absorbed responses, placing it last may well lead to more listeners turning off. And there are few news journalists, and singularly few Managing editors, who would be willing to sacrifice a substantial slice of their audience share for a smaller number of more morally sophisticated listeners.</p>
