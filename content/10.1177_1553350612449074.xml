<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2004, Donnez et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612449074">1</xref></sup> removed an ovary from a patient with Hodgkin’s disease before chemotherapy was administered and cryopreserved it to preserve fertility; after treatment of the primary disease, the ovary was transplanted back into the patient, and spontaneous pregnancy was achieved. The slow tissue-freezing method was used in the early days, but later vitrification, which provides a higher tissue survival rate, was developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612449074">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612449074">3</xref></sup> We have already reported ovarian function after the retransplantation of a vitrified, warmed ovary using the latter method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612449074">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reduced-port surgery (RPS) has been attracting attention in recent years for being less invasive than conventional laparoscopic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612449074">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612449074"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612449074"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612449074"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612449074"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612449074">10</xref></sup> After obtaining approval from the ethics committee of our hospital, we conducted RPS, including single-port surgery, on 6 patients and cryopreserved the extracted ovaries before the patients received chemotherapy; at the same time, we obtained immature oocytes from the contralateral ovaries (to be left in situ) and also cryopreserved them.</p>
<p>For patients scheduled to undergo chemotherapy or radiotherapy, it is preferable that recovery from oophorectomy be as rapid as possible; therefore, we considered RPS to potentially be suitable for these patients. Here, we report our experience with RPS together with patient background information.</p>

<title>Outline of Cryopreservation of the Ovaries</title>
<p>In April 2010, our surgical plan was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital as “cryopreservation of ovaries from patients scheduled to undergo chemotherapy or radiotherapy that is likely to abolish their ovarian function and re-transplantation of the cryopreserved ovaries after completion of the scheduled therapy.” At the request of our patients, the fee for this treatment was borne by the patients themselves. One day after surgery, the patients were either discharged from the hospital or transferred to another hospital for treatment of their primary disease.</p>
<p>Because of concerns regarding tumor reimplantation at the time of ovary retransplantation, we excluded patients with systemic diseases, such as leukemia, selecting instead those with lymphoma, breast cancer, and so on. We also excluded patients with markedly reduced ovarian function resulting from age or treatments such as previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy for their primary diseases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1553350612449074">
<title>Surgical Techniques</title>
<p>Two-port surgery was conducted in 3 patients, and single-port surgery using a single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) Port (Covidien, MA) in 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612449074">Figure 1</xref>). Although we basically considered SILS to be preferable, we chose 2-port surgery for the first patient because she had early-stage disease. In addition, 2-port surgery, rather than single-port surgery, was selected for patients who had the complications of endometriosis and uterine myoma because difficulty during surgery, caused by adhesions and other factors, was anticipated.</p>

</fig>
<p>Two-port surgery was conducted according to a previously reported method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612449074">11</xref></sup> A 5-mm flexible scope (LTF type VP; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was used to secure the field of vision. This scope can be manipulated by a hand lever and can be bent at will up to 100° from side to side and up and down continuously. The peritoneal cavity was entered through the umbilical region using a closed approach. A 12-mm trocar was placed in the umbilical region, and a 5-mm flexible scope was inserted through the 12-mm trocar; then, under laparoscopy, a 5-mm trocar was inserted into the left inguinal region. Following these maneuvers, a flexible scope was inserted into the 5-mm trocar in the inguinal region. Then, while checking the umbilical region, a 5-mm trocar was inserted into the same surgical incision in such a way that the 5-mm trocar crossed the 12-mm trocar in the umbilical region. The surgeon stood on the left side of the patient and performed the operation, with his or her right hand using the 12-mm trocar in the umbilical region and with his or her left hand using the 5-mm trocar at the inguinal region. The assistant inserted a flexible scope through the 5-mm trocar in the umbilical region and manipulated the scope with his or her left hand to secure the field of vision by adjusting the angle of the scope as necessary. The assistant operated the uterine manipulator with his or her right hand as necessary.</p>
<p>The SILS port was used for single-port surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612449074">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612449074">12</xref></sup> The umbilicus was reversed, the midline was incised for 2 to 2.5 cm, and the open method was then used to place the SILS port so as to reach the peritoneal cavity. A 12-mm port and a 5-mm port were inserted into the SILS port, the field of vision was secured by a flexible scope as described above, and the surgeon and the assistant performed the operation essentially as in the case of 2-port surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612449074">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The field of vision was secured by pneumoperitoneum, and peritoneal cavity findings were confirmed. An 18-G Cathelin needle equipped with a syringe was directly inserted transabdominally to reach the ovary and into a small follicle on the ovarian surface; then, follicular fluid was recovered by aspiration through the syringe as with in vitro fertilization procedures. The recovered follicular fluid was mixed with a culture medium, and immature oocytes (germinal vesicle [GV]-stage oocytes) were collected from the resulting culture medium under microscopy and cryopreserved according to our method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612449074">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612449074">13</xref></sup></p>

<p>Oophorectomy was routinely performed in both 2-port surgery and SILS; that is, the ovary was extracted by severing the ovarian arteries and veins and the proper ligament of the ovary using a LigaSure Blunt Tip (Covidien, MA). The extracted ovary was carefully recovered with an Endo Catch through the incision in the umbilical region. The cortical membrane obtained from the recovered ovary was cryopreserved using the cryotissue method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612449074">2</xref></sup> as described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1553350612449074">
<title>Vitrification of the Ovarian Tissue</title>
<p>Vitrification of the ovarian tissue was performed using cryotissue as reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612449074">2</xref></sup> Briefly, slices 1-mm in thickness (12 mm × 12 mm) of the ovarian cortical tissues containing primordial and primary oocytes were peeled off and equilibrated in 7.5% ethylene glycol and 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide in handling medium (HEPES-buffered TCM-199 solution supplemented with 10% v/v synthetic serum substitute; Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) for 25 minutes followed by a second equilibration in 20% ethylene glycol, 20% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 0.5 M sucrose in handling medium (vitrification solution) for 15 minutes. Ovarian tissues were then placed with a minimum volume of vitrification solution onto a thin metal strip (Cryotissue; Kitazato BioPharma, Fujinomiya, Japan) and submerged directly into sterilized liquid nitrogen, following which the strip was inserted into a protective container and placed into a liquid nitrogen storage tank.</p>

<p>The surgical results for 6 patients are presented (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612449074">Table 1</xref>). The operative time and estimated blood loss were 39.7 minutes (17-57) and 8.6 mL (2-20), respectively. Although we did not perform retransplantation, all surgeries in this study were completed within 1 hour, and estimated blood loss was also less than 20 mL. The SILS procedures performed on 3 patients were both completed in about 30 minutes, and estimated blood loss in these 3 patients was less than 5 mL.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>For the purpose of preserving fertility, we cryopreserved the ova and ovaries of 6 patients scheduled to undergo chemotherapy or radiotherapy. All samples from these 6 patients remain cryopreserved and have not yet been retransplanted or used for in vitro fertilization. Nonetheless, we were successful in performing RPS, including SILS. Thanks to the low invasiveness of RPS, the chemotherapy schedules for primary diseases were not altered.</p>
<p>In most patients, not only the ovaries but also GV oocytes were simultaneously preserved. This is considered to be favorable for preservation of fertility potential. Cryopreservation of the ovaries is still a developing method; however, we performed this procedure with approval from the ethics committee of our hospital. We plan to retransplant the cryopreserved ovarian cortical membranes once treatments for the primary diseases of our patients have been completed.</p>
<sec id="section8-1553350612449074">
<title>Cryopreservation of the Ovary</title>
<p>Chemotherapy or radiotherapy is performed as part of the treatment for malignant tumors or hematological diseases; however, when anticancer drugs are systemically administered or the gonads are irradiated, adverse effects on reproductive function become a concern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612449074">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612449074">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612449074">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612449074"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612449074">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>As for fertility preservation before chemotherapy or radiotherapy, methods such as protection by administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists before chemotherapy and translocation of the gonads before radiotherapy are conceivable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612449074">17</xref></sup> However, the results obtained as well as difficulty in performing these procedures make them less than satisfactory. If a patient has a spouse, cryopreservation of fertilized ova as in the case of routine in vitro fertilization is a possibility. However, if a patient is not married or is young, ova must be preserved before fertilization. Therefore, unfertilized ova<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612449074">18</xref></sup> or ovarian tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612449074">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612449074">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612449074">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612449074"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612449074">16</xref></sup> must be preserved. As for freezing of unfertilized ova, it is possible to collect ova without using ovulation inducers and then mature them in vitro; however, the number of ova that can be collected is limited, and spontaneous pregnancy is far from certain.</p>
<p>A treatment involving oophorectomy before chemotherapy, cryopreservation, and retransplantation after primary disease treatment completion was thus conceived. Successful live birth with this method was first reported by Donnez et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612449074">1</xref></sup> in 2004. Although cryopreservation of the ovary requires surgery under general anesthesia, if retransplantation is successful, spontaneous pregnancy can be expected with this method. Moreover, because ovarian function is restored, hormone replacement therapy is not required. In other words, this method also ameliorates ovarian deficiency symptoms as a result of loss of ovarian function with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612449074">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, it is possible to collect unfertilized ova at the time of oophorectomy aimed at cryopreservation of the ovary, as in this study. It may also be possible to cryopreserve unfertilized ova at the same time as described above.</p>

<p>There are 2 main tissue-freezing methods: slow freezing and vitrification. The slow-freezing method was the first to be used in practice and has been used in most reports published to date.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612449074">1</xref></sup> However, reportedly, the results of in vitro fertilization in patients who underwent homotopic transplantation of ovarian tissue are not necessarily good.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612449074">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612449074">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, vitrification does not require a programmed freezer and is easier than slow freezing. Furthermore, the portions containing primordial follicles can reportedly be peeled off as small sheets because they exist near the surface of the ovary and can thus be cryopreserved. Because it is in sheet form, the ovarian tissue becomes easier to handle at the time of retransplantation by this method. The tissue survival rate after retransplantation by the vitrification method was significantly higher than that by the slow-freezing method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612449074">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612449074">4</xref></sup> Thus, this method is expected to advance further. We are also performing cryopreservation of ovarian cortical membranes by vitrification in cooperation with colleagues in our institution.</p>

<title>Minimally Invasive Surgery</title>
<p>Because the candidate patients are scheduled to undergo chemotherapy, it is desirable that treatment of the primary diseases be started as early as possible. For this reason, since the report by Donnez et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612449074">1</xref></sup> oophorectomy has generally been performed laparoscopically. We introduced an even less invasive single-port surgery, which has attracted attention in recent years, and we have used this strategy for oophorectomy aimed at cryopreservation of the ovary.</p>
<p>Because RPS, including SILS, requires fewer incisions than conventional laparoscopic surgery, postoperative recovery is faster with this new method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612449074">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612449074">9</xref></sup> Especially in cases where the basal disease is a hematological disease, it seems to be very useful that there is little perioperative bleeding. Another advantage is that the operative time is short. However, with SILS, the degree of freedom at the time of surgery tends to be reduced, and the surgical technique also tends to be more difficult. Therefore, when intraoperative difficulty is anticipated, it is recommended that another port be added and that 2-port surgery is performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612449074">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the presence of endometriosis, adhesion of the ovary was anticipated in patients 2 and 3, and adhesions around the ovary were actually observed during the operations. We therefore used the 2-port surgery to ablate these adhesions.</p>
<p>For single-port surgery, we have been using the SILS Port from Covidien.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612449074">12</xref></sup> This seems to be appropriate for our purposes because it allows us to carefully extract and recover the ovary using an approximately 2.5-cm incision in the umbilical region. We are also making efforts to carefully extract the ovary using an Endo Catch (Covidien, MA).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we collect GV oocytes by puncturing and aspirating small follicles of the contralateral ovary at the time of surgery. We also cryopreserve GV oocytes obtained by puncturing extracted ovaries. We believe that this method is useful because it improves pregnancy potential after chemotherapy and because there is no possibility of reimplanting tumor cells at the time of retransplantation of the cryopreserved ovary in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization using GV oocytes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Cryopreservation of the ovarian tissue was possible in all patients. Also, in almost all patients, cryopreservation of the GV oocytes was possible, too.</p>
<p>All 6 patients were discharged from the hospital without postoperative problems and were able to receive treatments, such as chemotherapy, for their primary disease. So we suggest that fertility preservation operation before chemotherapy or radiotherapy can be safely carried out using RPS, including single-port surgery.</p>
<sec id="section12-1553350612449074">
<title>Final Remarks</title>
<p>As yet, there is no established technology for preserving the fertility potential of patients for whom chemotherapy or radiotherapy is planned, though new developments are anticipated. The method described herein may eventually be replaced by a newer technique. In any case, we hope that better treatment methods will be developed for patients scheduled to undergo chemotherapy or radiotherapy.</p>
