<abstract>
<p>This article explores Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) diagnosis and early popular forms of the Evergreen model of attachment therapy popular in the 1990s. It argues that the Evergreen model operated as part of a biomedical knowledge regime designed to mediate and remediate flows of adoptable children in the United States. The article juxtaposes attachment therapists’ understandings of child circulation via adoption with adoptees’ experiences of their own circulation to illuminate the ways in which early attachment therapists pathologized children’s attempts to exert agency within the limited scope of their own circulation and during treatment. The article elaborates on the adult-centric notion of linear flows of circulation via adoption vs. some children’s ‘ambi-valent’ experience of their own circulation. Ethnographic attention to such paradoxes within child circulation is important for illuminating how knowledge regimes attempt to smooth child circulation routes when children present as ‘circulatory problems’; it also asks by what processes children’s assertion of agency is constructed as a problem more broadly in the United States.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In their article, ‘Backed by papers: Undoing persons, history, and return,’ anthropologists Barbara Yngvesson and Susan Bibler Coutin (2006) consider the relationship between the concept of ‘return’ and the production of inter-country adoption law in the United States. Focusing on the experiences of transnational adoptees who make ‘roots trips’ to their countries of origins and on the experiences of deportees exiled to birth countries, they identify a contradiction: at the same time that legal discourse attempts to sharply articulate for circulated people a ‘clean break’ from their origins (in the case of adoptees – via sealed birth records, production of new birth certificates, and termination of birth parents’ rights to children; in the case of deportees – via naturalization documents), circulated individuals still feel a ‘pull to origins’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0907568213483148">Yngvesson and Coutin, 2006</xref>: 178–179). This pull, which Yngvesson and Coutin use to signal the complex ways that circulated people engage with notions of agency, manifests in circulated subjects as nostalgia, as longing for birth countries, and as fear of birth countries. Always, however, this ‘pull’ partially signifies for adoptees some possibility, freedom, or at least some alternative <italic>movement</italic> within or beyond the prefigured systems in which they are being circulated. In the midst of many constraining forces that attempt to fix both adoptees’ physical and social locations, through the reinterpretation of the ontological category of ‘return,’ adoptees rewrite their very identity. Such important work deconstructs the notion of circulation as a purely physical act. The circulation of bodies does not always prescribe the circulation of the self.</p>
<p>Yngvesson and Coutin’s theoretical framing of inter-country adoption as a flexible medium that accommodates not just a linear flow – but various types of figurative <italic>redirections</italic> of circulated peoples – is useful for thinking about how biomedical knowledge production about adoptees operates in tension with how adoptees actually understand and perform their own circulation. Every year, thousands of children are diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0907568213483148">1</xref></sup> in the United States. The vast majority of these children – popularly known as ‘RAD kids’ – are formerly institutionalized children who have either been domestically or internationally adopted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568213483148">Hall and Geher, 2003</xref>). In the late 1990s and early 2000s, I conducted fieldwork among adoptive families, a variety of attachment therapists, and adoption facilitators in the Denver metropolitan area in the United States to ethnographically document the social construction of domesticity, children, and childhood via RAD diagnosis and treatment. At the time, the RAD diagnosis and certain early forms of a controversial method of attachment therapy called the Evergreen model were becoming popular with adoptive parents. It was clear that these operated as a biomedical knowledge regime that remediated the behavior of what adoptive parents thought to be affectively suspect adoptees to ensure the unidirectional, linear migration of adoptable children in the United States. But I also found that adoptees diagnosed and treated for RAD at the clinic made meanings of their own circulation that relied more on an understanding of adoption as a form of non-linear movement – a condition, as one adoptee put it, of ‘moving, but not really going anywhere.’</p>
<p>In this article, using the case study of two siblings who were adopted from Russia to the US and then diagnosed and treated for RAD in the late 1990s, I first introduce the Evergreen model as it was practiced within one attachment therapy clinic (the Attachment Center at Evergreen [ACE])<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0907568213483148">2</xref></sup> in Evergreen, Colorado, in 1999–2000. I focus on how the RAD diagnosis and treatment helped to set standards for child circulation in both international and domestic adoption circuits, fixing adoptee circulation along axes of particular affective regimes associated with idealized nuclear family life (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0907568213483148">Eng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568213483148">Stryker, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0907568213483148">2011</xref>). Practitioners of the Evergreen model of attachment therapy at ACE used various forms of emotional management in an attempt to form child subjects worth circulating from institutions to nuclear families, as well as to justify taking other adoptees out of circulation. However, the ways in which children treated at the center actually understood their own circulation presented some challenges to the notion of circulation as a prefigured, linear form of movement. Children appeared to relate to their own circulation as a condition in which they were not just ‘from somewhere, and going somewhere,’ but as an ambivalent position (and here I will be using the term in the literal sense of being ‘ambi-valent,’ or, equally attracted and averse to two poles or locations) between biological, geographic, temporal, and psychological points that they struggled to identify themselves in relation to during their treatment at the clinic. I conclude by considering some links between ‘RAD Kids’ ’ perceptions of their own circulation and rethinking child and youth agency within childhood studies more broadly.</p>

<title>The rise (and fall) of the Evergreen model of attachment therapy at ACE</title>
<p>Since the early 1990s, a range of attachment therapies have emerged to transform and correct the bodies and brains of ‘RAD kids,’ and in turn, to transform and fix adoptive families in the United States. Therapists in the US typically use three types of interventions to address child attachment disregulation (behaviors resulting from a break in attachment in infancy and/or early childhood): social learning (behavioral) modalities, family therapy or family-systems therapy, and attachment therapy. Of these three modalities, attachment therapies, of which there many forms, most clearly utilize attachment theory as a foundation for practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568213483148">Barth and Miller, 2000</xref>). Traditional attachment therapies claim that caregiver qualities such as environmental stability, parental sensitivity, responsiveness to children’s physical and emotional needs, consistency, and a safe and predictable environment are the most effective to support the development of healthy attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0907568213483148">Bakersman-Kranenburg et al., 2003</xref>). In these types of interventions, the focus is on the parent–child relationship and teaching positive parenting skills rather than on the child’s pathology. Such parent–child relationship therapy usually favors maintaining adoptive children in their adoptive homes rather than removing them to institutional care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483148">Chaffin et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas traditional attachment therapy in the United States stems from the work of such attachment theorists as John Bowlby, Rene Spitz, and Mary Ainsworth, the more controversial Evergreen model of attachment therapy as it was practiced in certain clinics in the late 1990s traced its intellectual lineage to less evidence-based forms of ‘feeling therapy’ and rage reduction therapies popular in the US in the 1960s, such as Primal Scream Therapy, Gestalt, EST, and Bioenergetics. And unlike more traditional forms of attachment therapy used today, the Evergreen model was marked by two additional components: confrontation therapy and therapeutic-parenting training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568213483148">Stryker, 2010</xref>). Confrontation therapy, or ‘holding therapy’ as it was practiced at ACE in the late 1990s,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0907568213483148">3</xref></sup> was an intentionally intrusive, confrontational, physical, and lengthy form of therapist–client interaction in which the child was laid down across the laps of one or two therapists. The therapist(s) then encouraged the child to share feelings verbally while the therapist forced eye contact, and attempted, through verbal and physical cues (arguing, yelling, or confusing the child; making the child kick or perform repetitive tasks; or poking or gentle prodding) to incite emotions from the child. The purpose of this was to gain a ‘capitulation’ on the part of the child to gain his or her trust and to form a base from which the therapist and child could discuss the child’s early development history of abuse and neglect. Therapeutic-parent training, as it was practiced at ACE at the time, also involved a lengthy curriculum designed to teach adoptive parents how to build and maintain a ‘therapeutic home,’ in which parents could then conduct the Evergreen model of attachment therapy on their own (this may have included holding therapy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568213483148">Stryker, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The Evergreen model of attachment therapy at ACE enjoyed its most popular period during the late 1990s in the United States. Between 1996 and 1999, domestic adoption rates in the US increased from approximately 28,000 to 36,000 per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568213483148">AFCARS, 1999</xref>). International adoption rates almost quadrupled – jumping from just over 5000 to almost 20,000 per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0907568213483148">Tarmann, 2003</xref>). It was also during this heyday for the Evergreen model that I conducted fieldwork at ACE in 1999 and early 2000. At the time, ACE treated about 130 children per year. However, in April 2000, Connell Watkins, a local attachment therapist, accidently suffocated and killed a 10-year-old client, Candace Newmaker, during treatment. The incident effectively incriminated all other attachment disorder clinics in the area, and added fuel to an already heated debate over the efficacy and ethicality of the Evergreen model. During the 2000s, all of the town’s attachment therapy clinics, despite differences in the treatment modalities used, were at the center of heated controversy over the proper ways to treat children diagnosed with RAD. On one side of the controversy sat a minority of non-traditional attachment therapists and frustrated adoptive parents who swore by the Evergreen model as it was practiced in the 1990s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0907568213483148">Thomas et al., 2002</xref>); on the other have been medical practitioners and scholars who question the professionalism and efficacy of attachment therapists who continue to follow many aspects of the model (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0907568213483148">Mercer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0907568213483148">Zilberstein, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Therapeutic goals of the two-week intensive at ACE</title>
<p>Between 1996 and 2002, I conducted interviews, observations, and/ or extended case file reviews with 167 adoptive families whose adopted children (both internationally and domestically adopted) were diagnosed with RAD, 160 of whom eventually went on to seek some form of treatment for the disorder, and 129 of whom specifically selected the Evergreen model of attachment therapy as it was practiced at ACE in the late 1990s. Between 1999 and 2002, I conducted in-depth interviews with 59 families who sought treatment at ACE in the mid-1990s, 15 of whom would allow me to observe their children’s actual treatment there between 1999 and 2000. Here I would meet Sergei and Bettina Perkins, two children adopted by a Parker, Colorado couple, Margaret and John Perkins. Both were adopted from the same Moscow orphanage when each of the two children was seven years old in 1994. All four members of the Perkins family would serve as generous and valuable key interlocutors for me during my fieldwork.</p>
<p>The Perkins family exhibited many typical characteristics of the families in treatment at ACE. White, middle-class, and in their early forties, both Margaret and John were professionals. Margaret worked in a local theatre. John was a project manager for an entertainment consulting company. According to the couple, in 1990 they decided to adopt because they felt that they both had a good home to offer to a child, but they also acknowledged that neither of them were ‘diapers and burping types.’ Thus, they both felt that they would be the best parents to an older child, and particularly a boy. Shortly after beginning to research adoption options, they connected with a local adoption agency, which, at the time, specialized in facilitating Russian and Costa Rican adoptions. Originally, Margaret and John wanted to adopt only one child. After looking at photos and personality profiles of adoptable children, however, they decided to adopt both Bettina and Sergei from the same Moscow orphanage. According to John, the decision to adopt both children was based on several factors: first, when John and Margaret saw each of the two children, they thought that the children looked very similar. They also thought the children looked like John. Second, the children’s personality profiles indicated that Bettina was outgoing and athletic; Sergei, meanwhile, was an introvert who liked to draw and paint. Margaret and John thought the children might complement one another and, even though Bettina and Sergei did not know one another or spend time together at their densely populated Moscow orphanage, bond and teach one another new things. Third, the couple felt that adopting two older children would be more expedient than adopting them one at a time, in the event that they eventually decided to adopt another child, which they both thought was in their future. They also convinced themselves that adopting two children would be more rewarding and beneficial for everyone than adopting one. As John put it: ‘I guess we thought we could complete our family by adopting them both.’</p>
<p>According to Margaret, when Bettina and Sergei first arrived at their new adoptive home in Parker, Colorado, ‘things were great for a few months.’ John and Margaret described the children as curious, compliant, and interested in one another. After about three months, however, both children began displaying behaviors that disturbed the couple. Sergei, who exhibited the more overtly troubling behaviors of the two children, began to lie, sneak around the house at night, break things on purpose, be overly friendly with strangers while showing hostility toward Margaret and John, and urinate and defecate on the floor in his room and elsewhere in the house. Bettina began to cry several times a day in response to seemingly mundane events such as spilling a drink, getting her shirt dirty, or arriving somewhere late. She was also extremely watchful and wary of any other adults aside from Margaret and John that came to the house. In addition, she seemed very anxious, wanting, according to John, to control every interaction she engaged in with him or Margaret, or her peers.</p>
<p>Although Bettina and Sergei displayed such behaviors, Margaret and John waited almost four years to seek treatment for them. Both felt that they could help the children themselves with love, will, and patience. But as the behaviors grew more severe, they searched the internet for help. The town of Evergreen was located less than two hours away; when they learned of the Attachment Center at Evergreen, they took the children to be assessed there. According to Margaret, ‘It wasn’t our last hope. It might have been our only hope.’</p>
<p>Once at ACE, first Bettina and then Sergei each underwent ‘two-week intensives’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0907568213483148">5</xref></sup> at the center. The three main goals of the two-week intensives were to, within 10 sessions: first, <italic>introduce therapist control to elicit an emotional response</italic> from the child to their traumatic early childhood – this was done primarily by setting up rules so children demonstrate verbal reciprocity and total physical compliance and conducting extensive amounts of holding therapy; second, <italic>weaken the child’s attachment to their birth parents</italic> through such exercises as role-plays and psychodramas (forms of regression therapy without hypnosis) in which therapists imagine, (re)construct, and act out children’s early childhoods; and third, <italic>prescribe attachment between the child and their new, adoptive parents</italic> – this was hopefully invoked through various trust exercises between the child and the adoptive parents as well as a ‘Tug-of-War’ exercise in which the child was told to symbolically choose between their birth and adoptive families and to potentially commit to a future with the new family (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0907568213483148">Table 1</xref>). During the two weeks, when they were not in therapy sessions, children stayed with a ‘therapeutic foster family.’ The purpose of separating children from their adoptive family during their intensive was to provide the children with a chance to become immersed in the philosophy of the Evergreen model in an actual home situation. It also provided respite for the adoptive family and an opportunity for the family to attend therapeutic-parenting classes, in which they learned to turn their home into an Evergreen-based therapeutic home. Throughout the two-week intensive therapy, therapists conducted both ‘genuine emotion’ tests to assess and determine whether children seemed ‘real’ in their emotional reactions toward their own life histories and toward their adoptive parents during the two weeks. Therapists also included time daily to identify, process, and resolve emotions as they came up for both children and the adoptive parents. At the end of the two weeks, therapists constructed a set of long-term therapeutic goals. Part of this determination was to decide whether children could return home with adoptive parents, or whether adoptive parents would instead ‘love children from a distance,’ in which adoptive parents would still be legally and financially responsible for children, but children would live separately from adoptive parents while housed in short- or long-term care at ACE, or possibly be taken out of circulation altogether, to be sent to treatment group homes, boarding or military school for the long-term.</p>

<title>Sergei and Bettina’s responses to therapeutic goals</title>
<p>During their two-week intensives, both Bettina and Sergei faced their own challenges with the therapeutic goals. In the first phase of their two-week intensives, both resisted the notion that the therapist would – and should – be in control of them. Whereas Sergei withdrew immediately, refusing to talk or comply with any directives or rules, Bettina, at least initially, verbally reciprocated and acquiesced to directives for physical compliance. After two days, however, she attempted to negotiate her boundaries and privileges with the therapist, hoping to expand her therapeutic world. When this did not happen, she then began to discuss her unhappiness with her life and her family situation. Among the many aspects of her post-adoptive life she complained about was the feeling of being missed by or missing her birth mother, whom she had not seen since she was an infant. The following excerpt was taken from Day 3 of her two-week intensive:</p>
<speech>

</speech>

<speaker>Bettina:</speaker>
<p>My mom. And other girls I know.</p>

<p>During the second phase of the two-week intensive, in which therapists conducted role-plays and psychodramas based on the children’s reimagined early life histories, Bettina began to consistently express sadness and grief about many elements of her early childhood, such as being both premature and in mortally dangerous health as a newborn (she suffered intracranial hemorrhaging during her birth); her mother’s alcohol dependency and syphilitic condition, and Bettina’s subsequent abandonment in a children’s hospital at eight days of age; her mother’s signing away of her parental rights to Bettina when Bettina was around six months of age; and Bettina’s institutionalization at the Moscow orphanage for seven years. At the end of each role-play, in response to the therapist’s reminder that John and Margaret had chosen Bettina and made her a part of their family, and that she, in turn, could choose them, Bettina cried, and when John and Margaret entered the therapy room after Bettina’s individual therapy, Bettina hugged them.</p>
<p>Sergei’s second phase of the two-week intensive went differently. In response to his role-play, in which it was revealed that he was given up for adoption by his birth mother at one week, that he was moved between three orphanages in Russia within seven years, and that he was bullied and teased at the Moscow orphanage from which John and Margaret had adopted him, Sergei refused to make eye contact or speak of his past or his feelings and relationship to John and Margaret. When he did speak, he would, without outward emotion and in a low voice, attempt to redirect therapists to other topics, including his current interests in drawing, video games, and soccer. When John and Margaret joined Sergei and his therapist at the end of the sessions, Sergei sat stiffly next to them. When I later asked him why he didn’t want to say anything to the therapists, he told me matter-of-factly that he knew what the therapists wanted him to say about ‘what they [his birth parents] did,’ but he didn’t want to say what they wanted him to say, so ‘I just don’t say anything.’ Later on during my research, I asked Sergei again why he had not responded to therapist directives. He clarified that he did not actually remember his mother, but ‘it doesn’t mean that I will say what they say.’</p>
<p>During the third phase of their two-week intensives, in which therapists encourage children to choose their adoptive parents over their birth parents, both Bettina and Sergei underwent the ‘Tug-of-War’ exercise, in which they were asked to stand in the middle of the therapy room with John and Margaret on their left side and the therapist (acting out the role of their birth parent) on their right. The therapist tugged on one of the children’s arms, while John and Margaret tugged on the other. As the therapist said things in the children’s ear to represent their birth parents’ lack of desire to love and parent the children, John and Margaret were encouraged to tell the children how much they loved them, wanted them, and wished to be their ‘forever parent.’ The therapist then asked the children to choose between their birth parents and their adoptive parents. Bettina responded to the exercise by stating that she wanted both sets of parents; however, after some time, she said that she chose John and Margaret. Sergei, on the other hand, endured much tugging and pulling on his arms, flopping and enduring the therapist and John and Margaret moving him back and forth before he stated that he didn’t know who to choose. Ultimately, he never made a decision. Sergei would later reveal to me that he felt like he hadn’t wanted to choose any of them that day.</p>
<p>In the final phase of the two-week intensive, in which therapists determine whether children can return to the adoptive home or be loved from a distance, Bettina’s therapists decided that Bettina had sufficiently confronted her early childhood history and displayed enough genuine emotion about that history and toward her adoptive parents to return home with them. They, as well as John and Margaret,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0907568213483148">6</xref></sup> were hopeful that Bettina had learned enough about her history, worked through enough feelings, and made a commitment to be a part of her adoptive family. Ultimately, Bettina did return to ACE a year later for what therapists there called a ‘tune up,’ or, a set of therapeutic sessions designed to encourage her to continue bonding with her adoptive family; however, after this, she lived with John and Margaret until she was past 18. She continued therapy with a local therapist associated with ACE, and the behaviors for which she was brought to ACE subsided.</p>
<p>Sergei’s therapist, however, determined that he would need to be loved from a distance while staying for short-term care at ACE (approximately six weeks, with a possible recommitment for another six weeks). Since John and Margaret lived fairly close to the center, there could be ample time for review and checking-in between family members to help make the determination of whether Sergei would come home or remain at the center indefinitely. Sergei would continue to oscillate between living at home and spending time at ACE until he was in late adolescence. The behaviors for which he was brought to ACE continued, but also seem to subside when he moved out of John and Margaret’s home as a young adult and into a semi-therapeutic group home where he was given work to do and peers to live with.</p>

<title>The Evergreen model of attachment therapy as circulation management</title>
<p>The case studies of Bettina and Sergei Perkins demonstrate that the Evergreen model of attachment therapy operated as a form of circulation management in many ways. Before discussing details of the therapy itself, a few comments on <italic>the very context</italic> in which the therapy became popular are necessary. Looking more systemically not just at the linear flow of Bettina and Sergei’s movement from departure to ‘destination,’ but also at the circulation of ideas that support the institutions that determine children to be ‘adoptable’ in the first place, we see that the Evergreen model as it was practiced at ACE in the late 1990s heavily depended upon the notion that adopted children have <italic>affective value</italic> that will provide prospective adoptive parents with ‘as-if family’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483148">Modell, 1994</xref>) – family that uses biological or consanguinal relations to model what adoptive family should look and act like.</p>
<p>Photo listings and personality profiles of children available for adoption are interesting artifacts in this regard. As John revealed, photo listings and personality profiles are sometimes presented in regularly published bulletins or booklets; photo listings of adoptable children are also available on adoption agency websites in the United States, where photos are connected to links such as ‘Waiting Children’ and ‘Children Seeking Loving Families.’ Photos portray children as happy, smiling, and aesthetically pleasing in dress and personality. Photo listings are key to attracting parents to an agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568213483148">Dorow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568213483148">Stryker, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>But photo listings and personality profiles also list the qualities that make adoptees adoptable. In particular, they demonstrate that adoptees will make what Viviana Zelizer has called good ‘emotional assets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0907568213483148">Zelizer, 1985</xref>: 11) for families. They aid adopting parents to project their family into the future by assuring parents that adoptees will <italic>want</italic> to make a clean break with their pasts. As we see here, photo listings and personality profiles include information that suggests to parents that, despite a child’s experience in institutions, she or he welcomes and longs for the transition from institutional living to the nuclear family.</p>
<p>If personality profiles advertise, predict, and prescribe the value of adoptees as emotional assets, then the RAD diagnosis itself helps parents assess whether the adopted child is actually an emotional liability. In other words, the RAD diagnosis provides the standards by which the value of children as emotional assets should be determined. Integral to RAD’s diagnostic power as an affective assessment tool is a particular notion of ‘return.’ According to the attachment therapists at ACE in the late 1990s, there is a window of time, and of space and place, in which children form healthy attachments to adults (prior to age five). This is the window of time in which children develop in their natural state as emotional assets to families. However, according to the therapists, ‘grossly pathogenic care’ (verbal, physical, and sexual abuse; deprivation and neglect) alters the adoptee’s ‘natural state,’ transforming them from emotional asset to emotional liability. To return the child to its natural state as emotional asset, some form of biomedical intervention is required. As one therapist at ACE put it, ‘Kids’ natural state is that they want to be loved. None of these kids got that. We just help [adoptive] parents to give it to them.’ Biomedical knowledge regimes, in other words, set the standards for child circulatory systems through adoption.</p>
<p>Whereas the RAD diagnosis sets the standards for circulatory systems, RAD treatments like early forms of the Evergreen model of attachment therapy aided in the formation of subjects ‘worth’ circulating. For example, as we see in the case of Bettina and Sergei, the Evergreen model of attachment therapy was designed to specifically discipline their bodies and minds in ways that would result in the restoration of the adoptive family as an internalized collective. The Evergreen model explicitly and unapologetically operated as a form of emotional management of children, and the techniques that therapists used at the clinic were uniformly designed to return children to what attachment therapists understood to be their natural state as emotional assets. Foundational to this restoration was the production of family feeling, and particularly child love, in the clinic.</p>
<p>Therapists at ACE sought to produce child love in at least three important ways. First, they attempted to rid children of the notion that they were, as one therapist I interviewed called it, ‘beyond family.’ In other words, therapists went to great lengths to demonstrate to children that they could not, and no longer needed to, take care of themselves. Children were now part of an adoptive (real) family, and one of the stipulations of being in a family was the need and privilege to let adults be in control and keep children safe. Therapists at Evergreen understood children diagnosed with RAD to be preoccupied with self-caretaking, so much so that they sought only to control others at all times. Therapists sought to challenge children’s compulsion to control others by demonstrating that ‘the therapist is in control’ through a series of practices such as holding therapy, confrontational communication, demanding immediate conformity to therapy rules, and providing consequences to children who do not comply. By applying, and demanding, therapist control for the duration of the therapy, therapists understood themselves to be providing children with the opportunity to practice relinquishing control with them in the present, so that they could relinquish their need for control over adoptive parents later.</p>
<p>A second way that therapists attempted to produce child love in the clinic was through a series of exercises designed to divest children of their interest in their birth parents. Therapists reconstructed children’s early histories through regression work and role-plays that illuminated birth parents’ lacks vis-a-vis a doxic notion of the nuclear family. For example, therapists pieced together fractured narratives about birth parents’ biographies, including their relationship and sexual histories, their alcohol and drug use, their medical histories, and even their feelings about giving children up for adoption. These details were presented to children as evidence of their birth parents’ inability to truly care for them, as well as to demonstrate children’s innocence in their own early histories. Therapists demonstrated that birth parents made poor decisions and treated children poorly; thus, it was understandable that children had strong and intense feelings about their lot in life. Therapists represented birth parents as unrelenting and immutable in their abuse and neglect of their children. Children were assured that birth parents would, in fact, <italic>never</italic> be in a psychological position to be able to, or want to, parent them in the present or in the future. Children were challenged to accept this fact, to process it, and to recognize the abundant opportunities that their adoptive family provides to them.</p>
<p>A third way that therapists attempted to produce child love in the clinic was through a series of exercises designed to nurture children’s interest and investment in the adoptive family, which was also held up as the ideal form of family. This was evidenced through such examples as role-plays in which adoptive parents ‘rescue’ children from their past, and Tug-of-War exercises in which therapists physically and verbally encouraged children to choose adoptive parents over birth parents. In these exercises, therapists explicitly and consistently compared birth parents to adoptive parents, almost always ranking them below adoptive parents in desirable attributes. For example, birth parents (as role-played by therapists) were often represented as unclean, addicted, loud, irresponsible, dangerous, and without remorse about abusing, neglecting, and/or abandoning children. One the other hand, therapists encouraged adoptive parents in the therapy room to be resolute, reliable, loving, soft-spoken, helpful, and safe within the choosing exercises. Therapists presented two options to the children at the moment of their therapy – either hold on to the fantasy of being returned to their birth parents or accept the adoptive family. They strongly encouraged children to choose the adoptive family over their birth family.</p>
<p>Finally, ideas about return that supported Evergreen attachment therapists’ attempts to restore children to their ‘natural state’ as emotional assets also fueled medical professionals’ power to determine when to keep children in circulation and when to remove children from circulation. As we see in both children’s treatment, but especially Sergei’s, therapists continuously gauged his emotional progress during the therapy. If both Sergei and Bettina appeared to be ‘working hard’ for a family (readily giving control to the therapist and embracing the adoptive family), then attachment therapists recommended or allowed children to return home with adoptive parents. Those children who did not comply with therapist instructions were deemed ‘unable to attach,’ and thus, were often not reunited with their adoptive parents. Instead, adoptive parents ‘loved them from a distance.’ ‘Loving children from a distance’ included children being (re)institutionalized in either short- or long-term care at the clinic or elsewhere, such as in group homes, military schools, or boarding schools.</p>
<p>Implicit in the attachment therapists’ framework is the assumption that the exiling of the child from the adoptive family is a result of either the child’s need for more practice in being in a family or the child’s conscious <italic>choice</italic> to live outside of families, where there will not be an expectation to form attachments to others. In other words, children do not desire to return to their natural states as emotional assets. Sometimes, the responsibility for the shortcomings of the therapy is placed on the child – children were deemed to not ‘be working hard enough’ to take full advantage of the therapy, and this led to placement in long-term treatment at the clinic or to permanent placement in a group home. In other cases, therapists may have determined that living in a family was simply too hard for children; adoptive parents then enrolled children in military or boarding school. Here they remained until they emancipated at the age of 18. Upon legal adulthood, a large number of them enlisted in the military or entered other highly regimented professions (law enforcement, correctional facilities) where they would not be challenged emotionally. In other words, children were legally adopted, but in reality, they spent most of their childhoods exiled from adoptive families.</p>
<p>As seen here, circulations only counted when an emotional exchange between adoptee and adoptive parent had been produced. It is not just children’s bodies, but the emotional exchange that is circulated. The children were removed from circulation because they could not or would not receive or produce the emotional labor required to consummate the exchange. Both Sergei and Bettina were alternately posed with, or endured, a double exile – first from birth country or birth family, and then from the adoptive family. Orchestrated by both adoptive parents and attachment therapists then, children were left in a sort of circulatory limbo, not ‘of there’ or ‘of here.’ In becoming of ‘no one,’ the children became ‘of nowhere.’ Through the Evergreen model of attachment therapy, ‘RAD kids’ were constructed as circulatory problems that needed to be fixed in two ways: as bodies that needed to be returned to, or kept out of, circulation; and as emotional liabilities whose worth circulating was suspect and to be determined. If the value could be adequately assessed and/or ensured, then the ultimate solution to the ‘problem’ was to take the children out of circulation altogether.</p>
<p>But how were Bettina and Sergei actually performing their own circulation via international adoption? Did they, like attachment therapists at Evergreen, understand <italic>themselves</italic> as circulatory problems? Within the context of treatment at ACE in the 1990s, it is difficult to say, because much of what the children seemed to understand as agency was pathologized by therapists. However, in my additional work with adoptees diagnosed and treated for RAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0907568213483148">Stryker, 2011</xref>), I demonstrate that children diagnosed with RAD often utilize a sophisticated form of what Sabine Mannitz has referred to as ‘double cultural agency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568213483148">2005</xref>: 25), or the skills one uses to imagine for oneself the social fields that cross ontological boundaries and then the strategic positioning of oneself within those fields. In many cases, they use double cultural agency to manage interstitial positions between their birth and adoptive families, and between their biological and geographic origins and expected destinations. During Sergei and Bettina’s two-week intensives, there were many times when I considered them to be performing their own circulation using double cultural agency. For instance, in the example above, in response to a therapist’s question about her feelings about her adoptive family, Bettina pushed back on the therapist, asking her to expand her question about her feelings regarding the Perkinses to include others Bettina knows. Bettina’s wish to talk about her birth mother outside the prescribed parameters within her two-week intensive suggests that she is realizing circulation in a particular way, both in terms of emotional exchange, and in terms of the people Bettina includes in her understanding of circulation. In fact, one might read her desire to talk about her birth mother amid much therapist pressure (and stakes) to do otherwise, as a strategy for communicating an ambivalent experience of (ambi-valent position within) her own circulation. Implicit in this is the need to communicate multiple origins and/or the need to concretize her origins, her chronological history, and her complex identity associated with multiple families, institutions, nations, and cultures. When thought of in this way, Bettina’s ambivalence seems less based in pathology, than in a need for adoptees to understand and assert where they belong in systems that are attempting to fix their physical and social locations in ways that aren’t intuitive or preferential to adoptees.</p>
<p>Sergei’s invocation of an ambi-valent circulation at first appears to be less clear, given that his rejection of both birth and adoptive families throughout his treatment at ACE appeared to be total and resolute. His statement to me after his therapy at ACE that he wanted to choose neither his birth parents nor his adoptive parents seems to be most reflective of this abject rejection. However, I find Sergei’s earlier brief comments outside of the treatment room to me to be laden with possibilities for rethinking the creative ways in which children understand their own circulation. While present in treatment, Sergei used strategies such as silence, feigning ignorance, and diverting therapists’ attention away from his role-plays and psychodramas to express his resistance to the therapies themselves. He also did not choose a family to belong to in his Tug-of-War exercise. However, reporting to me that he knew what the therapists wanted him to say about ‘what they [his birth parents] did,’ but that he didn’t want to say what they wanted him to say, so ‘I just don’t say anything,’ and also, later clarifying that he did not actually remember his mother, but ‘it doesn’t mean that I will say what they say’ seem to me two understandings of expressions of deep ambivalence about <italic>having</italic> to choose between birth parents and adoptive parents. While it may be true that Sergei did not remember his birth mother, his resistance to saying what the therapists clearly wanted him to accept about her – that she did not, and could never love or parent him – was a narrative that he was not ready to accept. His choice ‘not to choose’ would understandably indicate an attempt to manage a deeply difficult interstitial position between wanting to belong somewhere, but still feeling as if he belonged nowhere.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Upon juxtaposing ACE therapists’ notion of adoption as a closed, linear form of migration with the children’s notion of adoption as a form of ‘moving without really going anywhere,’ we find that adoptive parents understood circulation as a form of fixed prefigured movement. The intervention of programs such as ACE was meant to contribute to this linear movement, particularly by moving children from institutions to nuclear families; when children created a rupture in circulation by ‘failing’ to return adoptive parent love with appropriate forms of child love, adoptive parents called upon ACE therapists to repair ruptures in circulation. ACE therapists did this primarily by attempting to produce child love in the clinic. Children’s return of love to parents in response to the treatment was proof of successful circulation; their lack of affective return was considered a ‘derailment,’ and thus, grounds for their de-circulation.</p>
<p>However, it may very well be that children treated at the clinic experienced their own ‘successful’ circulation as pendular, rather than linear. To begin, they may not have understood their own circulation as comprised primarily of their bodies and allegiances moving in one direction from institutions to families, but rather of a pendulating self. Children expressed ambivalence (experienced ambi-valence) about returning love to adoptive parents and appeared to resist in the form of expanding the notions of who and what they wanted to talk about during treatment. They also seemed to prioritize other more existential needs (identity construction and confirmation, establishing belonging in multiple families) over the needs of the affective value regimes constructed by adoptive parents. However, attachment therapists at ACE understood this as pathology, reforming some children, and re-institutionalizing others.</p>
<p>Given the possible difference in understanding of circulation between ACE therapists and the children treated at ACE, then where can one say that these particular adoptees were really moving from, and where to? Differences in attachment therapists’ and ‘RAD kids’ ’ understandings of the children’s circulation suggest that adoptive parents and adoption agencies, in this case, constructed unrealistic expectations for children’s emotional labor. Once in treatment, adoptees, particularly in light of their tumultuous early childhood histories, were often held to implausible standards of value to instantiate family. Agreement to comply resulted in the return of the child to the adoptive home – as we saw in Bettina’s case, she was ‘put back into’ circulation. However, failure to comply with therapists’ directives had great stakes: therapists associated it with resistance or inability to love, and unworthiness of circulation from institutions to families – those, like Sergei, who did not were taken out of circulation and <italic>re</italic>-institutionalized. For those children who were ‘loved from a distance,’ the ‘institution’ as juxtaposed with ‘the family’ became the child’s place of origin; consequently, it seemed logical to re-institutionalize them in the United States. As objects, they moved from one geographic location to another, from institutions to families, and from unadoptable to adoptable children; however as subjects, children like Bettina and Sergei complicated what it actually means to be ‘moved’.</p>
<p>This invites the question of whether the phenomenon of circulation as a form of movement without movement, or as one adoptee framed it, ‘movement without really going anywhere,’ might better be understood as a <italic>condition</italic> rather than a situation. In what other environments, and under what other circumstances do children’s justified mild or deep ambivalences, terrors, or even outright hatreds toward being rejected, abandoned, moved and traded create rupture in circulation systems? And what other knowledge regimes specifically emerge to prevent, mediate, or repair this rupture? The term ‘movement without movement’ is perhaps a way to describe the pathologizing, disciplining, and disappearing of children who present as circulatory problems, but it might also be a way to signal <italic>any</italic> process by which the roiling, squirming human child is constructed as a foil against which the reified child is supposed to smoothly circulate. How, for instance, do children diagnosed with ADHD or other mental illnesses become physically and figuratively immobilized within, or excluded from, systems of care in the service of other forms of circulation? How do children identify this immobility? Assess it? Align with it? Manage it? Change it?</p>
<p>Sociologist Berry Mayall challenges us to conduct work that treats ‘children as participant agents in social relations, and childhood as a social group fundamentally implicated in social processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0907568213483148">2002</xref>: 4). By learning more about children’s understanding and performance of their own circulation, it is possible that ‘we can learn from children about gaps and misfits between their experiences and their positioning in the social order, taken for granted by adults’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0907568213483148">Mayall, 2002</xref>: 2). It also asks to what extent such systems construct child choice and agency, and how we must nuance what is meant by these terms. Like other articles in this special issue (see, for example, Leifsen’s treatment of the Ecuadoran welfare system’s construction of children who do not cohabitate with biological parents as ‘lost children’), the ethnographic data presented here challenge us to identify and ethnographically engage with systems that construct and define child circulation. But another way we can start to attend to this project is by foregrounding the subjectivities of adoptive migrant children who are caught up in systems that assume them to be objects of exchange in adoption circuits with little to no understanding or say in shaping their own circulation experience.</p>
