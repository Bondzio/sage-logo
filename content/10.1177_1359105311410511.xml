<abstract>
<p>This study aimed to explore the process of posttraumatic growth of injured patients after a motor vehicle accident in China. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six patients. Transcripts were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Four main super-ordinate themes emerged: construction of meaning; perception of self; perception of connection; and perception of life philosophy. These themes describe growth and emotional distress which may well coexist. Posttraumatic growth can be seen as one outcome of a process of struggling with traumatic injuries. Some strategies for facilitating posttraumatic growth are discussed. Health-care providers may help the recovery of injured patients by facilitating posttraumatic growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent research on trauma has gone beyond investigating the negative effects of trauma and has shifted toward the emerging possible positive outcomes, especially posttraumatic growth (PTG), which is defined as the positive psychological change experienced as a result of the struggle with highly challenging life circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311410511">Tedeschi and Calhoun, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311410511">2004</xref>). PTG has attracted considerable attention over the past decade and is expected to add a new perspective to psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311410511">Zoellner and Maercker, 2006</xref>). Various traumatic experiences have been investigated in relation to PTG, such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311410511">Silva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311410511">Tallman and Altmaier, 2008</xref>), natural disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311410511">Kilmer and Gil-Rivas, 2010</xref>), and HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311410511">Siegel and Schrimshaw, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Motor vehicle accidents (MVA) are a common form of trauma, which can result in physical and psychological disorder in individuals. Data provided by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311410511">WHO (2006)</xref> showed 20 to 50 million people were injured or disabled in road collisions in 2002. In China, MVA are one of the most common causes of injury and death. According to the report from the Division of Public Health Supervision in the Ministry of Health in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311410511">2007</xref>), there are approximately 100,000 death casualties, and 500,000 injured cases in MVA every year in China. Additionally, MVA also bring a heavy burden to the society, with a cost as high as $290 billion per year. The increasing number of injuries sustained from MVA is of significant concern. For many accident survivors, the physical and psychological consequences are complex and lifelong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311410511">Hamanaka et al., 2006</xref>). Negative responses to traumatic injuries, such as functional disability, acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, have been well documented in the literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311410511">Tatjana and Oesterreich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311410511">Yasan et al., 2009</xref>). However, besides the major negative impact associated with the experience of MVA, such a distressing experience can also lead to positive change, suggested by empirical evidence. These were especially pronounced regarding elevated appreciation of life, improved personal relationships, and a greater sense of personal strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311410511">Harms and Talbot, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311410511">Nishi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311410511">Salter and Stallard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311410511">Turner and Cox, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311410511">Zoellner et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311410511">Salick and Auerbach (2006)</xref> suggested posttraumatic growth among people with visible disabilities remains to be investigated further because of the direct impact that a visible disability has on social relations, body image, and identity. MVA are a main cause of visible disability and severe MVA-related body impairment may produce a loss in the domains of identity, such as independence, work, and physical appearance. However, there is a paucity of studies concerning whether patients experience PTG in this visible disabled status from a health psychology perspective.</p>
<p>There is a growing number of empirical studies about PTG in western nations; the impact of sociocultural factors on this phenomenon has been intensely investigated but remains to be illustrated in the eastern cultural context. Chinese traditional culture has recognized positive change as an outcome of traumatic events, such as Mencius who allegedly stated: ‘When heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a great man, it always first frustrates his spirit and will.’ However, there is very little published information regarding the qualitative research on PTG in Chinese culture besides one in burn patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311410511">Zhai et al., 2010</xref>).The main purposes of this study are: (1) to better understand the process of PTG in injured patients after MVA in Chinese culture; and (2) to further describe strategies that may facilitate PTG.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1359105311410511">
<title>Design</title>
<p>Qualitative interviews were used as they provide a way to examine the participant’s subjective experience and are helpful in framing questions about the participant’s cognitive and affective processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311410511">Danoff-Burg and Revenson, 2005</xref>). Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) has emerged as an increasingly popular methodological tool that enables in-depth exploration of the meaning of an illness or injury for individuals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311410511">Reid et al., 2005</xref>). This study chose IPA as the method because it focuses on the in-depth examination of specific issues pertinent to participants. For IPA researchers usually try to find a reasonably homogeneous, purposive sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311410511">Smith and Osborn, 2008</xref>). Critically injured patients were interviewed in this study. A critically injured person was defined by an injury severity score (ISS) rating greater than 9 within the first 72 hours of arrival at hospital, which signified moderate to severe injuries to the body, excluding the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311410511">Civil and Schwab, 1988</xref>). As the purpose of this qualitative study was to illustrate the process of PTG in injured patients after MVA, we intentionally selected participants exhibiting evidence of PTG to capture distinctive characteristics of the phenomenon, and employed IPA for an in-depth understanding of insiders’ views.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359105311410511">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Inclusion criteria included age between18 and 65, an injury severity score greater than 9, at least three months of elapsed time since the onset of MVA, and proficient in Chinese. Patients with known cognitive impairment, such as brain injury, were excluded. A total of 13 individuals volunteered to participate in this study. Two participants who were distressed by unsolved litigation and five participants who did not demonstrate positive evidence of PTG (i.e. negative cases) were excluded. Six participants who represented a reasonably homogeneous sample were chosen for this study: all of them experienced repeated operations, five had experienced the danger close to an amputation and one had been amputated. Names have been changed by using letters to protect confidentiality. The participants’ details are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311410511">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>The research proposal received ethical approval from the university ethics committee and departments of the hospital. Each participant was informed of the purpose of the research and a consent form was signed. Interviews were conducted when patients felt able and willing to share their feelings and thoughts about their posttraumatic growth experiences. Confidentiality was maintained by using letters (i.e. A, B, C, D, E, F) to identify participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105311410511">
<title>Interview procedure</title>
<p>Participants invited for interview were recruited from the Qibao rehabilitation center of Shanghai. The investigators accessed the hospital database for patient admission details, screened the patients based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those interested met with the researcher to discuss the study and raise any concerns prior to giving formal consent. Data were collected from face-to-face in-depth interviews. Each participant was interviewed for about one hour in a small, private, comfortable interview room off the ward. Interviews were recorded on audio-tape with participants’ permission and then transcribed verbatim. A semi-structured interview schedule was used as a loose guide during interviews.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section7-1359105311410511">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>In order to gain access to the individuals’ experiences, the researcher can carefully interpret and make inferences from individual accounts, helped by an inductive, iterative, and idiographic stance with a focus upon the particular rather than the general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311410511">De Visser and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311410511">Smith and Osborn, 2008</xref>). The transcribed interviews were analyzed according to IPA processes and procedures as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311410511">Smith and Osborn (2008)</xref>. The transcript was read several times and the left-hand margin was used to annotate what was interesting or significant about what the respondent said. The second stage involved returning to the transcript afresh and using the right-hand margin to transform initial notes and ideas into more concise phrases which moved the response to a slightly higher level of abstraction and might invoke more psychological terminology. This transformation of initial notes into themes was continued through the whole transcript. The third stage consisted of further reducing the data by establishing connections between the preliminary themes and clustering them appropriately. Finally, a table was produced that showed each higher order theme and the subthemes that composed it. Then other cases were analyzed continually.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section8-1359105311410511" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Analysis of the data revealed four super-ordinate themes (each with associated subthemes), which are discussed in turn in this section. Although some overlap between these themes occurred, they appeared sufficiently distinct to be identified separately.</p>
<sec id="section9-1359105311410511">
<title>Construction of meaning</title>
<p>The first super-ordinate theme was concerned with the impact of an unexpected accident, and how the participants actively engaged with meaning making in distress. The process of meaning development was the key point toward PTG for patients.</p>
<sec id="section10-1359105311410511">
<title>Impact of accident</title>
<p>An unexpected, potentially life-threatening accident is thought to challenge a person’s assumptions and beliefs about the world and self. Life could not go on as planned because of the MVA and the injuries to the body. In this study, five participants immersed in rumination at first and tried their best to answer ‘why did it happen?’ Or ‘My life had been devastated, what should I do?’ They showed resentment toward the accident drivers, complained about their misfortune or fell into self-reproach. Participants A and D could be exemplified:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I just hate the driver so much and wouldn’t answer any calls in three months … Adding the adversity this time to the fracture three years ago, I thought myself as the most unlucky guy in the world. (A)</p>
<p>I don’t know how to describe my feelings. I can’t accept why a healthy person suddenly became like this. I felt so helpless and cried continually. I even thought of suicide. I hated the cars and had an impulse to smash them. I’m really dying to live in a place without cars. (D)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participant E underwent self-reproach because he asked for leave at work for a journey with his wife. On their way home, the accident happened and his wife was also slightly wounded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1359105311410511">
<title>Fatalism</title>
<p>After a period of rumination, each participant attributed their misfortune to destiny. They believed that accidents were preordained, whatever the case, unavoidable. After these thoughts, they stopped resenting others or themselves. Moreover, participants A and E expressed that they would believe in fate even more following the accident:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Some friends told me ‘Be careful when crossing the road’. I never considered it, even joked about it: ‘Hit me, and get me medical compensation.’ I’d never say that again, sometimes what you said will soon happen to you. (A)</p>
<p>I never believed in fate before the accident, but now I believe in it. Once someone didn’t believe me, I’d always promise ‘If I lie, let me be hit by a car.’ I’ll never make a joke like that. (E)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1359105311410511">
<title>Spiritual support of existence</title>
<p>For all participants, they had to face with the unexpected accident, the impairment and disability of the body, and the pain of multiple operations. They needed spiritual support to help them survive despite the cruel reality. This was one of the prominent themes within the interviews because every participant was prone to reflect on a greater sense of purpose and meaning in life. Reflection in distress made them look at the fundamental existential questions in a new light. For three young men under 30 years old, love of life and unrealized value of life were the driving force to get them through hard times:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I tolerated the pain for nothing but the hope of recovering earlier. I am so young, I desire to take care of my parents, marry a girl and contribute to the society. (A)</p>
<p>I was injured severely. Maybe a strong survival instinct supported me, you know, I am just 25, recalling the previous happy life, I told myself to survive. (B)</p>
<p>I am so young, there’re so many meaningful things out there. I must be positive. (E)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For participant C, D, and E, increased awareness of responsibility for their loved ones, family and career was their spiritual pillar to get through the suffering:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My son is my spiritual pillar, when I was suffering, I called his name … when I became suicidal, I hesitated. He is so young (eight years old). If I died who would take care for him? (D)</p>
<p>Responsibility has taught me the value of surviving. My parents, my child, my family and my business, they all need me. I had no choice, I have to survive. (F)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1359105311410511">
<title>Living in the moment</title>
<p>After having successfully achieved the meaning of their surviving and suffering, all the participants began to replace their attention from the previous accident to the present plight. They accepted the reality and tried to figure out a most beneficial way for their recovery. Following their cognition shift, they started to take more active coping styles. See these passages from participants B and F:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Things just happened like this, what I could possibly do is to try my best to return to my independence as soon as possible. (B)</p>
<p>Crying and weeping couldn’t solve any problems. I must confront the reality, and do something I could do. (F)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section14-1359105311410511">
<title>Perception of self</title>
<p>Perception of self is the second super-ordinate theme that addressed how disability-related impairment affected the participants’ identity and the psychological adjustment they experienced that have made them focus less on the distress of the loss and more on PTG.</p>
<sec id="section15-1359105311410511">
<title>Loss of the physical self</title>
<p>In early period of injuries, most participants were shocked to experience their impairment of body. They felt angry about the loss of control of their bodies and worried whether their injured limbs would be amputated. They often became whimsical at the doctors’ different assessments about their injuries. Moreover, repetitive dressing and following surgeries are huge challenges they have to face. They feared looking at their bloody wounds, just as D described: ‘Not until three months later I could have the courage to take a quick glance at my fractured legs.’ Similar sentiments were expressed by E:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know how well I am going to be. It’s such an embarrassment to walk lamely. You can’t imagine the feelings when I saw others walking with problems on their legs. I am asking myself if I would become one of them. (E)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As the only patient to have received amputation, participant F described her experience after the procedure: ‘I couldn’t believe what just happened. It was part of my body. When I see others, I couldn’t help staring at their leg because mine has gone.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1359105311410511">
<title>Self as survivor</title>
<p>Although some participants complained about their adversity, they also sometimes felt fortunate to have made such a narrow escape from death. In this study, four participants congratulated that they were survivors of MVA. Comparison with other patients was one of promoting factors to their perception of being a survivor. In all instances participants made and thought that other people were much worse. Making these downward comparisons reinforced their certainty that they would get better and made them realize how lucky they had been. As B and D described:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Compared with the dead and amputated, I seem to be in paradise [he was the only survivor in the accident and two others died on the spot]. (B)</p>
<p>Once I saw a patient with a high paraplegia, I stopped crying. Compared to her, I have nothing to complain about. (D)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For A and F, encouragement from a doctor was a trigger of their perception of being a survivor:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Doctor said, patients with such serious injuries normally had to be amputated, but my legs have been saved. (A)</p>
<p>There were three patients in the emergency room at that time, and obviously we had a slim chance of surviving, but I did make it. (F)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1359105311410511">
<title>Enhancement of self-efficacy</title>
<p>Recognition of themselves converted from being a ‘victim’ of the accident to a ‘survivor’ of trauma brought inspiration. As a result some participants were concerned less about the impairment of the body, rather focusing on the rebuilding of their inner strengths, such as the enhancement of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy refers to personal judgments of how well one can organize and implement actions in specific situations that contain ambiguous, unpredictable, and possibly stressful elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311410511">Bandura, 1982</xref>). In this study, four participants demonstrated an enhancement of self-efficacy during their recovery process. They presented with a positive image to themselves and greater endurance to sufferings. Telling the stories about their struggling with the injuries, they showed pride for their own courage. Through downward comparison, D elaborated: ‘Patients who suffered more severe injuries than I do could still lead a happy life. So I have no excuse not to make it.’</p>
<p>For participant A, the views of others reinforced his self-efficacy:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>During skin grafting, I received local anesthesia because of my bad overall condition, but I just tolerated the huge pain without even crying. The doctor joked ‘You must be a communist.’ [Communist could refer to a tough person in China.] When my relatives saw me changing dressings, they couldn’t help crying while I held my tears back. They were really surprised, ‘you’re such a brave guy’ … I had stepped on the threshold of hell, and I realized that everything, compared to the marvels of life, could fade. (A)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For participant F, her self-efficacy enhancement was derived from her own perception: ‘I have to face the sufferings that most of us cannot bear, but I learned that I’ve been through the toughest time I’ve ever known. No matter what happens later in my life, it would be no big deal.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1359105311410511">
<title>New possibility</title>
<p>During the recovery process, four of the participants reported the emergence of new possibilities in life, developing new interests, and perhaps embarking on significant new paths in life. Participant A used to enjoy going out with friends before the accident, but now he preferred spending his leisure time on a book or a computer. He used to be a car salesman, but planned to establish a small store after recovery. Participant E even appreciated the experience for giving him time to study: ‘I was so occupied before. During the stay here in hospital, I picked up my old professional literatures and linked them to my practical experiences, it might be the biggest harvest for me right now.’</p>
<p>Participant F decided to change her lifestyle thoroughly: ‘I was a career activist before the accident, and after this, I might as well be a Little Woman.’</p>

<sec id="section19-1359105311410511">
<title>Perception of connection</title>
<p>The third super-ordinate theme lies in changes of personal relationships that participants perceived and how they disengaged from sources of negative support and gained PTG from positive support.</p>
<sec id="section20-1359105311410511">
<title>Indifference of relationships</title>
<p>Each participant of this study described what they felt most deeply was the changes in relationships. Their feelings may vary from two different extremes as described by two Chinese sayings, either ‘when trouble occurs at one spot, help comes from all quarters’ or ‘no sooner has the person gone away than the tea cools down’. Participant A elaborated that the unexpected suspension of connection impacted him greatly. He could not understand why such good friends lost contact after the accident. Participant B had the similar feeling: ‘Some friends, who used to play together well before the accident, just phoned you but did not come to see you and did not mention doing you a favor.’</p>
<p>Participant E felt distressed because his wife did not support or console him, only quarreling with him:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Having given so much emotion, I couldn’t accept that my wife still quarreled with me after we survived such a disaster. Maybe I should believe the proverb ‘a couple is like the birds, originally living together while flying separately when disaster befalls’. (E)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participant D was distressed by the changes of colleagues’ relationships. She used the metaphor ‘no sooner has the person gone away than the tea cools down’ to describe her feelings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1359105311410511">
<title>Kindness of relationships</title>
<p>Compared to their negative experiences about the relationships, the participants were more affected by the help given beyond expectation. All participants admitted they felt a greater sense of intimacy, closeness to others after the trauma. For two unmarried participants, as the only child of a family, their deeper touch came from their relatives, friends and neighbors:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Some old neighbors, without contacting each other for five or six years, still came to see me on purpose and gave me a red packet [red paper containing money as a gift]. … I just worked for two months, my colleagues came twice and brought me money or presents. It’s quite inconvenient for me to go outside or pee, and they just asked to help me. It’s really a great surprise. (A)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>B was also greatly touched by his neighbors. Especially, when he saw many elderly neighbors in their 70s or 80s still visited him with presents.</p>
<p>For married participants, they felt intimacy in their marriage. C commented the accident had made him see how nice his wife was. Two female participants (D and F) accentuated how important roles their husbands played during their journey toward recovery:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Since the accident, my husband has accompanied me day and night to make me happy. And he bought flowers for me on Double Seven Festival. Specially, you know, he had never bought flowers for me before (Smile). I never realized how significant my husband is to me, but now I see without him I can’t get through the suffering at all. (D)</p>
<p>My husband was really nice. In the last five months, no matter how busy he was, he was always with me every night. (F)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1359105311410511">
<title>Transformation of interpersonal attitude</title>
<p>During interaction with others, five participants said their attitude toward relationships was transforming gradually. They decided that they would change their interpersonal principles in the future: ‘Initially, I always thought that people would never be kind enough to help the disabled or donate their money. But through this disaster, I firmly believe that people should always help each other’ (A).</p>
<p>Participant B pointed out when communicating with others, he would somehow change the attitude later: ‘For fair-weather friends, I have no need to show sincerity; for the older, as younger generations, we should care more for them’ (B).</p>
<p>Three participants, who experienced the intimacy of couple relationships, said they would take actions as rewards to their spouse. Just as participant F stated: ‘I treated my husband badly before. In my later life, I would be a soft woman and care more for him.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1359105311410511">
<title>Increased sense of empathy and altruism</title>
<p>Empathy was centered on the feelings and emotions participants experienced and altruism focused on the desire to help others. Four participants in this sample described a new sense of empathy for others that had not existed before, particularly for persons who suffered disabilities. They described new empathy from their own experience, based on their own suffering. A comparison of participant E’s feeling about the Wenchuan and Yushu earthquakes demonstrated the changes of his compassion for others:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When the Wenchuan earthquake took place, I had no such deep feelings except some general concern. While in the Yushu earthquake, I was really sympathetic for the victims, there must be many people who suffered so much like me [the Wenchuan and Yushu earthquakes occurred pre-trauma and post-trauma for him, respectively]. (E)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participant A also described an increased sense of empathy for others, and this increased experience of compassion made him desire to help the suffering people:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My empathy just overflows now, I can’t control myself to help others. I’ve never thought like this before. There’s a community near my home, and I will be a volunteer after my recovery. Many disabled need help and I may do them some favor. (A)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As an heir of a family enterprise, B described his life filled with beer and skittles before the accident. After the accident, he experienced how difficult it was to defend legal rights, which made him feel more compassionate to the poor:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Defending one’s legal rights is such a difficult thing. You can imagine how one suffers when he lies on the bed, bearing physical pain while worrying about money. If my workers encounter accidents I must pay medical costs for them. (B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section24-1359105311410511">
<title>Perception of life philosophy</title>
<p>The final super-ordinate theme captured the participants’ apprehension about future life and what positive changes of life philosophy they perceived from their traumatic experience to buffer their apprehension.</p>
<sec id="section25-1359105311410511">
<title>An uncertain future</title>
<p>After the distress of the accident, participants have to bear an impaired body and long-term rehabilitation process. And such uncertainty of physical rehabilitation distressed them. Four of them stated their apprehension about the future. Participants A and B, two unmarried man, did not know if they could get back to normal and worried about potential disability as well as their marriage. As participant D had experienced an eight-month treatment and rehabilitation, she worried whether her job would be kept for her. Participant E was newly married and his career had just started up. He was unsure about the future of both his marriage and career: ‘There were too many uncertainties in the future, and I am just like a boat sailing on the sea, knowing neither where I am nor who I am.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1359105311410511">
<title>Priority</title>
<p>Priority is about a changed sense of what is of most importance in life, which is one of the elements of a changed philosophy of life that individuals can experience as PTG. All participants described they would attach more importance to families than before, which represented most Chinese ideas. Besides family, participants A and F expressed money as a newly emerged priority in their life: ‘I never paid attention to money, but now I know what money means to me. How can I treat my leg without money? Can’t money buy health? Yes, under some specific conditions, money does mean health’ (A).</p>
<p>Participant F is not a permanent resident in Shanghai. She felt lucky because it is in Shanghai that she had a chance to recover. However, without permanent residency in Shanghai, her medical fees cannot be included in her medicine insurance. Until the interview, her medical cost has accumulated to over ¥ 400,000: ‘Money was not a big deal to me. But in the future, I’ll pay more attention to it. You know, I have experienced nine operations, each costing at least ¥ 30,000. I must live on and make compensations.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1359105311410511">
<title>Appreciation of life</title>
<p>Though there are some uncertainties in the future, all participants articulated that they had a greater appreciation for life. It refers to an increased appreciation for their own existence, an easier life, and more enjoyment. Especially the three young men who were below 30, they all expressed they would cherish life and appreciate every day. This is exemplified in the following quotation: ‘I will cherish my life and work harder; after all, nothing is more important than life’ (A).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1359105311410511">
<title>Enhancement of wisdom</title>
<p>Five participants demonstrated they gained great insight into many things. During the process of self-introspection and interaction with others, they have better understanding about self, life, and human nature, especially for participants A and B. A comparison of pre-trauma with post-trauma self made them feel they had grown up a lot:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Before the accident, I just liked making friends and playing, thinking nothing about the future. Now I learn to consider my future. Yes, wisdom comes by suffering, one never grows up without a fall. (A)</p>
<p>I never considered others’ suffering before. This experience altered my perspective toward life, maybe it just changed my view of life. (B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section29-1359105311410511" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Four master themes emerged from the interviews, each with associated subordinate themes. Some reports concluded that PTG can be seen as a process, or an outcome. As a process, it has been conceptualized as a coping strategy or a form of coping effort in the face of enduring distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311410511">Zoellner and Maercker, 2006</xref>). A possible contribution of this study is the elaboration of the process by which injured patients in the rehabilitation stage begin to grow after a MVA injury. Our results demonstrated the sources of patients’ distress and how they progress from the initial trauma of impairment toward posttraumatic growth, which may help to improve health-care providers’ understandings of how injured patients change following the onset of physical impairment. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311410511">Tedeschi and Calhoun (2004</xref>: 7) include ‘enduring distress’ in their model of PTG. Our results are consistent with the previous PTG model and demonstrate that posttraumatic growth can coexist with distress, and PTG is a consequence of struggling with a traumatic experience.</p>
<p>Some themes of this study showed similarities with what has been reported in other studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311410511">Tedeschi and Calhoun, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311410511">2006</xref>), which confirmed that PTG did present in different cultural backgrounds. However, precise interpretation requires thorough knowledge of Chinese sociocultural contexts and the participants’ physical status. As for interpersonal relationships, participants A and B, as unmarried men, experienced a less significant change in family relationships. As the only child, they will always be the focus of their parents. Besides, the kind help from the community (neighbors) brought them great psychological impact. While C sighed, had he not only one child but five, would he be visited by a different one each time in hospital? With the implementation of the One-Child policy in China, the family size shrinks, which demonstrated a weakened capacity of families to cope with trauma both in terms of material and emotional support, the health-care provider working with injured patients should build more connection to the community for more support to them. Additionally, money was a priority with significant implications in this study. This issue can derive from the specificity in the medical insurance system in China, examples are the one-time limit compensation, insufficient insurance coverage and uneven medical resource allocation, and the reality of the damaged body. Uneven medical insurance among different provinces may be a factor of great importance. For instance, four participants in this sample received different compensation because of a shortage of Shanghai’s household register. However, traumatic injured patients might need repeated operations, re-hospitalization, and further rehabilitative care. The cost is prodigious. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311410511">Read et al. (2004)</xref> reported in their study, despite the availability of insurance coverage for most patients, more than half of the study group felt the financial impact of their injury was moderate to severe and caused hardships for themselves and their families. All participants in this study have experienced at least three operations, with a cost varying from ¥ 100,000 to ¥ 500,000, paid by themselves temporarily. Thus, financial issues played a significant role throughout their treatment and rehabilitation. Additionally, change of money priority was one of the drives for patients with their eager to return to work. This study may provide a recommendation to clinicians when communicating with patients the presence of PTG, the influence of varying sociocultural contexts, and individual differences should be considered.</p>
<p>This study suggests clinicians working with patients injured in MVA better identify the patient’s specific experience and thus modify their interventions to best fit the patient. The health-care providers can promote the patient’s recovery by assisting them to admit reasonability of distress, focus on positive changes in relationships, live in the moment, and cope with the future actively.</p>
<p>The findings of this study have several clinical implications in terms of strategies to facilitate PTG. Previous studies determined that searching for meaning of life did build a more substantial base in growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311410511">Tedeschi and Calhourn (2006)</xref> emphasized that PTG tends to be more likely to develop when the individual ruminates, trying to make sense out of what has happened, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311410511">Tedeschi and Kilmer (2005</xref>: 235) also contended: ‘Distress is somewhat easier to tolerate if one recognizes a meaningful and valuable aspect to the experience.’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311410511">Park et al. (2008)</xref> reported that survivors who had immediate rumination after the event would have higher Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) scores. In our results, the construction of meaning is clearly consistent with the above conclusions, for all participants in this sample experienced a searching for meaning after their traumatic experience. They showed better PTG experiences and fewer signs of distress when they succeeded in finding meaning. This suggests that clinicians’ active engagement with meaning making can be an effective avenue to foster PTG.</p>
<p>Another unique implication of this study pertains to how environmental resources, such as interpersonal interaction from family, community, and the hospital contexts, contributed to the PTG of injured patients. Health-care providers are in a position to address patients’ environmental resources, such as establishing an interpersonal atmosphere which allows the client to explore the possibility of growth, or promote the individual’s perception of environmental resources, which is of importance in the initiation of PTG.</p>
<p>Future research should focus more on individuals for whom the PTG process does not naturally occur, perhaps by external facilitating progress through strategies based on the themes discussed here.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-1359105311410511">
<title>Limitation</title>
<p>Participants in this study were patients at the convalescence stage in hospital. More awaiting challenges will emerge when they return to their homes and society. Whether they will demonstrate better adjustment or transform their PTG experience into action after discharge (such as interpersonal connections, altruistic acts) remains uncertain, which may need further longitudinal studies.</p>
