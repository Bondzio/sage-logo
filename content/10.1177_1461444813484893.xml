<p>For as long as there has been fiction, fans have authored parodies, knock-offs, and rewrites. The Internet, however, brought about an explosion of unauthorized fan fiction on a scale never before seen. Whereas a great deal of attention has been paid over the past 15 years to the effects of the rise of the Internet on copyright in music, less attention has been paid to the effects of the rise of the Internet on copyright in fiction and on the relationship between authors of fiction and their fans.</p>
<p>In <italic>Fan Fiction and Copyright</italic>, Schwabach, Professor of Law at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, deals with a subset of fan fiction called ‘fanfic’. Fan works might include both works of fiction and non-fiction; ‘fan fiction’ includes authorized and unauthorized fan fiction, whether published or unpublished; ‘fanfic’ refers to fan fiction published only online without the consent of the author or rights-holder, for an audience of other fans (p. 8). <italic>Fan Fiction and Copyright</italic> deals with this last category.</p>
<p>In this short and highly readable book, Schwabach first reviews the legal issues at hand: can fictional characters be copyrighted? What sorts of characters fall under copyright? Secondly, he addresses three main ways that the authors of underlying works’ interests conflict with those of the authors of fan fiction. Authors and fans are, according to Schwabach, on an inevitable collision course (pp. 143–144). Schwabach concludes with some brief final thoughts on how this collision course might be averted.</p>
<p>To start, Schwabach addresses two basic questions. Firstly: are the underlying works or characters, upon which the fanfic is based, protected? On what basis are characters in underlying works protected? Drawing on the relevant American legislation and jurisprudence, as well as a romp through many helpful and entertaining examples of the various forms of fanfic from slash to <italic>yaoi</italic> to Ships (p. 10), Schwabach provides ample interpretation of the current state of American copyright law as it pertains to fanfic. To grossly over-simplify, the dominant test of whether copyright subsists in an underlying character (along with the usual test of originality and assuming that the copyright has not yet expired) is the ‘sufficiently delineated’ test. To be subject to copyright, the character must be ‘sufficiently delineated’ as having a developed individualized character; rather than being an archetype or stock character, the character must be one-of-a-kind and well-defined (Chapter 2 and p. 40).</p>
<p>Secondly, Schwabach asks: if the underlying works are protected, does the fan work infringe on that protection? He concludes that, in some cases, fan fiction can rely on fair use and parody defenses in American law, while in other cases, fanfic is neither a parody nor fair use. The contours of fair use as it applies to fanfic are far from clear, but Schwabach illustrates with extensive examples.</p>
<p>From here, Schwabach goes on to examine the tenuous relationship between authors and fans. Relationships between authors of underlying works and authors of fan fiction often begin on good terms; Marion Zimmer Bradley and JK Rowling both originally encouraged fanfic. Schwabach delineates three situations, however, which give rise to conflict. Firstly, the author of the underlying work might object to the way that a character or other element of their work is used or portrayed in fan fiction. In some cases, for example, authors have objected to the portrayal of a character in sadomasochistic or gay fanfic (pp. 94–99). Secondly, authors of underlying works may find themselves in danger of infringing the copyright of their fans’ fiction and thus unable to carry their own work forward unhindered by the chilling effects of copyright. This happened to Marion Zimmer Bradley, prompting her to reverse course and prohibit all fanfic (pp. 110–114). Thirdly, the author may have an interest in preventing borrowing or copying directly from the underlying work. JK Rowling prevented the publication of a Harry Potter encyclopedia that contained substantial verbatim copying of her work. The Lexicon was later published in modified form (pp. 126–131).</p>
<p>This book has many qualities that recommend it. It provides an ample discussion of fanfic in various media, including fan art, fan videos, and ‘filksongs’—fan song parodies (p. 78).</p>
<p>The book’s biggest shortcoming is that, although Schwabach identifies many negative consequences of the current state of the law, and although he finds US law on copyright as it pertains to fanfic to be very unclear to the detriment of both fans and authors, he fails to call for or suggest any specific reforms. Instead, he is happy to leave solutions to private contracts and the dissemination of principles and best practices (pp. 92, 146). This seems an inadequate solution to the sorts of problems he identifies throughout the book. For example, he calls ‘deeply disturbing’ the reasoning of the United States District Court for the Central District of California in MGM v. Honda, wherein the court granted an injunction to MGM to stop the broadcast of a Honda commercial that made use of a James Bond-esque character. Schwabach notes that:<disp-quote>
<p>…the name ‘James Bond’ appears nowhere in the commercial, and in appearance the actor driving the car shares with James Bond (whose appearance, as noted, is ever changing) only the characteristics of being male and Caucasian, and perhaps fairly good-looking—not a rarity among movie leads. (p. 38)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Schwabach suggests that the domain over which MGM was able to claim copyright was not simply the character James Bond, but the entire ‘action/spy/police hero’ genre (pp. 38–39). Schwabach also shows that copyright has been used to suppress the ‘localization’ and appropriation of American fiction around the world in ways that, he argues, puts copyright in the service of ‘implementing a world monoculture’ (p. 78). Contracts and best practices seem inadequate responses to these and other disturbing effects that this book, to its great credit, highlights.</p>
