<p>Peter Norton’s <italic>Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City</italic> is a seminal contribution to our understanding of the twentieth-century American city. It is also a fascinating study of power and the interaction between organized interest groups and normative conceptions of terms such as justice, efficiency, and freedom.</p>
<p><italic>Fighting Traffic</italic> is fundamentally a study of how the automobile won primacy in the streets of American cities over the course of the 1920s. The establishment of the hegemony of the automobile was no automatic outgrowth of the new technology’s development, but rather required a fundamental reconceptualization of the public street and its purposes. Accommodating the American city to the rapid and indefinite growth of the automobile necessitated a change in public understanding, from streets as public spaces to be used by all, to streets as conveyor belts for automobile traffic.</p>
<p>One of Norton’s major contributions is to inform (or remind) readers just how contested the rise of the urban motor age was in American cities. The brutal reality of urban traffic accidents in the 1910s and early 1920s made the conflict between the car and the pedestrian a live political issue in cities nationwide. Civic responses during this era—including parades in the street and public memorials honoring children killed by cars—appealed to the traditional view of the street as a place pedestrians have a right to occupy. The implication of this view was that motorists bore full responsibility for accidents harming pedestrians. In this early era before the traffic light, city policemen also upheld this traditional conception, focusing their efforts at public order on controlling cars rather than getting people out of the streets. In Cincinnati, civic activists in 1923 even managed to call a public referendum on an ordinance requiring “speed governors” inside cars within the city to forcibly prevent cars from exceeding speeds of 25 mph. (Heavy industry mobilization assured that this ordinance was handily defeated at the polls.)</p>
<p>Over the course of the 1920s, the conception of the street began to change, with the push of a not-so-invisible hand from industry interests (termed “motordom” by Norton). Norton describes this alteration as taking place in two stages. First, the conflict between cars and pedestrians was redefined as not an issue of “justice” (protecting the people’s right to the street) but as a question of “efficiency” best dealt with by experts. Traffic engineers take center stage at this point in the narrative. Norton shows that in the early and mid-1920s, traffic engineers were motivated by a utilitarian conception of the public interest, a conception that included a commitment to maintaining the high-density city as well as a multimodal urban transportation system with room for streetcars as well as the automobile. This conception—that cities are fundamentally thoroughfares for transportation—represented a marked change from the traditional conception of streets. The emergence of traffic lights, for instance, placed new regulations on not only cars but also the behavior of pedestrians. But the initial assumptions of traffic engineers also provided strong justification for continuing to closely regulate the presence and behavior of motor vehicles in the city, and for favoring alternative modes (like streetcars) that, by carrying more passengers, were more efficient from a traffic point of view.</p>
<p>Over the course of the 1920s, however, this viewpoint gave way to a conception of “motor freedom” energetically promoted by motordom and its allies. Norton argues that as automobile sales reached a plateau in 1923–1924, the industry began to recognize that it must take the offensive in reframing public debates about city streets. With respect to public safety, a public relations offensive was launched to argue that the fundamental cause of accidents was not speed in itself—implying an inherent problem with the technology—but rather the problem of reckless drivers <italic>and</italic> pedestrians. Irresponsible pedestrian behavior was now to be regarded as a primary cause of accidents, a claim ironically made more plausible by the work of local safety committees promoting good sense and self-preserving behaviors among children and other pedestrians. At the same time, industry interests began promoting the idea that the solution to congestion (and safety) was to expand the “floor space” of transportation infrastructure by building more roads in and around cities—and eventually, more roads specifically dedicated for car travel, no pedestrians allowed.</p>
<p>In this part of the story, Norton effectively ties the question of cars in cities to larger questions about the role of government in defining and promoting the public interest with a detailed focus on Herbert Hoover’s National Conference on Street and Highway Safety, first convened by Hoover (as Secretary of Commerce) in 1924. For Hoover, the conference was a live experiment on his political philosophy of “associationalism,” which involved “bringing trade associations, business representatives, and other interest groups together in large national gatherings to work out agreements” (p. 180). The work of the National Conference included drafting model ordinances for cities and states to deal with safety and congestion issues. Norton shows how the influence of motordom within the association moved the Conference’s Committee on Municipal Traffic Ordinances to adopt a car-friendly model ordinance—soon published by the Commerce Department and widely adopted by cities and states—that rejected both traditional pedestrian rights and the traffic engineers’ prerogative to regulate transportation in the name of efficiency. Instead, the creed promoted by the ordinance was that of minimizing and simplifying regulation on motor traffic, full stop.</p>
<p>Norton’s book contributes to the literature on technology and society, but it should be of interest to a range of fields, including urban history, urban planning, and urban sociology. As the utility and sustainability of the contemporary auto-dominated city is increasingly questioned and challenged, Norton’s work of history offers important resources for would-be reformers in two senses. First, his historical work on the conflict between the car and pedestrians offers material for deconstructing common assumptions that streets always have been and hence always must be mainly thoroughfares for cars. Second, he shows that the reconfiguration of the meaning of a public space like the street is necessarily intimately tied to both the efforts of organized and interest groups and to the content of the rhetorical claims they advance. This suggests that future reform will require the emergence of not only attractive rhetoric but also a high degree of social organization among those who might stand to benefit from a return to shared streets.</p>
