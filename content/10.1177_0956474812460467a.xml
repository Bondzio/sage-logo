<p>As the British newspaper industry awaits its fate, an Australian journalist muses over the outcome of press inquiries Down Under</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>When it comes to media matters, Australia still looks to the Old Country for inspiration. You have the BBC, we have the ABC. You have <italic>Panorama</italic>, we have <italic>Four Corners.</italic> You have <italic>Strictly Come Dancing</italic> and Ant and Dec, we have <italic>Dancing with the Stars</italic> and Hamish and Andy.</p>
<p>And just as you had the Leveson Inquiry, we had the Finkelstein Inquiry. As Fleet Street awaits Sir Brian Leveson's report into phone hacking and press standards, the report that could change everything, the Australian media play a similar game of wait-and-see as the government decides whether to adopt any of the radical suggestions for regulation, contained in judge Raymond Finkelstein's report.</p>
<p>The Finkelstein Inquiry, or to give it its correct title, the Independent Media Inquiry into the Media and Media Regulation, was set in train by the same events that engulfed the British media last year — phone hacking. The difference was that over here we didn't have any. Not one recorded case. No celebrities coming forward making accusations, no police investigations, no suspicion of the dark arts no evidence of the bribing of police and public officials.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when the UK phone-hacking scandal broke anew last year, it was front page news in Australia. The tabloid malpractice at the <italic>News of the World</italic> was a story that everyone wanted to know more about, considering the tabloid's owner, Rupert Murdoch, was Australian by birth and built his first empire here. “Surely Australian journalists were up to it?” people would ask me at parties. As it turned out, no.</p>
<p>But lack of evidence did not stop Julia Gillard, the Welsh-born lawyer who became Australia's first female prime minister when she rolled Kevin Rudd for the Labor leadership two years ago, proclaiming that News Limited, the local arm of News Corporation, had “hard questions” to answer. The company was outraged. Ms Gillard later privately told editors she had meant her words in the sense that, if there had been a food poisoning scare at a McDonald's outlet in Paris, local consumers would want to be reassured that Aussie burgers were safe. And just like that (almost) the Finkelstein Inquiry was born. While many were suspicious that Labor's partners, the Greens, who referred to News Limited as the “hate media”, were keen to use the inquiry to punish the company, by the time it rolled around the focus had shifted to press regulation.</p>
<sec id="section1-0956474812460467a">
<title>Public hearings were anodyne</title>
<p>Now that sounds sensible, as regulation in a converging media world needs updating, except that the government had already commissioned the mammoth Convergence Review to deal with such matters, as part of a wide-ranging examination into Australia's changing media landscape. What was the point of another inquiry?</p>
<p>Compared with Leveson, the public hearings of the Finkelstein Inquiry were anodyne, held in old-fashioned rooms on university campuses. Julia Gillard did not give evidence, nor did Rupert Murdoch. Instead of Hugh Grant, we had a parade of academics and commentators, plus a few chief executives, including Greg Hywood, chief executive of the second-largest publisher Fairfax Media, who sensibly asked, “What problem are we solving here?”</p>
<p>It was a question that resonated and the issue of whether there was a problem remained unanswered until the written report: “The answer given is yes,” the report said, before listing what was wrong: market failure, public distrust of the media, numerous instances of the media harming people, failure of the existing regulatory systems and victims powerless to obtain redress. The report showed a schism between academia, particularly journalism academia and journalism itself. The academic critique of media in Australia is that its excesses, particularly the right-wing excesses of News Limited, need to be curbed and that the government is the appropriate part of the polity to do it.</p>

<p>This gap between academia and media institutions was underlined when a university journalism undergraduate did work experience at Melbourne's <italic>Herald Sun</italic> newspaper and wrote about the experience in her student newspaper. “Throughout the week, I was consistently subjected to patronising attitudes, being referred to as ‘Little Bud’, ‘Champ’ and ‘Kidlet’,” she wrote. “Men were also continuously and unnecessarily sexist, waiting for me to walk through doors and leave the elevator before them.” The newspaper's approach, she wrote, was “both deluded and wrong. Basic fact checking would have refuted many of the heteronormative, white, elitist opinions expressed in that building regarding gender and trans people.”</p>
<p>That said, it was certainly the belief of many, even existing regulators, that the present regulatory system had problems. Apart from the perennial “toothless tiger” complaint, the Australian Press Council was felt to be underfunded and obsessed with minor matters. My favourite example was the broadsheet section editor who spent months dealing with the Australian Press Council on a matter generated by a complaint from a disgruntled contributor. He approached the APC after she rejected his comment piece nine minutes after he submitted it. His contention was that she couldn't possibly have given enough consideration to his piece.</p>
<p>The APC later dropped the matter. Anyone can complain to the Australian Press Council about anything. It hasn't taken up the Press Complaints Commission's policy of not accepting third party complaints. Recent figures, which the council disputes, show lobby groups are taking advantage, with complaints from them doubling, while overall complaints grew at 10 per cent.</p>
<p>To replace the APC, the Finkelstein Inquiry called for the creation of a News Media Council, which would regulate news on any platform, print, TV, radio and online. The NMC would be government-funded and statutory with the power to impose sanctions on journalists and media companies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0956474812460467a">
<title>The Greens loved it; publishers hated it</title>
<p>Embarrassingly for the inquiry, it suggested this should extend to blogs that received as few as 43 hits a day. Reactions were predictable. The Greens loved it. News Limited and other publishers hated it.</p>
<p>The Convergence Review, in contrast, championed an industry-funded standards body, that would regulate news content from providers of a certain scale, but would be voluntary and lack statutory powers.</p>
<p>The APC chairman, Julian Disney, suggested a third way: statutory underpinning for a self-regulating body. Many in the industry can't stand Disney, a former head of a peak social services body. But he has succeeded in doubling funding to the council and expanding its staff, as the industry desperately tried to head off the more unpalatable alternatives proposed. Already, Seven West Media, owner of <italic>The West Australian</italic> newspaper and a large stable of magazines, has pulled up stumps, removing itself from the APC and setting up its breakaway Independent Media Council. It seemed the APC's days were numbered, as were the days of the statutory broadcasting regulatory, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, as both inquiries suggested a new system.</p>
<p>The Convergence Review was tasked with providing a road map through the changing media landscape and rewrite regulation to make it fit for purpose in a digital age. It was meant to be the main game while the Finkelstein Inquiry was attacked as a politically motivated sideshow. Its critics even managed to sabotage its Wikipedia entry, inserting: “Observers have noted that Finkelstein was simply a rabid left-wing troll, out to do the government's bidding in an attempt to place a cloak of respectability on its attempts to muzzle the government's media opponents.”</p>
<p>Media executives were quick to dismiss Finkelstein as well. “You do know there is nothing in this?” one executive told me over the phone at one point. “It's going to end up as a couple of sentences in the Convergence Review.” Yet after both reports were released, to silence from the government, which promised to respond later, something happened. Certainly the Convergence Review, which was polite about Finkelstein but disagreed with its central regulatory recommendations, seemed to be suggesting the Finkelstein recommendations had reached the end of their natural life.</p>
<p>The CR championed simplifying contentious media ownership rules down to two key tests: a “minimum number of owners” rule and a “public interest test”. These would replace cross-media ownership rules including the “75 per cent audience reach” and rules defining the number of owners allowed on particular platforms.</p>
<p>But then leaks suggested that communications minister Stephen Conroy was pretty keen on the News Media Council as a statutory entry and doing away with the self-regulation of the APC. He also favoured the public interest test to be applied by a new regulator in relation to media ownership changes (in addition to the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission's competition policy obligations). It would apply to such instances as Gina Rinehart, the world's richest woman through her vast mining fortune, buying into Fairfax Media and demanding seats on the board, a move that in terms of the politics of the play would be like the Barclay brothers demanding a seat on the Scott Trust.</p>
<p>But before the government could get around to responding, the industry was convulsed. One Monday in June, Fairfax, home to our oldest major newspaper, <italic>The Sydney Morning Herald</italic>, and Melbourne's <italic>The Age</italic>, announced a massive cost-cutting program that included the axing of 1,900 jobs. Its two metropolitan broadsheets would turn tabloid as the company renewed its massive push into digital.</p>
<p>Two days later, News Limited announced a massive restructuring, including merging its daily and Sunday metropolitan papers. It would only say that the number of planned redundancies would be less than Fairfax's. The print industry seemingly went from villains to victims. But where does it go from here? The ball is in Ms Gillard's court. Bullish Senator Conroy, who has had many beefs with News Limited, has sounded more conciliatory of late. He has submitted his recommendations to Canberra, but Ms Gillard has been keeping her powder dry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0956474812460467a">
<title>Sting of the debate has exhausted itself</title>
<p>The smart money is on a watering-down of Senator Conroy's proposals. Ms Gillard has already responded to media executives who wrote to her worried about curbs on free speech by suggesting they could institute a tougher self-regulatory system. The media says it has already done so. And much of the sting in the debate has exhausted itself. No-one could find any trace of phone-hacking in Australia and private detectives were employed sparingly.</p>
<p>Additionally, veteran Greens leader Bob Brown, who often bore the brunt of aggressive campaigning from News Limited and came up with the “hate media” label, retired. But Kim Williams, the classical music-loving former ABC executive appointed News Limited chief executive late last year, threatened to go to the high court to challenge any legislation that threatened press freedom. “Over-regulation is not appropriate when it comes to freedom of expression,” Mr Williams said.</p>
<p>One option Ms Gillard could push is for expected significant content providers to join an industry self-regulator, in exchange for gaining special legal protections, such as shield laws to protect journos and their sources. In one sense, it could all be academic. Australia will go to the polls next year, and Gillard's Labor is as unpopular as Gordon Brown's Labour government was. Few predict that her party will win an election in the timeframe needed to ensure that the complex legislation affecting media regulation is carried through.</p>
<p>The opposition Liberal Party is much more News Limited friendly. Opposition leader Tony Abbott was wandering around <italic>The Australian</italic>'s newsroom the other day, chatting to staff like they were old friends. Which, in fact, they are. Abbott worked at the paper as a feature writer early in his career. At the start of August, he gave a speech about the “freedom wars”, vigorously pushing back against many of the assumptions that underpinned Finkelstein.</p>
<p>The irony is that the Convergence Review styled itself as creating a principles-based regulatory framework that would be designed to prevent the enactment of media laws and regulation that punished one organisation and rewarded another. But events have shown that politicians have not entirely weaned themselves from enjoying using media regulation as a political football.</p>
