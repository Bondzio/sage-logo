<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim was to examine and compare the impact of HeartScore and coronary artery calcification (CAC) score on subsequent changes in the use of medication.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 1156 healthy men and women, aged 50 or 60, had a baseline medical examination and a coronary artery CT-scan as a part of a screening programme. Using the European HeartScore, the total 10-year cardiovascular mortality risk was estimated (≥5% risk was considered as high). Risk factors and CAC scores were reported to both the patients and their general practitioner. Six months after the screening, follow-up questionnaires addressing current medication were mailed to the participants.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A completed questionnaire was returned by 1075 (93%) subjects. At follow up, the overall use of prophylactic medication was significantly increased. Of those with CAC (<italic>n</italic> = 462) or high HeartScore (<italic>n</italic> = 233), 21 and 19%, respectively, received lipid-lowering treatment, while 25 and 32%, respectively, received antihypertensive treatment. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the presence of CAC was associated with an increased use of lipid-lowering treatment (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.2–4.0), while the presence of a high HeartScore was associated with an increased use of lipid-lowering (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.6–5.5) and antihypertensive medication (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.9–6.0).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Knowledge of present cardiovascular risk factors like high HeartScore and/or CAC leads to beneficial changes in medication. However, at follow up only a minority of high-risk subjects did received prophylactic treatment. CAC score was not superior to HeartScore regarding these motivational outcomes.</p>

<p>Over the past decades improved prevention strategies and treatment have reduced the rate of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) significantly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711428063">1</xref></sup> Despite this, CVD remains the major cause of premature mortality and disability in developed countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711428063">2</xref></sup> In approximately 50% of the cases, the first appearance of CVD is acute myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711428063">3</xref></sup> Thus, many apparently healthy people may live with subclinical CVD. Risk models, such as the European HeartScore or the Framingham risk score, are used to assess an individual’s global 10-year risk. Unfortunately, these stratification algorithms only predict 60–65% of cardiovascular risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711428063">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711428063">6</xref></sup> Thus, even in the absence of traditional risk factors, many individuals do suffer CVD.</p>
<p>In order to improve risk stratification of asymptomatic individuals, detection of coronary artery calcification (CAC) by non-enhanced multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) is of special interest. While HeartScore and Framingham risk score estimate the risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD), a non-enhanced MSCT detects subclinical CAD. CAC has been described as an independent marker of cardiovascular risk, providing a prognostic value superior to traditional risk markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711428063">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711428063">8</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the implementation of CAC scanning in risk assessment remains controversial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711428063">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711428063">10</xref></sup> and whether CAC screening alters clinical management and behavioural changes ‐ including adherence to preventive treatment or tobacco usage – is still uncertain, and data addressing this issue is lacking.</p>
<p>Consequently, the aim of this study was to examine and compare, if information from HeartScore and CAC score, detected on a screening examination had any impact on subsequent changes in medication and tobacco usage in a cohort of middle-aged women and men.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1741826711428063"><title>Study cohort</title>
<p>The study cohort included a random sample of 1156 subjects (545 men and 611 women) from the general population, born in either 1949 or 1959 and living in Region of Southern Denmark (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711428063">Table 1</xref>). These subjects were a subset of a larger random population sample (<italic>n</italic> = 1825) invited to take part in the Danish Risk Score Study (DanRisk) in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711428063">11</xref></sup> The purpose of the DanRisk screening study was to examine the presence and severity of CAC in healthy middle-aged Danes and to compare CAC with the European HeartScore. A total of 1257 subjects (69%) accepted the invitation to participate in the DanRisk study. However, 101 subjects were excluded from this substudy due to previous cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus. The protocol was approved by the Regional Scientific Ethical Committee for Southern Denmark (S-20080140) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.

<sec id="sec4-1741826711428063"><title>The DanRisk screening procedures</title>
<p>At study entry each participant underwent a medical history interview performed by the project-staff, focusing on known previous diseases and tobacco and medication usage. Current drug medication was recorded and classified in subgroups: antiplatelet (aspirin and clopidogrel), lipid-lowering, antihypertensive (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor antagonist, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, β-blockers, α-blockers, and centrally active antihypertensive drugs), and other drugs.</p>
<p>Cardiac risk factors, including body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipid parameters, were measured and calculated by standardized methods on the day of examination. Using the HeartScore model the total 10-year cardiovascular mortality risk was estimated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711428063">12</xref></sup> Increased risk was defined by a score ≥5%. For the measurement of CAC, MSCT was performed. Calculation of the total Agatston score was performed by summing up the scores from each of the foci found in the coronary arteries and classified by an experienced cardiologist as zero (score 0 U), low (score 1–399 U), or high (score ≥400 U).</p>
<p>Each participant and their general physician (GP) received a written report with selected test results: blood glucose, blood pressure, total cholesterol, CAC score (zero, low, high), body mass index, waist circumference, smoking status, and the estimated risk of cardiovascular mortality. The latter was defined and classified as follows: (1) increased risk (HeartScore ≥10%); (2) slightly increased risk (HeartScore ≥5% and &lt;10%); (3) low risk (HeartScore &lt;5%) with increased alertness in case of blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg, cholesterol ≥7.0 mmol/l, smoker or Agatston score ≥400; and (4) low risk (HeartScore &lt;5%). In case of any abnormal results, the participants were urged to contact their GP. Further, evaluation and treatment was left to the discretion of the individual GP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711428063"><title>Follow-up questionnaire</title>
<p>Six months after the screening examination, a follow-up questionnaire was mailed to the subjects and a free return envelope was enclosed. Questions raised and answer options included:
<list id="list1-1741826711428063" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Have you consulted your general physician since the screening? ‘Yes, for check-up after the screening/Yes, of other cause/No’,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Have you been hospitalized since the screening? ‘Yes – if yes, why?/No’,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are you taking any prescribed medicine? ‘Yes – if yes, which?/No’,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are you smoking? ‘Active/Stopped/Never’.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Two months later, a reminder was sent to non-responders. The returned questionnaires were continuously entered into EpiData version 3.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.epidata.dk">www.epidata.dk</ext-link>). Data entry was done twice and subsequently validated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711428063"><title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>Data was analysed descriptively according to type. Continuous variables were analysed by descriptive statistics, arithmetic mean, and standard deviation, whereas categorical variables were presented by contingency tables and percentages.</p>
<p>Categorical variables (medication usage and smoking status) were compared using Fisher’s exact test and Fisher‐Freeman‐Halton test for 2 × 2 and 2 × 3 tables, respectively, and continuous variables were compared with Wilcoxon rank sum test for independent groups. Paired categorical variables were analysed by McNemar’s test. In order to examine the association of baseline CAC/HeartScore with subsequent medication usage after 6 months of follow up, multivariate logistic regression was applied. CAC score (0 versus rest), HeartScore class (less than 5% versus rest) and medication usage at baseline were selected as explanatory variables. Since the CAC score and the HeartScore were not reported as continuous variables to the participant and the general physician these variables were analysed as dichotomized in the regression model. Significance level for all inference procedures was 5% without adjustment for multiple testing. Therefore, all inference results are to be considered of exploratory nature. All analyses were performed by with Statistical Analysis Software version 9.1.3 and Stata version MP 11.1.</p>

<p>A total of 1075 (93%) subjects replied and were included in this study. All baseline characteristics are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711428063">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711428063"><title>Medical treatment at 6-month follow up</title>
<p>As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711428063">Table 2</xref>, a significant increase was found in the use of lipid-lowering therapy and antihypertensive agents, even in subjects with very low risk (no coronary calcification as well as a HeartScore &lt;5%) an increase was observed. However, at follow up, only the minority of the high-risk subjects did receive preventive medication. Of those with CAC (<italic>n</italic> = 408 + 54) or high HeartScore (<italic>n</italic> = 233), 21% (<italic>n</italic> = 68 + 27) and 19% (<italic>n</italic> = 44), respectively, received lipid-lowering treatment, while 25% (<italic>n</italic> = 96 + 18) and 32% (<italic>n</italic> = 74) received antihypertensive treatment, respectively. In multivariate logistic regression analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711428063">Table 3</xref>), the presence of CAC was associated with a 5-fold greater likelihood of receiving antiplatelet therapy (OR 5.1; 95% CI 1.4–19.1; <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and a 2-fold greater chance of receiving lipid-lowering agents (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.2–4.0; <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), while antihypertensive treatment was not influenced. A high HeartScore was associated with a 3-fold greater likelihood of using lipid-lowering agents (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.6–5.5; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0008), and an almost 3.5-fold increase in using antihypertensive treatment (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.9–6.0; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, a high HeartScore was associated with a 2-fold greater likelihood of using antiplatelet medication, though this observation was not statistically significant (OR 2.3; 95% CI 0.8–6.6; <italic>p</italic> = 0.14). If the CAC score and HeartScore were analysed as continuous variables in the multivariate logistic regression, the conclusions were not significantly altered.

<sec id="sec9-1741826711428063"><title>Smoking status</title>
<p>At the time of study entry, 253 (24%) of the participants were current smokers. At follow up, 39 subjects had quitted smoking, whereas another 10 subjects (seven with a HeartScore below 5% and four without coronary calcification) started smoking again after the screening. The number of active smokers thus decreased to 224 (21%) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). When comparing the subjects who stopped smoking (<italic>n</italic> = 39) with those still smoking at the time of follow up (<italic>n</italic> = 214), no significant difference between the two groups’ risk profiles (CAC scores and HeartScores) was found.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741826711428063"><title>Control at the general physician and new hospitalization</title>
<p>At 6-month follow up, 267 subjects had consulted their GP due to control. Among those 102 of 233 (44%) with a high HeartScore and 24 of 54 (44%) with severe coronary calcification. In subjects with a HeartScore below 5% and no coronary calcification (<italic>n</italic> = 533), 100 (19%) did consult their GP following the screening. Increasing HeartScore or CAC scores were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of consulting the GP due to control after the screening (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Fisher-Freeman-Halton test; data not shown).</p>
<p>At follow up, the participants were also asked about any hospitalization since the screening. Forty-two participants reported new hospitalization of which six were admitted for cardiac reasons (cardiac arrest in one (HeartScore 6.2% and CAC score 94) acute myocardial infarction in two (HeartScore 9.4% and CAC score 166 U, and 2.2% and 0 U), coronary bypass surgery in one (HeartScore 29.0% and CAC score 1268 U), and atrial fibrillation in two (HeartScore 1.7% and CAC score 176 U, and 11.4% and 1260 U).</p>

<sec id="sec12-1741826711428063"><title>Screening effects</title>
<p>This population-based study of middle-aged asymptomatic subjects showed that cardiovascular risk screening, applying either HeartScore or CAC, generally increased the overall proportion of subjects treated with lipid-lowering and antihypertensive agents. However, at 6-month follow up only a minority of the subjects at highest risk received preventive treatment.</p>
<p>Previously, it has been suggested that the presence of CAC might be a motivating factor for lifestyle changes, including antiplatelet and lipid-lowering treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711428063">13</xref></sup> In our study, less than half of the high-risk subjects received preventive medicine 6 months after screening. This limited effect of the screening may be due to the fact that only 44% subjects with high HeartScore and 44% of those with severe calcification consulted their GP as they were advised to. Additionally, the deficient effect on motivational outcome may be partly caused by the participant’s unwillingness to changes as well as the lack of physician‐patient interaction in a screening-programme like DanRisk.</p>
<p>As an adverse consequence of the screening, the proportion of subjects treated with prophylactic medication also enlarged in the subgroups considered at low risk according to HeartScore and CAC score. Further, the screening caused an overburden of the GPs, since 19% of the subjects at low risk (low HeartScore and no CAC) consulted their GP after the screening, even though they had been informed to be at low risk for cardiovascular disease and no control was needed.</p>
<p>In a previous study, the presence of CAC did not appear to influence motivation for smoking cessation or smoking behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711428063">14</xref></sup> We found a significant reduction in the amount of current smokers at follow up. Neither HeartScore nor CAC scores were the determining factor for smoking cessation. Even though the proportion of current smokers was reduced after the screening, 21% of the subjects continued to smoke. Another ten participants actually started smoking after the screening. This adverse effect may be caused by knowledge of their risk profile giving them a sense of security and hereby having a negative impact on their behaviour.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1741826711428063"><title>Should CAC screening or HeartScore screening be used as systematic primary prevention?</title>
<p>HeartScore and Framingham risk score estimate the risk of developing CAD, whereas the MSCT detect subclinical CAD. The superiority of CAC as an independent marker of cardiovascular risk providing prognostic value above traditional risk markers has been extensively demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711428063">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711428063">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711428063">8</xref></sup> Despite the availability of these data, we still do not know if knowledge of CAC significantly alters lifestyle behaviours or leads to risk profile improvements. Our study indicates that screening for CVD, including HeartScore estimation and CAC score, increases the proportion of subjects treated with prophylactic medicine as well as causing cessation of smoking. Whether HeartScore or CAC score is the single most important factor is difficult to determine, since multivariate logistic regression suggests that the presence of CAC was associated with a greater likelihood of initiating treatment with antiplatelet agents (OR 5.1; <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and lipid-lowering therapy (OR 2.2; <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), while a high HeartScore increased the likelihood for treatment with both lipid-lowering (OR 2.9; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0008) and antihypertensive treatment (OR 3.4; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Previous studies report different outcomes. In the PACC project, comparing anatomically based cardiovascular risk prediction (CAC screening) with intensive case management in a sample of 450 asymptomatic active-duty US army personnel, there was no significant improvements in cardiovascular risk profiles associated with the knowledge of CAC, as opposed to intensive case management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711428063">15</xref></sup> However, in a more recent paper from the PACC project, the conclusion was the opposite. Presence of coronary calcification was associated with an independent greater likelihood of statin (OR 3.5; 95% CI 2.7–4.7) and aspirin usage (OR 3.1; 95% CI 2.3–4.1), while traditional risk factors had a smaller impact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711428063">16</xref></sup> In a follow up from the MESA study, the risk ratios for medication initiation were less impressive: 1.5 (95% CI 1.1–2.2) for lipid-lowering, 1.6 (95% CI 1.1–2.2) for antihypertensive, and 1.3 (95% CI 1.0–1.7) for antiplatelet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711428063">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even though we found improvement in potentially beneficial health behaviour or medical treatment, we also observed adverse effects, including participants overburdening the GPs, a trend towards over treatment and finally a few subjects restarted smoking during follow up. ‘The treatment-risk paradox’ demonstrating that the high-risk patients are often least likely to be treated, represents another important barrier to prevention strategies. Accordingly, we observed that the majority of the high-risk participants did not consult a physician even though they were advised to do so. Furthermore, we found that prophylactic medical treatment was widely deficit in these subgroups.</p>
<p>CAC screening of selected age-groups will be very expensive and due to radiation it is not completely free of risk. Opposed to this, a HeartScore screening is less expensive, not associated with any kind of risk and provides an established treatment-guideline. The disadvantage of a general HeartScore screening is that many individuals will still suffer from cardiovascular events in the absence of traditional risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711428063">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711428063">8</xref></sup> Before a CAC screening, a number of questions remain to be clarified: (1) despite the presence of calcifications, how many of these will nonetheless remain free of CVD; (2) despite prophylactic treatment, how many subjects with CAC will have cardiovascular clinical endpoints; and (3) how many subjects without CAC will suffer from CVD?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1741826711428063"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>Since this is an observational study with out a control group other factors than the HeartScore and CAC score screening might explain some of the observed changes at follow up. Also, surveys based on questionnaires, are subject to the risk of information bias. Baseline assessments were performed by an oral interview whereas the follow-up assessments were performed by a written questionnaire. These differences in methods may have influenced the results. However, in both cases, the information comes directly from the patients and hereby from the same primary source. There may be a risk of misunderstanding the questions and therefore filling out the questionnaire incorrectly. At the same time, self-reported answers may be understated or exaggerated, because the respondents may be too embarrassed to reveal the true answers. This includes the risk of selective underreporting by for example the high-risk subjects playing down their actual tobacco use.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1741826711428063" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Middle-aged Danes were very interested in participating in a screening with HeartScore and CAC score, and this screening did increase the subsequent overall use of prophylactic medication. However, 6 months after the screening, only a minority of the high-risk subjects received antiplatelet and lipid-lowering agents, while a relative large proportion of low-risk subjects were treated with inappropriate preventive medication. CAC score was not superior to HeartScore regarding these motivational outcomes.</p>
