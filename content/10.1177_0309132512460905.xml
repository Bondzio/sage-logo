<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>All too often within the pages of academic journals, human geography is heralded as uniquely ‘placed’ to address and have lasting impact upon the pressing concerns of our time, such as the (im)possibility of social good within a system of capitalist relations and the development of a new global science in light of environmental change. The scale and scope of such challenges in combination with the extant pressures upon academics and the nature of being critical have the potential to leave many geographers feeling helpless, depressed and defeated in the presence of such unrelenting forces. We might say that geographers feel disenchanted. There is, however, a spectre of hope in our midst. It appears in the form of a different way of being, working and writing that enables the application of geographical innovation, transforming dulling and deadening apprehension and paralysis into an affirmative, ‘reparative’ attitude. It offers a way of knowing that seeks nourishment through a multiplicity of experiences, welcoming surprise. It enables productive conversation and critique beyond disciplinary cultures of intellectualization and rationalization, promoting the identification of actual and possible impacts and scoping out future research possibilities. This new stance expands the ways in which researchers might think and do differently, enabling broader political and ethical interventions in the world. For geographers, this hope comes in the form of ‘enchantment’ – an open, ready-to-be-surprised ‘disposition’ before, in, with the world. In this article, we make sense of, and space for, the unintelligibility of enchantment in order to encourage a less repressed, more cheerful way of engaging with the geographies of the world.</p>
<p>As geographers of enthusiasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512460905">Geoghegan, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132512460905">2012</xref>) and playfulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0309132512460905">Woodyer, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0309132512460905">2012</xref>),<sup>

</sup> this paper was prompted (or perhaps provoked) by our reading of, and attempt to embody, the work of political theorist Jane Bennett, specifically <italic>The Enchantment of Modern Life</italic> (2001). She defines enchantment as: ‘to be struck and shaken by the extraordinary that lives amid the familiar and everyday … enchantment entails a state of wonder … a momentarily immobilizing encounter; it is to be transfixed, spellbound’ (p. 5). However, as she acknowledges, enchantment is not simply an occurrence of delight, namely ‘the pleasurable feeling of being charmed’, it is a simultaneous experience of the uncanny feeling of ‘being disrupted or torn out of one’s default sensory-psychic-intellectual disposition’ (p. 5). As Schneider explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>We become enchanted … when we are confronted by circumstances or occurrences so peculiar and so beyond our present understanding as to leave us convinced that, were they to be understood, our image of how the world operates would be radically transformed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132512460905">Schneider, 1993</xref>: 2–3)</p>
</disp-quote>
While enchantment is a term frequently used by human geographers to express delight, wonder or that which cannot be simply explained, the concept has yet to be subject to sustained critique, specifically how it can be used to progress geographic thought and praxis. This paper is a means to make sense of the place of enchantment in both our personal journeys as geographers and the journey of the discipline more widely in order to consider where a continuing engagement with enchantment may take us. Defining enchantment as a sensory experience of unintelligibility and a mood of fullness or plenitude, we track back through our disciplinary heritage to explore how geographers have employed enchantment as a force through which the world inspires affective attachment. Drawing on this rich history, our paper outlines an agenda for disrupting the discipline’s current habits of thinking and acting by adopting a more affirmative stance. Rather than call for a <italic>re-</italic>enchantment of human geography, we argue that the magic and our engagement with it has never gone away. Instead, we stress that a recuperation of enchantment is required, sharing the spirit of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0309132512460905">Whatmore’s (2006)</xref> attention to disciplinary repetitions rather than ruptures. In turn, we hope to offer ways in which we can (once again) enchant our geographical endeavours.</p>
<p>In this paper we review and extend the terrain of the debate surrounding enchantment. While this paper is about finding new ideas, it also seeks to make explicit those ideas already existing. We begin by investigating the disenchantment-enchantment couplet. Disenchantment has received less attention from human geographers; as a consequence the implications for what we describe as disenchanted ways of working have gone unnoticed. We move on to offer a close consideration of the longer lineages of affective attachment and embodied ways of being-in-the-world within human geography. In section IV, we consider how human geographers have recently worked with the concept of enchantment. In section V we put forward our new ‘enchanted’ academic stance in order to progress a more affirmative mode of critique within geography. We conclude by re-muddying the waters surrounding enchanted ways of working, in an attempt to pre-empt criticisms of our stance and provide further room for debate.</p>

<title>II The disenchantment thesis</title>
<p>Identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0309132512460905">Thrift (2008</xref>: 65) as ‘[o]ne of the most damaging ideas that has swept through the social sciences and humanities’, the overbearing cultural narrative of a disenchanted modernity and its debilitating effects have hung like a dark cloud over numerous academic fields. Metanarratives of disenchantment and their concomitant preoccupation with destructive power go some way toward accounting for the overwhelmingly ‘critical’ character of geographical theory over the last 40 years. This is evidenced by a fixation on the ethically and politically questionable character of the social processes that constitute our world. It can also be felt in the forceful critique of approaches that shift attention from repression and oppression to possibilities and potentialities. These approaches – such as those gathered under the umbrella of non-representational geographies – are charged with a lack of politics and critical application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512460905">Cresswell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132512460905">Nash, 2000</xref>). We show how the historical trajectory of the disenchantment thesis extends beyond the early 20th century treatise of Weber, who is often cited as its chief exponent, to the critical theory of the Frankfurt School and through to a later Foucauldian version of this metanarrative.</p>
<p>Disenchantment of the world manifests in what can be described as the post-enlightenment bifurcation of the rational and irrational. Broadly speaking, the disenchantment thesis maintains that ‘wonders and marvels have been demystified by science, spirituality has been supplanted by secularism, spontaneity has been replaced by bureaucratization, and the imagination has been subordinated by instrumental reason’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309132512460905">Saler, 2006</xref>: 692). As Weber argues: ‘The fate of our times is characterized by rationalization and intellectualization, and, above all, by the “disenchantment of the world”. Precisely the ultimate and most sublime values have retreated from public life’ (Weber, 1918, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132512460905">Gerth and Wright Mills, 1946</xref>: 155). Weber’s analysis formed part of a longer critique initiated in the late 18th century by the Romantics, and expedited through the <italic>Kulturpessismus</italic> of the 19th and 20th centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132512460905">Grismondi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309132512460905">Saler, 2006</xref>). The ‘cultural pessimists’ were wary of the premises of Enlightenment thought. They questioned the narrative of progress, equating it with control and enslavement. This distrust ‘only grew more powerful as the new rationality became more and more associated with materialism, utilitarianism and industrialism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132512460905">Grismondi, 2004</xref>: 438). For these pessimistic intellectuals, ‘spirit’ had evaporated from everyday experiences leaving but ‘a culture full of dead objects without inherent meaning or value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132512460905">Gross, 1982</xref>: 75, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132512460905">Grismondi, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The disenchantment thesis thus asserts the Enlightenment emphasis on reason and science ‘at the expense of other ways of apprehending and being-in-the-world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309132512460905">Saler, 2006</xref>: 695). Attempts to distinguish between enchantment and disenchantment occurred at a time consumed by an overwhelming drive to make sense of the world. Prior to disenchantment taking hold from the 18th century onwards, ‘even the most hard nosed empiricists in the seventeenth century gave some latitude to phenomena we would today deem peculiar’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132512460905">Schneider, 1993</xref>: ix). Drawing attention to the likes of John Aubery (antiquarian) and Isaac Newton (scientist), Schneider discusses how investigators examining enchanting phenomena could also be respected participants of the Royal Society – the first organization devoted to the empirical study of nature and the institutional birthplace of scepticism about enchanting peculiarities. This trajectory of disenchantment reveals credulity, namely the disposition to believe too readily, as a function of community norms that vary across time and space. In the disenchantment narrative, the modern self is predisposed towards rationalism and scepticism; an image that became all too prevalent at the cost of in-depth understandings of the ways contemporary individuals function (for example, see socio-economic critiques of the figure of <italic>homo economicus</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132512460905">Callon, 1998</xref>). In a disenchanted world, ‘there are no mysterious, incalculable forces that come into play, but rather … one can … in principle, master all things by calculation’ (Weber, 1918, cited in Gerth and Wright, 1946: 139). As we show in what follows, the ‘disenchantment’ continued well into the 20th century.</p>
<p>While the critical theorists of the Frankfurt School agreed with Weber’s descriptions of the capitalist organization of economy and society, they initially rallied against his evaluation. Committed to human emancipation from capitalist slavery through the revolution of the working class, they criticized Weber’s characteristic resignation and stoicism. Yet, as the inevitability of a working-class revolution diminished, their analyses of the Enlightenment became more pessimistic, leading to the eventual acceptance and incorporation of Weber’s evaluative analysis of capitalist society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512460905">Kearney and Rainwater, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0309132512460905">Turner, 1981</xref>). An example here is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132512460905">Adorno and Horkheimer’s <italic>Dialectic of Enlightenment</italic> (1997 [1944]</xref>) with its central theme of instrumental reason leading to the destruction of the ‘good life’. This is a bleak and pessimistic study of the Enlightenment, which they defined by the disenchantment or <italic>Entzauberung</italic> of the world. They argued that ‘the fully enlightened earth radiates disaster triumphant. The program of the Enlightenment was the disenchantment of the world; dissolution of myths and the substitution of knowledge for fancy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132512460905">Adorno and Horkheimer, 1997 [1944]</xref>: 3). Indeed, ‘the human mind, which overcomes superstition, is to hold sway over disenchanted nature’ (p. 4). Similarly in <italic>One-Dimensional Man</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132512460905">Marcuse (1964</xref>) examines how ‘progress’ – the growth of mechanization and Western democracy – results in political domination, repression and misery.</p>
<p>An anti-Enlightenment rejection of reason’s equation with progress and freedom is central to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132512460905">Foucault’s (1975)</xref> critique of modernity, including its institutions, discourses, practices and forms of subjectivity. The force of his critique of how the interface between modern forms of knowledge and power create new modes of domination is bolstered by the range of perspectives upon which he draws to substantiate his argument, namely psychiatry and medicine, punishment and criminology, disciplinary formation and apparatuses, and the constitution of the subject. While Foucault opposes the Frankfurt School’s analysis of power as anchored in macrostructures and thus descending and repressive, his treatise may be read as pessimistic. For Foucault, power is everywhere, circulating throughout a decentred field of institutional networks. It is woven into all aspects of social and personal life. Power, much like the disenchantment witnessed by Weber, is suffocating in its effect. Individuals are ‘caught within a complex grid of disciplinary, normalizing and panoptic powers that survey, judge, measure and correct their every move’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512460905">Best and Kellner, 1991</xref>: 55). While Foucault’s shift from an emphasis on ‘technologies of domination’ to ‘technologies of the self’ in the 1980s may caution against charges of fatalism, the efficacy of the agent and the nature of resistance remain nebulous. Power and domination continue as central motifs of Foucault’s work, turned to the mastering of one’s own body and desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512460905">Best and Kellner, 1991</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309132512460905">Thrift (2000</xref>: 269) notes, ‘In Foucault country, it always seems to be raining’.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, Weber’s aforementioned lament that a disenchanted modernity meant the impoverishment of human experience, by painting an image of the modern world as a place of anxiety, alienation and wanting (watchwords of disenchantment), affective attachment to that world has been ignored and discouraged. It was argued that:
<disp-quote>
<p>reason would free individuals from being enthralled by such enchantments; science would affirm that what had been taken for centuries as ‘wonders’ and ‘marvels’, when examined empirically and without reliance on revelation, would be explicable in terms of uniform natural laws. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309132512460905">Saler, 2006</xref>: 696)</p>
</disp-quote>
This is not to say there are no aspects of contemporary life that fit this disenchanted image. Take <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132512460905">Bauman’s (2007)</xref> critique of consumerism and the social consequences of its ubiquity, which describes the colonization of human relations by the logic of commodity markets. Rather, the implication of this representation is that within any experiences of enchantment the mood of attachment is likely ‘to pass without comment and thus without more sustained embodiment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512460905">Bennett, 2001</xref>: 4). Bennett explains that the disenchantment narrative ‘represents and sustains a specific range of aesthetic sensibilities; it enters into the moods, temperaments, habits, perceptual comportments, and somatic predispositions’ (p. 16). It moulds a particular way of being-in-the-world.</p>
<p>Given the political and ethical effects of this disenchanted way of being, it is deserving of more attention than currently granted within human geography. A preoccupation with reason and destructive power has imbued critical thinking with scepticism and negativity. As a consequence, geographers – and social scientists more broadly – are trained to be detached and discerning. Masterful knowing and moralistic judgement have been emphasized, with faith placed in the efficacy of debunking, ‘the idea that clear sight into injustice carries with it its own impetus for undoing wrong and enacting right’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512460905">Bennett, 2001</xref>: 129). In line with the beliefs of the Frankfurt School, it is assumed that emphasizing the pervasive power of ‘the system’ will inflame opposition to it. Yet, as we argue in the penultimate section of this paper, ever more descriptions of the power of ‘the system’ serve to strengthen it, attributing to it unwarranted causal powers and effectively performing its dominance. The implications of this mode of critical thinking – potential to engender impotence and fatalism – have been unduly neglected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132512460905">Cook and Woodyer, 2012</xref>): ‘the overwhelming impression is, too often, of a world that has given up the ghost’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309132512460905">Thrift, 2000</xref>: 269).</p>
<p>This disenchanted route to being critical prompts us to lose sight or rather feeling of the efficacy of the sensuous. Human geographers are and have for a long time been interested in questions of what it is to be-in-the-world. Below, we consider how enchantment has been referenced within human geography, specifically revisiting geographical studies that are today ‘more often cited than sighted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309132512460905">Powell, 1994</xref>: 211).</p>

<title>III Tracing enchantment within human geography</title>
<p>While Bennett has offered much to contemporary human geography, the preponderance and perhaps reliance upon her arguments has meant that the lineage of geographical engagement with affective attachment and enchantment has been obscured from view. A sense of enchantment has long been a defining feature of geographical study, albeit marked by contrasting approaches towards it. This disciplinary trajectory is put forward below.</p>
<p>Let us begin by tracking back to the work of the foundational figure of geography, Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859). Most famous for his work on Latin America, Humboldt was a scientist and humanist. He was primarily concerned with detailing nature, yet was also attentive to the character and causes of human organization. Heralded as the first great thinker of modernity, Humboldt believed that wonder was the foundation of science. He was a key figure in German Romanticism, a movement that sought to bring together, or at least reinterpret, scientific inquiry, philosophy and poetry. In the <italic>Earliest Program for a System of German Idealism </italic>(1796), Humboldt argued that ‘the highest act of reason is an aesthetic act’, meaning ‘the philosopher must possess as much aesthetic power as the poet’ (reproduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309132512460905">Schulte-Sasse, 1997</xref>: 72–73). Much like the early members of the Royal Society in the previous section, Humboldt was critical of a merely scientific approach to nature since a preoccupation with quantifiable material obscured and neglected the ‘higher enjoyments’ – experiences of beauty, charm and the sublime – of such study. Indeed, to quantify nature was, for Humboldt, to petrify this living, changing force into a fixed, dead mass, and to forestall appreciation of human finitude.</p>
<p>This tension between the finite and the infinite underpinned the Romantic argument for redefining the boundaries between science, philosophy and poetry. A blurring was necessary for attending to experiences ‘whose meaning cannot be exhausted by thought’ and accepting the provisional character of knowledge claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132512460905">Millan-Zaibert, 2004</xref>: 54). Here the aim of science was ‘not utility and control but wisdom and understanding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132512460905">Bowen, 1981</xref>: 225); not domination but interpretation. In Humboldt’s work it is possible to trace numerous varied concerns of our somewhat disparate discipline of geography; substantive, conceptual and methodological. It is the continuing tension between these different concerns that has shaped, and been shaped by, the discipline’s differing relation to enchantment. To illustrate this tension we look in what follows at the importance of humanistic approaches to geography, Marxist reactions to this mode of inquiry, and the recent emergence of Magical Marxism.</p>
<p>J.K. Wright (1891–1969) can be described as the father of the humanist approach to American geography. His work explored the influence of perception, imagination and the allure of the unknown upon geographical knowledge. In proposing the study of ‘geosophy’, Wright drew attention to the common experience of personal terrae incognitae – areas of which individuals have no first-hand experience but which become ‘known’ through imagination. Wright’s engagement with Goose Eye – a 3870-ft peak in the Mahoosuc mountain range – is useful here, helpfully illustrating how Wright regarded perception and imagination as integral to shaping geographical knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512460905">Keighren, 2005</xref>). As a child, Wright’s wonder became consumed by Goose Eye. Spending his summers in New Hampshire, he gazed upon and travelled to the summits of the Mahoosuc mountains. In subsequent years, Wright scaled many unnamed peaks seen from his ascents of Goose Eye, charting his emotional and aesthetic engagements with this landscape. These accounts are representative of both a sense of charm and uncanniness:
<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Charm:</italic> The air felt warm and delightful; great flat-bottomed cumulus clouds extended to the horizon in every direction, casting their slow-moving shadows on the huge slopes of the Old Speck opposite. We took off our shoes and stockings to dry them … and settled down in unhurried bliss. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0309132512460905">Wright, 1965</xref>: 636, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512460905">Keighren, 2005</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Uncanny:</italic> We … found our way up Goose Eye Brook valley, but as we progressed farther and farther the sky constantly looked darker and more ominous; gray mists drifted before the peak of the mountain, and occasionally terrific blasts of wind came roaring down the ravine, whirling showers of dry leaves. It impressed me as dramatic – even operatic. We were three lone travelers marching up into the vast terrible mountains, where lived frightful dragons and vampires. All the omens told us to turn back. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0309132512460905">Wright, 1965</xref>: 642, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512460905">Keighren, 2005</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
Wright’s work is instructive for thinking through enchantment as he attends to both the pleasurable sense of mystery and its simultaneous sinister edge. Attentive to the ‘disrepute in which subjectivity is often held in scientific circles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0309132512460905">Wright, 1947</xref>: 5), he stressed the critical distinction between illusion and delusion, focusing on ‘aesthetic imagining’, a process that encompasses the communication of the results of our imagining. It is therefore ‘entirely legitimate to enrich and add colour and vividness to the style of an otherwise objective geographical exposition’ (p. 8) as this brings the audience ‘down to earth from the lofty observation point of the objective’, allowing them to ‘see and feel through our eyes and feelings’ (p. 9). The aim, then, is not to delude the audience, but to render teaching and writing more evocative and thus powerful than they might otherwise be.</p>
<p>Wright’s ‘geosophy’ was an important antecedent to a broader humanistic geography concerned with the intimacy of people-place relations. To provide but a brief account of this field is necessarily to do a disservice to the diverse character of a rich and fragmented gathering of philosophies, methods and substantive studies. Broadly speaking, humanistic geography developed as a critique of the ‘peopleless’ spatial science of the 1950s, we might say a disenchanted approach that was insensitive to the humanity of both the geographer and those under study. To counteract the reification of human subjects as ‘little more than dots on a map, statistics on a graph or numbers in an equation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132512460905">Cloke et al., 1991</xref>: 69), humanistic geographers looked to phenomenology and existentialism for inspiration. Central to this move was ‘reawakening a sense of wonder about the earth and its places’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309132512460905">Relph, 1985</xref>: 16) by attending to direct human experience; fostering a ‘compassionate intelligence that seeks to see things in and for themselves’ (p. 16). These geographers were in the process of (re)enchanting the discipline. Extending the insights of Wright, a key thread of this work was a new attentiveness to the role of the body in making and giving meaning to the world. Conceiving the human subject as a preconscious yet intelligent subject, figures such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309132512460905">Seamon (1979</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132512460905">Buttimer (1976</xref>) focused on comportment, practice and feel, namely ‘the less visible, more subtle portions of human existence – at-homeness, habit, modes of encounter, dwelling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309132512460905">Seamon, 1979</xref>: 160).</p>
<p>This strand of research was deemed a necessary source of vitality and meaning for human geography: ‘people are always immersed in an environment and world … [we need to] understand the nature of this immersion, which provides the touchstone and background for any formal, scientific consideration of environmental elements and interconnections’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309132512460905">Seamon and Mugerauer, 1985</xref>: 3). A humanistic approach acted to remind geographers of their curiosity for place that made them geographers in the first instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512460905">Pocock, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309132512460905">Relph, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0309132512460905">Wright, 1947</xref>). In adopting such an approach, they were not seeking to deny the importance of technical forms of thinking, but to prevent their domination within the discipline. This was a forestalling of the dulling and deadening effects of rational disenchanted ways of being. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0309132512460905">Tuan (1974</xref>: 14) asserted: ‘if by rational we mean the conscious application of logical rules, then only a small part of most people’s lives is rational’.</p>
<p>Tuan’s concept of ‘topophilia’ was seminal in stressing the affective attachments that people form with places:
<disp-quote>
<p>[topophilia] can be defined broadly to include all of the human being’s affective ties with the material environment. These differ greatly in intensity, subtlety, and mode of expression. The response to environment may be primarily aesthetic: it may then vary from the fleeting pleasure one gets from a view to the equally fleeting but more intense sense of beauty that is suddenly revealed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0309132512460905">Tuan, 1974</xref>: 93)</p>
</disp-quote>
More broadly, Tuan’s writing was important for reinvigorating an affirmative attitude within the discipline. Reflecting on the writing of <italic>Topophilia</italic> in response to commentaries in this very journal, Tuan noted:
<disp-quote>
<p>Despair was almost a fashionable pose, though not for all of us. Not for me, and that’s where temperament comes in … the discipline of geography offered hope. Or rather, geography is by its nature reflective of a hopeful attitude. It is, after all, the study of the Earth as the home of human beings. And ‘home’ is a heart-warming word in any language. In geography, I see human beings exercising their freedom to create worlds that provide them with not only a means of survival but also the good life. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0309132512460905">Tuan, 1994</xref>: 358)</p>
</disp-quote>
As one might expect, given the critical thrust of geography as a discipline, <italic>Topophilia</italic> was critiqued for being too positive and bordering on nostalgic. Yet, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309132512460905">Relph (1994</xref>) contends in a commentary on <italic>Topophilia</italic>, constantly dwelling on the darker side of human existence is not a prerequisite for critical inquiry. In this paper, we share Relph’s sentiment that it is ‘a sad comment indeed on the present state of human affairs’ if ‘good’ environmental experiences have to be ‘regarded as somehow nostalgic and idealistic’ (p. 358).</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to acknowledge the weight of the critique levelled against a humanistic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132512460905">Daniels, 1994</xref>). This criticism centred on the humanistic geographers’ purported preoccupation with social meaning at the expense of inquiries into social inequalities, namely the neglect of the economic, social and political constraints that shaped the everyday lives of those research participants being studied. Humanistic geographers were chided for their idealism, for living in a world bereft of politics and difference. The study of social inequalities became the preserve of the parallel development of Marxist geography, which examined the social roots of these inequalities, particularly those entangled with the workings of the capitalist system. At the heart of this development was the search for more socially responsible alternatives to capitalist rule; a goal that shaped the didactic tendencies of this approach. Crudely put, then, this was the battle of agency versus structure. The parallel developments of humanistic geography and Marxist geography were underpinned by different conceptions of subjectivity; the creative artist versus the ideologically determined.</p>
<p>Yet our desire to compartmentalize approaches ignores the fact that certain key figures of the phenomenological tradition were also Marxist in political orientation, for example Merleau-Ponty. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132512460905">Daniels (1994</xref>) has lamented that humanistic geography ‘scarcely survived’ the weight of critique imposed by historical materialism (and it should be noted feminism and poststructuralist deconstruction), the recent emergence of Magical Marxism points to a coming together of this critical tradition with a more idealistic and humanistic approach. Drawing on a rich range of literary texts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512460905">Merrifield (2011</xref>: xii) proposes a new brand of ‘fantastical, dreaming Marxism’. Criticizing Marxist publications for their dry, predictable and alienating character, Merrifield looks to affirmative, creative, even poetic ways to inspire and reinvigorate political engagement: ‘Imagine a Marxism that’s not just critical analysis … Imagine a Marxism that opens up the horizons of the affirmative and reaches out beyond the dour realism of critical negativity’ (pp. 1–2). A Marxism that drafts a ‘more positive conception of life that ups the ante of mere critique and analysis, of yet another study showing how messed up our world is’ (pp. 1–2). Merrifield’s call to arms is not an escape from, but rather a reframing of, politics; a concern with reinventing rather than overthrowing society. It means ‘creating another fantasy in light of the ruling fantasy; its critical power doesn’t come from criticism but from an ability to disrupt and reinvent, to create and inspire hope’ (p. 18; for a working-through of these ideas, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132512460905">Cook and Woodyer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512460905">Millner, 2011</xref>). Magical Marxism seeks to change our perception of reality, marking the capitalist system as but a fiction operated by the bourgeoisie. This move towards an imaginative form of Marxism may be read as a reinsertion of humanity into geographical research similar to that injected by the humanistic geographers in the face of spatial science.</p>
<p>Tracing our disciplinary history through the contributions of Relph, Seamon, Tuan, Buttimer and others, we have highlighted the ways in which geographers have previously sought to (re)enchant human geography and its objects of study, particularly after its brush with the cold, calculating rationalities of spatial science. Our return to this history has revealed a lineage of geographical engagement with affective attachment and embodied ways of being-in-the-world, specifically the efforts by humanistic geographers to offer an alternative vision for geography: what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512460905">Pocock (1994</xref>: 356) described as ‘another way of ‘doing’ geography rather than modelling, hypothesis-testing or exposing the ills of capitalism. In so doing, enjoyment, indeed the ‘soul’ – of the subject was kept alive’. In what follows, we consider the ways in which human geographers have engaged with enchantment more recently.</p>

<sec id="section4-0309132512460905">
<title>IV Current geographical engagements with enchantment</title>
<p>In order to contextualize our more affirmative and enchanted stance towards geographical endeavour, we highlight three important themes emerging from recent geographical interest in enchantment: first, the contemporary turn to vitalist modes of being; second, cautions against the over-romanticism of this turn; and third, ‘new’ ways of appreciating and capturing this mode of being in geographical research.</p>
<p>Within contemporary human geography, enchantment has been most obviously accentuated by the bringing together of materiality and affect. Here, an appreciation of the productive capacities of materiality is forcefully asserted; materiality is shown to grab us, make us feel, even haunt us. In large part, this work is informed by poststructuralist formulations of the subject, whereby notions of subjectivity and agency are ‘untethered from their humanist anchor within, and as the essence of, human individuality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0309132512460905">Wylie, 2010</xref>: 102). Here one finds particular reference to Bennett’s work, not least because this field shares an ontological emphasis on an animated molecular materialism that is neither reductive nor mechanistic, but complex and vital. Such ontological thinking draws on the affirmationist philosophical trajectory beginning with Spinoza, and passing through Nietzsche to Deleuze. Focusing on the affective materialisms gathered under the name of non-representational theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132512460905">Anderson and Wylie (2009</xref>: 319) outline this vitalist understanding by thinking ‘outside the postenlightenment bifurcation of matter into primary and secondary qualities that underpin the distinction between – matter/form, material/immaterial, actual/virtual, material/discursive, mind/matter’. Here liveliness is emphasized as a feature of materiality that exceeds its crystallization into things and is independent of the subject. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309132512460905">Massumi (2002</xref>: 35) writes, ‘[a]ctually existing, structured things live in and through that which escapes them’. This excess, or immateriality, cannot be imposed (known), only exposed (felt).</p>
<p>Given this philosophical premise, such work is characterized by an emphasis on the sensory. As a sensory encounter of unintelligibility, enchantment is an affective force that can lead to a changed emotional state. While speaking of unintelligibility may imply a cognitive basis for enchantment, it is above all sensory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512460905">Bennett (2001</xref>: 5) describes this somatic effect as ‘a sense of having one’s nerves or circulation or concentration powers turned up or recharged’. It is a moment of acute sensory activity in which one is lifted from mundane existence, being simultaneously transfixed in wonder and transported by sense: ‘Thoughts, but also limbs … are brought to rest, even as the senses continue to operate, indeed … in high gear. You notice new colours, discern details previously ignored, hear extraordinary sounds as familiar landscapes of sense sharpen and intensify’ (p. 5). Bennett underscores the importance of the sensory to enchantment by asserting how it may be fostered by ‘giving greater expression to the sense of play’ and/or honing ‘sensory receptivity to the marvellous specificity of things’ (p. 4).</p>
<p>The importance of sensory receptivity to enchantment is powerfully illustrated by Holloway’s (2003, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132512460905">2006</xref>) work on meditative practices and séances, in which he examines how sacred space-times are enacted in and of the everyday through relational configurations of bodies and objects: the bodily movement and comportment of meditative practice, and interaction with incense, candles and mantelpieces. Belief in the spiritual is grounded in this embodied practice, the action of the body in and towards the world: ‘Seemingly everyday objects are patterned into a relational typology of sense, movements, rhythms and affective actions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132512460905">Holloway, 2003</xref>: 1967). Through this relationality, the everyday is reconfigured and revalued.</p>
<p>The entwining of matter with sensibility points to the plenitude central to experiences of enchantment. Within such experiences, a new circuit of intensities forms between material bodies. These affinities are not restricted to natural bodies; sites of enchantment also include the literary, machinic and electronic alongside structures, entities and events in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132512460905">Benjamin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512460905">Bennett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132512460905">Gell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132512460905">Miller, 2001</xref>). Whatever its site, the overall sensory effect of enchantment is ‘a mood of fullness, plenitude or liveliness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512460905">Bennett, 2001</xref>: 5). The critical faculties prized within the disenchantment thesis are suspended as one is caught up in the moment. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512460905">Bennett (2001</xref>: 156), this fullness is: ‘a feeling of being connected in an affirmative way to existence; it is to be under the momentary impression that the natural and the cultural worlds offer gifts and, in so doing, remind us that it is good to be alive’. She understands affirming the abundance of life to be a disposition of (most) humans, being ‘deeply installed in their bodies’ (p. 158). This reiterates how the sense of fullness in our modern world inspires deep and powerful attachments, indicating the ordinary, everyday nature of enchantment – somewhat <italic>qua </italic>humanistic geography – and its potential for informing a new enchanted academic stance.</p>
<p>Importantly, geographical work has also sought to critique Bennett’s conceptualization of enchantment by asserting that a lively materialism does not equate to a totalizing vitalism. In researching the ‘lives’ of tourist souvenirs at home, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309132512460905">Ramsay (2009</xref>) recognizes the productive capacity of materiality, but finds Bennett’s idea of enchantment as a ‘momentary, immobilizing encounter’ ‘too dramatic’. Instead, she develops the concept of ‘refracted enchantment’, considering how objects have an affective materiality: ‘both enlivened and mundane; enchanting and enchanted; processual and yet remaining in stasis as a residual affective trace’ (p. 212). Enchantment offers, she suggests, a way of understanding the complexity of materiality, through distance and proximity, estrangement and attachment. Wylie shares a similar sentiment. Writing about memorial benches, he discusses the illusion of enchantment and its constant displacement: ‘Something always takes their [enchanting moments] place, displaces and alienates them; in fact, we can argue, something is always already displacing the moment both without and within’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0309132512460905">Wylie, 2009</xref>: 276). Wylie’s work follows an alternative Derridean post-phenomenological trajectory, which conceives subjectivity in terms of loss; yearning for an unachievable coherent subject. Here there is a more haunting sense of enchantment, a theme that is central to the burgeoning field of ‘spectro-geographies’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309132512460905">Maddern and Adey, 2008</xref>). These geographies share a concern with how things and sites may be charged with ‘magical qualities’, which result from the folding together of different times and spaces. As such they seek out the extraordinary as it is experienced and practised in the ordinary.</p>
<p>Given the reliance of recent geographical work on Bennett, instructive anthropological approaches to enchantment have been obscured from view. The aforementioned moment of unintelligibility is particularly well described in Gell’s (1992) explanation of the enchanting or, in his words, ‘captivating’ capacity of art objects. Captivation or enchantment is, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132512460905">Gell (1998</xref>: 71) argues, a product of the ‘demoralization produced by the spectacle of unimaginable virtuosity’ that we experience in the art object’s presence; the art object embodies an agency that is essentially undecipherable to the spectator. Enchantment in this way makes us uneasy because it assaults our understanding of how the world operates and has associated implications for our practical competence in dealing with such moments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132512460905">Schneider, 1993</xref>). Yet Gell’s discussion of enchantment as captivation inflects a bitter edge to a term commonly used in a positive, even romantic regard. To captivate is also to capture, enslave and dominate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132512460905">Miller (2001</xref>) explores this theme further by drawing on Gell’s ‘captivation’ in his discussion of ‘possession’. Taking the example of his dislike for the décor of his own home, Miller examines how the material home can exercise an enchanting power over its inhabitants: the home comes to possess its occupants. Possession refers here to an unwelcome presence that needs to be exorcized by the act of appropriation, an act that demonstrates practical competence when our sense of intelligibility is disrupted. This broader discussion fleshes out the uncanny element of enchantment that is too often obscured in accounts drawing on Bennett’s conceptualization. A similar sentiment of haunting is found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132512460905">McEwan’s (2008)</xref> examination of the presence of ghosts and ghost stories in enchanted modernities. This work reveals a less optimistic politics of enchantment that nevertheless produces affects and even real political effects.</p>
<p>The present geographical engagement with enchantment points to a different way of doing things: giving space to the just perceptible and more-than-rational. Indeed, understanding enchantment as abounding in everyday life requires us to find a way of appreciating enchantment as it is experienced in the ‘moment’: interrogating ‘the flash of the felt before we wrap it up with contemplation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512460905">Dewsbury, 2003</xref>: 1930). The problem lies in apprehending the ‘varied, surging capacities to affect and to be affected that give everyday life the quality of continual motion of relations, scenes, contingencies, and emergences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0309132512460905">Stewart, 2007</xref>: 1). Appreciating enchantment in the ordinary requires attention to the possibilities for how our world might be otherwise that pass below our threshold of routine perception. We thus need to ‘slow the quick jump to representational thinking and evaluative critique long enough to find ways of approaching the complex and uncertain objects’ that enchant us (p. 4).</p>
<p>Dewsbury’s (2003: 1920) work on witnessing space offers a route through the quagmire of ‘grasping the pure thusness of being’. He argues that ‘witnessing sees us moving away from being “all too human” to being open to the world as a whole’ (pp. 1908–1909). He writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>it represents a genuine and important shift away from thinking life solely in terms of <italic>power knowledge</italic>, that which orchestrates meaning and purpose in life through the orientation of the self constructed to serve … towards apprehending <italic>life knowledge</italic>, that which speaks to the affirmation of life itself, to our feelings, desires, and beliefs that give us investments in the world and which makes us feel that we belong. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512460905">Dewsbury, 2003</xref>: 1928, author’s emphasis)</p>
</disp-quote>
Notwithstanding the different conceptions of subjectivity at play, this focus on life knowledge represents a disciplinary return to a longer trajectory of ‘intuition’ as advocated by the humanistic geographers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309132512460905">Seamon (1979</xref>), specifically ‘the nature of noticing and attention’ imbricated in our encounters and mergings with the world. It is the in-betweenness of these relationships that is interesting here, namely the communicative relationships between things that evoke feelings of love, care and attachment. This attention helps us move away from causal relationships of power, thereby establishing an emotional and ethical context for our relations. This counters the normative detached role of the academic. In challenging a disregard for what lies at the margins of sense, researchers are required to realize that ‘we are only part of the world, of the making of place, for the world (materialities) believes in us as much as we (emotions) believe in it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512460905">Dewsbury, 2003</xref>: 1908). Witnessing immateriality is not easy because it ‘calls us to betray our roots in habitable modes of thinking’ (p. 1923), but it is a worthwhile task as we now outline in discussing the benefits of adopting a new enchanted academic stance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0309132512460905">
<title>V A new enchanted academic stance</title>
<p>In this section, we turn our attention to the wider applicability of enchantment in terms of adopting ‘affirmative modes of critique’, namely ways of thinking critically that challenge extant habits of masterful knowing and moralistic judgement based on the objective separation of the detached critic. We offer here two ways to approach the adoption of a new ‘enchanted’ academic stance: first, in relation to the aforementioned modes of researching that work towards apprehending life knowledge; and, second, in terms of developing ways of working that allow for experimentation with alternate worlds and possibilities. These so-called stances relate to two different yet interrelated ethical-political projects. As we suggested in the previous section, the practice of gathering and grasping rather than explaining and evaluating is a political undertaking: ‘accepting the call to make the world’s witness … emphasizing the world’s unspoken demands in the present’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512460905">Dewsbury, 2003</xref>: 1908). This is a politics based on being open to the ongoing enactment of the world, and the ‘creation of new values and senses in the affirmative constitution of life and human existence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132512460905">Hayden, 1998</xref>: 6). Dewsbury’s sense of grasping as a political undertaking is useful for expanding the ways in which researchers might think and do differently, enabling broader political and ethical interventions in the world. We focus on this idea here.</p>
<p>Recently extant habits of critical thinking have been challenged from a number of disciplinary perspectives, specifically within social and political theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512460905">Bennett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132512460905">Coles, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132512460905">Connolly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132512460905">Orlie, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0309132512460905">Rendell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0309132512460905">Sedgwick, 2003</xref>). Latour offers a forceful challenge, likening the practice of critical theory to the thinking of popular conspiracy theorists: ‘In both cases … it’s the same appeal to powerful agents hidden in the dark acting always consistently and continuously, relentlessly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132512460905">Latour, 2004</xref>: 229). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0309132512460905">Sedgwick (2003</xref>) echoes this sentiment by identifying critical analysis as ‘paranoid thinking’, whereby theoretical investigations are reduced to ‘revelation of already known underlying power structures and forms of oppression within society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132512460905">Brown et al., 2011</xref>: 123). Focusing on the already known gives it rhetorical power with real effects. These effects materialize in a repressive form of power that engenders what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512460905">Bennett (2001</xref>) refers to as a ‘why bother?’ mentality. Drawing on Sedgwick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512460905">Gibson-Graham (2008</xref>: 615) consider the power of representations of capitalism as an ‘obdurate structure or system’ in discouraging non-capitalist initiatives. People experience impotence in its presence: ‘capitalism [is] strengthened, its dominance performed, as an affect of its representations’ (p. 615). The possibilities of other already existing diverse economies – a host of non- and alternative-market transactions, unpaid and alternative forms of wage labour, and non- and alternative-capitalist enterprises – are closed down, forced to hide in the light as they wait to be ‘performatively enacted’.</p>
<p>This way of working is reproduced through academic training in how to be discerning and detached. To be critical is to ‘penetrate the veil of common understanding and expose the root causes and bottom lines that govern the phenomenal world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512460905">Gibson-Graham, 2008</xref>: 618). As a result, scepticism and negativity cast a dark shadow over our theorizing. Critical thinkers, then, aim to negate the possibility of surprise, such as that experienced in moments of enchantment. Sedgwick refers to this as the adoption of an ‘anxiety-mitigating’ stance.</p>
<p>Geographical challenges to such habits of thinking take shape around calls to value utopianism and hope as part of critical thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512460905">Anderson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132512460905">Harvey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309132512460905">Pinder, 2002</xref>), thereby finding ‘space for … imagining other possibilities and desires’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309132512460905">Pinder, 2002</xref>: 238). Considering the performativity of knowledge – ‘what the pursuit and production of knowledge does’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132512460905">Brown et al., 2011</xref>: 122) – is central to this endeavour. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132512460905">Law and Urry (2004</xref>: 404) argue: ‘to change our understanding is to change the world, in small and sometimes major ways’. What and how we think are political and ethical decisions and statements. Recognizing academics’ constitutive role in social-material worlds places a new burden of responsibility upon them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512460905">Gibson-Graham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132512460905">Law and Urry, 2004</xref>). This responsibility has been addressed by so-called scholar activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0309132512460905">The Autonomous Geography Collective, 2010</xref>); however, Sedgwick and Gibson-Graham are calling for a more general and widespread appreciation within academia. What is needed is a ‘hopeful, reparative, nonjudgemental affective stance’ that ‘enable[s] us as thinking subjects to inhabit a diverse landscape’ of force and open ourselves to the positive energies thereby made available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512460905">Gibson-Graham, 2008</xref>: 626). The value of this approach has been recognized not only in economic geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132512460905">Carnegie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0309132512460905">Roelvink, 2009</xref>) but also in recent work on ecological crisis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132512460905">Amsler (2010</xref>) describes how crisis thinking in relation to anthropogenic climate change may be reoriented around opportunity rather than fear by placing social relationships, imaginative capabilities and existential uncertainty at its core. As a result, crisis becomes a productive rather than catastrophic event.</p>
<p>As Gibson-Graham and Amsler (among others) show, it is within our capabilities as academics to challenge powerful, potentially destructive cultural narratives. We can seek out and develop ‘thinking techniques and research practices that proliferate new knowledge, thereby contributing to … possibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132512460905">Brown et al., 2011</xref>: 126) – the possibility of diverse alternatives to capitalist transactions, the possibility of opportunistic rather than fearful responses to anthropocentric climate change. This can be achieved by following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0309132512460905">Sedgwick (2003</xref>) and practising a weak form of theory. By refusing to extend explanation too widely or deeply, weak theory is ‘little better than a description of the phenomena which it purports to explain’ (Tomkins, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0309132512460905">Sedgwick, 2003</xref>: 145). Indeed, the power of description over explanation was discussed by the humanistic geographers encountered earlier in this paper in their efforts to (re)energize the discipline. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309132512460905">Seamon (1979</xref>: 156) argued: ‘Explanation … has fostered a growing malaise’.</p>
<p>The value of ‘mere description’ has been addressed most recently within the sociological literature, as Latour argues:
<disp-quote>
<p>No scholar should find humiliating the task of sticking to mere description. This is, on the contrary, the highest and rarest achievement. However, we worry that by sticking to description there may be something missing, since we have not ‘added to it’ something else that is called ‘explanation’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132512460905">Latour, 2005</xref>: 136–137)</p>
</disp-quote>
Yet, he continues, ‘[i]f a description remains in need of explanation, it means it is a bad description’ (p. 137). One might pause here to consider the efficacy of the rich descriptions amid the pages of the journal <italic>Cultural Geographies.</italic>
</p>
<p>The power of description in weak theory is its ability to bring the marginal into being, thereby disrupting dominant assumptions about social and spatial organization and working against the realist epistemological habit of capturing and assessing already known underlying power structures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309132512460905">2</xref>
</sup> Whereas ‘[s]trong theory has produced our powerlessness by positing unfolding logics and structures that limit politics’, a focus on ‘weak theory’ has the potential to de-fetishize power opening up a ‘differentiated landscape of force, constraint, energy, and freedom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512460905">Gibson-Graham, 2008</xref>: 619). Gibson-Graham practise this technique by documenting ‘marginal’ economic activities and movements – enterprises like consumer, producer and worker cooperatives organized around an ethic of solidarity, local and complementary currencies, non-profit organizations that put social objectives before business objectives. This act of describing constitutes ‘new objects of study and investigation, making them visible as potential objects of policy and politics’ (p. 620). As an example of becoming open to possibility and performing other worlds that we can and do inhabit, this project shows how, by setting our realist epistemological habits to one side, we can ‘explore rather than judge, giving what is nascent and not fully formed some room to move and grow’ (p. 620). The notion of academic ethics has been expanded: ‘Ethics in our understanding involves not only continually choosing to feel, think and act in particular ways but also the embodied practices that bring principles into action’ (p. 620).</p>
<p>Practising weak theory demands a ‘reparative’ as opposed to ‘anxiety-mitigating’ stance: a way of knowing that seeks nourishment through a multiplicity of experiences and thereby welcomes surprise. Enchantment, as mood, is an effective and affective means through which to foster a generosity of spirit that renders the self more open to the surprise of other selves and bodies. This is achieved through its affirmation; a new context for the self emerges. The expanded experience afforded creates a deep sense of attachment to the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132512460905">Abram, 1996</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512460905">Bennett (2001</xref>: 158) contends: ‘Attachment to the world is the contingent source of receptivity and generosity towards other bodies. In the hem of this matrix, ethical principles, rules, ideals, and sensibilities are born.’ This generosity of spirit enables us to encounter other possibilities in real terms: ‘if you believe in the world you precipitate events, however inconspicuous, that elude control, you engender new space-times, however small their surface or volume’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132512460905">Deleuze, 1995</xref>: 176, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512460905">Anderson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512460905">Bennett (2001</xref>), Sedgwick outlines the importance of <italic>bodily</italic> disposition to ways of thinking, specifically the ways in which the process of changing our thinking and thereby our world is co-implicated with the process of changing ourselves. How we choose to think and theorize ‘makes us a condition of possibility of new … becomings rather than a condition of their impossibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512460905">Gibson-Graham, 2008</xref>: 618). Through the embodied experience of enchantment, we can experiment with techniques and sensibilities that may cultivate turning points through which new possibilities for life and living may be witnessed, invented and acted upon.</p>
<p>Take, for example, research conducted as part of the AHRC’s Landscape and Environment programme. In ‘Imagining Change: Coastal Conversations’, a video readily accessible online,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309132512460905">3</xref>
</sup> Stephen Daniels explains the vital role of the arts and humanities in understanding coastal change, drawing on the creative engagements of cultural geographers, alongside performance and visual artists. Rather than understanding coastal change through the ‘reason of charts of sea level change’, Simon Read uses visual art to track the environmental shifts which he comes to appreciate through living on a boat. Caitlin DeSilvey uses experimental narration to fold together the history and future of a Cornish harbour that cannot be preserved in the face of environmental change (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132512460905">DeSilvey, 2012</xref>). This ‘palliative curation’ is reminiscent of the folding together of different times and spaces that is the subject of the aforementioned ‘spectro-geographies’.</p>
<p>Enchantment demonstrates the alternative power of life knowledge, of grasping, not explaining. Shifting attention to the affirmative rebalances the rhetorical power currently afforded to the sceptical and negative. Being open to a ‘differentiated landscape of force’ provides us with sparks of positive energy that forestall feelings of impotence. Writing about the effect of reading affirmationist philosophical descriptions of our lively, quirky world, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132512460905">Jacobs (1996</xref>: 383) argues that ‘[o]ne’s sense of political possibilities is unavoidably energized’. Enchantment acts as a motivating force, providing a spark of energy with political and/or ethical impetus. Through it we might create a ‘proto-political domain of added strength’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0309132512460905">Thrift, 2005</xref>: 145) that permits belief in the possibility of alternative narratives, of other ways of being and doing, even in the face of powerful, repressive cultural narratives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132512460905">Cook and Woodyer, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The Piedmont Project, a faculty development programme for sustainability conducted at Emory University in Atlanta, demonstrated the power of enchantment in effecting social change. The programme comprised a two-day workshop incorporating a lunchtime walk in the little-known woods on campus alongside short presentations and group discussions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132512460905">Bartlett (2008</xref>) reports the importance of the enchanting nature of the walks – experiencing moments of sensory expansion, a sense of being outside oneself, and attachment to and empathy for living things – and the sense of restoration that they provided. A strong correlation between the affect of enchantment and lasting changing patterns of sustainable behaviour was noted.</p>
<p>In many cases, the positive power of enchantment lies in its expression of ambivalence – the simultaneous experience of charm <italic>and</italic> the uncanny. It does not deny that there is bad in our world, but offers us a means of not becoming paralysed by it. Let us illustrate this by taking as an example Shelley Sacks’s social sculpture, which has been richly documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132512460905">Cook et al. (2000</xref>). In her installation, ‘Exchange Values’, seemingly banal banana skins – dried, cured and blackened – are woven together with recordings of St Lucian banana farmers posing questions for western consumers: ‘Who is this “British Housewife”? We keep being told about the “British Housewife”!! How does she know what a banana’s supposed to be?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132512460905">Cook et al., 2000</xref>: 340). Combined with the dialogues, the banana skins make abstract processes of capitalist trade more intimate and engaging. Importantly, the installation is not the final product; it only works with the audience’s emotional and visceral registering of enchantment: a simultaneous experience of charm and uncanniness in the presence of these sights, smells and sounds. The being-in-the-world played upon here is simultaneously critical and affirmative. Enchantment offers a practical means of negotiating the bitter-sweet, of being energized rather than paralysed. The <italic>Uneven Geographies</italic> exhibition held at Nottingham Contemporary in 2010 provided further examples of affective ‘commentaries’ on the politics of globalization. The artists in this exhibition used a range of media and techniques to make the usually obscure and opaque visible and legible. In so doing, they presented a different way of seeing trade relations and world events. Works included Coca-Cola bottles with screen-printed statements such as ‘Yankees go home!’ and quirky-looking model gardens that interspersed poetry and humour through the structure of comics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132512460905">Farquharson and Waters, 2010</xref>). Such examples play with the ideas of a ‘new’ Magical Marxism encountered earlier in the paper.</p>
<p>As human geography researchers, we need to open ourselves up to be enchanted. We need to halt the rush to evaluative critique, taking time to appreciate the small things and allowing ourselves to be nourished by the energy their surprise affords. We acknowledge that an openness to enchantment does not always equal ethical behaviour – indeed ‘affective energies are unruly and protean forces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512460905">Bennett, 2001</xref>: 156) – but it is a state from which such behaviour is possible. Adopting an affirmative stance is a project that will require perseverance, specifically repeated acts of <italic>retuning</italic> the self to such forces. It is this restless experimentation with the re-orientation of knowledge toward surprising futures that should now be our project, not exposing real truth, but inventing other truths.</p>

<title>VI Openings: provoking a debate</title>
<p>This paper has sought to question the accepted rules for thinking and acting in human geography, making space for ways of being, doing and writing that are less to do with rationality and/or reason. We grant you this was a bold move. It was a move we had to make as we registered our growing disillusion with not only the practices of a discipline about which we are passionate, but also its ability to address and have lasting impact upon the pressing concerns of our time.</p>
<p>We fully expect the affirmative stance proffered here to be critiqued by some (possibly many); the figures of Noys and Adorno come to mind. In a critical reading of contemporary Continental Theory’s commitment to metaphysical ontologies and inventive potential, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309132512460905">Noys (2010</xref>) offers a forceful critique of affirmationism and its dominance as a largely unmarked doxa. For Noys, negativity is fundamental to political antagonism as affirmationism lacks the social and political agency to actuate its politics. He argues that valorizing the powers of life has become a substitute for actual political activity. As such, Noys writes of the poverty of affirmationism’s vitalism, labelling it a philosophy of defeat. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512460905">Adorno (1998</xref>) argues that making the positive a condition of critique necessarily tames it. To renounce critique for not providing a positive solution is to reinforce society as it stands. In comparison, ‘the false, once determinedly known and precisely expressed, is already an index of what is right and better’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512460905">Adorno, 1998</xref>: 288). Indeed, Adorno accuses ‘those talking most about the positive’ as being ‘in agreement with destructive power’, using the positive as but a ‘thin veil’ to delude themselves of their belief (p. 288). These ripostes raise important questions about whether the affirmative stance that we outline can ever reach any meaningful, plausible accommodation with more constitutionally critical currents within our discipline. Here we draw strength from the anchoring of this approach within the disciplinary record. (Re)turns to enchanted ways of working – in geographical engagements with affect and materiality, and moves toward a magical form of Marxism – demonstrate the persistent need and desire for an affirmative approach to geographical endeavours.</p>
<p>Such an affirmative approach should not be equated with a naive optimism and a permanently pleasurable disposition for two key reasons. First, optimism is based on a blind faith that things will work out for the best, rather than engagements with ‘actually existing potentialities and possibilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512460905">Anderson, 2006</xref>: 705). It is pertinent to note how the term ‘naive’ is more commonly associated with optimism rather than pessimism, thereby reinforcing the disenchantment thesis outlined earlier. This enchanted stance is more than ‘futile speculation or idealistic dreaming … disconnected from reality’ (p. 694) because it is embedded in our phenomenal everyday worlds. The task, if we choose to accept it, is tuning the self to be attentive to the surprise and the positive energy which our everyday realities can afford.</p>
<p>Second, enchanted ways of researching attend to the simultaneous experience of charm <italic>and </italic>uncanniness in moments of enchantment. They allow us to express, and work with and through ambivalence. They encourage us to rethink what being ‘critical’ means. The task is to be more modest and less deterministic in our academic endeavours and to appreciate the power of being so, to use enchanted ways of working to engage with and learn from others beyond the academy as the likes of Shelley Sacks richly demonstrate.</p>
<p>The real openness to be addressed, however, is the insistent and consistent need to compartmentalize human geography research, whereby certain aspects are allowed to fall into relative obscurity and others are denigrated for thinking in ‘new’ ways. A firm appreciation of our historical disciplinary trajectory, as put forward in this paper, goes some way towards tempering arguments about the radical (and in some cases subversive) nature of work conducted from an affirmative stance, specifically work that tends to be descriptive rather than explanatory. More attention needs to focus on recognizing threads of commonality around which we can gather and regroup. We have shown and continue to argue that we should not be drawing solely on contemporary currents within social and political theory to rethink the nature of being critical and the character of critique in human geography. We must return to and take strength from our disciplinary heritage and intervene in this wider social scientific debate with and through our historical lineage of engagement with questions of attachment, wonder and enchantment.</p>
<p>We are not expecting all human geographers to be enchanted all of the time – but what we propose in this paper will hopefully encourage a shift in geographical thinking – however small. For, as enchantment shows us, the small, fleeting and just perceptible are far from insignificant.</p>
