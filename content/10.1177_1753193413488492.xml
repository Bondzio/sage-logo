<body>
<p>Berger’s article demonstrates that a third of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) treated primarily by steroid injection have a good result at 1 year. Patients with an initial good response to steroid were more likely to benefit from an additional injection. This correlates well with our own findings in Fife, where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193413488492">Jenkins et al. (2012)</xref> showed that only one third of patients treated primarily with steroid injection had gone on to have surgery within 5 years.</p>
<p>Steroid injection has traditionally been considered a short-term fix in CTS. More recently, longer-term improvement in symptoms has been reported following steroid injection. It is generally regarded as a safe procedure, with no evidence to suggest that multiple injections are harmful in any way.</p>
<p>Given that patients do not require time off work following injection, there is significant potential advantage to patients who respond to this treatment. Most surgeons would opt for the simplest, safest, most effective treatment for themselves. Steroid injection clearly hits the buttons of simplest and safest. In a select group of patients it is as effective as surgical decompression.</p>
<p>In symptomatic patients with mild or borderline changes on nerve conduction studies, steroid injection may be the first-line treatment of choice. Patients with moderate to severe CTS, who are informed of the risks and benefits of conservative versus operative management, may choose steroid injection over Carpal Tunnel Decompression (CTD) for reasons of convenience or work commitments. Most patients will be able to choose whether to repeat the injection or not from the experience of their response to the first injection. As with any steroid injection in the hand, there are no well defined parameters for how many and how often they can be given, but common sense will usually prevail.</p>
<p>We may well find that informed consent and experience will equip our patients to make the right decisions regarding their own treatment. This, in turn, will shape the carpal tunnel service of the future, in which steroid injection is likely have a higher profile.</p>
