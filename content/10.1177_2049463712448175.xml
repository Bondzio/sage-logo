<body>
<p>Thank you for the very positive feedback about the first issue of the <italic>British Journal of Pain</italic> (<italic>BJP</italic>), which was co-commissioned with Associate Professor Roger Knaggs and focused on opioids. Thanks also to those who contributed, especially those who wrote or reviewed articles.</p>
<p>Two articles in particular from the opioids issue have sparked discussions. The first, by Dr Roman Jovey, reviewed the North American approach to managing opioids, pain and addiction. The recent publication of the Prescription Costs Analysis for England<sup>1</sup> (data for the other countries are available) for primary care should compel us all to review our practices related to the initiation and continuation of opioid therapies. Additional material provided by Dr Jovey includes two examples of downloadable opioid contracts – both available to readers using the link below. The second article that has stimulated conversation far and wide is Dr Douglas Natusch’s critical exploration of equianalgesic opioid doses and the dearth of data to support common practices.</p>
<p>This current issue, which delves into the relationship and impact of education and pain, has been co-commissioned with Emma Briggs, who is the chair of the BPS Pain Education Special Interest Group. Topics include pain education as part of a wider policy initiative, interprofessional learning, distance learning and the strategies of the International Association for the Study of Pain to support pain education in developing countries.</p>
<p>As part of the marketing and developmental strategy for the <italic>BJP</italic> there is currently open access to the content of this and previous issues of the <italic>BJP</italic> and <italic>Reviews in Pain</italic> via <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bjp.sagepub.com/">http://bjp.sagepub.com/</ext-link>. Once articles for forthcoming issues have been accepted for publication and proofs have been copy-edited and approved, they are published on the web prior to going to print. The publisher refers to this ‘epub before print’ service as OnLine First. You can also elect to receive eTOCs (emailed updates of online content) through the site.</p>
<p>Since the publication of issue one, I have been delighted to receive expressions of interest from the membership and beyond to submit original pieces of work for potential publication. Please keep them coming as the <italic>BJP</italic> is about to make a formal call for papers. I would also welcome letters to the Editor or peer commentary about content. It is a possibility that letters/commentary related to topics that are ‘epub before print’ could be published in the same issue if submitted in a timely fashion.</p>
