<abstract>
<p>This qualitative study explored the coping strategies used by first-time Hong Kong Chinese mothers in adjusting to the demands of early motherhood. A purposive sample of 26 first-time Chinese mothers who had participated in a childbirth psycho-education program was interviewed in-depth at six weeks postpartum in respect to their coping strategies. Two main categories emerged: making personalized and achievable decisions and seeking emotional and spiritual solace. Implications for health professionals are discussed, including the need to support individual women’s personal resources and foster social networks to optimize maternal and infant health.</p>

<p>Transition to motherhood is a major developmental task in a woman’s life, which is marked by dramatic changes in personal identity, responsibilities, lifestyles, roles, and relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311415728">Nelson, 2003</xref>). Although many mothers are able to meet the challenges of parenting and derive satisfaction from the maternal role, others feel overburdened and become depressed in the perinatal period, which can have detrimental effects on their infants’ psychosocial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311415728">Gauthier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311415728">Ngai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311415728">Pawlby et al., 2008</xref>). Health professionals play a substantial role in supporting women through stressful experiences of maternal transition. It is important to develop interventions that are grounded in the life experiences of mothers, supporting existing coping resources, and creating the resources needed to promote positive adaptation.</p>
<p>Coping is conceptualized as the cognitive and behavioral efforts used to manage specific external and internal demands that tax an individual’s resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311415728">Lazarus and Folkman, 1984</xref>). Coping strategies have been broadly classified into problem-focused and emotion-focused coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311415728">Lazarus and Folkman, 1984</xref>). Women in different cultures and ethnic groups may adopt different sets of coping strategies in dealing with the multitude of role demands and stressors they encounter as mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311415728">Currie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311415728">Edge and Rogers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311415728">Jirapaet, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311415728">Radtke and Van Mens-Verhulst, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311415728">Carolan (2007)</xref> found that first-time Canadian mothers over 35 years were highly motivated in seeking out knowledge about infant risks in a bid to make informed decisions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311415728">O’Brien et al. (2009)</xref> contended that Australian mothers employed several cognitive and behavioral strategies such as seeking knowledge, problem solving, goal setting, positive self-talk, and the practice of mindfulness to assist them in dealing with the challenges of breastfeeding and early mothering. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311415728">Currie’s (2009)</xref> study on Australian mothers found that obtaining help, having a plan, and taking time-out were the main strategies used by new mothers to maintain a sense of wellness. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311415728">Edge and Rogers (2005)</xref> found that Black Caribbean mothers in the UK focused on personal agency such as self-efficacy and resilience as the primary means of dealing with distress during early motherhood. The Black Caribbean mothers also relied on spirituality as a source of strength, but they were reluctant to seek help for psychological problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311415728">Edge and Rogers, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311415728">Gichia (2000)</xref> also found that African-American mothers drew upon internal reserves, demonstrating the personal fortitude and ingenuity needed to perform their maternal role.</p>
<p>In Asian countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311415728">Liamputtong and Naksook (2003)</xref> studied the experience of Thai immigrant mothers in Australia and found that they sought social support from other Thais in the community to help them eliminate the feelings of isolation and loneliness. Another study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311415728">Jirapaet (2001)</xref> on HIV-positive Thai mothers found that mothers used both emotion and problem-focused coping strategies to meet their maternal role demands. These included altering their perception of the problem to control stress and seeking help from their social networks.</p>
<p>Although there is a growing body of literature on maternal coping from a cross-cultural perspective, only a few studies have investigated the experience of mothering within a Chinese social context. In a study of Chinese mothers’ experiences of parenting a child with Downs Syndrome, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311415728">Lam and Mackenzie (2002)</xref> found that self-reliance, seeking social support, and avoidance were the most frequently used coping strategies. In another qualitative study of 117 Taiwanese parents who had children with learning disabilities, three types of coping behaviors were identified, namely proactive behaviors, acceptance, and distraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311415728">Chang and Hsu, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311415728">Chen et al. (2006)</xref> found that acceptance and problem solving were the major coping strategies among 23 Taiwanese mothers with postpartum depression. In their study, Chinese mothers accepted the fatalism inherent in the Chinese socially constructed female role expectations of shouldering the majority of burden for both childcare and household duties. Mothers also actively employed problem-solving strategies and sought social support to help them cope with the challenging reality of caring for a newborn baby. The Chinese fatalistic belief originated in Buddhism assumes that life situations are predetermined by external, invisible forces, such as fate. Because fate cannot be changed, one has to accept it and endure it with courage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311415728">Chen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, previous studies mainly focused on mothers with disabled children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311415728">Chang and Hsu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311415728">Lam and Mackenzie, 2002</xref>). No studies to date have explored maternal coping with healthy infants during the early weeks of motherhood from women’s subjective experience in Hong Kong. The present study attempted to fill this gap through the exploration of coping strategies that women used in adjusting to the demands of first-time motherhood in Hong Kong. Knowledge of Chinese mothers’ coping behaviors can greatly equip healthcare professionals in the development of culturally sensitive care to assist the mothers in dealing with the demands of maternal role attainment. Thus, this study aimed to explore the coping strategies used by first-time Hong Kong Chinese mothers in adjusting to the demands of early motherhood.</p>

<title>Design and participants</title>
<p>A descriptive qualitative approach using content analysis was adopted to explore the coping strategies women used in adjusting to the demands of early motherhood among first-time Hong Kong Chinese mothers. Participants were recruited from a larger intervention study which examined the effects of a childbirth psycho-education program on learned resourcefulness, maternal role competence and perinatal depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311415728">Ngai et al., 2009</xref>). The intervention consisted of three one-hour weekly sessions which focused on cognitive restructuring, problem solving, and efficacy enhancement. Women were eligible for the intervention study if they were aged 18 years or above, Hong Kong Chinese residents, primiparous with singleton and uneventful pregnancy, and able to speak and read Chinese language. Women who had attended the childbirth psycho-education program were selected to participate in a semi-structured interview at six weeks postpartum using purposeful sampling to capture the participants’ diverse characteristics, such as age and socio-economic status. A total of 26 women participated in the semi-structured interviews. The mean age of the participants was 32.7 years (SD = 3.8). All the participants had at least a secondary school education. Over two-thirds of the women were employed (73.1%), with a median monthly family income of HK$28,587 (US$3665). The majority of participants had a vaginal delivery (61.5%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311415728">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Ethical approval was granted by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong–New Territories Easter Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews. A semi-structured interview guide was developed based on the aim of the study and a review of the literature on maternal transition. The guide consisted of open-ended questions asking women to describe their coping experience during early motherhood. Examples of these questions were: ‘How do you cope with the experience of new motherhood?’; and ‘How do you deal with problems encountered in childcare?’ The interview guide was assessed by two expert health professionals in midwifery nursing, two experienced midwives, and two Chinese mothers and the questions were regarded by them as appropriate.</p>
<p>At six weeks postpartum, the researcher telephoned the participants inviting them to participate in a semi-structured interview. The purpose of the study was explained. With their informed written consent, the interview was conducted by the researcher at the participant’s home. The participants were encouraged to express their coping experience in Cantonese. Each interview lasted for about 60 minutes and interviews were audio-recorded. Field notes were also taken. As the interviewer’s own experience and predisposition at the beginning of the research may introduce bias to the findings, the interviewer bracketed her prior experience and knowledge about motherhood and counteracted bias by reflexivity and self-criticism to ensure objectivity of the data being collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311415728">Graneheim and Lundman, 2004</xref>). This was done by maintaining a reflexive journal to reflect upon personal thoughts, feelings, beliefs, values, preconceptions, biases, and associations during the interviews. Participants were recruited until data saturation was achieved when additional participants did not uncover new ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311415728">Speziale and Carpenter, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359105311415728">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Content analysis was used to analyze the interview data which were transcribed verbatim. Content analysis involves the process of coding, creating categories, and developing themes. Coding refers to labeling a meaning unit such as words, sentences, or paragraphs containing aspects related to each other through their content and context. A category is a group of content that shares a commonality. It refers mainly to a descriptive level of content and often includes a number of sub-categories. A theme is an expression of the latent content of the text which links the underlying meanings together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311415728">Graneheim and Lundman, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The data analysis was undertaken in Cantonese as the original language and conducted simultaneously with data collection. Data were categorized and assigned code labels to the identified categories. Each term, sentence, and phrase representing an idea was identified and grouped into a category for analysis of emerging themes. Categories were reviewed for ambiguities and overlapping codes to ensure they were mutually exclusive. All transcripts were coded line by line, read and reread by the first and second authors independently. After independent coding, the researchers compared the themes in each interview, looked for commonalities and differences, and identified the overall themes that best described the participants’ coping behaviors in dealing with the demands of early motherhood. Quotations were then translated into English. The first author translated the quotations which were then subsequently cross-checked by the second author.</p>

<sec id="section5-1359105311415728" sec-type="results|discussion">
<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>Two major categories emerged from women’s descriptions of coping behaviors during early motherhood: (1) Making personalized and achievable decisions; and (2) Seeking emotional and spiritual solace.</p>
<sec id="section6-1359105311415728">
<title>Making personalized and achievable decisions</title>
<p>Chinese mothers demonstrated self-reliance and mobilized personal resources through strategies, such as making personalized decisions and perseverance, in dealing with the challenges of maternal role during early motherhood. The mothers took an active role in facing difficulties encountered during early motherhood. They set realistic goals and analyzed the problem in order to find out the cause and devise solutions. For example, one mother said: ‘I understood that my child was still young, I should not have too many expectations. I would set goals gradually at each stage … in order to avoid putting too much pressure on myself’ (Informant 5). Another mother said: ‘When I encountered difficulties in child care, I would think about the solutions and consider different ways for handling the problem’ (Informant 17).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the mothers demonstrated perseverance and actively worked on changing their thoughts to manage the complexities of maternal role and strive for successful breastfeeding. For example, one mother said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I had difficulty in breastfeeding, my child was very demanding and required frequent feed. I told myself that the situation would improve eventually, if not this month, maybe the next month or the coming months … Even if I failed in breastfeeding, I could give him formula. Every problem had a solution. (Informant 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several mothers persevered for considerable lengths of time to fulfill the maternal role particularly in breastfeeding. One mother testified:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I had the belief that I could breastfeed, everyone could breastfeed. My friend with an inverted nipple was successful in breastfeeding, so there was no reason that I could not do it. I had read the pamphlets that basically all types of breast were suitable for breastfeeding … I kept trying and persisted in breastfeeding … Now, I was successful in breastfeeding my child, it was because of my perseverance and persistence. (Informant 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The use of positive thinking appears to have helped participants persevere in difficult situations particularly in breastfeeding. For example, a mother said: ‘My child cried a lot … I tried to think positively that he was still young and needed time to adapt … I should not think of him as a troublesome child and be patient with him’ (Informant 4). The results are similar to those found in O’Brien et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311415728">2009</xref>) study, who discussed the important role of positive self-talk in fostering persistence in breastfeeding.</p>
<p>The emphasis on perseverance and self-reliant coping strategies is compatible with the Confucian tradition of self-discipline and the high importance accorded to parental obligations to family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311415728">Park and Chesla, 2007</xref>). Traditional Chinese values and practices in child rearing emphasize parental responsibility for child development. Starting from the time when the woman is pregnant, she is expected to shape the character of the coming child by restricting her activities and diet such as listening to classical music and avoiding spicy foods. After the child is born, the parents are expected to lay the foundation for the child’s socialization, set a good model, and look after the child’s needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311415728">Park and Chesla, 2007</xref>). The failure of women to maintain a well-functioning family and adequately nurture their children according to given cultural standards of the role of a Confucian inspired ‘good mother’ is commonly believed to bring disgrace and shame to the family’s reputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311415728">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible that Chinese mothers are obliged to fulfill the moral obligations of the role of a mother and actively use direct action coping to help them deal with difficulties encountered in child care. The results concur with previous findings that self-reliance and active problem solving and decision making are important strategies used by Chinese mothers to cope with the demands of their maternal roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311415728">Chang and Hsu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311415728">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311415728">Lam and Mackenzie, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1359105311415728">
<title>Seeking emotional and spiritual solace</title>
<p>The Chinese mothers relied on close-knit family ties and friends for emotional and practical support. They alluded to the importance of family and friends during the early weeks of maternal transition and the usefulness of being able to share their feelings and concerns. For example, one mother said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My husband would help me when he was back from his work. We took turns to take care of the child … I also talked to my husband to ventilate my feelings … I felt much better afterward. I believed that talking to others was very important. I was lucky that I could talk to my sister who had just given birth and shared my feelings with her. (Informant 20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another mother said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I moved to live with my mother-in-law after delivery, she helped me a lot in childcare. My mother also came by to visit every day and talked with me … My husband was very supportive, he assisted me in childcare and listened to me when I was upset. (Informant 25)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The role of the extended family is an essential part of Chinese society. Traditionally, Chinese women depend extensively on their extended family members for advice and assistance in early mothering knowledge and skills. The cultural practice of ‘doing the month’ or ‘peiyue’ care whereby a mother is accompanied by a female family member during the first postpartum month enables Chinese women to have adequate rest and support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311415728">Chien et al., 2006</xref>). However, support from the extended family has decreased in recent years because of the nuclear family structure and geographic distance from the extended family. When extended family members are not available, some mothers sought to hire a maid specialized in ‘peiyue’ to assist them in childcare and household chores, a practice that is becoming more common in the contemporary Hong Kong society. For instance, one mother stated: ‘At day time, I had a “peiyue” maid to help me and I also had a domestic maid, so I could have adequate rest’ (Informant 7).</p>
<p>Although the traditional postpartum practice of ‘doing the month’ provides mothers with a certain degree of support, the mandatory rest and confinement at home for the first month after delivery appears to pose a tension in Chinese mothers’ role transition. Several mothers mentioned forbearance while enduring the cultural practice of ‘doing the month’ and fulfilling their childcare responsibility. For example, one mother said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I could not go out because of ‘doing the month’. I had to stay at home as it was my duty to take care of the child … It was very boring. However, I could just bear it. I would try to treasure the time while I was ‘doing the month’ because I had all the time with my child. When I resumed my work, I might not have so much time to be with my child. So, I would treasure the time and tried to build up a good bonding with her. (Informant 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The occurrence of forbearance can be seen to be influenced by Confucian notions of the importance of moral suffering. This is linked to the virtues of a ‘strong’ personality in traditional Chinese forbearance involving self-control of one’s emotion and the ability to endure hardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311415728">Bond, 1996</xref>). Although Chinese families have changed profoundly in structure and role organization in the past century, many of the traditional ideologies and values are retained in contemporary Hong Kong society. Chinese mothers are expected to take on family responsibilities in childrearing and domestic duties, even though the majority of women in Hong Kong have a full-time employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311415728">Ngai et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, participants coped by engaging in emotive coping, such as calling upon their own patience to endure and using positive thinking to regulate their emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311415728">Lazarus and Folkman, 1984</xref>). Positive thinking such as ‘perceiving doing the month as an opportunity for building mother–infant bonding’ appears to have helped participants maintain an optimistic focus and to continually devote efforts to deal with the complexities of maternal role and subscribe to traditional customs.</p>
<p>The findings also reveal that prayer was a useful coping resource for participants who had strong religious beliefs. They prayed and renewed their faith in God, which seems to give them strength and hope to withstand stressors in childcare. For example, one mother stated: ‘I was a Christian. I would pray which gave me the strength’ (Informant 20).</p>
<p>The result supports previous findings that religion exerts an influence on the way Chinese families react and cope with a disabled child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311415728">Chang and Hsu, 2007</xref>). Appealing to supernatural powers and asking for blessings and healings has a long history in the Chinese cultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311415728">Hwang, 1977</xref>) and remains widespread in contemporary Chinese societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311415728">Chang and Hsu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311415728">Mok et al., 2010</xref>). Chinese people believe in a pantheon of powerful spirits that can bring a change in the suffering person through certain rituals, such as the act of prayer which may protect people from evil and allow them to transform a potential tragedy into an opportunity for achieving self-growth and personal peace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311415728">Haque, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311415728">Tzeng and Yin, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, participants who were overwhelmed by the burden of infant care and household duties resorted to the use of avoidance, such as telling themselves not to worry too much about the problems or wishing their child will grow up quickly. For instance, one mother said: ‘When I was upset, I tried not to think about the problems [financial and childcare difficulties]. After crying, I told myself not to think about it again’ (Informant 26). This concurs with the results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311415728">Lam and Mackenzie’s (2002)</xref> study that avoidance was among the coping strategies used by Chinese mothers in parenting with a disabled child during the early weeks of motherhood.</p>
<p>In summary, Chinese mothers tended to use a combination of all available personal, social, and cultural resources to deal with the demands of early motherhood. The Confucian value about family ties and responsibility obliges Chinese mothers to draw on all available cultural reserves of coping resources for the benefit of the child and the fulfillment of family and cultural obligations.</p>
<p>This study was conducted with a small sample of Hong Kong Chinese first-time mothers participating in a childbirth psycho-education program which may have influenced women’s coping behaviors and limits the generalizability of the results. Despite the limitation, it does provide in-depth and contextual data.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The findings of this study highlight the impact of cultural beliefs on Chinese maternal coping during the transition to early motherhood. It is important for health professionals at the forefront of health service provision to acknowledge that Chinese women can empower themselves through such coping strategies as making personalized decisions, perseverance, forbearance, and seeking emotional and spiritual solace in order to manage the complexities of maternal transition. Culturally specific information on effective coping strategies, such as positive thinking and problem-solving skills, should be reinforced in the childbirth education and through individual care. Given the potential impact of family and friends on the coping process, understanding family dynamics and support systems in individual mothers’ social and cultural contexts is essential in the delivery of culturally competent and sensitive care.</p>
