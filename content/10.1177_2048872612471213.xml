<title>Background:</title>
<p>Although outcomes of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have greatly improved, bleeding is still an issue. Thus, this study aims to evaluate in-hospital management and outcomes of unselected patients with ACS focusing on antithrombotic therapies and bleeding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2048872612471213">
<title>Methods and results:</title>
<p>From 22 April 2009 to 29 December 2010, 6394 consecutive Italian patients were prospectively enrolled and followed for 6 months. Most patients (55.3%) had non-ST-elevation (NSTE) ACS. Of the ST-elevation (STE) ACS patients, 79.8% received reperfusion (mainly mechanical). In-hospital and 6-month unadjusted total mortality rates were 4.2 and 7.8% for STE-ACS and 2.5 and 6.4% for NSTE-ACS, respectively. During hospitalization, TIMI major bleeding rate was 1.2% (1.4% STE-ACS and 1.1% NSTE-ACS, respectively) and TIMI minor bleeding was 3.1%. In-hospital and 6-month unadjusted total mortality rates were 3.1 and 6.7% for patients without bleeding, 1.5 and 8.6% for minor bleeding, and 19.0 and 26.6% for TIMI major bleeding, respectively (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). Notably, TIMI major bleeding was one of the strongest predictors of the 6-month composite end point (death or reinfarction) (STE-ACS hazard ratio, HR, 2.86, 95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 1.57−5.23; NSTE-ACS HR, 2.71, 95% CI 1.52−4.80). Predictors of in-hospital TIMI major bleeding were weight (odds ratio, OR, 0.97, 95% CI 0.95−0.99), female gender (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.09−2.96), history of peripheral vasculopathy (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.83−4.78), switching anticoagulant therapy (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.36−5.05), intra-aortic balloon pump implantation (OR 4.44, 95% CI 1.85−10.69), and creatinine ≥2 mg/dl on admission (OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.84−7.33).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has changed dramatically in recent years and has resulted in substantial improvements in outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2048872612471213">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2048872612471213">2</xref></sup> However, this effective aggressive treatment has increased the risk of bleeding complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612471213">3</xref></sup> Emerging evidence of a strong association of bleeding with adverse outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612471213">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612471213">5</xref></sup> has focused the attention of clinicians on its determinants and methods to avoid it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612471213">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2048872612471213"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2048872612471213">8</xref></sup> However, most information on bleeding in ACS arises from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating different antithrombotic drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612471213">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2048872612471213">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2048872612471213">10</xref></sup> By design, these RCTs exclude older patients or subjects with extensive comorbidities; thus, the reported frequencies of bleeding could differ from that observed in unselected populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612471213">6</xref></sup> As opposed, observational studies that include the full spectrum of patients and that apply consistent criteria for bleeding may provide more reliable estimates of the epidemiology of bleeding and its evolution over years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612471213">6</xref></sup> Unfortunately, data on contemporary bleeding rates among unselected ACS patients, their relation with guidelines recommended treatments and prognosis are limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2048872612471213">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2048872612471213">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologist (ANMCO) designed the MANTRA (Management of patients with acute coronary syndromes in the real world practice in Italy: an outcome research study focused on the use of ANTithRombotic Agents) registry to investigate the epidemiology of bleeding in contemporary treated unselected patients with ACS and their relations to in-hospital care and outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2048872612471213" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The MANTRA registry was designed as a multicentre, prospective, observational, nationwide study aimed to evaluate the patterns of care of patients with ACS currently admitted to the Italian intensive cardiac care units (ICCU). The registry focused on bleedings and their relations to in-hospital treatments. The enrolment period was from 22 April 2009 to 29 December 2010, but it was limited to 12 months at each centre. Fifty-two ICCUs representative of the Italian ICCUs network participated to the study; 29% of these ICCUs have on-site cardiac surgery and interventional facilities and 36% interventional facilities without surgery. In brief, all patients ≥18 years old admitted with a suspected diagnosis of ACS at the participating hospitals were eligible. Eligibility required a clinical history of ACS and at least one of the following: electrocardiographic changes consistent with ACS, serial increases in cardiac biomarkers (troponin, creatinine kinase MB), or documented coronary artery disease. Patients with non-cardiovascular causes for the clinical presentation, those previously enrolled by another participating centre during the same index event, or without informed consent, were excluded. Demographic, clinical characteristics, treatment practices, and hospital outcome data were collected. Standardized definitions of patient-related variables, clinical diagnoses, hospital complications, and outcomes were used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2048872612471213">13</xref></sup> In particular, bleeding was classified according to the TIMI definitions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2048872612471213">14</xref></sup> Major TIMI bleeding was defined as any intracranial bleeding, or overt bleeding with a decrease in haemoglobin ≥5 g/dl or decrease in haematocrit ≥15%. Minor TIMI bleeding was defined as spontaneous gross haematuria, spontaneous haematemesis, or observed bleeding with decrease in haemoglobin ≥3 g/dl but haematocrit ≤15%. In addition, patients were followed up for 6 months, with outpatients visits scheduled at 1 and 6 months after enrolment. All patients were asked to sign an informed consent for the anonymous management of their individual data. Local Institutional Review Boards were informed of the study according to the Italian rules.</p>
<p>In each participating centre, the in-charge physician was responsible for screening consecutive patients admitted to the ICCU. Data were collected using an electronic case report form (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anmco.it/mantra">www.anmco.it/mantra</ext-link>) by the participating centre and entered in a centralized database located at the ANMCO Research Center in Florence. By using a validation plan, integrated in the data entry software, data were checked for missing or contradictory entries and values out of the normal range. Each participating centre was also asked to complete a questionnaire, designed to provide a full description of their logistics.</p>
<p>Data were analysed for two predefined groups of patients: (1) ST-elevation ACS (STE-ACS) or new-onset left bundle branch block; and (2) non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). Furthermore, patients enrolled in the study were divided into three prespecified groups to facilitate comparison across bleeding strata: (1) no bleeding; (2) minor TIMI bleeding; and (3) major TIMI bleeding.</p>
<sec id="section6-2048872612471213">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Categorical variables were reported as percentages and compared by chi-squared test, while continuous variables were reported as median and interquartile range (IQR) and compared by ANOVA analysis if normally distributed, or by Kruskal−Wallis test if not. Multivariables analysis were performed in order to identify the independent predictors of in-hospital TIMI major bleeding (logistic backward model, STE-ACS and NSTE-ACS patients) and the independent predictors of the combined end-point all-cause death and/or reinfarction at 6 months (Cox model, separately in STE-ACS and NSTE-ACS patients). Variables statistically significant at a previous univariate analysis with <italic>p</italic>-values &lt;0.01 and the variable considered of clinical interest (see Appendix B for details) were inserted in the model. When more than two categories were present, dummy variables were introduced to define a reference group. To assess whether in-hospital TIMI major bleeding was an independent predictor of the combined end-point all-cause death and/or reinfarction at 6 months, TIMI major bleeding was entered in the Cox model as a time-dependent variable, to account for the time of onset of the event.</p>
<p>All statistical tests were two-sided and a <italic>p-</italic>value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed with SAS version 9.2.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>From 22 April 2009 to 29 December 2010, 6394 consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled (76.2% of them at ICCU with interventional facilities). Overall, median length of hospital admission was 6.0 (IQR 4.0−8.0) days. NSTE-ACS was diagnosed in 55.3% (<italic>n</italic>=3536) of cases while the remainders (<italic>n</italic>=2858) had STE-ACS (see Appendix C for details). Briefly, among STE-ACS subjects, 79.8% received reperfusion (16.1% fibrinolysis and 63.7% primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI). Besides, a high proportion of NSTE-ACS patients underwent coronary angiography and PCI (78.3 and 54.6%, respectively) during hospitalization. The overall unadjusted in-hospital and 6-month total mortality rates were 4.2 and 7.8% for STE-ACS and 2.5 and 6.4% for NSTE-ACS, respectively.</p>
<sec id="section8-2048872612471213">
<title>Bleeding characteristics, patterns of care, and outcomes</title>
<p>Of the 6394 patients in the study, 1.2% sustained a TIMI major bleeding during hospitalization. In seven (8.9%) cases, these major bleedings were intracranial, in 35.4% gastrointestinal, and in 38% were access-site related. Four patients had an additional major bleeding (three cases gastrointestinal and one CABG related); thus major bleeding episodes during hospitalization were 83. The risk of major bleeding tended to cluster during the early days of hospitalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2048872612471213">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Of those 79 patients with a major TIMI bleeding, 50.6% presented with STE-ACS. Thus, major bleeding rates were 1.4% for STE-ACS and 1.1% for NSTE-ACS. Interestingly, neither reperfusion in STE-ACS (major TIMI bleeding rates: 1.1% for primary PCI, 1.7% for thrombolysis, and 2.1% for no reperfusion; <italic>p</italic>=0.17) nor early invasive management in NSTE-ACS patients (major TIMI bleeding rates: 0.9% for in-hospital coronary angiography and 2.0% for no in-hospital coronary angiography; <italic>p</italic>=0.01) affected the risk of bleeding. Notably, 198 patients (3.1%) had a TIMI minor bleeding (3.5% for STE-ACS and 2.8% for NSTE-ACS, respectively) and in 32.8% of them the bleeding was at the vascular access site.</p>
<p>Patients who bled were older than those who did not bleed, more often were women, had lower bodyweight, and more non-cardiac comorbidities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2048872612471213">Table 1</xref>). On admission, patients with a major bleeding had lower systolic blood pressure, more heart failure, higher GRACE risk scores, a worse renal function, and a higher proportion of low ejection fraction than those without bleeding.</p>

<p>Patients with a major haemorrhage received less frequently aspirin, clopidogrel, and double antiplatelet therapy than that who did not bleed. As opposed, they were treated more often with unfractionated heparin, thrombolytic agents, or switched more frequently to different anticoagulant drugs. Dosing of antithrombotic therapies at the time of bleeding was not recorded. However, all patients with an intracranial haemorrhage and 76.5% of subjects with non-intracranial major bleed discontinued at least one antithrombotic drug at the time of bleeding. At discharge, patients with a major bleeding received less angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor blocker, and less statins, but more diuretics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2048872612471213">Table 2</xref>). In addition, although they were less likely to have undergone PCI, but had a higher probability to receive an intra-aortic balloon pump or to be submitted to coronary artery bypass surgery than those without a bleed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2048872612471213">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study demonstrates that despite contemporary aggressive therapies and interventions, the rate of bleeding remains relatively low in an unselected population of ACS. Moreover, patients who bled were frailer, sicker, largely undertreated, and demonstrated a worse outcome. Thus, in such a population, major bleeding may represent an unavoidable clinical outcome. However, some of their bleeding triggers may be controlled and physicians should tailor treatments to reduce them further.</p>
<p>During the last decades, improvements in the management of patients with ACS were associated with better outcomes in unselected populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2048872612471213">2</xref></sup> These improvements were mainly due to more aggressive antithrombotic therapies and interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2048872612471213">2</xref></sup> In fact, when results of the current MANTRA registry are compared with that of previous Italian Registries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2048872612471213">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2048872612471213">16</xref></sup> we observed a substantial increase in reperfusion rates (65.0% Blitz-1 to 79.8% MANTRA) in STE-ACS, in-hospital early revascularization (28.6% Blitz-2 to 54.6% MANTRA) in NSTE-ACS, and in-hospital and secondary prevention medical treatments that translated into improved outcomes (in-hospital death rate STE-ACS: 7.5% Blitz-1 to 4.2% MANTRA registry). However, as ischaemic event rates decline, the relative importance of haemorrhagic complications increases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612471213">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612471213">6</xref></sup> In-hospital major bleeding occurs in 3−15% of contemporary trial and registry ACS populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612471213">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612471213">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2048872612471213">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2048872612471213">12</xref></sup> In the GRACE registry of 24,045 patients with ACS the overall rate of major bleeding was 3.9% according to a study-defined scale, ranging from 2.3% in patients with unstable angina to 4.8% in those with STE-ACS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2048872612471213">17</xref></sup> In our study the rate of major bleedings was lower (1.4% for STE-ACS and 1.1% for NSTE-ACS), and not related to a lower clinical risk or a less aggressive treatment. This difference might depend on the more stringent criteria of the TIMI bleeding definition adopted by our study as well as improvements in clinical practice. Furthermore, several analyses have reported independent predictors of haemorrhagic complications in ACS. Factors independently associated with a higher risk of major bleeding included: advanced age, female gender, lower blood pressure, history of bleeding or renal failure, and use of 2b/3a inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612471213">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612471213"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612471213">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2048872612471213">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2048872612471213"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2048872612471213">11</xref></sup> In our registry, at multivariable analysis, baseline renal dysfunction was the most powerful predictor along with peripheral vasculopathy, female gender, and low bodyweight, while advanced age was not. The relevance of renal dysfunction is not surprising since these patients are prone to excess dosing of antithrombotic drugs and more susceptible to bleedings. Notably, switching anticoagulant therapies and intra-aortic balloon pump implantation demonstrated a strong association with major bleeding as well. Switching from one anticoagulant to another exposes patients to fluctuating levels of anticoagulation and enhances their bleeding risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2048872612471213">18</xref></sup> Similarly, the intra-aortic balloon pump needs a large, long-standing arterial sheath that increases the risk of bleeding as well. Interestingly, these bleeding triggers might be partially controlled if physicians carefully tailor treatments and manage vascular access sites correctly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2048872612471213">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2048872612471213">19</xref></sup> On the other hand, in our study patients who bled were undertreated. Thus, we may argue that in the real world, physicians carefully select patients at low risk for bleeding when deciding to administer aggressive antithrombotic agents or perform interventions. Older age is the best-known predictor of bleeding and data from the Blitz-3 registry show that elderly patients with ACS receive less antithrombotics and interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2048872612471213">20</xref></sup> Thus, when bleeding occurs in such unselected, undertreated population, it may represent more a clinical outcome due to the unfavorable characteristics of the patient (e.g. frailty, comorbidities, severity of illness) than a consequence of aggressive treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2048872612471213">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the definition of major bleeding varies across RCTs and registries, major bleeding is associated with higher mortality in a dose-dependent manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612471213">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612471213">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2048872612471213">12</xref></sup> Patients with haemodynamically significant bleeding are at greatest risk of in-hospital mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2048872612471213">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, in ACS patients major bleeding increases the adjusted hazard of death at 30 days by &gt;5-fold and continues to increase this risk up to 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612471213">5</xref></sup> In the GRACE registry, patients with major bleeding had significantly higher rates of in-hospital death than those without major bleeding (18.6 vs. 5.1%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2048872612471213">17</xref></sup> After adjusting for confounding variables, major bleeding remained associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.18−2.28).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2048872612471213">17</xref></sup> In the MANTRA registry, major bleeding increased the risk of death or reinfarction by &gt;2-fold and was one of the strongest predictors of adverse outcome. This negative relation is emphasized by the short time interval between major bleeding and adverse events. These early hazards associated with bleeding are clear. Potential explanations for these risks include a direct effect of the bleeding event, hypoxia, or effects of transfusions. In addition, discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy to minimize bleeding is an important trigger of thrombotic events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2048872612471213">23</xref></sup> In our study all patients with an intracranial haemorrhage and most subjects with a non intracranial major bled discontinued at least an antithrombotic agent. Furthermore, physicians are reluctant to submit patients who bleed to interventions or to discharge them with antiplatelet agents or other preventive treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2048872612471213">24</xref></sup> Similarly, in the MANTRA registry, patients with major bleeds were less frequently submitted to coronary angiography or PCI and received less preventive therapies at discharge. Unfortunately, early discontinuation of antithrombotic agents and under-treatment could have adversely affected outcomes of frail and sicker patients more prone to adverse outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2048872612471213">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, although patients are treated more aggressively, a decline of the frequency of major bleeding over years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2048872612471213">2</xref></sup> not explained by changes in patients’ risk status, has been reported. In the MANTRA registry the 1.1% TIMI major bleeding rate observed among NSTE-ACS patients equals that reported by the previous Blitz-2 registry, where a healthier population was treated less aggressively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2048872612471213">16</xref></sup> Thus, as we mentioned, improvements in clinical practice, such as early bleeding risk stratification and tailored selection of antithrombotics, and dose adjustment according to weight and renal function, as well as a careful management of vascular access site, may have minimized the bleeding risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2048872612471213">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612471213">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612471213">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The study suffers several limitations. First, the lack of a standardized definition for bleeding in ACS patients. Recently, the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) aimed to overcome such limitation by standardizing bleeding definitions with an objective nomenclature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2048872612471213">25</xref></sup> Unfortunately, we were not able to apply the BARC definition to our population. However, the TIMI bleeding definition that we adopted has been widely used previously in RCTs, registries, and clinical practice. Secondly, bleeding events were not centrally adjudicated. Data regarding vascular access site were not individually collected. However, among participating centres, the reported rate of radial access during angiography was rather low (median 25%, IQR 5−66%). Furthermore, patients’ enrolment was not consecutive in all centres due to suboptimal logistics during off hours and exclusion of subjects who died early on arrival or were not able to sign the informed consent. Finally, as an observational, cohort analysis, other unaccounted differences may have remained after adjusting with multivariable analysis for confounders.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Despite aggressive therapies and interventions, the rate of bleeding remains relatively low in an unselected population of ACS. Moreover, patients who bled were frailer, sicker, largely undertreated, and demonstrated a worse outcome. Thus, in such population major bleeding may represent an unavoidable clinical outcome. However, some of their bleeding triggers may be controlled and physicians should tailor treatments to reduce them further.</p>
