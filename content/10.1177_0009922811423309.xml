<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pediatric health care professionals see many children who have been exposed to traumatic events and play a crucial role in helping these youngsters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811423309">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811423309">2</xref></sup> Traumatic events are characterized by an overwhelming confrontation with death, serious injury, or other threat to physical integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811423309">3</xref></sup> Examples include natural disasters, serious accidents, violence, and the sudden loss of a loved one. Exposure to these events is fairly common in children, with prevalence rates ranging from 14%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811423309">4</xref></sup> to more than 65%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811423309">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811423309">6</xref></sup> in peace-time general population studies. Traumatic exposure puts both mental and physical health at risk in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811423309">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811423309">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811423309">9</xref></sup> For example, they may develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811423309">3</xref></sup>), encounter problems in academic functioning, and show increased rates of various physical disorders.</p>
<p>The care of pediatric providers is essential for children confronted with severe stressors. These professionals are often the first to see a child after exposure. They are trusted adults to whom children can disclose experiences, who can screen for functional impairments caused by an experience, who can provide education about normal reactions to trauma, who can monitor whether exposed children show psychiatric symptoms, and who can encourage parents to seek specialized mental health care for their child when needed. They can promote parents’ optimal assistance to their child.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811423309">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811423309">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Parents influence children’s recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811423309">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811423309">13</xref></sup> Particularly, researchers have found parental distress to be a significant predictor of posttraumatic stress reactions in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811423309">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811423309">16</xref></sup> Moreover, in a model of Relational PTSD, Scheeringa and Zeanah have described 3 parenting styles that exacerbate symptoms of young children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922811423309">17</xref></sup> The first is the withdrawn parent, who is not available to the child because of his/her own distress. The second is the overprotective parent, who is constrictive because of a strong fear that the child may be victimized again. The third style refers to the frightening parent, who may repeatedly ask about horrific details of the experience of the child or put the child in danger again.</p>
<p>Although this model is very informative, it would be valuable to complement it with healthy parent-child interactions after trauma. This would enable professionals to assess and promote parental assistance. Very little is known about parental strategies used to support children after traumatic exposure, even though research in other domains discusses positive parental behavior such as sensitivity and responsiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922811423309">18</xref></sup> In addition, most research looks at correlations between symptom scores. Although this focus provides broad insights regarding associations between, for example, parental PTSD and child PTSD, it does not lead to detailed knowledge of parent-child interactions after trauma or of parents’ views on the help they receive from professionals in this regard. To assist parents in helping their children recover, a more detailed understanding is necessary.</p>
<p>The purpose of the current study is to strengthen trauma-informed health care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811423309">19</xref></sup> by exploring parents’ strategies to promote the psychological recovery of their children after single-incident<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811423309">20</xref></sup> trauma. Because qualitative methods enable the exploration of complex and dynamic processes, and we wanted to study commonalities across different types of experiences, we conducted semistructured interviews with parents of children who had been confronted with a wide range of traumatic events.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Primary caregivers (referred to as parents) were recruited as part of a study on children’s recovery after traumatic exposure. This study focused on children aged between 8 and 12 years, and its methods and findings are reported in a separate article.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922811423309">21</xref></sup> Children registered at the University Medical Center Utrecht (the Netherlands) as having experienced a single-incident trauma were eligible, provided they were not or no longer receiving mental health care, and the event had occurred at least 6 months previously. The traumatic events fitted the A1 exposure criterion for PTSD in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811423309">3</xref></sup> Written informed consent and verbal assent were obtained from the parents and the children, respectively. Inclusion in the study was continuous and carried out according to purposive sampling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811423309">22</xref></sup> to achieve maximum diversity in demographic characteristics, types of trauma, time since trauma, and degree of mental health care. We stopped including families when no significant new themes emerged from the interviews. The study protocol was approved by the medical ethics committee of the (University Medical Center Utrecht).</p>
<p>The parents of 34 children were approached for the study. The parents of 7 children declined for various reasons, including lack of time and concerns about exposing the child to the interview. In the case of 2 children, we were unable to contact both divorced parents for informed consent. Participation of families was not significantly related to child age, child gender, or type of event (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .10; other variables unknown for nonparticipants). In all, 25 families participated, with 33 parents involved in the interviews (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811423309">Table 1</xref>). The experiences of the children (15 boys and 10 girls, mean age 10.7 years) were categorized under sudden loss (6 children; eg, losing a sibling as a result of drowning), violence (8 children; eg, sexual assault and witnessing a suicide), and accidents with injury (11 children; eg, sustaining complex fractures in a road traffic accident).</p>

<title>Interviews</title>
<p>The topics in the interview guide (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922811423309">Table 2</xref>) related to the characteristics of the trauma, reactions of the child, changes in the child’s outlook on the world, and factors that assisted or impeded the child’s recovery, including parents’ role in the child’s recovery. The wording of the questions was as open as possible. An experienced, trained interviewer [EA] carried out the interviews. [HB] monitored the wording and openness of the questions based on the transcripts. The body of the interviews lasted 37 minutes on average (ranging from 15 to 72 minutes, audiotaped). Additional mental health care was offered after the interview and was accepted by 1 family.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The analysis was carried out according to the constant comparison method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811423309">22</xref></sup> Interviews were transcribed verbatim except for names, dates, and locations, which were substituted with functional codes to ensure confidentiality. The data were imported in MAXQDA 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811423309">23</xref></sup> The study’s approach was inductive. Each potentially meaningful fragment in the first 4 transcripts was coded independently by [EA] and [HB], and the differences were discussed until consensus was reached. Subsequent interviews were initially coded by [EA] and checked by [HB]. [MJ] and [RK] reviewed the codes to avoid potential researcher bias. New interviews were compared with existing codes to identify similarities and differences. The codes were grouped into conceptual categories, and the interrelationships were continuously discussed by the research team. Categories became saturated (ie, no new themes came up) with 22 interviews, and this was confirmed with 3 subsequent interviews. A clinical child psychologist and a social worker, both of whom were not connected to the study, reviewed and approved the analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Although the interviews covered a range of topics, parenting strategies to promote children’s psychological recovery after traumatic exposure were prominent in participants’ narratives. They often started to talk about these practices before any questions were posed about them. We distinguished 2 aspects in the narratives: (<italic>a</italic>) being aware of a child’s needs and (<italic>b</italic>) acting on these needs. We elaborate on the 2 categories of practices in the following sections. We will refer to the combination as “responsive parenting after trauma,” the central theme of our results. Being responsive was a challenge for parents. One father mentioned both aspects of responsive parenting while expressing this challenge:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>But I wonder, does he really still think about it? I don’t know. Yeah, anybody would want to know their kid so well that you know that “it’s done,” or “something is still bothering my child.” And if the latter is the case, that you take action.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section7-0009922811423309">
<title>Being Aware of a Child’s Needs</title>
<p>Parents tried to get a sense of how their child was doing after the event. They made use of 5 strategies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922811423309">Table 3</xref>). One was to directly ask the child how he or she was doing. A second was to compare the child’s behavior before and after the trauma. Another was to determine whether the behavior of children was in line with their character. For example, a mother said that her son was an introvert and that his reluctance to talk about the event was rather in line with his character instead of a potential stress reaction she was worried about. A fourth way to find a point of reference for the seriousness of children’s posttraumatic reactions was by comparing them with siblings:</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some parents mentioned that they tried to monitor the child’s reactions but found it difficult to come to conclusions. In order not to miss possibly important cues, parents checked other people’s impressions of the child, such as those of a mental health care professional or a school teacher:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At school you talk about it a bit more with the teacher. And yeah, the teacher didn’t really see that he ran behind or couldn’t concentrate as well. No, it’s going well at school.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parents did not always succeed in being aware of their child’s needs and functioning. One mother had missed her child’s signals that he was still suffering from stress reactions related to the violence the family had encountered. She thought that he was too young to be affected by the incident. She did have the feeling that something was not going well for the boy but thought that his concentration problems at school had to do with dyslexia. Looking back, she felt that her child’s malfunctioning had continued for years because she was unaware of his needs. Only after it was discovered that he suffered from posttraumatic stress, was an adequate intervention provided, and he recovered.</p>

<title>Acting on the Child’s Needs</title>
<p>Parents not only tried to be aware of their child’s functioning and needs, but they also took action to facilitate their child’s recovery (9 strategies; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922811423309">Table 3</xref>). Their approach often incorporated an element of making sure that the child felt in control. For example, when parents explained that it was important to talk about the event (the first strategy that we identified), most of them went into more depth and said that they actually provided an atmosphere in which the child felt free but not obliged to talk. Part of being able to provide such an atmosphere was knowing the child very well. Some parents pinpointed in which situations their child would talk about distressing thoughts or feelings and made sure they provided the opportunity:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He hardly talks about it. He does talk about it with me when we’re taking a bath. Then the two of us take our time and he won’t stop talking.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The children had many questions, for example, about “right and wrong” after incidents of violence and about what happened exactly in a car accident. The second strategy that we identified regarded answering these questions. Again, parents tried to adjust to the child’s pace by saying that the child was free to ask, and that when he or she was ready, parents would provide information. Some parents felt that their approach differed from the one followed by police officers or doctors:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes doctors came barging in and they would start that whole conversation, whereas we were just easing her into it, like “Whenever you’re ready we’ll tell you about it.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Being sensitive to their child’s pace stood central as well in parents’ descriptions of stimulating their children to do things that they preferred to avoid after the traumatic event, such as going to school by bike after a traffic accident or being confronted with a changed body image. The way parents guided this confrontation with reminders appeared to be a combination of challenging the child and giving the child control over the situation. Under these conditions, several children finally made the step toward the confrontation:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Removing] that band-aid [from his disfigured finger], yeah, that was very hard for him. So we took a photo while he didn’t look. We put that photo at home. “When you think <italic>I want to see it</italic> you can go look at the photo. Then you know what your finger looks like, and you can say whether the band aid can go or not.” And eventually he said himself: “Now I want to see the photo.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parents protected their children from cues that they thought would be unhelpful for recovery, such as exposure to news crews. Parents also hid their own emotions from their children when they judged them too intense. For example, they hid tears until they were out of sight of the child. However, children appeared very sensitive to signals of parents’ distress. Several parents coincidentally learned that their child knew about gruesome details they thought they had only spoken about with other adults. In other cases, parents felt that they were so overwhelmed by the event that they were not able to hide any feelings. A mother described that her son was heavily affected by his parents being “off-track” and drunk. When children needed more help to come to terms with the event or when parents felt that they could not adequately support their children, parents searched for help, for example, by contacting a social worker at school or a psychologist at the hospital:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>That [my daughter] just didn’t want to go outside anymore, that was a reason for me to think “Well, I don’t know how to go about this, I want to get help because I can’t do this myself.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A further strategy that parents used to support their child (and themselves) was to undertake symbolic activities. Again, they attempted to make the child feel in control. For example, they had children choose the colors for a painting related to the event. Or they made a scrap book of all the postcards that the child had received.</p>
<p>Many parents, whether they saw distress in their child or not, paid attention to taking up normal routines again, thereby providing a daily structure to rely on. Clinicians also supported parents in taking up a normal rhythm, which was valuable to parents. A mother said that the most important piece of advice the medical staff gave her was to pick up normal routines again and let her son go to school as soon as possible. Without the advice, she would have kept him home for a much longer period of time. Finally, parents spoke about their efforts to allow time for fun activities and enjoyable moments as a strategy to support their children.</p>
<p>Parents felt that their strategies helped their children recover or that they could have helped if they had been better aware of the needs. A father who felt confident about his and his wife’s approach said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think it’s really to our credit too. . . . We really tried hard to keep things as normal as possible for them.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the current study was to strengthen trauma-informed health care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811423309">19</xref></sup> by qualitatively exploring parents’ strategies to promote the psychological recovery of their children after single-incident trauma. Responsive parenting was a core theme in the narratives. It consisted of being aware of a child’s needs and acting on these needs. We distinguished 5 parental tactics to estimate the seriousness of posttraumatic stress reactions in children (to be aware) and 9 behavioral strategies to assist children (to act on needs). Central to responsivity were parents’ attempts to follow their children’s pace while providing structure and guidance when necessary or seeking help to do this. Parents felt that their capacity to be responsive was influenced by their own level of well-being or distress.</p>
<p>When interpreting the results, the limitations of the study should be noted. First, we studied parents’ perspectives. Although their views have important clinical implications, their accounts may not directly translate to what actually happened, which requires further study. Second, we studied parents in a Western-European culture, from a Western-European perspective. Our findings cannot be generalized to other cultures without more research. Finally, we studied a sample of children exposed to single-incident trauma. Although this represents a large and sometimes underrecognized group of children confronted with adversity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811423309">20</xref></sup> our findings should not be generalized to parents of children who have been traumatized chronically.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, our findings provide the basis for an extended version of Scheeringa and Zeanah’s model of Relational PTSD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922811423309">17</xref></sup> including not only the withdrawn parent, the overprotective parent, and the frightening parent but also the responsive parent and his or her specific strategies. We, therefore, propose a model of Relational PTSD and Recovery (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811423309">Figure 1</xref>) based on our study. The model shows that trauma in children affects both the children themselves and their parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811423309">10</xref></sup> Subsequently, parents’ own well-being influences their parenting style, which has an effect on the child’s well-being. Because most children recover well and most parents do not develop clinical levels of PTSD after trauma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811423309">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811423309">10</xref></sup> we have depicted the unresponsive parenting styles in smaller boxes than those used for the responsive style (which includes both elements of being aware of the child’s needs and acting on these needs). Because parental behavior influences children in ways other than through parenting alone (eg, by modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811423309">11</xref></sup>), an additional direct arrow is shown between the parent’s and the child’s well-being.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0009922811423309-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>This model may guide health care professionals when exploring which strategies parents are using at a certain moment and what their capacity is to promote their children’s recovery after trauma. In addition, the model may be used to inform parents of helpful and unhelpful behaviors and serve as a basis for honing parenting skills. The model may also assist in identifying families that need specialized mental health care—when distress levels are high and parenting styles are less than optimal. For future use, the model will need to be further tested, and instruments, such as questionnaires, interviews, and training manuals, can be developed to assist clinicians in using the model.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our results point to several direct clinical implications. First, we found that parenting responsively after trauma was felt as a challenge to the parents. Health care providers need to be aware of this in order to be responsive themselves and give parents the opportunity to share worries or thoughts about parenting. Second, parents spoke about instances in which their thoughtful strategies to help their child (eg, regarding giving information about the event) were interrupted by professionals. Therefore, both health care and other professionals need to make sure that they are aligned with parents regarding the timing and content of information given to children about what happened exactly during the traumatic event or what is going to happen (eg, in medical or judicial procedures). Finally, psychoeducation (eg, regarding restoring normal routines) by health care professionals was regarded very favorably by parents. It appears valuable to explicitly include this information in discussions with parents.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this study is the first in-depth examination of parents’ views on children’s recovery after a wide range of traumatic experiences, focusing on parental strategies to promote psychological recovery. Although studies regarding other pediatric health issues (eg, spina bifida<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922811423309">24</xref></sup> and diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922811423309">25</xref></sup>) showed the importance of parental acceptation and warmth, the area of positive parent-child interactions after trauma remained unexplored. It is our hope that the model of Relational PTSD and Recovery will improve trauma-informed health care and promote children’s posttrauma recovery.</p>
