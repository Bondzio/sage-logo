<abstract>
<p>Neoliberalism is often regarded as a type of economic practice advocating the primacy of the market and the rolling back of the Keynesian welfare state. Yet neoliberalism does not merely functions as economic tenets. There is also another side to it as a form of government or governmentality. This is the other less-attended to aspect of neoliberalism, and which this paper seeks to highlight. Through the example of the island-state of Singapore, neoliberalism is examined as a set of economic tenets <italic>and</italic> as a form of governmentality by considering the neoliberal political rationality that forms the basis for their existence. Once a developmental state, Singapore has undergone much structural changes to its economy in the past decade. The economy has gradually been deregulated, liberalised and privatised to conform more to the neoliberal model. However, existing interests embedded within the developmental state prevents a transition to a full-fledged neoliberal regulatory one. Instead what emerges is a type of hybrid state, in the form of the neoliberal-developmental state. It is hoped that by examining this notion of the neoliberal-developmental state, further light can be shed on neoliberalism and its impact on this tiny island-state and vice-versa.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neoliberalism is commonly regarded as a set of economic practises premised on the rolling back of Keynesian economics and the welfare state. More specifically, it is associated with the primacy of the market, the privatisation of state enterprises, maximised competition through the liberalisation and deregulation of the economy in order to promote “free trade,” preferences towards monetary policies favouring businesses and corporations at the expense of labour, environmental degradation and resource depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511419900">Harvey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920511419900">Klein, 2007</xref>). In the 1970s, policies and practises that eventually came to be collectively regarded as neoliberalism started making headway in the United States and Britain. Its ascension was hastened by the election of Ronald Reagan in the 1981 Presidential Elections and Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister of Britain in 1979. Their respective economic policies were heavily influenced by the ideas of the Chicago School of Economics, notably those of Friedrich Von Hayek and Milton Friedman. It was also during Reagan’s administration and Thatcher’s cabinet that the so-called Washington Consensus of 1989 came about. This event put onto paper the various economic doctrines that are currently recognised as the tenets of neoliberalism. Transnational institutions such as the World Bank (WB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came to be populated by disseminators of neoliberal economics doctrines. Through the threat of withholding much needed financial aid in times of economic crises (examples include the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis and the 1999 – 2002 Argentinean Peso Crisis), these institutions have been able to force member countries to engage in what the IMF terms as Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAP). These policies worked to restructure economies to become more receptive to international capital flows (through the processes of liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation), allowing for further integration with the global capitalist economy.</p>
<p>Yet neoliberalism does not merely functions as economic tenets. There is also another side to it as a form of government or governmentality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920511419900">1</xref></sup> This is the other less-attended to aspect of neoliberalism which this paper seeks to highlight. Foucault regards governmentality as the “conduct of conduct”, and this ranges from the government of the self to the government of others. The exercise of governmentality occurs when there is ‘an encounter between the technologies of domination [power] of others and those of the self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511419900">Foucault, 2003</xref>: 147). Technologies are essentially ‘matrix of reasons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511419900">Foucault, 2003</xref>: 146), of which Foucault identifies four major types (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511419900">Foucault, 2003</xref>). Two of these interest him the most - technologies of power which influences the way an individual conducts him/herself and ‘submit them to certain ends or domination’, and technologies of the self which allow for individuals to bring about via their own or the methods of others, ‘a certain number of operations on their own bodies and souls, thoughts, conduct, and way of being’ so that they are able to come to a certain stage of happiness, and wisdom among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511419900">Foucault, 2003</xref>: 145).</p>
<p>Technologies of the self refer to the means by which individual go about engaging in self-regulation while technologies of power works to shape and direct those efforts at self-regulation. In turn, the determinants of the form and content of these technologies of power and the self are predicated upon what is referred to as political rationality. Generally, political rationality ‘constitute[s] a part of the fabric of our ways of thinking about and acting upon one another and ourselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511419900">Barry, Osborne and Rose, 1996</xref>: 7) and therefore, it is meaningless to analyses technologies of power without considering the political rationality underpinning them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0896920511419900">Lemke, 2001</xref>: 191). Technologies hence form the means by which one is channelled to think, rationalise and act in particular ways that obey the logic of the political rationality in place.</p>
<p>This paper examines neoliberalism as a set of economic tenets <italic>and</italic> as a form of governmentality by considering the neoliberal political rationality that forms the basis for their existence. As Brown points out, reducing neoliberalism to merely a collection of economic policies ignores ‘the <italic>political rationality</italic> that both organises these policies and reaches beyond the market’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511419900">Brown, 2005</xref>: 38). In addition, what is often witnessed in neoliberalism as “the retreat of the state” - relinquishing its involvement in state-owned enterprises and direct provision of public services, and transferring that role to the private sector and market forces instead - constitutes one half of the story. The other half is that the so-called “retreat” often accompanied the growth of state institutions acting to expand the realm of state governance into the lives of all within society. Through the example of Singapore, the paper demonstrates that this simultaneous retreat and expansion of the state is no paradox but exists in a relationship of mutual dependence, a consequence of the neoliberal political rationality in effect.</p>
<p>The growth of Singapore into a major regional business and economic centre is well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511419900">Huff, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920511419900">Rodan, 1989</xref>). A major reason for this can be credited to the undertaking of an Export-Oriented Industrialisation (EOI) strategy by the fledgling state’s political leaders after independence in 1965. Through a concerted effort by the various state institutions - in particular, the Economic Development Board (EDB) – as well as the use of draconian laws to keep labour servile and politically inactive, foreign investment flowed into the country. This is represented most visibly by the presence of foreign multi-national companies (MNCs) across the island. The state-led industrialisation strategy was viewed by the then (and current) ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) to be the most effective, efficient and instrumentally rational means of engendering economic growth, and thus regarded to be the most “pragmatic” course of action. The notion of “pragmatism” has come to symbolise and embodies the approach that the PAP takes in all spheres of life, be they economic, political or social, and forms the foundation for the <italic>ideology of pragmatism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511419900">Chua, 1995</xref>). It is imperative to note though, that whatever that constituted “pragmatic” is defined <italic>from the position of the PAP</italic>, as opposed to for instance, the position of the rest of the populace. In light of the above, the following questions are posed: what are some of the outcomes when the neoliberal political rationality interacts with a developmental state? Specifically, what are those outcomes vis-à-vis a place like Singapore where a particular ideology based on a sort of “pragmatic” utilitarianism is hegemonic, and why?</p>
<p>I argue that the hegemony of the ideology of pragmatism in independent Singapore’s history allowed the easier adoption of the neoliberal political rationality, represented most noticeably through the implementation of neoliberal economic policies. The belief by the state elites that the adoption of neoliberal economics will lead to greater economic growth is a continuation from the logic informing their earlier implementation of state-led industrialisation. I also argue that there is a reduction of the state relying on the deploying of the ideological state apparatuses in the regulation of the citizen body. Instead, the influence of the neoliberal political rationality working through a neoliberal governmentality gradually becomes more dominant. Through neoliberal technologies of power and the self, the exercise of neoliberal governmentality compels the individual (citizen or otherwise) in Singapore society to self-regulate his/her behaviour and thinking to be in line with the neoliberal political rationality. However, this does not consign the ideological state apparatuses to a position of irrelevancy as it continues to operate in tandem with the latter, although it is arguable that its role is less prominent than before.</p>
<p>Following the above arguments, an outcome is the development of a cross between a developmental state and a neoliberal regulatory state which I term the <italic>neoliberal-developmental state</italic>, with the neoliberal political rationality as the operating logic manifesting in two ways. The first is integrating aspects of the neoliberal economic model into the developmental state, with all the latter’s associated features of direct state intervention into the economy, and the resulting power interests and relations from such interventions continuing to persist. The second way is in the exercising of a neoliberal governmentality that also guides its actions and operating rationale, demonstrated in the employment of neoliberal technologies of subjection and subjectivity. This is represented most prominently in the implementation of policies like the management of foreign labour migration, and the labour upgrading and re-training policies that work to create neoliberal subjects – individuals that are ‘self-active and self-reliant in the reproduction of his or her well-being through [the application of] market values and principles in the various spheres of everyday life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920511419900">Liow, 2009</xref>: 89). The embracement of neoliberalism by the PAP can thus be interpreted as an extension of its development strategies. It is also an outcome of organising the social, political and economic life of Singapore society around the ideology of pragmatism from its early days of development, of which the overarching purpose is to enable the quicker and more efficient accumulation of capital through high levels of economic growth.</p>
<p>The next section examines how the process of capital accumulation is a central theme in the emergence of neoliberalism, and discusses at length the neoliberal political rationality. Thereafter, the focus shifts to the history of Singapore as a developmental state, and on the political and economic developments during this period that smoothened the way for the implementation of neoliberal economic tenets. Subsequently, the concept of the neoliberal-developmental state and the reasons for its occurrence are looked at. This same section also examines the exercise of a neoliberal governmentality, manifested through the PAP’s methods of managing large number of foreign labourers within its borders, and the skills “upgrading” process of the citizenry. Finally, the paper concludes with a few comments about the Singapore neoliberal-developmental state and its relevancy in making sense of capitalism today.</p>

<title>Neoliberalism and the Neoliberal Political Rationality</title>
<p>The ascent of neoliberalism can be located in the capital accumulation crisis of the 1970s. At that time, neoliberal economic theory as espoused by Von Hayek and Friedman offered a possible solution towards this crisis, although the result was (and continues to be) increasing social inequality and the redistribution of wealth back to the ruling elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511419900">Harvey, 2005</xref>: 16-18). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0896920511419900">Rose (1999</xref>: 27) states that in the various critiques of Hayek, Friedman and others against welfare and the welfare state, a ‘certain rationality, call it neo-liberalism, came to provide a way of linking up these various tactics, integrating them <italic>in thought</italic> so that they appeared to partake in a coherent logic’. Primarily, the virtues of economic competition, the primacy of the market, the belief that the economy is independent of and separate from politics among others were emphasised upon. It was this rationality that ‘came to infuse, a whole variety of practises and assemblages for regulating economic life, medical care, welfare benefits, professional activity and so forth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0896920511419900">Rose, 1999</xref>: 27). This includes the state and at this level, the ‘[n]eoliberal [political] rationality, while foregrounding the market… involves <italic>extending and disseminating market values to all institutions and social action</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511419900">Brown, 2005</xref>: 39-40). The extension of the neoliberal political rationality ‘to the state itself indexes the state’s success according to its ability to sustain and foster the market and ties state legitimacy to such success’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511419900">Brown, 2005</xref>: 41). It informs and structures the practices of the state to become,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>enfolded and animated by market rationality… Political discourse on all matters is framed in entrepreneurial terms; <italic>the state must not simply concern itself with the market but think and behave like a market actor</italic> across all of its functions, including law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511419900">Brown, 2005</xref>: 42).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What transpires then is that ‘the health and growth of the economy [becomes] <italic>the</italic> basis of state legitimacy, both because the state is forthrightly responsible for the health of the economy and because of the economic rationality to which state practises have been submitted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511419900">Brown, 2005</xref>: 42).</p>
<p>At the same time, the neoliberal political rationality leads to the creation of neoliberal technologies of power that act on subjects by modifying the latter’s technologies of the self, rationalizing their worldviews and mode of existence so that they are able to self-regulate in accordance to the tenets of the market (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920511419900">Liow, 2009</xref>). The interaction between technologies of power and the self gives rise to the exercise of a neoliberal governmentality. Consequently, considering that governmentality ‘designate[s] the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups might be directed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511419900">Foucault, 1983</xref>: 221), a neoliberal governmentality is therefore an assortment of technologies and knowledge that helps to order and regulate everyday life conduct of individuals, groups and states in accordance to a market-based rationality i.e. the neoliberal political rationality.</p>
<sec id="section3-0896920511419900">
<title>The Material Basis for the Emergence of the Neoliberal Political Rationality</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0896920511419900">Rose (1999)</xref> claims that that there were no conscious attempts in the 1970s to create the doctrines of what has come to be recognised as neoliberalism today. For instance, the various economic policies implemented by the Thatcher Cabinet in the 1980s ‘were not realisation of any philosophy’ but ‘were, rather, contingent lash-ups of thoughts and action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0896920511419900">Rose, 1999</xref>: 27) at resolving the various problems of governing. Harvey states it in another way: ‘The capitalist world stumbled towards neoliberalisation as the answer [to the crisis of the 1970s] through a series of gyrations and chaotic experiments that really only converged as a new orthodoxy with the articulation of what became known as the “Washington Consensus”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511419900">Harvey, 2005</xref>: 13). While these <italic>ad hoc</italic> methods were indeed ‘practical attempts to think about and act upon specific problems in particular locales’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0896920511419900">Rose, 1999</xref>: 27), including addressing the crisis of that period and ensuring growth, it is undeniable that matters of class and class interests will have exercised their influence in the formulation of those “contingent lash-ups” that gave rise to the neoliberal political rationality. Then, with rising unemployment and accelerating inflation, populist, socialist and communist parties gained ground, representing a ‘<italic>political</italic> threat’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511419900">Harvey, 2005</xref>: 15) and ‘<italic>economic threat</italic> to the position of ruling elites and classes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511419900">Harvey, 2005</xref>: 15). There was an urgent need on the part of the ruling classes ‘to move decisively if they were to protect themselves from political and economic annihilation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511419900">Harvey, 2005</xref>: 15) and to defend their own interests. Indeed, it is difficult to ignore the class position of policy-makers and power holders in the United States and Britain, and not consider how the implementation of the economic theories of Hayek and Friedman coincided with the general class interests of those policy-makers. The neoliberalisation of advanced capitalist economies is in part ‘a <italic>political</italic> project to re-establish the conditions for capital accumulation and to restore the power of economic elites’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511419900">Harvey, 2005</xref>: 19; see also 31-6). This ‘has succeeded remarkably well in restoring, or in some instances (as in Russia and China) creating, the power of an economic elite’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511419900">Harvey, 2005</xref>: 19; See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511419900">Foster and Magdoff, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The point is that the emergence of the neoliberal political rationality (and hence neoliberalism) has its roots in the material conditions of that period. The accompanying elements and practises that came to regulate economic and social life are an outcome of the capitalist logic intrinsic within the neoliberal political rationality. Attempts at strengthening the class power of the capitalist class led to the materialisation of the neoliberal political rationality, represented most visibly as a coherent set of economic doctrines, and more imperceptibly as a form of governmentality. It is therefore crucial to acknowledge the material basis of the neoliberal political rationality and that it is one remaining rooted to the interests of the capital-owning class. The neoliberal political rationality denotes the means by which the more efficient accumulation of capital and restoration of class power are carried out.</p>
<p>Just as it is crucial to be conscious of the material basis behind the emergence of the neoliberal political rationality, one must likewise be similarly aware of the various historical and economic developments in the history of the Singapore developmental state. These have allowed for the neoliberal political rationality to be more readily accepted and integrated, with consequences that continue to reverberate till this day.</p>

<title>The Neoliberalisation of Singapore?</title>
<sec id="section5-0896920511419900">
<title>Singapore’s History as a Developmental State Post-1965</title>
<p>The developmental state thesis in essence postulates the notion that state-led macroeconomic planning and industrialisation efforts can engender economic growth. Such a task is undertaken by a group of technocrats who enjoy substantial political leeway in making decisions that may prove unpopular with the larger society, but are beneficial towards the purpose of generating economic growth. There is a large degree of state intervention in the economy through massive regulation and planning, particularly in relation to the strategising and carrying out of trade and industrial policies. There is also extensive use of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511419900">Althusser (2008)</xref> refers to as the ideological state apparatus (ISA) to socialise and condition the people into thinking and behaving in ways conducive for the advancement of the interest of those at the helm of the developmental state. At the same time, the use of political repression via the repressive state apparatus (RSA) - exemplified by the period of military dictatorships during the 1980s in Taiwan and South Korea - also forms a common feature of the developmental state.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, Singapore is widely considered as a typical developmental state (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511419900">Castells, 1988</xref>). As mentioned in the beginning, the heavy involvement of the state in Singapore’s economy is evident in its direct participation. This includes starting up state-owned companies to facilitate the growth of the economy, as well as actively providing the necessary logistical and infrastructural support for foreign firms to invest in the country. Its efforts have brought the island state through two economic phases, and worked to lay the basis for the third today, known as the Knowledge-Based Economy (KBE) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920511419900">Rodan, 1989</xref>). In addition, the Singapore developmental state has also been heavily involved in creating an efficient civil service bureaucracy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920511419900">2</xref></sup> the cultivation of technocrats and in the use of political repression to fulfil political, economic and social objectives among others. Indeed, the concept of the developmental state as applied to Singapore is so enduring that the country continues to be regarded so by some.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920511419900">3</xref></sup> However it is highly debatable that the Singapore developmental state continues to exist unchanged, given developments over the last three decades since independence.</p>
<p>Initially, an independent Singapore was beyond the contemplation of its founding leaders with the assumption that it will be a permanent part of the then newly-formed Federation of Malaysia. Differences on issues of race and citizenship proved irreconcilable, resulting in separation and independence in 1965. Facing internal problems and external threats, the PAP put in place a system based on ‘one central concern, namely, “national survival”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511419900">Chua, 1995</xref>: 48). The conditions under which Singapore came into existence became ‘distilled and conceptualised by the PAP into an issue of the “survival of the nation” that could be resolved by successful capitalistic industrial development’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511419900">Chua, 1995</xref>: 4). An ideology of pragmatism came to be ‘the structuring centre of reasoning and rationalization of the policies by which Singapore has been governed since independence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511419900">Chua, 1995</xref>: 48). To be more precise, pragmatism is regarded as a ‘national identity [based on] purposive rational action, one of means-end calculation, one of technology of science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511419900">Chan and Evers, 1973</xref>: 317). Thus decisions are made on the basis of utilitarian economic principles to the exclusion of non-economic ones like human and democratic rights.</p>
<p>To reiterate, what the PAP considers as “pragmatic” policies may be so in terms of furthering its own interests and agenda. Being “pragmatic” is not an objective condition in itself as for the rest of the populace, that which is regarded as “pragmatic” for them either receives no consideration, or the PAP may claim that their policies <italic>are</italic> pragmatic for the people. Practises by both individual and state-level actors challenging the “pragmatic” and “rational” direction (such as instituting a minimum-wage law, greater protection of low-skilled foreign workers and greater political freedom) are deemed counterproductive to the country’s economic interests and regarded as undesirable. The PAP constantly justifies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920511419900">4</xref></sup> that ‘continuous economic growth is the wellspring of all else in a Singaporean’s life, including a democratic society in the end. Thus all aspects of social life are to be instrumentally harnessed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511419900">Chua, 1995</xref>: 59) towards such a purpose.</p>
<p>Such an instrumental rational approach marks ‘the conceptual kernel of the PAP’s political pragmatism and its logical unfolding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511419900">Chua, 1995</xref>: 59) is witnessed in the social, economic and political arena. Singaporeans are ‘admonished to identify with the economic success of the state… As these policies [are based]…on rational and scientific principles, any criticism of these policies can be branded as irrational’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511419900">Chan &amp; Evers 1973</xref>: 317) by the PAP. It is based on this rationale that labour-unfriendly measures were put in place and justified. These include the introduction of a Bill rendering strikes as illegal and the extension of the working week at the expense of workers’ welfare in terms of reduction in annual and medical leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511419900">Rodan, 1997</xref>: 152). These measures were implemented to generate growth, and hence for the “pragmatic” PAP, ‘the sectional interest of labour was to be subjugated to the larger interest of national survival’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511419900">Chua, 1995</xref>: 18). Repressive measures were used and justified on the basis of contributing to the “greater good” of the country and if ‘a measure of social control can be shown to contribute to economic growth, it is considered as necessary to survival <italic>per se</italic> and hence, “pragmatic.”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511419900">Chua, 1995</xref>: 4) The success of the PAP in fostering a business friendly environment is also due to the knowledge on the part of the populace that dissent is not tolerated; it will deploy the repressive state apparatus if necessary to ensure compliance with its “pragmatic” approach. History has shown this to be the case.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0896920511419900">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over the following years, the ideology of pragmatism has steadily ‘penetrated the consciousness of the population and has come to serve as the conceptual boundaries within which Singaporeans think through significant portions of their daily life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511419900">Chua, 1995</xref>: 68). Many have internalised the belief that economic success requires social and political stability and these necessarily come at the expense of sacrificing some political and constitutional rights. If economic growth represented the “pragmatic” goal of the Singapore state, it was reproduced at the level of everyday life in a culture of mass consumption. The ideology of pragmatism thus grounded the legitimacy of the PAP in the fulfilling of this criterion of growth. The resulting traits that the Singapore state and much of the population has come to value – instrumental rationality based on market principles, utilitarianism, and competition amongst others - are an outcome of the ideology of pragmatism translated into practice. It is also noteworthy that these are the very same traits that allow for capitalism to thrive in Singapore.</p>

<title>Metamorphosis: Developmental State to Neoliberal State?</title>
<p>As opposed to the developmental state, the neoliberal regulatory state in theory appears to occupy the other end of the continuum. The role of such a state is to provide the basis upon which the market, driven by the existence of an abstract “natural” law, can be allowed to flourish. It entails the state taking upon a substantially lesser role in actualising trade and industry strategies. Instead, the private sector is to be roped in as the more dominant and active participant in bringing those strategies to fruition. Such a minimal state was actively advocated by the WB and the IMF as well as certain countries (in particular the United States) in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis. The IMF pointed out that “distortions” to the market by state intervention and cronyism had given rise to the financial meltdown. The aim of those reforms was to create a state where ‘“technopols” would be able to get on with the job of creating rationally efficient policies and institutions insulated from the raids of predatory alliances and the demands of vested interests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511419900">Robison, Rodan and Hewison, 2005</xref>: 172).</p>
<p>Singapore appears to be transiting from a developmental state to a neoliberal regulatory one. In many a speeches by PAP politicians, policies to be undertaken must possess economically-rational justifications and be regarded as “market-friendly”. Policies tapping into the free market form the most “rational” approach, given the operation of the global economy in accordance to so-called “market principles” i.e. capitalist logic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0896920511419900">6</xref></sup> For instance, Inderjit Singh, who is the chairperson of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Finance and Trade and Industry, considers that ‘the long-term model for Singapore “must get close to the Washington Consensus model”, which gives markets freer rein to drive growth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0896920511419900">The Straits Times Insight, 21 June 2008</xref>). A report on Singapore’s competitiveness known as the Committee on Singapore’s Competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419900">CSC, 1998</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0896920511419900">7</xref></sup> acknowledges that the state’s role had been to provide ‘stable, rational and predictable economic policies and regulatory environments [which] include good industrial relations, free enterprise, free trade, market-based allocation of resources’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419900">CSC, 1998</xref>: 115) among others.</p>
<p>In addition, the PAP actively sought to expand the financial and business services industries in Singapore since the late 1980s through opening the economy up to be more receptive of international capital flows in a bid to turn Singapore into a regional financial and business hub. The intention is to further deepen the level of integration between the economy of Singapore and the global capitalist one. The privatisation of the once-national Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) as well as the liberalisation of the banking sector reflects such an aspiration. One of the CSC’s recommendations vis-à-vis financial institutions is that ‘[r]egulation should increasingly be replaced by supervision [as] [b]lanket regulation risk stunting the growth of sound financial institutions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419900">CSC, 1998</xref>: 141). Other practises rooted in neoliberal economics have been adopted to allow for the mechanisms sustaining Singapore’s economic growth vis-à-vis the global economy to continue operating. The 1990s in particular bore witness to this course of action, especially in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis. Some of the measures taken during this period included a slew of economic deregulation and liberalisation which affected the banking, services, telecommunications, public transport and power sectors.</p>
<p>Other reforms recommended were the reductions in national savings and raising the level of private consumption, the decoupling of government-linked companies (GLCs) - which are essentially state enterprises set up after 1965 as part of the state’s effort at kick-starting the economy - and the transfer of SGD 62 billion from the compulsory national superannuation scheme (the Central Provident Fund or CPF) to the hands of fund managers and superannuation schemes in the private sector<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0896920511419900">8</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511419900">Robison et al, 2005</xref>: 178). These recommendations had all been carried out to varying degrees. In addition, other sectors like healthcare and public transportation had become liberalised in recent years. The adoption of neoliberal reforms took place insofar as it was perceived to represent the best means for the perpetuation of economic growth, since the legitimacy of the PAP hinged upon this (though the degree to which growth benefits the general population is another question altogether).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0896920511419900">9</xref></sup> These actions, along with the implementation of the recommendations of the CSC point to the PAP as an advocate of a neoliberalised economy and that the transition to a neoliberal regulatory state is underway. Yet there is more than meets the eye.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0896920511419900">
<title>The Persistence of Power Relations and Interests</title>
<p>One of the problems in the perspective of the World Bank and the IMF is ignoring the presence of embedded social and power relations and the continuing influence of these relations within supposedly “neutral” and “rationally efficient” institutions and amongst technopols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511419900">Robison et al, 2005</xref>: 176). The wholesale transition from developmental state to neoliberal regulatory state is rendered problematic precisely because of those historically embedded power relations and interests. Instead the implementation of neoliberal reforms by the PAP led to ‘a refashioning of the developmental state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511419900">Robison et al, 2005</xref>: 181). For all its rhetoric about the market and the carrying out of structural reforms along neoliberal lines, the PAP wanted to preserve ‘the essence of those existing structures of the developmental state within which a specific set of power relations are embedded’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511419900">Robison et al, 2005</xref>: 173), as it was the PAP that created and are the beneficiaries of said structures. Hence the inclusion of neoliberal reforms did not indicate a complete abandonment of the developmental state model as it was the ‘[r]etention of fundamental power relations underlying the prevailing developmental state, and not all the intricate forms of that state [that] are the priority for the PAP’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511419900">Robison et al, 2005</xref>: 179). Thus, while the PAP continues to wax lyrical about being proponents of market forces, this position is highly selective and strategic. The rhetoric of market forces for instance allows them to continue justifying the absence of a minimum wage law,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0896920511419900">10</xref></sup> as well as the salaries of ministers and senior civil servants, which are some of the highest in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0896920511419900">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The PAP is also more liberal regarding certain sectors like finance and business, but continues to wield considerable influence in the utilities, communications and transport sectors (just to name a few) through its former GLCs. Even though privatised and supposedly independent, these former GLCs continue to maintain close ties with the state either as being a subsidiary of the giant state-linked investment company Temasek Holdings and/or by having its upper management personnel drawn from the upper echelons of the civil service and armed forces. More importantly, “competitors” in those sectors remain tied to the state or Temasek Holdings in one way or another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0896920511419900">12</xref></sup> The PAP thus has a real interest as to how well its former GLCs are doing in terms of profitability. Based on this, it is possible to arrive at the notion that the PAP’s declaration of being market friendly comprises of attempts to incorporate neoliberal reforms to strategically position Singapore to take advantage of changes in the global capitalist economy while at the same time preserving its own interests by remaining significantly connected to these numerous former GLCs.</p>
<p>Being regarded as ‘pro-market’ allows for arguments of “market efficiency” to be made and helped to pave the way for GLCs to become privatised into corporate entities and for former public sectors to be liberalised. Although this may resemble the classic withdrawal of the state in neoliberalism - relinquishing its involvement in state-owned enterprises and direct provision of public services, and transferring that role to the private sector and market forces instead - it is not as simple. Given that many of these former GLCs still have strong ties to the state, it seems that the state is operating as an umbrella organisation that oversees former GLCs – essentially profit-making GLCs now – masquerading as private companies. The payments that these former GLCs received from the populace are thus regarded as going to profit-seeking entities, even though the latter continue to enjoy close links and protection from the state that normal private companies would not otherwise have. In addition, some (like the public transport companies for instance) have become public-listed entities and are placed in a situation where they need to be accountable to their shareholders in generating profits while at the same time having to provide essential public services. It is thus highly questionable if the public interest is served given that the profit-motive has entered the picture. As a result of the privatisation process, it appears that the provision of essential public services at low costs affordable to the general public is increasingly becoming sidelined in favour of profit generation.</p>
<p>As a result, the extent to which the neoliberal regulatory state has supplanted the developmental state in Singapore is at best regarded as ‘ambiguous and inconclusive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511419900">Robison et al, 2005</xref>: 173). After all, the close connections with numerous GLCs allow for the PAP to retain control over a large sector of the Singapore economy, and thus for it to preserve its historically embedded interests and power relations that comes with such control. In this way, appeals to neoliberal economic tenets tend to be more rhetoric than practise. Thus, the transition from a developmental state to a wholly neoliberal regulatory state is not possible owing to existing embedded power relations and interests. Instead what occurs is the preservation of those structures that continue those relations and the selective incorporation of neoliberal economic practises or what is referred to as ‘a rationalisation of [the developmental state]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511419900">Robison et al, 2005</xref>: 181). The result is the neoliberal-developmental state.</p>

<title>Singapore as a Neoliberal Developmental State</title>
<p>The notion of the neoliberal-developmental state is partly developed from the ideas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511419900">Robison, Rodan and Hewison (2005)</xref>. As already discussed earlier, while an implementation of certain neoliberal reforms by the PAP can be observed, core structures and institutions of the developmental state continue to exist. This is one of three defining features of a neoliberal-developmental state. Tied to the first (neoliberal economic reforms) is the second feature, which is the existence and operation of a neoliberal political rationality. The third feature is intertwined with the second, which is that the neoliberal political rationality has given rise to the exercising of a neoliberal governmentality, employing neoliberal technologies of subjection and subjectivity in its objective of fostering economic growth.</p>
<sec id="section9-0896920511419900">
<title>The State: Some Clarifications</title>
<p>Like all states, it is pertinent to bear in mind that the Singapore neoliberal-developmental state is an <italic>outcome</italic> rather than an <italic>a priori</italic> entity that precedes any sort of ‘political action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511419900">Lemke, 2007</xref>: 10). Indeed, Foucault argues that ‘the state does not have an essence. The state is not universal nor in itself an autonomous source of power… [the state] has no heart in the sense that it has no interior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511419900">Foucault, 2008</xref>: 77). It needs to work through bodies, practises and strategies in order to manifest its presence. He also regards that ‘the state is nothing else but the mobile effect of a regime of multiple governmentalities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511419900">Foucault, 2008</xref>: 77). It is ‘superstructural in relation to a whole series of power network’ which includes the governmentalities of the body, sexuality, family, knowledge et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511419900">Foucault, 1980</xref>: 122). In effect, the state represents ‘<italic>the codification of a whole number of power relations which render its functioning possible</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511419900">Foucault, 1980</xref>: 122, emphasis added). Governmentality and its practices consequently form the key to an analysis of the modern state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511419900">Foucault, 2008</xref>: 78). Drawing from Foucault, Lemke likewise argues that the state is ‘to be understood as an emergent and complex resultant of conflicting and contradictory governmental practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511419900">Lemke, 2007</xref>: 10). The state thus needs to be understood as a type of effect,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0896920511419900">13</xref></sup> that is as an outcome ‘and instrument of political strategies and social relations of power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511419900">Lemke, 2007</xref>: 10). It is hence important to keep in mind that the political transformation of the Singapore state from a developmental to a neoliberal-developmental one is an outcome of historical events that has resulted in the creation, alteration, growth and maintenance of the various institutions, strategies and power relations that constitute its “essence” at present.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0896920511419900">
<title>A Confluence of Ideology and Governmentality</title>
<p>It is in these very historical developments that one can locate the reason for the clear resonance between the neoliberal political rationality and the PAP’s ideology of pragmatism and fixation on economic growth as a measure of competent governance. Crucially though perhaps unsurprisingly, the “pragmatic” values of the ideology coincide fittingly with those espoused by the neoliberal political rationality because both are about creating an optimal environment for capitalism to flourish. This helps to prepare the ground for the latter to be more easily accepted. The hegemonic ideology of pragmatism prepared the ground for a moral discourse centring on the “good” that is associated with market-led economic growth to be introduced into the national psyche, allowing for the neoliberal political rationality to become more easily entrenched within the political and social landscape of Singapore than otherwise. The confluence between ideology and political rationality is traced to assuming that the market and being instrumentally rational are inherently “Good Things” in themselves, manifested most vividly through the goal of economic growth at the level of the state and a culture centred on consumption at the level of the individual. It is also witnessed in how the PAP structures the country’s economic policies and strategies in a manner most accommodating for the operation of “market forces”, presenting these formulations as contributing to national interests. For the populace, the implementation of neoliberal reforms is akin to merely putting old wine into new bottles.</p>
<p>In addition, just as sectional interests and embedded power relations among others carried over from the developmental state continue to play a significant role, the same can be said of the role of the ideology of pragmatism vis-à-vis the neoliberal political rationality. The emergence of the latter does not relegate the former to a position of insignificance. Instead the situation becomes more complex, with both working towards fulfilling the primary objective of the PAP (economic growth). The difference between the use of ideology and political rationality however, is that the existence of the former tends to have the support of the hidden but very real presence of the coercive elements of the state. As mentioned, the ideology of pragmatism was accompanied by the threat of state coercion i.e. the exercise of sovereign power. With the neoliberal political rationality however, there is lesser need (though <italic>not</italic> an absence) for the employing of coercion to make Singaporeans conform to the directions of the PAP. Instead what exists is a tendency towards exhorting the desirability of economic growth and prosperity, material consumption and the creation and sustaining of what has been referred to by former Senior Minister (SM) Goh Chok Tong as a ‘Swiss standard of living’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511419900">Lim, 2001</xref>). While there will certainly be exceptions where the use of coercion holds more sway, there is a lesser need for its use to ensure conformity. Coercion, while still an important tool in the maintenance of social control, no longer forms the only means by which the PAP can utilise in the regulation of the citizenry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0896920511419900">14</xref></sup> Yet even as the operation of governmentality gradually comes to co-exist with the exercise of sovereign power the latter is never fully displaced, at least not in the Singapore case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0896920511419900">
<title>The Role of Institutions</title>
<p>In the regulation of Singapore society, the diffusion of norms and modes of living in accordance to the neoliberal political rationality are transmitted via the institutions of the state. For this reason, it is useful to bring in Mann’s work on the growth of infrastructural power in the modern state. Like Foucault, he argues that the state ‘<italic>is</italic> merely and essentially an arena, <italic>a place</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511419900">Mann, 1984</xref>: 187). Mann conceptualises state power as being derived from two forms of power: despotic and infrastructural power. Despotic power refers to possessing an authority over a group or groups of individuals to do as directed, supported by the threat of coercion. On the other hand, infrastructural power stresses on the ability of the state to institutionalise and reproduce certain moulds of behaviour and action. In doing so, its power is such that it is able to ‘[penetrate] everyday life more than did any historical state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511419900">Mann, 1984</xref>: 189). Increasingly within modern states (Mann references capitalist democracies in particular), infrastructural power is becoming far more pervasive and dominant, with an emphasis especially on the role of institutions in the diffusion of norms and modes of behaviour. An increase in the infrastructural powers of the state has led to a similar increase in ‘the territoriality of social life itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511419900">Mann, 1984</xref>: 211) allowing the exercise of a ‘massive force over social life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511419900">Mann, 1984</xref>: 212).</p>
<p>Mann’s concept of despotic and infrastructural power is highly similar to Foucault’s concepts of the sovereign power (which is repressive and coercive) and government(ality) respectively. Indeed, the role of institutions vis-à-vis infrastructural power mirrors the role of technologies of the self and power vis-à-vis governmentality. Foucault suggests that for power relations to be ‘progressively governmentalised’ (1983: 224) it is necessary to work through the ‘auspices’ of state institutions (1983: 224). Like Mann, Foucault recognises that the norms within a society are diffused through institutions, which strengthens the state’s capacity and simultaneously ensuring its penetration into everyday life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511419900">Lemke (2007</xref>: 9) draws on this association by suggesting that institutions be regarded as technologies. The institutions of the state are therefore considered as end-products, since they are primarily ‘technologies that are materialised and stabilised in institutional settings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511419900">Lemke 2007</xref>: 9). Therefore this approach to the conceptualisation of the state locates political transformations to essentially ‘new technologies and forms of knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511419900">Lemke, 2007</xref>: 9). In the case of the Singapore neoliberal-developmental state, this is seen in the employment of neoliberal technologies of subjection and subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511419900">Ong, 2006</xref>) – essentially forms of technologies of power and of the self - leading to the development of new types of institutions and practises. This expansion of infrastructural power has given rise to the bringing about of new norms, practises and modes of behaviour, shown through the examples of the Work Pass system and the discourse on labour upgrading policies.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511419900">Ong (2006)</xref> regards that ‘postdevelopmental’ (177) strategies of Southeast Asian states informed by a neoliberal political rationality tend to emphasise ‘the <italic>control of the population</italic> [as] a key strategy for linking up with global circuits of capital’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511419900">Ong, 2006</xref>: 177, emphasis added). In relation to this, technologies of subjection are utilised as part of operationalising such a strategy. Technologies of subjection refer to</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>political strategies that differently regulate populations for optimal productivity, increasingly through spatial practises that engage market forces. Such regulations include the fortressisation of urban space, the control of travel, and the recruitment of certain kinds of actors to growth hubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511419900">Ong, 2006</xref>: 6).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such differential regulations are what the Singapore neoliberal-developmental state has been engaging in, witnessed in the example of the Work Pass system that practices differential treatment of workers in accordance to their class, ethnicity, sex and the degree to which each of them can contribute to the economic growth of Singapore.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0896920511419900">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the EOI phase, that Singapore generally lacks adequate local manpower for its growing industries was evident. This continues to be the case today, where there is a constant need to import manpower from the world over to take up positions at the construction site, the factory production line, the department store or the office cubicle. Such a situation is set to continue if one considers the constant fall in the rate of population growth, which has slipped below the replacement level of 2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511419900">Tan, 10 April 2002</xref>). Since 1965 the Singapore state has developed a series of policies in order to bring in and at the same time control the ever-burgeoning number of foreigners coming into Singapore for work. Through examining how the Singapore state manages the in and outflow of foreign manpower, one can discern that such a policy has its underpinnings in the ideology of pragmatism and subsequently, the neoliberal political rationality. Foreign manpower here refers broadly at to all individuals, ranging across class, ethnicity and sex who come into Singapore for the purpose of working in the city-state – from the foreign domestic worker (FDW) working for the Singaporean family, the Indian Information Technology (IT) systems expatriate employed in a local bank to the American Director managing the Singapore branch of a large transnational corporation. The purpose of examining the Work Pass system is to illustrate the management of foreign workers coming into Singapore. It demonstrates the utilitarian and instrumental nature of the Singapore state imbued with the neoliberal political rationality, with little or no concern for the welfare of individuals unless it proves economically expedient to do so.</p>
<p>Currently, any foreigner wishing to seek employment within Singapore needs to apply and obtain a work pass from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). The current Work Pass system is a revamp of an earlier one. Prior to the change in late 1998, there were two categories under which foreigners could apply. Depending on the monthly income earned (qualifications became an important factor later on in the following years) he or she could apply for either the Employment Pass or the Work Permit. In 1984, the minimum monthly salary needed to qualify for the Employment Pass was SGD1000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0896920511419900">Ministry of Home Affairs, 1984</xref>: 3), and this eventually increased to SGD2000 in 1997. While there was no explicit stipulation regarding educational qualifications in 1984, by 1997 the MOM allowed for the use of educational qualifications (degree or diploma) to apply for the pass even if the salary is less than SGD2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920511419900">Goh, 1997</xref>: 151).</p>
<p>The current Work Pass system came into existence in 1998 and is a precise instrument for differentiating types of workers. Depending on the nature of work being done, educational level of the applicant, salary level among other criteria, the worker will be allowed to apply for either a Work Permit (R-Pass), S-Pass, or Employment Pass.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0896920511419900">16</xref></sup> The Work Pass system stipulates clearly and specifically the limits as to what the foreign labourer can or cannot do. This includes matters such as the bringing in of a spouse, family and/or parents, the number of years as to which the worker is allowed to remain in Singapore and chances for obtaining permanent residency (PR) or citizenship, among others. Generally the higher the educational level of the worker and the more relevant the worker’s expertise and technical skills are to a particular industry (especially those that the PAP plans to expand) the less restrictive the work pass. Through using the various passes as a sorting mechanism, the flow of foreign labour becomes regulated in accordance to a very specific set of criteria that can be adjusted accordingly. The system provides the means to identify individuals considered desirable in the eyes of the PAP. These include those possessing high levels of education and are able to contribute towards the intellectual and economic capital of the country.</p>
<p>The rationale for the system is purely economical and utilitarian. Former Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Wong Kan Seng emphasises that ‘Singapore must remain open to global talent in its drive to stay ahead of competitors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0896920511419900">Peh, 2006</xref>). In order to counter the threat of global competition and the sharply declining birth-rates, he states that Singaporeans ‘should encourage those who can contribute to settle down here…This is the way to enlarge the economic pie. There will then be more for everyone to share’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0896920511419900">Peh, 2006</xref>). However this does not apply equally to all foreign individuals coming into Singapore to work and depends on the degree of economic contribution that he or she can make to the Singapore economy, gauged through the criteria of education and salary levels. The segregation of workers is also reflected in the semiotics of how foreign labourers are labelled by political leaders and the local mass media, and which has since filtered down as everyday reference for the populace. Those involved in low-end types of jobs are referred to as “foreign <italic>workers</italic>”. On the other hand, those deemed more skilled and command higher salaries are regarded as “foreign <italic>talent</italic>”.</p>
<p>“Foreign talents” has been identified by the PAP to be one of the crucial pillars for the advancement, growth and sustaining of the Singapore economy. In the 2006 National Day Rally Speech, PM Lee Hsien Loong stated that ‘welcoming foreign talent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511419900">Channel NewsAsia, 21 August 2006</xref>) is vital to ensuring the vitality of the Singapore economy. This is also reflected in the statements made by his predecessor former SM Goh Chok Tong who said in 1999 that the country needs to ‘attract and welcome international talent from abroad’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511419900">Suryanarayana, 1999</xref>) in order to ‘build a first-world economy and a world-class home’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511419900">Suryanarayana, 1999</xref>). He reiterated in 2002 ‘the importance of attracting international talent to Singapore. This is crucial for [Singapore’s] growth and development’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511419900">Goh, 2002</xref>). One can trace the origins of this policy of attracting “foreign talent” back to 1989, when immigration control laws were liberalised by the state, with the rationale behind the move being the same as at present:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Singapore’s growing economy needed more skilled workers and professionals than were being produced at home… Shortage of talent means fewer foreign investors establishing businesses here, slower growth and fewer opportunities for Singaporeans… Singapore therefore welcomes foreign immigrants who can contribute to Singapore’s economy and be integrated into our society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0896920511419900">The Straits Times, 11 July 1989</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In light of the above, Wong’s earlier allusion primarily applies to this group of “foreign talents” i.e. those possessing high levels of education, and experts in the various fields that Singapore is currently looking to develop. These include the field of biomedicine, life sciences, financial and business services among others. The bias stems from the hope that these foreigners will eventually take up citizenship, thereby contributing to the overall quality of the manpower and engender economic growth in Singapore. This is why employment pass holders are able to apply for their family members to come over to Singapore to stay for the long term.</p>
<p>On the opposite end are the “foreign workers.” These are mostly on the R-Pass and better known as work-permit holders, and are much less skilled and educated vis-à-vis the employment pass holders. They are only allowed to come into Singapore to function as a means to an end - to build the infrastructure (such as construction workers) or as workers servicing “foreign talents” and local Singaporeans in the service sector. Construction workers, foreign domestic workers, and low-level retail workers among others belong to this category. Their purpose is to maintain the functioning of the Singapore economy. Due to their class, education level and/or ethnicity, they are deemed as “surplus” in the sense that their presence as long-term residents is considered by the PAP to be highly undesirable. Long-term residency in Singapore is thus not an option open to this category of workers. Once a worker’s work permit expires at the end of two years, his or her employer may or may not choose to renew it. Even if the worker desires to continue working, this is not up to him or her. Workers on work permits are not allowed to stay in the country in the hopes of acquiring citizenship, unlike the “foreign talents”. The latter group is able to exercise a much larger degree of control over their decision to remain here or return back to where they originated.</p>
<p>The Work Pass system is an outcome of the desire of the Singapore neoliberal-developmental state to create and sustain economic growth in the most economically efficient and “pragmatic” manner possible. While the need for foreign manpower to power the Singapore economy is recognised, at the same time it is evident some types of foreigners are deemed more “desirable” than others. The policy of differentiating the types of migrant workers coming in reflects the political rationality of the state as one geared towards economically rational market principles – seeking to retain those “talents” who will be of future use for economic growth, while those considered as “workers” are simply made used of and “disposed” i.e. sent back to their home country with no option to stay in Singapore as a permanent resident or to acquire citizenship. The Work Pass system is hence highly utilitarian and calculative in its purpose, demonstrating the existence of a neoliberal political rationality as the governing rationale of the Singapore neoliberal-developmental state.</p>

<title>Technologies of Subjectivity: Upgrading and the Work Development Agency (WDA)</title>
<p>While the Work Pass system is an example of how the employment of neoliberal technologies of subjection is utilised to control the flow of “desirable” immigrants into Singapore, mechanisms are simultaneously put in place to (re)shape Singaporeans into neoliberal subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920511419900">Liow, 2009</xref>: 91-4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511419900">Ong, 2006</xref>: 12-14; See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0896920511419900">Jayasuriya, 2006</xref>: 245-50) through technologies of subjectivity. Technologies of subjectivity refer to ‘an array of knowledge and expert systems to induce self-animation and self-government so that citizens can optimise choices, efficiency, and competitiveness in turbulent market conditions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511419900">Ong, 2006</xref>: 6). An example will be workplace practises pegging bonus amounts and/or job security to the performance of individuals and his or her contribution to the company. Through these, workers’ technologies of the self become aligned to that of the traits espoused by the neoliberal ethos: highly competitive, economically independent, expected to become self-reliant and active in the reproduction of his or her well-being through the application of market values and principles in matters of everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920511419900">Liow, 2009</xref>). In other words, the neoliberal subject is expected to be ‘an entrepreneur of himself or herself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511419900">Gordon, 1991</xref>: 43-4).</p>
<p>The PAP has implemented a range of technologies of subjectivity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0896920511419900">17</xref></sup> aim at producing neoliberal subjects. The discourse of upgrading is one of the most prominent examples. It has constituted a part of the PAP’s rhetoric for the past three decades, and has recently been officially made into public policy. The roots of the discourse can roughly be traced to the setting up of the Skills Development Fund (SDF). This was conceived in October 1979 and comes under the Skills Development Levy (SDL) Act. The purpose of the SDF was to encourage employers ‘to invest in skills upgrading of the workforce’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0896920511419900">SDF Website, 2010</xref>) and is to be carried out via the offering of incentives ‘on the basis of a cost-sharing principle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0896920511419900">SDF Website, 2010</xref>). The additional condition is that the type of ‘training must be relevant to the economic development of Singapore’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0896920511419900">SDF Website, 2010</xref>). The SDF figured as an important part of the so-called Second Industrial Revolution in Singapore, the latter being the economic phase which the PAP attempted to transform and improve Singapore’s labour workforce into becoming semi-skilled and skilled workers. Then in 1979, the workforce predominantly consisted of low-skilled workers engaged in mass production. However, the Second Industrial Revolution failed to takeoff and was largely regarded as a failure. Yet the subsequent shift to the Knowledge-Based Economy (KBE) did not render the SDF redundant. Instead, the SDF continued to provide a source of funding to subsidise businesses seeking to actively upgrade the skills of their workers. For all intents and purposes, the SDF continued to fulfil the function for which it was originally developed. A complement to the SDF was the Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) which was set up in the December of 1996. The purpose was to retrain unskilled and semi-skilled workers in their mid-career paths to pick up new sets of skills in order to better their chances of employability. While talks of upgrading have been mentioned consistently over the years that followed, the extent to which action was taken to bring about such an eventuality was largely limited to the SDF and the SRP.</p>
<p>This discourse of upgrading as a means to staying employable and relevant started picking up noticeably after the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis. Such an approach is seen most clearly in the CSC report. It recommended the following to improve the so-called human capital of Singapore. The first is that the SDF needs to ‘be re-positioned to encourage employers to train their workers in certifiable skills’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419900">CSC, 1998</xref>: 87). In addition ‘the SRP [is to] be elevated to a national programme with greater funding and support from both Government and Employers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419900">CSC, 1998</xref>: 88). This will ‘help minimise the threat of structural unemployment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419900">CSC, 1998</xref>: 82). It also proposed setting up a National Skills Recognition System ‘to promote and guide skills upgrading’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419900">CSC, 1998</xref>: 82) and an Individual Skillsave Account ‘to encourage individuals themselves to <italic>take responsibility</italic> for their own skills upgrading’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419900">CSC, 1998</xref>: 87, emphasis added). The above four measures are to be simultaneously supported by the continuous improving of the capabilities and capacities of infrastructure available for Continuing Education and Training or CET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419900">CSC, 1998</xref>: 81). It is on the recommendations of the CSC that likely resulted in the setting up of a new statutory board in 2003 to implement those recommendations. This is the Work Development Agency (WDA).</p>
<p>The WDA has both short and long term objectives. In the case of the former, the role of the WDA was to ‘support and help in the re-employment of unemployed or retrenched workers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0896920511419900">The Straits Times, 1 July 2003</xref>). The situation in 2003 saw unemployment and retrenchment levels rising, owing to the effects of the economic crisis in 2001. However, the long term role is to primarily ‘focus on adult continuing education and training’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0896920511419900">The Straits Times, 1 July 2003</xref>) and to ‘[help] those with jobs stay employable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511419900">Channel NewsAsia, 15 August 2003</xref>). Given that the direction of the Singapore economy is being actively directed to an increasingly service and high-tech manufacturing based one, structural unemployment will inevitably result. The WDA is consequently to ensure that Singaporeans are re-trained to meet those changes. The primary rationale for its existence is to ‘ensur[e] the <italic>employability</italic> and <italic>competitiveness</italic> of the nearly 95 percent of Singaporeans who are gainfully employed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511419900">Channel NewsAsia, 12 September 2003</xref>, emphasis added). This is reflected in its stated vision – ‘[a] Competitive Workforce, with workers Learning for Life, and Advancing with Skills’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0896920511419900">WDA Website, 2010a</xref>) - and its mission – ‘[t]o enhance the employability and competitiveness of our workforce’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0896920511419900">WDA Website, 2010a</xref>). The Continuing Education and Training (CET) Masterplan forms the main thrust of the state’s upgrading strategy and the rationale for it is as given below:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In today’s economy, knowledge and skills can become obsolete so quickly that ongoing professional development or continual learning is <italic>the key to surviving and thriving in the present and the future global workplace</italic>. It is against this backdrop that the Continuing Education and Training (CET) Masterplan was developed. WDA works together with employers to help workers make the right choices on their learning journey. The programmes form a lifelong learning system that <italic>enable workers to stay relevant, find their niche and seize opportunities in new growth sectors</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0896920511419900">WDA Website, 2010b</xref>, emphasis added).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The individualisation of success (and conversely, failure) in terms of finding and securing employment is clearly implied in the above statement and conveys the following: “the state i.e. government is here to help you if you want to help yourself. Beyond that, the government is not to be blamed should you fail to find employment. The onus is on you to make yourself as attractive to the employer as you can, and a way to do this is through upgrading yourself”. That the upgrading discourse has come to gain currency is seen in the following example. In 2004, a year after the WDA was established, the then Secretary-General of the state-controlled union, the National Trade Union Congress (NTUC) (who is also a Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office) stressed that ‘[w]orkers will also increasingly need to take the initiative for their own upgrading’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0896920511419900">Lee, 2004</xref>). Together with the then-president of the NTUC, there was an urging of ‘employees to gain new skills and move up the technology ladder’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0896920511419900">Lee, 2004</xref>). Failure to do so will render them vulnerable to becoming replaced by low-wage workers in the emerging economies of China and India. To this end, it mooted and advocated the idea of a learning account, the purpose being ‘to create accounts which workers can then use to pay for training courses which their employers do not fund’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0896920511419900">Lee, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The theme of self-reliance is strongly evident in the above examples, especially when one considers that the discourse of upgrading one’s skills conveys the notion that staying employable is no longer the responsibility of the state. Rather, it is a task that the individual is <italic>ultimately</italic> responsible for, even in times of recession and retrenchment; an individual’s employability is now in his or her own hands. If said individual fails to secure a new job, the condemnation falls on him or her for not doing enough to help him or herself, even if the lack of employment opportunities is due to systemic and structural reasons. The inherent systemic problems of the capitalist mode of production – periodic economic crises leading to mass retrenchments and unemployment - become greatly depoliticised and obscured, its consequences reduced to failures on the part of the individual and something that he or she needs to be <italic>wholly</italic> responsible for overcoming. The WDA hence functions as a tool to depoliticise the issue of unemployment, through individualising the issue of structural unemployment. It exonerates the PAP of the responsibility for providing employment or for periods of retrenchment, and diverts attention away from the inherent structural problems of the capitalist system.</p>
<p>Aside from depoliticising the issues of unemployment and retrenchment, the WDA also functions as a neoliberal technology working to manage, govern and shape the Singaporean workforce into a particular type of subject. As the examples above demonstrate, should an individual finds him or herself in a situation of unemployment or becoming retrenched, the WDA conveys the idea that said individual needs to make him or her as attractive and appealing as possible to potential employers – the so-called “branding” of oneself. The engagement of self-commodification and self-promotion on the part of the individual are part of being a neoliberal subject – highly competitive, self-reliant and living according to market principles as a guide for everyday living. Such a move reflects a broader trend in many countries as to how social policy has come to be ‘designed and shaped so as to enhance inclusion within the market rather than being preoccupied with the earlier emphasis on notions such as the redistribution of income’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0896920511419900">Jayasuriya, 2006</xref>: 235). Unemployment and in particular, retrenchment, are constantly portrayed as obstacles to be overcome with training and upgrading, as an “opportunity” to “reinvent” oneself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0896920511419900">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The upgrading discourse therefore conveys the idea that the objective is a society where the opportunity for participation in the market economy is to be made as equal as possible, underscoring the very existence of the neoliberal political rationality. The setting up of the WDA officially moved the discourse of upgrading from merely being an appendage of an economic strategy (upgrading skills of worker to be more suited to a new type of economy), to an economic (and political) strategy in itself – that of creating neoliberal subjects who can engage in self-care and self-regulation. The idea is that should a structural change in the economy come about in the future, there is no need to exhort for workers to “upgrade” or “reinvent” themselves. As neoliberal subjects, they will take it upon themselves to do so. The upgrading discourse allows for the state to relinquish its role in the provision of public service with the minimal of political consequences.</p>
<p>From the example of the upgrading discourse as a neoliberal technology of subjectivity, the gradual transformation of the type and degree of involvement that the Singapore developmental state has vis-à-vis the governance of Singapore society is being witnessed here. Rather than the state pulling back, it is instead a refashioning, expansion and/or altering its institutions in order to create a certain type of individual i.e. the neoliberal subject through the deployment of technologies that have their underpinnings in the neoliberal political rationality. What is taking place in effect is an expansion in the creation of institutions aimed towards ‘introducing a political regime of governance and control into new areas of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920511419900">Konings, 2010</xref>: 745). The WDA is but one example of this hallmark of the neoliberal-developmental state.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Neoliberalism has brought about fundamental changes in the structures and institutions of states and societies the world over as a consequence of the implementation of its economic tenets. In the aftermath of the 2008 Financial Crisis, calls for the reining in of the neoliberal economic model in favour of a more regulated and “responsible” model of capitalism were made by newspapers and political leaders among others the world over, especially in countries most affected by it. Cries for the return of the state to take a more active role in the economic and social spheres abound, contrary to the prescriptions of neoliberal economic theory. In this regard, understanding the neoliberal-developmental state and its workings is crucial to understanding one of the ways in which the logic of capitalism manifests itself physically today. The state (and not just the neoliberal-developmental variant) plays an active albeit less visible role in neoliberalism, which is the transformation of the populace into neoliberal subjects by means of a neoliberal governmentality.</p>
<p>The novelty about such a type of state is the exercising of a governmentality based on the neoliberal political rationality in the governing and regulation of society and its members. Relying less on ideology than on the use of neoliberal technologies, individuals within Singapore society are induced take it upon themselves to self-regulate, behaving and thinking in accordance to the neoliberal ethos. Althusser writes that ideology ‘represents the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511419900">2008</xref>: 36). In contrast, the operation of governmentality presents the relationship of the individuals to their conditions of existence as one that is regarded to be “objective reality”. Such an “objective reality” is borne out of their constant involvement in the maintenance of their sense and understanding of the self. For ideology the illusion can be removed with the lifting of the mask to reveal the actual face beneath. Conversely in the case of governmentality, there is no mask to lift; what the individual hold on to <italic>is</italic> a “truth” as he or she has come to know it. This “truth” is imposed on the individual in everyday life by the same power that creates the neoliberal subject i.e. neoliberal technologies of power and the self. This is how the neoliberal political rationality demonstrates its resilience. Through the exercise of governmentality, it has brought about changes in the way that individuals and groups think, act, and rationalise. It is far easier to alter the structure of the economy than it is to undo and/or alter the deeply ingrained sense of the self of the individual in relation to his/her “truth” and the governing rationale of the state. Thus, even with the waning of neoliberal economic theory, the neoliberal political rationality continues to be exerted through its technologies. Therefore, any efforts at opposing neoliberalism and the outcomes of its consequences must seriously consider this point.</p>
<p>In Singapore, operationalising the neoliberal political rationality has been highly beneficial to the economic interests of the PAP-dominated state and Capitalism, as the accumulation of capital is rendered more efficient under such a regime. Whether is it strategically implementing neoliberal economic tenets or the utilisation of neoliberal technologies – represented in here by the Work Pass system and the discourse of upgrading – they are essentially driven by the capitalist logic to aid in the accumulation process. The upgrading discourse in particular focuses on moulding individuals into “entrepreneurs” of the self. By propagating the idea that responsibility of one’s own well-being lies <italic>solely</italic> in the hands of the individual, this technology works to change the way in which the Singapore state is involved in the shaping of society. Emphasis is placed overwhelmingly on responsibility of the self to the exclusion of the roles of social structures and the structure of the economy in determining the outcome of one’s existence. The notion of “self-reliance” is used as a euphemism for justifying and legitimising the reduction of the state’s role in the provision of public services. More importantly, a larger segment of the populace are receptive to such exhortations, owing to the legacy of the effectiveness of the ideology of pragmatism at first and subsequently through the neoliberal technologies that shape them (in various degrees) into becoming neoliberal subjects through enabling policies like the discourse of upgrading and re-training. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511419900">Brown (2005</xref>: 43) states, the ‘neoliberal citizen is calculating, rather than rule abiding, a Benthamite rather than a Hobbesian.’ I add that it is a matter of degrees, rather than being an absolute either-or situation with the Singaporean becoming more Benthamite and less Hobbesian. This is part of a wider trend unfolding in many advanced capitalist countries, and is the reason why the analysis here can be relevantly applied to far bigger states and societies. The driving logic of the neoliberal political rationality remains the same, with the ultimate goal focused upon the more efficient process of capital accumulation.</p>
<p>Consequently, to challenge the Singapore neoliberal-developmental state is to confront the neoliberal political rationality and ultimately, capitalism. Doing otherwise ignores the very real threat that such a political rationality poses for bringing about genuine social change. One should also question though as to what this really means. For this to take place in Singapore political liberalisation is a first step but it cannot end there. While such a move is important, things will eventually revert back to status quo unless change is accompanied by a shift away from the neoliberal political rationality through a reorganisation of the economy and re-examining the purposes of existing and future economic and social policies. This entails putting forth and promoting an alternative discourse as the underpinnings of a political rationality based on the notions of cooperation and a more equitable distribution of resources and wealth across Singapore society. Otherwise, the existence of more opposition voices alongside the PAP in parliament will merely be serving the same food in a different dish. What is truly needed may be a change of diet.</p>

<p>The arguments against the minimum wage ranges from the assumption that having it only slows and/or scares away foreign investment from Singapore thereby causing retardation in the growth of the economy to a minimum wage raising the costs of everything, to causing companies to be lose their competitiveness. Former Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew’s argument against the minimum wage is typical: ‘[a minimum wage] to narrow the income gap could do more harm than good’ and that ‘every country that has set a minimum wage over what the market will bear has found that the move cuts jobs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511419900">Au Yong, 2009</xref>).

The following statement by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) also reiterates that rhetoric: ‘Whether wages [for workers] should increase or decrease is <italic>best determined by market demand and supply</italic> for labour, skills, capabilities and competency to perform the task’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511419900">Hooi, 2004</xref>, emphasis added).</p>
<p>While it is beyond the paper to present the case for a minimum wage here, it is highly debatable that a minimum wage <italic>necessarily</italic> leads to the dismal scenario that Lee Kuan Yew paints above. The allusions to a neutral arbiter in the market is highly flawed as the fact that employers have the power to decide on the wages since workers experience much personal costs when unemployed is unacknowledged. This power is exercised when the employers pay employees what the latter would otherwise earn in a truly competitive market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511419900">Chapman, 2004</xref>). In fact, ‘there is no demonstrated statistical relationship between high wages and lower employment…[as] employment levels are not determined, primarily in the labour market’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0896920511419900">Stanford, 2008</xref>: 156). Rather, the existence of a minimum wage increase (or in Singapore’s case, actually <italic>having</italic> a minimum wage) will ‘correct a market imbalance by forcing employers to pay a fair wage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511419900">Chapman, 2004</xref>). See also <italic>Institutional Economics and the Minimum Wage: Broadening the Theoretical and Policy Debate</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511419900">Kaufman, 2010</xref>) for an updated analysis on the minimum wage debate.</p></fn>

<p>The argument by the PAP is that there is a need to pay an astronomical salary pegged at “market rates” i.e. what the individual would otherwise be getting in the private sector had he or she be in a similar type of position. The rationale is so that “top” talent will be attracted to serve in the public sector. It is never asked if these individuals been in the private sector, would they have been able to rise to the equivalent of the public sector positions that they are holding in the first place.</p></fn>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511419900">Mitchell (1991)</xref> also discusses the notion of the state but as a structural effect. He uses the example of the reorganising of the army in the eighteenth century; one could observe the ‘effect produced by the organised partitioning of space, the regular distribution of bodies, exact timing, the coordination of movement, the combining of elements, and endless repetition, all of which are particular practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511419900">Mitchell 1991</xref>: 93-4). However, it is in the ‘order and precision of such processes [that] created the effect of an apparatus apart from the men themselves, whose structure orders, contains, and controls them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511419900">Mitchell 1991</xref>: 94). It is this that needs to be taken note of vis-à-vis the state, as it is to be analysed ‘as the powerful, metaphysical effect of practises that make such structures appear to exist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511419900">Mitchell 1991</xref>: 94). Such an arrangement allows for one to ‘both acknowledge the power of the political arrangements that we call the state and at the same time account for their elusiveness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511419900">Mitchell 1991</xref>: 94-5). There is a distinct parallel of Mitchell’s to Lemke’s (and hence Foucault’s) approach – the power of political arrangements can arguably be the sort of power relations and strategies that the latter discusses (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511419900">Mitchell, 1991</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>It is useful to note that the advent of the internet and the concomitant widespread usage of new media technologies such as blogs and podcasting mean that the use of outright state coercion can no longer be carried out (as it was done during the so-called Marxist Conspiracy) without its actions becoming widely known globally. Suppression or restricting the internet would also not be possible since a key aspect of its economic strategy involves making use of IT ‘as a business enabler’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419900">CSC, 1998</xref>: 103), with e-commerce as a major component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419900">CSC, 1998</xref>: 104). Consequently, its aspirations at becoming a global city and attracting the global elite to move to Singapore among other goals mean that state coercion must now be exercised with the knowledge that its actions will have greater repercussions than previously. Again, this does <italic>not</italic> mean that the state will back away from the use of coercion, only that they might be more subtle and circumspect as to how they go about doing it.</p></fn>

<p>It is possible that the basis of such a policy has its foundations in eugenics. It is well known that Lee Kuan Yew believed in eugenics. Thus, high IQ levels to him are unevenly distributed across the different “races” of Chinese, Malay, Indian and “Others”. In one instance, he compares the mathematical ability of the Chinese and the Malay as inherent and different between each “race”:</p>
<p>‘“The first thing is we bring the problems out into the open,” [Lee Kuan Yew] replied. “If you pretend that the problem doesn’t exist, and that in fact [the Malays] can score as well as the Chinese in mathematics, then you have created yourself an enormous myth which you will be stuck with. And there will be such great disillusionment”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0896920511419900">Richardson, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The above statement was made in the context that of him saying that there are ‘differences in learning aptitude between blacks, whites and other races in America’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0896920511419900">Richardson, 1992</xref>), and the situation of the blacks in the United States parallel that of the Malays in Singapore.</p>
<p>Lee also believes that high IQ is more predominant amongst those in the upper class, as seen for instance, in the attempt to introduce the Graduate Mothers’ Scheme in 1983. This extremely unpopular scheme has a eugenics basis. Its purpose was to encourage university graduates who presumably had higher Intelligence Quotient (IQ) levels to produce babies through a whole host of incentives, thereby improving the gene pool of the population. Although ultimately abandoned, the scheme made prominent the use of biopower to govern the population. It emphasises that the PAP had consistently intervened in the lives of Singaporeans, and continues to do so even until the present day. As Lee himself states,</p>
<p>‘And I say without the slightest remorse, that we wouldn’t be here, we would not have made economic progress, if we had not intervened on very personal matters - who your neighbour is, how you live, the noise you make, how you spit, or what language you use. We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920511419900">Katigbak, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of the above, it is not unreasonable to extend the same line of thinking within the PAP-dominated government to the management of the types of migrant workers coming in.</p></fn>

<p>The other major technology of subjectivity that the PAP utilises is known as the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme or Workfare. Introduced in 2007, Workfare is a cash payment to old and low-wage Singaporean workers i.e. earning less than SGD 1500 a month. Other criteria applies as well, including length of time worked (at least 3 months out of a 6-month period), living on a property that has an Annual Value of less than SGD 11,000 and be at least 35 years old and above. In 2010, the scheme was revised with the increasing of the limit to SGD 1,700 instead. In addition, there is the introduction of a Workfare Training Support Scheme, which combines labour upgrading with the workfare scheme. Consequently, receiving aid from the state is conditional upon being part of the labour force. The implication here suggests that only those who are working merits any form of help. Rather than citizenship, the basis of aid is contingent upon their economic participation that will deem them as worthy of aid. Workfare thus puts across and emphasises the notion that by and large, the individual is to be responsible for his or her own welfare, even if that individual in question is an elderly. Assistance from the state cannot be counted upon – one needs to work for the aid.</p></fn>

<p>For instance, in the National Day Rally Speech of 2009, the Prime Minister (PM) Lee cited the example of a Mr Mohd Amin:</p>
<p>‘After the retrenchment, I feared I can’t find another job because of my age… The career centre coached me to learn a skill and start a new career path. I felt supported… ‘I attended the job placement event and I successfully found a job as an Enforcement Specialist. The training allowed me to do my job confidently. ‘I’m doing well. I am so happy now as I am earning more than before’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511419900">Lee, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>PM Lee then stressed this point made by Mohd Amin: ‘I will ask my friends to go to career centre for support and help. Tell them to be flexible and not choosy.’ The message that the PM is trying to convey vis-à-vis the issue of retrenchment cannot be clearer.</p></fn>
