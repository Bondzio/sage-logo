<p>James Bennett has written on a variety of media topics from digital media to intellectual property, with a strong focus on television and performance. A growing number of scholars are examining fame and celebrity, and this treatment fits into a continuum of perspectives from celebrity-as-demotic to celebrity-as-aristocratic, with a particular focus on what the author sees as the underexplored area of TV celebrity (which he places at the demotic end of the spectrum).</p>
<p>Bennett is chair of Media, Information and Communications at London Metropolitan University and an editor at the new <italic>Celebrity Studies Journal</italic> published by Routledge. In framing this study, Bennett draws on the work of other television studies scholars, largely those who have turned their attention to reality TV. In terms of like work on television fame, Bennett liberally references both Joshua Gamson (<italic>Claims to Fame: Celebrity in Contemporary America</italic>; University of California Press, 1994) and Graeme Turner (<italic>Understanding Celebrity</italic>; Sage, 2004), though <italic>Television Personalities</italic> doggedly maintains its focus on the specific “personality” aspect of TV celebrity.</p>
<p>The author defines TV personalities as those <italic>who play themselves</italic> as distinct from television <italic>actors</italic>. Think Arthur Godfrey, Oprah Winfrey, Benny Hill, and the scores of personalities populating the world of reality TV. Where many observers have commented that TV personalities are “agreeable voids,” famous for being famous without having to work hard or exercise any skill, Bennett argues that “televisual skill” is an undervalued aspect of this hybrid form of celebrity that requires both labor and achievement. By Bennett’s characterization, the most salient feature of TV personalities is their function of <italic>familiarity</italic>. They seem to be like us, unlike movie stars who are remote, idealized versions. The everydayness and ordinariness of these TV personalities is what we like about them and connect to, and rather than positioning these qualities as a deficiency, Bennett stresses this authenticity and intimacy as the site of their cultural importance.</p>
<p>The book progresses chronologically and is divided into three parts. In part 1, Bennett addresses televisual fame in the 1950s, including performers’ transition from Vaudeville to radio to television. One interesting note is the perceived risk by many performers, given that their mugs would be on screen for a potentially very large audience to see rather than a mere theaterful or effectively blind radio audience. In part 2, he speaks to the political economy of the 1980s and 1990s and the development of the TV personality system in mass broadcasting. Along the way, he touches on femininity, glamour, and visual spectacle, and how time slots and schedule (i.e., flow) and distribution and production affect the perception and reception of TV personalities.</p>
<p>Part 3 tackles the lifestyle TV regime, DIY fame, and the impact of digital media. This includes the entrepreneurial position of TV personalities in the commercial economics of the medium (e.g., Simon Cowell’s “nasty judge” image on the U.K. <italic>Pop Idol</italic> was exported to the U.S. <italic>American Idol</italic>, and also allowed Cowell to create and profit from similar formats in other shows, globally) and in the political economy of public service broadcasting (i.e. ongoing debates about presenter pay and televisual skill required by personalities appearing as “themselves”). This latter relates to the underlying question about TV personalities who present as their real selves about whom one might ask, “What is their <italic>work</italic>? What is the value of their fame?” In his attempt to position this work as skilled performance and as valuable, Bennett argues that they provide pleasure and social meaning.</p>
<p>Throughout, Bennett dips into notions and theories of the self, both the personalities on TV as well <italic>our</italic> selves, the viewers. Part of the dynamic of the TV experience is negotiating the perception of the “real” selves of those on screen, as well as locating our own true selves and the splits that we embody in our own off-screen lives. He cites plenty of scholarship on TV’s role in the development of self, most of which paints reality and lifestyle TV as a modernized, democratized interpretation of public service. TV personalities’ ordinariness is a crucial element of such a perspective. The work involved in performing the self has received little analytical attention because TV personalities are not actors in the same way that film actors are. Different kinds of pleasure are provided by TV personalities’ performance and film stars’ acting, and Bennett believes they should be treated and appreciated separately.</p>
<p>Jade Goody, a controversial former U.K. <italic>Big Brother</italic> contestant, is offered by Bennett as a totem who presents “no distinction or dialectic between on- and off-screen self,” and who represents what many people see as a devaluation of celebrity. TV is now overrun with manufactured celebrities calling to mind Daniel Boorstin’s “pseudoevents.” But as a foil, he holds up Nigella Lawson, the cooking show host who embodies the combination of televisual and vocational skill. Lawson is a captivating personality, an effective performer and communicator, as well as a skilled home cook who imparts legitimately useful information. She is also an example of the pairing of spectacle/glamour and intimacy that is unique to the TV personality concept.</p>
<p>Cooking programs are a ripe venue for observing the interplay between information/ education and performance, and Bennett spends a significant amount of space on this format. He describes the production specifics of the Jamie Oliver–hosted <italic>Naked Chef</italic> and <italic>Jamie at Home</italic>—the specific, casual language and energetic movements of the host; the handheld camera and close-ups; the confirmation of his culinary authority; the overriding fun attitude of the program toward the subject. Bennett cites Oliver as an example where pleasure results from learning a recipe and a “lifestyle project” even though performance is given more authority and emphasis than education. Bennett sidesteps the role of pleasure in the psychology of viewing, but he acknowledges this absence in his conclusion, acknowledging that further research is needed with regard to the meanings and pleasures of television to audiences and fans.</p>
<p>Audience, at least with regard to user-generated content, is implicit in his final chapters, however, where Bennett turns to DIY celebrity, most markedly played out on talent search programs such as the British <italic>Popstar to Operastar</italic> and in digital media with programs such as <italic>DiggNation</italic> (a video podcast based on the social bookmarking website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://digg.com">digg.com</ext-link>). The particular celebrity of Kevin Rose, the cofounder of digg.com and “poster boy of web2.0 and Internet entrepreneur,” may fit into a subdivision of traditional TV celebrity, but given the attention paid him by traditional media outlets, it is an indication of the potential of new media to play a powerful role in the continuum and continuation of video celebrity.</p>
<p>This work dovetails with both performance studies and television studies, but the particulars of television fame have not been studied to this depth in other book-length works. Bennett has started a conversation that will prove increasingly important and complex as television culture moves through both the dramatic and evolutionary changes currently in progress.</p>
