<abstract>
<p>With clinical oral examinations not always possible in health surveys, researchers may instead be invited to add questions to a wider health survey. In such situations, an item is needed which adequately represents both clinical and self-reported oral health. This study investigated the clinical validity of Locker’s global self-reported oral health item among young middle-aged adults in populations in New Zealand and Australia. Clinical examination and self-report data (including the OHIP-14) were obtained from recent national dental surveys in NZ and Australia, and from age-38 assessments in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study. National dataset analyses involved 35- to 44-year-olds. Caries and tooth-loss experience showed mostly consistent, statistically significant gradients across the Locker item responses; those responding ‘Excellent’ had the lowest scores, and those responding ‘Poor’ the highest. Periodontitis experience gradients in the NZ national sample were mainly as hypothesized; those rating their oral health as ‘Poor’ had the highest disease experience. OHIP-14 gradients across the Locker item responses were consistent and as hypothesized. The proportion of disease in the population borne by those ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’ ranged from 26% to 72%. These findings provide preliminary support for the measure’s validity as a global self-reported oral health measure in young middle-aged adults.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since Locker’s influential adaptation of the World Health Organization’s model of the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps to oral health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512460676">Locker, 1988</xref>), the development and validation of multi-item scales for measuring “oral-health-related quality of life” (OHRQoL) have continued apace. A crucial step in that development has been the examination of scales’ criterion validity, whereby scores are compared against an accepted equivalent measure, such as a single-item (global) self-rating which serves as a summary measure for the same construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512460676">Guyatt <italic>et al</italic>., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512460676">Locker <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), but validating the latter (in turn) is problematic, because there is no equivalent measure. Single-item measures can be useful in their own right, however, because they integrate subjective perceptions and objective observations into a unified summary measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512460676">Kaplan and Baron-Epel, 2003</xref>), with the relative contributions of those aspects differing among individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512460676">Locker <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). For some, the presence/absence of disease (and functional capability) is more important; subjective perceptions or illness-associated behaviors take precedence for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512460676">Kaplan and Baron-Epel, 2003</xref>). Regardless, the dominant assumption behind global measures is their salience for both participants and researchers. They have the advantage that interpreting scores is far simpler than for multi-item scales. Although it is unclear from the literature who may have coined the term “global oral health rating”, global measures became inextricably associated with Locker and his work. One such is that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512460676">Locker (2001)</xref>: “How would you describe the health of your teeth or mouth?”; it uses the ordinal response options ‘Excellent’, ‘Very good’, ‘Good’, ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’. It has been used both as an outcome measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512460676">Locker and Jokovic, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512460676">Dolan <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>) and to validate multi-item scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512460676">Locker <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Clinical oral examinations are not always possible in health surveys; oral health researchers may be invited to add a few oral health questions to a wider health survey. In such situations, a validated single item would be very useful. Such single-item scales should be tested for validity by, among other things, comparison with disease measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512460676">Fayers and Machin, 2000</xref>). A logical assumption of an enquiry about someone’s oral health is that the response is systematically related to actual clinical status, so that those who rate their oral health as ‘excellent’ should have better oral health than those rating theirs as ‘poor’. Implicit in that process is the assumption that the question is valid: the scale is measuring what we think it is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512460676">Streiner and Norman, 1995</xref>). To date, the Locker item’s association with clinical status has not been systematically investigated.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical validity of the Locker item among young middle-aged adults in representative samples from populations in New Zealand (NZ) and Australia. It was hypothesized that there would be distinct gradients, whereby those responding ‘Excellent’ had the lowest disease experience, and those responding ‘Poor’ the highest.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study conformed to STROBE guidelines. Data were obtained from recent national surveys in NZ and Australia, and from the age-38 assessments in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study. Each study used Locker’s global item (although the Australian survey used slightly different wording), undertook clinical oral examinations, and used the short-form Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512460676">Slade, 1997</xref>) to measure OHRQoL. Analyses of the national datasets in this report were restricted to the 35- to 44-year-old age group because it is one of the key pathfinder age groups recommended by the WHO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512460676">World Health Organization, 1997</xref>), yet it has been little studied. However, we present data on the other adult age groups in the Appendix.</p>
<sec id="section3-0022034512460676">
<title>The 2009 NZ National Oral Health Survey (NZOHS)</title>
<p>We collected self-reported and clinical examination data from 2,209 adults, 2,048 of whom received periodontal examinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512460676">Ministry of Health, 2010</xref>). The NZ Health and Disability Multi-Region Ethics Committee gave ethics approval. The survey used the re-contact database from the 2006 New Zealand Health Survey, which used a multi-stage, stratified, probability-proportional-to-size sample design, with greater sampling of some ethnic groups. [Detailed information on the methodology is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexmh/ohs-methodology-report-2009">http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexmh/ohs-methodology-report-2009</ext-link>.]</p>
<p>Dental examinations were undertaken in dental clinics throughout the country. A lead examiner, a gold standard examiner, and 21 examining dentists were used, and each attended a two-and-a-half-day training and calibration course run by the head examiner. Examinations recorded data on dentition status, surface-level dental caries experience, and periodontal attachment loss (at 6 sites <italic>per</italic> tooth for all teeth except the third molars). Analyses were undertaken in Stata, with weighting (using the svyset command) used to ensure that the estimates reflected the source population. Data are reported here for the 578 35- to 44-year-olds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022034512460676">
<title>The Australian National Survey of Adult Oral Health 2004-06</title>
<p>This used a three-stage stratified clustered sampling design. The sampling frame was households listed in an electronic national telephone database. The first stage selected postcodes stratified into metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. The second stage selected households within sampled postcodes, and the third stage selected one person aged 15 yrs or older from each sampled household. The sample estimates have been shown to be valid estimates for the target population of Australian adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512460676">Mejia <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Dentate participants who completed the computer-assisted telephone interview were invited to undergo a standardized oral examination. Those who did were subsequently sent a self-administered questionnaire. The global self-report oral health item used was “How would you rate your own dental health?”, with the same response options as the Locker item.</p>
<p>The 30 examining dentists were calibrated to record tooth loss, dental decay experience, and periodontal status. Each dental surface was assessed and categorized by visual criteria only. The periodontal assessment used a probe with 2mm markings for all measurements. Examiner reliability was acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512460676">Slade <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Analyses used SUDAAN to allow for the clustered sampling design and to yield unbiased standard error estimates and design effects. Data are reported here for the 1,030 35- to 44-year-olds.</p>

<sec id="section5-0022034512460676">
<title>The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (DMHDS)</title>
<p>This is a longitudinal study of a birth cohort born in Dunedin (New Zealand) between 1 April 1972 and 31 March 1973 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512460676">Silva and Stanton, 1996</xref>). The sample that formed the basis for the longitudinal study was 1,037 children assessed within a month of their third birthdays. Periodic collections of health and developmental data have since been undertaken. This study uses data collected from the age-38 assessment, the most recent one. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Otago Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>Examinations for dental caries (collected as tooth surface-level data according to WHO criteria), periodontal status, and missing teeth were conducted by three calibrated dental examiners. They determined accumulated tooth loss due to caries by observing the presence or absence of each tooth, and ascertaining the reason for any absence. Periodontal measurements were made in all 4 quadrants. Three sites (mesiobuccal, buccal, and distolingual) <italic>per</italic> tooth were examined for probing depth and gingival recession, recorded with the use of a Hu-Friedy PCP-2 probe. Clinical attachment loss (CAL) for each site was calculated by summing GR and PD. Mid-buccal measurements for molars were made at the midpoint of the mesial root. All measurements were rounded down to the nearest whole millimeter at the time of recording. Weighting was not used for the DMHDS, because it is a complete birth cohort rather than a population sample. Accordingly, confidence intervals are not presented for the data from that study. Data are reported here for 858 individuals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034512460676">
<title>Overview of Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>In each dataset, Locker’s global item was used as the independent variable, and gradients in clinical disease and OHRQoL were examined for consistency and for statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05). Differences were tested for statistical significance by ANOVA or appropriate non-parametric tests for continuous variables, and by Chi-squared tests for categorical variables.</p>
<p>For each of the OHIP-14 items, participants were asked how often they had experienced the problem in the preceding 4 wks. Responses were coded as ‘very often’ (scoring 4), ‘fairly often’ (scoring 3), ‘occasionally’ (scoring 2), ‘hardly ever’ (scoring 1), or ‘never’ (scoring 0). The prevalence of one or more OHIP-14 impacts was computed by identification of those who responded ‘very often’ or ‘fairly often’ for at least one of the 14 items.</p>
<p>For determination of the amount of variance explained by the Locker item responses, each of the continuous and count variables was used as the dependent variable in a linear regression model, and the R<sup>2</sup> value was noted.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Responses to the Locker item were broadly similar in the two national populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512460676">Table 1</xref>), but with slightly more Australians reporting their oral health as ‘Excellent’. A higher proportion of the Dunedin cohort reported their oral health as ‘Poor’.</p>

<p>Examination of the amount of variance in each of the continuous measures which was explained by the Locker variable showed that it was highest (at 28.8%) in the Australian sample for the OHIP-14 (and lowest in the Dunedin cohort for coronal FT, being 0.1%).</p>
<p>The attributable fraction was computed for the prevalence estimates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022034512460676">Table 4</xref>). Although there was some variation among the three populations, just over half the disease (for the clinical and self-report variables) was borne by those reporting ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’ oral health. There were some population differences, with the attributable fraction for those responding ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’ in the Dunedin cohort representing at least 60% of those affected. In the national samples, it was highest for root DS and lowest for missing teeth.</p>

<p>Scrutiny of the clinical disease and OHIP-14 gradients across the Locker items in the other age groups in the New Zealand and Australian national samples (Appendix) revealed that the gradients in clinical disease experience in the 18- to 24- and 25- to 34-year-old age groups were not as consistent as in the older age groups; those responding “Poor’ had the most, although that was not always the case. Gradients in the older age groups were more consistent.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the clinical and self-report validity of Locker’s single-item oral health measure among adults in NZ and Australia. There were marked and consistent gradients (with minor exceptions) in clinical disease and self-reported oral health across the item’s 5 ordinal categories, notwithstanding a subtle difference between the NZ and Australian studies in its wording. The proportion of disease in the population borne by those ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’ ranged from 26% to 72%, depending on the condition and population. These findings offer some support for the measure’s validity as a global self-report measure of oral status for use with the 35- to 44-year-old age group. It is less useful with younger adults, most likely because they have less oral disease.</p>
<p>Analysis of the attributable fraction data indicates that just over half the disease in the populations studied was borne by those reporting ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’ oral health. That this was consistently higher among the Dunedin cohort is to be expected, given that its participation rate was considerably higher than those for the 2 national samples, and so it is more likely to have captured more of those with the poorest oral health. For all three samples, the attributable fraction was higher than the proportion reporting ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’ oral health (39.2%, 27.4%, and 17.9% in the Dunedin, NZ, and Australian samples, respectively); the scale of that difference (between the “observed” and “expected” proportions) varied by both sample and condition, being lowest for missing teeth in all three samples, and highest for root DS prevalence in the Australian sample (at 3 times as high). That difference is a key issue: If it is relatively small (such as for missing teeth), researchers would be better advised to ask directly about that condition; if it is relatively large, the Locker measure would be more useful because of its ability to identify those with poor health in a range of oral conditions.</p>
<p>An important finding was that, rather than being limited to a single domain (such as caries), gradients across the Locker item responses were observable with caries, tooth loss, and periodontitis, and they were consistent with scores on a more sophisticated self-report measure, the OHIP-14. This suggests that the Locker item did indeed provide an adequate summary of how people view their oral health (at least among those older than 34 yrs), and that it unified their subjective perceptions and objective observations in a coherent way which is consistent with contemporary models and understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512460676">Wilson and Cleary, 1995</xref>). Locker himself emphasized the separate realities of health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512460676">Locker and Miller, 1994</xref>), and stressed that we should not base our understanding of the validity of oral health measures on their association with clinical indicators; rather, they should be compared with other subjective indicators. The important contribution made by this study is that we have found the measure in question to be valid in both respects; thus, Locker’s assertion about the separateness of the subjective and clinical realities requires some modification.</p>
<p>Self-reported data are important in oral health research, which will continue to rely on such data, particularly in situations where researchers are able to opportunistically “piggy-back” on surveys of general health. This study’s findings are a first step in determining the Locker item’s clinical validity for adults in their 30s and 40s (and older). Further work needs to determine its reliability, sensitivity, and responsiveness.</p>
