<abstract>
<p>“Micaela” is the first <italic>telenovela</italic> protagonist with Asperger’s Syndrome. This article reports a multimethod study of her production, representation, and consumption. My examination underscores (a) the tensions of creating/consuming a protagonist intended to deliver a message of nonexclusion, who is bound by the <italic>telenovela</italic> genre’s codes and (b) the strains between television’s commercial and social responsibility facets. Written as a letter to the character, the article is intimate and reflexive in tone. It is a format that underscores the depth of my engagement with the study and the inside access I was privileged to have.</p>

<p>Micaela Gómez</p>
<p><italic>Telenovela La Mujer Perfecta</italic></p>
<p>Network Venevisión</p>
<p>Caracas</p>
<p>Venezuela</p>
<p>Dear Micaela:</p>
<p>I know it sounds strange, scandalous even, but I witnessed the moment you were conceived.</p>
<p>You were a sought-out and carefully planned daughter. And just as there are people who take iron and folic acid in preparation for a possible pregnancy, Leonardo Padrón, who is both your father and mother, nourished himself with all the information possible about autism and Asperger’s Syndrome before bringing you into the world. And so did I.</p>
<p>I don’t know if you remember me. We met some time ago in Studio 3 at network Venevisión in Caracas. My name is Carolina Acosta-Alzuru and I have been studying writer Leonardo Padrón’s <italic>telenovelas</italic> since 1999. As you know, he is a poet who has written some of the most successful Venezuelan <italic>telenovelas</italic> of the last 15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1532708612471305">IMDB, 2012</xref>). I have conducted five case studies focusing on Padrón’s <italic>telenovelas</italic>, which are perfect epicenters for my research interest of unraveling the links between media, culture, and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612471305">Acosta-Alzuru, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532708612471305">2003b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612471305">2003c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612471305">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612471305">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612471305">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612471305">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Padrón is comfortable with my presence near him. We have been communicating daily for over a decade. In each case study that I have tackled, he has given me increased access to his thought and writing processes. He discusses with me ideas, character and plot design. Padrón emails me both the working and finished versions of every <italic>telenovela</italic> episode he writes, and he has allowed me to observe his meetings with his writing team. He also shares with me his creative doubts, conversations with television executives, and reactions to audience metrics (ratings and shares) and the Venezuelan entertainment media. In short, although my research is focused on the telenovela genre, I have also been conducting an ethnographic study of a <italic>telenovela</italic> writer for over a decade. Such is the nature of my research on Padrón: prolonged and sustained engagement. Hence, when he was going to conceive you, Micaela, he allowed me to accompany him in his creative process as if I were his very shadow. He thought out loud in front of me and gave me the privilege that every qualitative researcher dreams about: to walk in the shoes of her object of study.</p>
<p>Padrón is also the key to my access to the rest of the edifice that every <italic>telenovela</italic> is. The executive producers who have worked with him have given me entry into the production site(s) and process. Hence, I have been able to conduct in-depth interviews and participant observation inside <italic>telenovela</italic> production. Such access is a responsibility that I don’t take lightly, one that elicits deep reflection, much space in my research journal, and strict adherence to research ethic. It is also a true privilege, since production is the least studied area in <italic>telenovela</italic> scholarship and a key locus in the study of media and culture.</p>
<p>You see, Micaela, I draw on the cultural studies insight that media and culture are inevitably connected: “culture is concerned with the production and the exchange of meanings—the ‘giving and taking of meaning’—between the members of a society or group” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532708612471305">Hall, 1997</xref>, p. 2). In consequence, I approach each <italic>telenovela</italic> from the multiple perspectives present in the “circuit of culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532708612471305">du Gay, Hall, MacKay, &amp; Negus, 1997</xref>), which I use as an organizing theoretical tool. In each case study, I mix textual and ethnographic methods that include textual analysis, news coverage and social media analyses, participant observation on the set and network offices, document and ratings analyses, and repeated in-depth interviews with the <italic>telenovelas</italic>’ writers, executive producers, actors, and audience members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532708612471305">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In January 2010, a line from Padrón in my Blackberry became your genesis: “Good morning, Carolina! What if the protagonist is autistic?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532708612471305">2</xref></sup> I was immediately excited with the cultural, educational, and research possibilities of such a lead character. Padrón and I began reading scientific material to learn about Asperger and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532708612471305">Aston, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612471305">Attwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612471305">Baron-Cohen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612471305">Bentley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612471305">Grandin &amp; Duffy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1532708612471305">Williams, 1996</xref>). We remembered a novel by Mark Haddon that we had read a couple of years back, <italic>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1532708612471305">2003</xref>), and we realized that the main character <italic>must</italic> have had Asperger’s, although no explanation is given in the story for why the boy narrator processed reality in such a peculiar way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532708612471305">3</xref></sup> We reread the novel with this new lens, and we began to stumble on the subject everywhere. We consumed books,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532708612471305">4</xref></sup> cinema,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532708612471305">5</xref></sup> and television.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532708612471305">6</xref></sup> And we learned the differences between “NT = Neurotypicals,” like us, and “Aspies,” like you (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1532708612471305">“Wrong Planet,” n.d</xref>.).</p>
<p>Previous scholarship focusing on media representations of autism and/or Asperger’s Syndrome gave me important lights, even though I did not immerse myself in the area of disability studies as I had hoped. There was no time, <italic>telenovela</italic> creation and production is always fast-paced. Research on news media representations of autism and Asperger’s provided a picture of news stories on these topics marked by limited factual information and stereotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1532708612471305">Jones, 2009</xref>), and a neglect of the perspective of articulate autistic persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1532708612471305">Robertson, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532708612471305">7</xref></sup> There is also some academic literature on cultural representations of autism in films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612471305">Baker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532708612471305">Murray, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1532708612471305">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1532708612471305">Schwartz, 2008</xref>), novels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532708612471305">Berger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532708612471305">Burks-Abbott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532708612471305">Murray, 2008b</xref>), and television series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532708612471305">Douwe, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532708612471305">8</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532708612471305">Murray (2008b)</xref> sums well this scholarship’s assessment of the representations they analyzed:
<disp-quote>
<p>[I]f we see more autism around us than at any time in history, and if we think of the consequences of knowing it to be a lifelong condition, then we can also admit that we have a greater opportunity for dialogue than has ever existed. Listening to those with autism has never been a more available option, and it is one that those who are in the business of making cultural representations of the condition need to take up. . . . There are still too many easy assumptions made, and casual stories told, about this condition. (p. 212)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Armed with a month of intense research and conversations with me about the dangers of repeating some of the problematic aspects of previous popular culture representations that emphasize a genius or freak dichotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532708612471305">Murray, 2008b</xref>), in February of 2010, Padrón interviewed Dr. Lilian Negrón of SOVENIA<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532708612471305">9</xref></sup> and spoke with several people with Asperger’s. They shared their DNA with you, and as such, they are part of your family and one of your most important buttresses, dear Micaela.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are asking yourself why there was so much research prior to your conception. After all, aren’t <italic>telenovelas</italic> always the same story? Haven’t there been hundreds of <italic>telenovela</italic> protagonists afflicted by some physical problem of which they are cured before the happy ending? Moreover, did famous Cuban writer Delia Fiallo spend months researching the different causes and consequences—behavioral and social—of blindness before writing her landmark <italic>telenovela Esmeralda</italic>?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1532708612471305">10</xref></sup> It does not seem so. Esmeralda’s blindness was not intended to generate knowledge or elicit reflection but was a dramatic way to accentuate the traditional <italic>telenovela</italic> female protagonist code. Also, <italic>Esmeralda</italic> was written at a time in which Venezuelan television rarely imported <italic>telenovelas</italic>; hence, domestic-produced dramas competed against each other, in equal conditions.</p>
<p>Your case and your <italic>telenovela</italic> were different, though. You needed to come into the world with as many reinforcements as possible in the form of research and acting talent because we knew that you would be born into a critical context. The Venezuelan <italic>telenovela</italic> industry had been sliding down a slope made slippery by the political context in a country whose government increasingly controls everything, especially media content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1532708612471305">Ramírez Alvarado, 2007</xref>) through the legal instrument known as the Law of Social Responsibility in Radio and Television (Ley Resorte; Venezuela, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1532708612471305">2010</xref>), a restrictive media content law. Venezuelan productions had lost ground not only on the international arena but also in the domestic market, where competing network Televen had managed to seize the first place spot by broadcasting expensive <italic>telenovelas</italic> produced by U.S.-based (and NBC-owned) Telemundo. These imported <italic>telenovelas</italic> enjoyed not only better budgets but were also produced without the straightjacket of the Venezuelan Ley Resorte. Padrón knew he had to write a story that would be able to get around the legal restrictions and make the best of a limited budget and the constraints of the government imposed exchange control. Above all, he had to craft a plot that would make Venezuelans reconnect with national productions. And you, Micaela, were the cornerstone of the <italic>telenovela</italic> he was creating.</p>
<p>You are the daughter of an author who writes realist <italic>telenovelas</italic>. And although these do not spurn the codes of the genre, they do sometimes transgress them to generate processes of identification and reflection in the audience. If Padrón was going to write a protagonist with Asperger’s Syndrome, he was going to do it in the most realistic way possible within the unavoidable corset imposed by the codes of the <italic>telenovela</italic> as a melodramatic genre.</p>
<p>The <italic>telenovela</italic> writing process is always rife with doubts. But with you, Micaela, Padrón’s qualms were of particular importance for the end product’s chances of success:
<disp-quote>
<p>I tend to write strong women. But this character has a fragile quality to it. Is it a good idea to write something so complex and counter to my natural writing style in such a complicated context as the one we have right now in Venezuelan television? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1532708612471305">Padrón, 2010a</xref>)</p>
<p>Throughout the 120 episodes, every time my protagonist processes an emotion, I will have to research how an Asperger does it. Also, I think that what happens to the character could become repetitive and lack visual versatility. Essentially, I sometimes feel that the syndrome my main character has, could become a burden for me, a weight on my shoulders. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1532708612471305">Padrón, 2010b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Your writer’s fears were valid, especially as he faced writing a long-winded 120-hour story at television’s industrial speed. But, the positive aspects of creating a protagonist with Asperger’s were also indisputable.</p>
<p>As you know well, Micaela, just as there are not two identical human beings, there are also not two Aspergers that are the same. There is immense variation in the degree of intensity of the characteristics that define the syndrome and in the way in which they manifest themselves. This made it possible for your genetic make-up to include both this disorder and the characteristics that would make you function as a <italic>telenovela</italic> protagonist. Being Asperger would allow you to be a character that is simultaneously tender, moving, and, on occasions, amusing. Padrón could give you a good dose of one of his strengths: poetry. And you would give him the opportunity to speak about the subject of exclusion in a country whose government has, ironically, made of that word a pretext for generating exclusions of all types. It was necessary, however, to be in a permanent state of alert in light of two risks: that you might ridicule or caricaturize people with Asperger’s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1532708612471305">11</xref></sup> and that the audience would not understand you as a character.</p>
<p>In April 2010, the biological clock counting down to your birth suddenly sped up. The premiere of <italic>telenovela Harina de otro costal</italic> was not well received by the audience. Eventually, <italic>Harina</italic> was cancelled and something unprecedented occurred in Venezuelan TV: 3 months without a single national <italic>telenovela</italic> on the air. This precipitated the construction and preproduction processes of the microcosm where you would live: <italic>telenovela La Mujer Perfecta</italic> [The Perfect Woman], which was the only Venezuelan <italic>telenovela</italic> produced in the remainder of 2010. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1532708612471305">Padrón (2010b)</xref>, then, finalized plot(s) and characters’ design:
<disp-quote>
<p>This is the story of six women who struggle to become what every man dreams of: the perfect woman. To achieve this, they will try surgery, exercise, diets, Botox, fame, money and power. But, in every case love will have the final word, and perfection will elude any association with the body. . . . And it is the story of a country in which being the perfect woman has become the biggest obsession of all. (p. 1)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1532708612471305">12</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Of these six women, you would be the most peculiar, Micaela. You, who had never gone under the plastic surgery knife and who had never fallen in love, would discover the symptoms of love on meeting Santiago Reverón, a famous plastic surgeon married to a diva with a body and face operated on to the point of perfection. And Santiago would fall in love with you, the strangest woman he had ever met. Among your peculiarities is that you process what you hear literally. You do not understand the nuances of spoken language, nor of body language. As such, you cannot parse metaphors, sarcasm, and jokes. In addition, you lack social filters when speaking; hence, you never lie or sugar coat your expressions. Brilliant, with an intelligence that is above average and a photographic memory, you can speak extensively about some subjects in which you are particularly learned. At the same time, you have difficulty deciphering emotions—your own and those of others. You are methodical and attached to your routines. They are your safety net. Hence, you suffer if anything alters your habits or environment. Your body language can confuse people: you have difficulty making eye contact and, in general, you do not like to be touched. At the beginning of <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic>, no one (not even you), knew the reason behind your characteristics: Asperger’s Syndrome, a condition that lies in the spectrum of autism. But Asperger’s would not impede the occurrence of your love story with Santiago. And, as you know, a central love story is the defining characteristic of <italic>telenovelas</italic>.</p>
<p>Now that you existed “on paper,” Micaela, the next thing was to give you corporeity. As a character, you would undoubtedly mark a milestone in the career of the actor who played you. For months, Padrón had one particular person in mind that has the acting caliber to personify you. Even when he wrote the first episode in early May 2009, you still had her face. But, there was a change of plan. The network’s management imposed a switch between this actor and Mónica Spear. And, though Spear’s talent and charisma are unquestionable, these were not the reasons for the change. The motive was an aesthetic one. Network executives believed that Spear and actor Ricardo Álamo, who would play Santiago, looked better visually than Álamo and the female actor for whom the role had been written originally. They thought that the audience would only believe that Santiago would leave his perfectly shaped wife Gala for you, if Spear played you. It was an ironic twist in a <italic>telenovela</italic> designed specifically to criticize Venezuelan society’s emphasis on physical perfection, but which also spoke volumes about the strict beauty canons that govern the <italic>telenovela</italic> industry and their relationship to risk, as perceived by TV executives.</p>
<p>I worried about you, Micaela. I was conscious of how crucial it was to choose an actor who would make you a believable character. No matter how well researched and written a character is, the actor is key. I quickly learned that my concern was unnecessary. Spear gave an excellent performance. Like Padrón, she also did research at SOVENIA, imprinted her candor in you, and constructed your elusive gaze, inability to handle intense sensory stimuli, perplexity regarding the behavior of other human beings, and your mechanic tone of voice when you demonstrated your Asperger’s erudition in long speeches packed with historical dates and facts.</p>
<p>I met you before the media and audience did. One day in July 2010, I arrived to Venevisión’s freezing Studio 3 and there you were, sitting in a set that resembled a police interrogation room, remember? You were methodically examining the table and you even smelled it. It was scene 25-1 of Episode 4:
<disp-quote>
<p>25-1) INT. INTERROGATION OFFICE. DAY.</p>
<p>Micaela is all alone. Seated. Looking at everything around her . . . she touches the table and smells it. . . . At that point, Santiago enters. She tenses up. He walks slowly, cautiously . . . takes a chair . . . and sits in front of her. Immediately, Micaela avoids his eyes, focusing on some imperfection of the table.</p>
<p>  SANTIAGO</p>
<p>  How did the interrogation go?</p>
<p>  MICAELA (WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM. NATURAL)</p>
<p>  You already know, Doctor. You were listening the whole time on the other side of that glass. That two-way mirror (POINTS), it was invented by Arnold Gesell, an American psychologist and pediatrician, in order to observe the behavior of children without disturbing them. . . . That’s why these interrogation rooms are called Gesell Chambers . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After months of shadowing Padrón while he created you, I could finally meet you, the embodiment of one of the most interesting research experiences I have ever had. I thought of the messages about Asperger’s, exclusion and the nature of love, which you would relay to the audience and felt a lump in my throat. I wanted to protect you. A good symptom for the <italic>telenovela</italic>, because if I felt that, maybe the audience would feel it too, which is what every <italic>telenovela</italic> protagonist aims to elicit in the viewers.</p>
<p>On August 30, Venevisión presented <italic>telenovela La Mujer Perfecta</italic> to the press via a private screening of the first episode. There were 31 episodes written and 20 ready for broadcasting. It was the end of the silent phase of production in which the audience is comprised only of network executives and those who write and produce the <italic>telenovela</italic>. (Not even actors see the produced material beforehand.) And it was the beginning of the decisive public phase of <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic>.</p>
<p>Micaela, it had not been easy to get to that point with you. It had taken Padrón’s team of writers some time to learn how to write your scenes. At first, they hardly wrote any dialogues for you. It was as if your Asperger’s was a weight on their shoulders too. Fortunately, that was overcome in the first 2 months of writing. Your first scenes also had to be redone, as the actors-protagonists, Spear and Álamo, requested a meeting with Padrón to better understand the effects the syndrome had on the dynamic between the characters they were playing.</p>
<p>In turn, Padrón, who at first thought that your diagnosis as an Asperger would occur “more or less halfway through the <italic>telenovela</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1532708612471305">Padrón, 2010a</xref>), that is, episode 60, had decided to accelerate this event, place it in episode 22, and thereby reduce the amount of time in which the audience could draw erroneous conclusions about your odd behavior and language. He did not want, though, to sacrifice the realism of the story since many “Aspies” spend years without being diagnosed correctly and, in the meantime, suffer from being misunderstood and excluded.</p>
<p>In the same line of thought, a few days before the presentation to the press, Padrón made a second decision: to announce your condition as Asperger at that event before the press watched the first episode:
<disp-quote>
<p>This is a country that is currently going through different types of exclusion: political, social, and gender exclusion. I wanted the main couple to signify the metaphor of exclusion through a very unique character, which is the one that Mónica Spear plays: Micaela Gómez. She is a character who suffers from Asperger’s syndrome, a mild form of autism that makes her have a difficult relationship with the world of emotions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1532708612471305">Padrón, 2010c</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With this announcement your writer attempted to immunize you and his <italic>telenovela</italic> against possible mistaken interpretations, which could then spread dangerously in the entertainment media.</p>
<p>The episode received much applause, Micaela. However, after conducting participant observation at several of these events, I have learned that media representatives always applaud at the premiere, even if they did not like the episode, and then write their real impressions in their reporting. It is important, then, to observe these journalists while they watch the episode and to strike up conversations with those present at the event. That evening something noteworthy happened, though. When I spoke with reporters and several other <italic>telenovela</italic> writers present, all of them praised you highly as a character. They thought you had everything a <italic>telenovela</italic> protagonist needs for the audience to fall in love with.</p>
<p>In the following days, the media highlighted the difficult moment the national <italic>telenovela</italic> was going through and how <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic> seemed to have the ingredients to initiate the industry’s much-needed recovery. With regards to you, Micaela, it turns out that although the network gave thorough media kits to every journalist with the aim of informing them about characters, plots, and cast, the press interpreted you in several different ways, some grossly inaccurate:
<disp-quote>
<p>Micaela, a unique girl, has Asperger’s syndrome, this makes her character attempt to find logic in everything around her, as well as explain every doubt that anyone around her might have. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532708612471305">Echandía Túpano &amp; López Balbi, 2010</xref>)</p>
<p>The melodrama’s “ugly duckling” will be the one to turn into “<italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic>” at the end of the story.

<p>On September 1 at 10 p.m., the first episode of <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic> was broadcast and the rest of Venezuela finally met you through your opening monologue:
<disp-quote>
<p>MICAELA (OFF):</p>
<p>Yesterday someone told me that I’m strange. My family has told me that my whole life. But until now no doctor has said what it is I have.</p>
<p>It seems to me that it’s other people who are odd. They say good evening when they arrive at a funeral home. What is so good about it if someone has died?</p>
<p>Or they say good morning to a policeman when they get pulled over for speeding.</p>
<p>When they’re sad, they play music. Or cry when they laugh too much.</p>
<p>I understand them even less when, in order to explain that they’re in love, they say they have butterflies in their stomach. It is impossible for butterflies to fly in a person’s stomach. There isn’t enough room. . . . Or is it just that I have never been in love? (Episode 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The reaction to the <italic>telenovela</italic> was positive and the ratings from the first week were conclusive. During the 10 p.m. time slot, Venevisión moved from being in third place with a 21.3% share<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1532708612471305">14</xref></sup> to first place with 32.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612471305">AGB, 2010</xref>). Audience members participating in my study expressed that you were their favorite character and that they wanted to know more about you. Several members of the Asperger community (people with the condition, their loved ones, therapists, and educators) shared with me their thoughts on the Facebook page “Asperger’s Syndrome Venezuela—Challenges and Hopes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532708612471305">Facebook, 2010</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>Hello Carolina, my little girl is in the Autism Spectrum (high functioning). On the 22nd of this month she will be 9 years old. I can tell you that I’m very happy with the <italic>telenovela</italic> and particularly with Mónica’s performance, I think it’s really good!!! . . . so much so that it’s impossible not to see my daughter in Micaela. To be honest I never imagined that the day would come when I saw in my country a <italic>telenovela</italic> that addressed this subject and much less that the protagonist had the condition. This is an important step for our entire autistic community for which I give enormous thanks to Mr. Leonardo Padrón for such an initiative!</p>
<p>Hi Carolina, I wanted to make a comment today about the performance by Micaela’s mother. Personally I see myself reflected in her, it’s exactly like what we see in the <italic>telenovela</italic>. The way she protects Micaela that no one else understands, how she guides her daughter in the right direction. For example, when she convinces Micaela to go to the movies, using subtlety and her daughter’s love of popcorn. That is the day to day of an Asperger mother, we do things little by little and accomplish much!</p>
<p>Ms. Acosta-Alzuru, the scene last night where Micaela’s mom and Santiago talk about Micaela . . . about her peculiar manner of being was MARVELOUS. I was in tears! . . . I felt very identified with Micaela’s mom . . . so many sentiments rose up in me, as the mother of an Asperger I tell you that the scene touched my heart!</p>
<p>The best thing about the way Micaela’s story has been developed in “La Mujer Perfecta” is that it’s the same way it happened for many of us Aspergers in our lives. Nobody knows what she or he has, some don’t bother to understand and prefer the easy way out by making jokes and destructive heckling, others walk in the dark but are marveled by the light we give off, we are not “normal” but also not “special”, rather we walk on a tightrope, no Asperger is like another . . . in sum, Leonardo Padrón not only informed himself extensively on the subject, but he also got to the heart of the matter: each person’s (and not just Aspergers) struggle for acceptance as valuable and unique human beings.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some members of the Asperger community were not as excited, though. They were fearful that the <italic>telenovela</italic> might not be the best medium to raise awareness about the syndrome and that the portrait of Aspergers could, in fact, do more harm than good:
<disp-quote>
<p>Greetings! I don’t know. . . . I’m not fully convinced of having Asperger’s in a <italic>telenovela</italic> . . . it’s such a complicated subject! I insist on education and information as tools to conquer the ignorance about the syndrome. In the context of a <italic>telenovela</italic> the essence of what we truly want could be lost. What we struggle for is the integration of our people into society with equal conditions and without discrimination. This is just my opinion. I wish the writer would read this and take it into account for the development of the character!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The same doubt was also expressed by the mother of a 6-year-old Asperger boy in a letter addressed to Padrón after the first episode:
<disp-quote>
<p>I write to you because yesterday I saw your new <italic>telenovela</italic>, and seeing the character played by Ms. Mónica I immediately realized that it was a case of Asperger’s. I had not read anything about the <italic>telenovela</italic> beforehand, this means that her performance is going well SO FAR. . . . I would very much like it if this subject was handled delicately since I am a mother. I know that you are also a father and you know our children hurt A LOT. Do not treat it as a type of joke or that people end up looking down on those with Asperger’s, I also think it is excellent that the subject be addressed given that in this society people do not know what Asperger’s Syndrome is. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532708612471305">E., 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These points of view were not surprising. Padrón, his writers, and Spear worked diligently so that these people’s understandable fears would never become a reality.</p>
<p>The media devoted a lot of space to you, Micaela. From extensive and informative reports about Asperger’s and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532708612471305">Ferrer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532708612471305">“Mundo Asperger,” 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1532708612471305">Rodríguez, 2010</xref>), to the usual criticism that <italic>telenovela</italic> plots and characters receive. For example, in <italic>Últimas Noticias</italic>, journalist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612471305">Jesús Bustindui (2010)</xref> sneered at the fact that at your age, you had not yet been correctly diagnosed:
<disp-quote>
<p>In <italic>telenovela</italic> “La Mujer Perfecta,” Micaela’s mother talks to doctor Santiago and tells him that her daughter had been examined by no less than 17 doctors. What is absurd is that not one of those doctors discovered that she suffers from Asperger’s Syndrome. (p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Television critic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532708612471305">Alexis Correia (2010)</xref> of <italic>El Nacional</italic> thought that there was an important contradiction in your behavior:
<disp-quote>
<p>When Guillermo (Eduardo Serrano) revealed to Micaela (Mónica Spear) that she is a patient with Asperger’s Syndrome, the psychologist tells her: “People like you do not have the ability to understand jokes, metaphors, or phrases that have a double meaning,” and she corroborated, “Yes, doctor, that happens to me.” To analyze this answer perhaps we need the help of a specialist, but is it not strange that a person who lacks the ability to understand metaphors would be capable of having full consciousness of her own limitation? (p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jhonatan Ugueto, who has Asperger’s like you,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1532708612471305">15</xref></sup> responded to Bustindui and Correia:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are entertainment journalists who have criticized some aspects of the <italic>telenovela</italic> in relation to Asperger’s Syndrome. Jesús Bustindui, from Últimas Noticias asks how it is possible that Micaela went through so many psychologists and none of them even mentioned Asperger’s Syndrome. Mr. Bustindui: I went through a similar experience, the psychologists who saw me did not know how to define my condition that was so peculiar, the closest they got was to talk about “mild autism,” not a very specific diagnosis. Another journalist, Alexis Correia, from <italic>El Nacional</italic>, was curious to know how Micaela can have a certain notion of her condition while at the same time having difficulty understanding metaphors, jokes with a double meaning, and other complex details of human communication. To Mr. Correia I say that not all Aspergers are the same, some can understand certain jokes and metaphors but in other things from daily life, such as following instructions, doing jobs, they can be too literal, they do what they are told, but they do not take the time to look for other perspectives for doing the job in a quicker or more efficient way; that is my case. As such, it is not just specialists, any Asperger who is moderately clear about their condition can talk about it and more. They would confirm that Leonardo Padrón informed himself sufficiently well on the subject, in the sense that Asperger’s is a neurochemical cerebral condition that is too complex and has not yet been studied very extensively. (Ugueto, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532708612471305">Escobar, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the following months, the ratings war between <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic> and its competition raged. Shares and ratings, so positive in the first week, hit a plateau. It seemed that the sudden move from third to first place had been too good to be true. In October, the <italic>telenovela</italic>’s average share was 30.1%, whereas Televén’s <italic>El Clon</italic> (<italic>The Clone</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1532708612471305">16</xref></sup> was 30.6%. In November, <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic> regained the first place spot, 30.6% to 28.9%. The <italic>telenovela</italic> ended in March, blowing away the competition with 31.6% to <italic>Aurora</italic>’s 19.4%, leaving fertile ground for the next melodrama, <italic>La Viuda Joven</italic> (<italic>The Young Widow</italic>), which launched with a clear advantage against the defeated <italic>Aurora</italic>. The Venezuelan <italic>telenovela</italic> had, at the hand of <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic>, come back from the dead. And you, Micaela, had played a key role in this resurrection.</p>
<p>Throughout the difficult battle for the ratings, there were never any doubts with regard to your acceptance by the audience. This was clear both in my study as well as in the research done by the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1532708612471305">Venevisión, 2010</xref>). I should note that this is not the case for all <italic>telenovela</italic> protagonists who, sometimes, are eclipsed by another story or character. Because <italic>telenovela</italic> consumption is of a primarily emotional nature, it has elements of chance and mystery.</p>
<p>Despite the audience’s general acceptance, I could read on Twitter comments here and there that were symptomatic of how society decodes those who, like you, are different:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think Micaela from @LaMujerPerfecta is super birdbrained</p>
<p>the protagonists is a <italic>mongólica</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1532708612471305">17</xref></sup>…!! @lamujerperfecta</p>
<p>Ok, Mikaela (sic) is not asperger. SHE IS F . . . ING CRAZY!!!!!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, SOVENIA published in its Twitter:
<disp-quote>
<p>@lamujerperfecta Excellent performance by Mónica as Micaela, adults who are self-diagnosing themselves as Aspergers are sending us emails requesting consultation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Additionally, several specialists on autism and Asperger’s, including Dr. Negrón, praised you and the realism of your story on a radio show devoted to the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532708612471305">Escobar, 2010</xref>). These professionals, of ample experience with autism, highlighted the public service aspects of your story, something that the network itself never seemed to understand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1532708612471305">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, just as your conception was a painstaking process, every key moment of your life was also carefully researched, written, and performed. As for me, I continued my study, following the writing and production processes and taking the audience’s pulse regularly. Through your literal way of looking at the world and your unbridled honesty, the audience heard about “the symptoms of love,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1532708612471305">19</xref></sup> experienced alongside you the process of your diagnosis, your first kiss, the first time you made love, your wedding, the difficulties of married life, your perplexity at being pregnant, and your decision to become an activist for the inclusion of people with autism and Asperger’s. In hundreds of scenes you made the audience fall in love with you thanks to your absence of malice, prodigious memory, struggle to learn how to decipher the world, and your love for Santiago. The Asperger community, in particular, was pleased and grateful:
<disp-quote>
<p>@Leonardo_Padron Thanks on behalf of my son for showing Venezuelans that autism exists, awareness is necessary.</p>
<p>@Leonardo_Padron today my student that has Asperger’s was happy because “finally there are people like him on TV” referring to @lamujerperfecta</p>
<p>@lamujerperfecta in my family there is a case like Micaela’s, and seeing her character, helps us to confront our case with hope!</p>
<p>@Leonardo_Padron @F_FASPERGERV @lamujerperfecta @SOVENIA since this <italic>telenovela</italic> has been on, people talk about asperger’s, fantastic!</p>
<p>@lamujerperfecta is the only one who gave us importance as Aspergers. It let Venezuela know that we exist.</p>
<p>@Leonardo_Pardron I am a Language Therapist and I love Mónica’s acting as well, she outdid herself! Long live aspergers</p>
<p>Micaela is the first famous Venezuelan Asperger . . . even if she is a character.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Studying a <italic>telenovela</italic>’s reception is always a window to the social formation’s taboos and mores, Micaela. An important day in my research was when you made love for the first time. Once again Padrón consulted with specialists. He learned that Asperger’s makes you “tactile defensive.” That means that you have sensory hypersensitivity and, in general, you do not like to be touched. Dr. Guillermo Toro, the psychologist who diagnosed you, explained to Santiago that he should use “deep touch,” pressure and massages, instead of superficial caresses. For your part, you would process your first sexual experience from the characteristics of your condition: reading about it beforehand, describing it without inhibitions, and if it turned out to be pleasurable, wanting to repeat it:
<disp-quote>
<p>7) INT. HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.</p>
<p>Santiago and Micaela have made love. She lies on his chest, with the biggest smile of her life.</p>
<p>MICAELA (AMAZED)</p>
<p>I didn’t know it was like that. I didn’t know the heart could beat so quickly and feel so . . . good. It was as if I had received a shock of ten thousand volts!!</p>
<p>SANTIAGO (SMILES)</p>
<p>Yes, that’s a good comparison. Did you feel good?</p>
<p>MICAELA (VERY SINCERE)</p>
<p>So good!! Except for that brief moment of pain . . . after that everything was perfect, I felt very comfortable, kind of big, as if I were growing suddenly, like Alice in Wonderland . . . and I could feel every part of my body, and also yours . . .! It was as if my body was going to explode into butterflies . . !</p>
<p>16) INT. HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT</p>
<p>Santiago and Micaela have eaten and are talking, sitting on the bed. Micaela checks the clock on the nightstand every so often.</p>
<p>MICAELA (JUMPS UPON SEEING THE HOUR)</p>
<p>Finally, it’s been 45 minutes!</p>
<p>SANTIAGO (LOOKS AT HER, DUMBFOUNDED)</p>
<p>Does that mean something?</p>
<p>MICAELA (SITS UP)</p>
<p>It’s just that, it’s been 45 minutes . . . (SHE KISSES HIM) and I want to . . . (SHE KISSES HIM AGAIN) again.</p>
<p>SANTIAGO</p>
<p>Want to . . . <italic>what</italic> again!?</p>
<p>MICAELA (OBVIOUS)</p>
<p>Sex. My sister Shirley told me that one can wait a while, 45 minutes to an hour, and make love again . . . And it has been 45 minutes! (Episode 54)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A woman asking for sex? Even worse, a <italic>telenovela</italic> protagonist taking the lead in sex?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1532708612471305">20</xref></sup> The reactions on Twitter came immediately and, in general, were polarized by gender. Women thought the sequence was tender and realistic. On the other hand, many men made lewd comments on Facebook, Twitter, and in my study, calling you a prostitute in every way imaginable. And a journalist from the entertainment media tweeted: “Micaela is not autistic! She is a tremendous NYMPHOMANIAC.”</p>
<p>The public’s reception of your first time had brought to light the ways in which Venezuelan men and women view female sexual desire. These reactions did not surprise me. I had long since come to the realization that your Asperger’s honesty was a litmus test for Venezuelans’ sociocultural mechanisms and perceptions. And the audience’s comments were in line with the country’s cultural perceptions of gender roles.</p>
<p>On March 14, 2011, the final episode of <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic> was broadcast. The <italic>telenovela</italic> ended with the same format with which it had begun 6 months before: a monologue. But this time, your 4-year-old daughter delivered the monologue, after a “several years later” time lapse:
<disp-quote>
<p>GIRL: (VOICE OVER)</p>
<p>Yesterday someone told me that I’m a strange girl. But I’m not. I’m simply an Asperger. Just how some people have blonde hair or tan skin, I’m Asperger. My mom says that in reality no one is very normal or very perfect to speak of, that we are all different and wonderful.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Micaela, your message of inclusion was received. This was reflected in the words of the participants in my study and the messages posted in social media:
<disp-quote>
<p>I loved Micaela’s speech: we all fit in this world and we should accept each other just as we are, and respect each other. (ROSA)</p>
<p>You know what made me reflect? Micaela, her internal beauty and reflection about tolerance and acceptance of others just as they are. (ANTONIO)</p>
<p>The character that most touched me was Micaela. Exclusion is something scary. Many children are victims in their schools, and even in their own families, for being different. It isn’t only about having a specific syndrome. Perhaps it’s about being overweight, dark-skinned or short. (PEDRO)</p>
<p>@lamujerperfecta the <italic>telenovela</italic> dealt with real situations and the best part was that it touched on the theme of Asperger’s which was not very well-known. Congratulations!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A key test for a media text is whether the people represented therein approve of the portrait that has been painted of them. And, as Murray posits, popular culture content like <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic> that addresses neurotypical audiences and seeks commercial success, also begs the question “can autistic viewers find themselves in them?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532708612471305">Murray, 2008b</xref>, p. 33). Thus, the reactions of people with Asperger’s were particularly important:
<disp-quote>
<p>The representation of Asperger’s Syndrome in the <italic>telenovela</italic> was simply EXTRAORDINARY!!!!! I think Mónica Spear’s performance was moving and pertinent. Of course, Micaela’s attitude will never be the same as many people with this condition, be they man or woman, because each person with Asperger’s is a world in and of themselves, united by diverse characteristics. But, as a person who lives with this condition, I approve the <italic>telenovela’s</italic> and Micaela’s representation of Asperger’s Syndrome.</p>
<p>I think the representation of Asperger’s Syndrome was perfect. Because this was the first Venezuelan <italic>telenovela</italic> that has a person with Asperger’s as the protagonist, it really let Venezuela know what the syndrome is. People now understand me better.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Five days after the <italic>telenovela</italic> ended, Padrón received the Rafael Ángel García Award for writer of the year for “his versatility as a writer and sensitivity in tackling social interest issues in his <italic>telenovelas</italic> that result in visibility and awareness of issues such as, nondiscrimination, domestic violence, and breast cancer, among others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532708612471305">CECODAP, 2011</xref>). The award was presented by CECODAP—an NGO dedicated to the promotion and defense of the rights of children and adolescents. And on World Autism Awareness Day, the Center for Evaluation and Integrated Diagnostics of Development Disorders (CEDIAD) made a public tribute to Padrón because he “opened his heart to autism and made it so that Venezuelans had a new perspective regarding people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612471305">CEDIAD, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1532708612471305">perezreve, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the message that you embodied, Micaela, its strengths and possibilities had not been understood in an important place: Venevisión. Yes, the network that produced and broadcast <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic>. On March 20, a few days after the final episode, the comedy show <italic>A que te ríes</italic> (<italic>I bet you’ll laugh</italic>) aired the traditional parody of the <italic>telenovela</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1532708612471305">21</xref></sup> and gave it the title <italic>La mujer choreta</italic> (<italic>The Messed-Up Woman)</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612471305">Cerutti, Martínez, Valenotti, &amp; Díaz, 2011</xref>). Imitating a character like you is a delicate endeavor. The show’s humor, coarse and disrespectful even toward the networks’ own talent, worked against everything <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic> had accomplished with regard to increasing awareness and sensitivity toward Asperger’s Syndrome.</p>
<p>One of the <italic>telenovela</italic>’s achievements had been to foster recall<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1532708612471305">22</xref></sup> for the word “Asperger,” emphasizing that the syndrome is a condition, not an illness, and much less, a mental illness. In <italic>A que te ríes’</italic> first scene, “Micaela” says, with a totally dazed expression, open mouth, and rocking back and forth, “They tell me you’re a doctor.” To which “Santiago” responds, “Yes, but I don’t operate on your kind of crazies.” Previously, “Micaela” had said to him, “I’m not crazy, everyone thinks I’m crazy, but no. What I have is a weird thing they call asparagus.” This gag was repeated in the parody two more times using “astonishment” and “Volkswagen” instead of saying “Asperger.”</p>
<p><italic>La mujer choreta</italic> also represented you as a sex-crazed woman, while repeatedly associating you with two words: sick and crazy. In one scene, “Micaela” is seated in “Santiago’s” lap and tries fruitlessly to kiss him:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>“Micaela”:</speaker>
<p>What’s wrong, Doctor? Don’t you want to kiss me?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>“Santiago”:</speaker>
<p>No, I do, I do want to.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>“Micaela”:</speaker>
<p>So why don’t you? Is it because I’m sick? Is that why?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>“Santiago” (with a gesture of disgust):</speaker>
<p>No, it’s just that . . . it grosses me out!</p>
</speech>
<p>In two other scenes “Santiago” exclaims, “You’re not crazy, you’re COMPLETELY crazy!” And in the scene mimicking your first time, the parody’s “Santiago” says, “This really is the perfect woman! She’s crazy, stupid, and totally hot!” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612471305">Cerutti et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>You might be surprised to learn, Micaela, that the press offered scarce negative comments about <italic>La mujer choreta</italic>, instead highlighting how upset Padrón and the cast were with the parody, criticizing them for “not having a sense of humor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1532708612471305">Mata, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1532708612471305">Sepulturero, 2011</xref>). In contrast, the Asperger community did not approve of the show:
<disp-quote>
<p>Terrible depiction of the Asperger in the parody of <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic>, transmitted by Venevisión tonight on their show <italic>A que te ríes</italic>. Very regrettable, after the telenovela had educated the public about our children’s condition.</p>
<p>It’s a lack of respect to do a parody of Micaela in <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic> about Asperger’s syndrome, they should take those shows off the air for offending people with this condition!!</p>
<p>The people at Venevisión are hypocrites they never sympathized with Asperger’s syndrome they didn’t even understand the concepts of the condition!!</p>
<p>It would be great if all of us involved in the issue: SOVENIA, the friends of this group, LEONARDO PADRON himself made public our disgust, I think if we leave it like this, we will allow just anyone to feel like they have the right to make fun of us and that is unacceptable.</p>
<p>With this type of parodies the perception that people with Asperger’s are “crazies” will increase. Whoever is willing to write a letter complaining to Venevisión, count on my signature.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I wonder what would have happened if this group, or SOVENIA, had sent that letter to the network. Would they have received an apology from Venevisión?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1532708612471305">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beyond the undeniable preeminence of commercial interest over social responsibility in Venezuelan television, the pettiness of some entertainment press, and the intricacies of the human condition, your presence on the Venezuelan television screen was extraordinary news, Micaela. <italic>Telenovelas</italic>, the backbone of the programming grid in many Latin American countries, including Venezuela, can be efficient vehicles for sociocultural messages. A genre traditionally known for its problematic representation of gender roles and trite storylines with exaggerated twists of the plot can also deliver content that increases awareness and elicits reflection. This was your case, Micaela. And, even though the <italic>telenovela</italic> codes imposed a glaze of sentimentality in your story, the latter did not extend a bona fide certification of neurotypical values as it highlighted the most troublesome aspects of “Othering” and exclusion.</p>
<p>So I conclude this letter, my dear, with another letter. One that I received from a father whose 6-year-old daughter is an Asperger like you. In his letter there are images which confirm that <italic>telenovelas</italic>, although they are entertainment, can be agents of change in the lives of individuals and in society. I give it to you in appreciation for your presence on Venezuelan television and in my scholarship.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As the father of a 6-year-old girl with Asperger’s Syndrome, I’m very thankful for this idea of making a <italic>telenovela</italic> whose protagonist has this condition. Before the <italic>telenovela</italic> was on television, it was very difficult for my wife and me to explain the syndrome to others. In fact, I always carry with me copies of a quick guide about the Asperger’s. My daughter has been the victim of the rejection caused by ignorance about her condition. But after the <italic>telenovela</italic> everything began to change, even within our immediate family we began to see better comprehension of her way of seeing and understanding the world. In a sense, the minds of those who do not like to read or be informed were opened.</p>
<p>The information transmitted by way of the <italic>telenovela</italic>, be it by Micaela or by the character that was a psychologist, was very useful.</p>
<p>The progress in my daughter’s life since her teachers, cousins, aunts, grandmothers, and grandfather started watching <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic> has been immense. Before that, either they overprotected her to the point of thinking she wasn’t capable of understanding everyday instructions, or she was excluded from a party or get-together because they thought she would not be comfortable.</p>
<p>My daughter has made so much progress thanks to <italic>La Mujer Perfecta’s</italic> breaking of paradigms that this year she was her school’s carnival princess and, as such, she addressed the audience. Last December she participated in the Christmas dance and now tries to make friends. It is now a rare occurrence when she isolates herself.</p>
<p>There’s something very curious that she hasn’t been able to explain to me yet. I don’t know if someone said it to her or if she saw it herself since she also watched the <italic>telenovela</italic>. It is that she calls herself a perfect woman. She says “I’m a princess, I’m a mujer perfecta” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532708612471305">Suárez, 2010</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So long, Micaela. Your presence on my dissection table has taught me much about the possibilities and limitations of the <italic>telenovela</italic> genre, and the cultural production and consumption of “Othering.” In consequence, this letter is a contribution to media and cultural studies, in general, and <italic>telenovela</italic> scholarship in particular. I embrace you, Micaela, just as I did the first time I learned of the possibility of your existence and imagined the message you could be for all Venezuelans, with or without Asperger’s.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Carolina</p>

<p>Specifically, the study of telenovela <italic>La Mujer Perfecta</italic>, where Micaela was the protagonist, included textual analysis of its 120 episodes, 32 hours of interviews and daily email and Blackberry messenger conversations with writer Padrón, in-depth interviews with his team of writers and the telenovela cast members, more than 50 hours of participant observation in writers’ meetings, network offices, the set, and locations. The study also involved observation and analysis of Facebook and Twitter during broadcasts, repeated interviews and questionnaires with 30 members of the audience and 6 people with Asperger’s syndrome who watched the telenovela regularly, and analysis of the ratings and the media coverage the telenovela received.</p>

<p>Although Mark Haddon has stated on multiple occasions that he does not consider himself an expert on the subject and that his novel was written with the sole intention of showing the world from the point of view of an “outsider,” he recognizes that it is not surprising to him that he receives frequent invitations to speak about autism and Asperger’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532708612471305">Haddon, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>The question is relevant. In Episode 93, Micaela, in one of her frequent demonstrations of erudition, said referring to the yogurt another character was eating, “That is why they introduce bacteria in milk, in generally they use two or more to achieve a more complete fermentation. Those bacteria use the lactose or sugar in milk as an energy source, and they liberate lactic acid as a waste product. In sum, yogurt is like the excrement of bacteria.” Prior to that, in Episode 92, another character that was recovering from a heart attack is reprimanded by his daughter for eating a sandwich “with a ton of mayonnaise.” In light of these two texts, an advertiser who produces mayonnaise and yogurt complained to the network. Management apologized and told Leonardo Padrón that he needed to include in posterior episodes positive texts about these products. In contrast, the network did not seem to take it personally when the gay community complained about a character in the <italic>telenovela</italic>, which they thought represented homosexuals in a stereotypical way. Would the latter have happened with a letter from the Aspergers?</p>
