<abstract>
<p>Phenolic compounds from mashua tuber were evaluated as potential antioxidants to retard the oxidation of crude soybean oil submitted to accelerated storage and frying. During the accelerated storage, an ethanolic crude extract, a purified extract, an aqueous fraction and an ethyl acetate fraction from mashua containing different gallic acid equivalent concentrations (100, 300 and 600 ppm) in oil were evaluated at 55 °C. After 15 days of storage, better effects were evidenced against soybean oil oxidation at 300 and 600 ppm of ethyl acetate fraction in comparison to 200 ppm butylated hydroxytoluene and the control (no antioxidant added). During the frying process at ∼180 °C, principal component analysis revealed that the content of trienes and dienes were strongly correlated with the frying batch. Ethyl acetate fraction at 200 ppm showed the highest efficacy against oil oxidation in terms of polar compound values, free fatty acids and conjugated dienes and trienes in comparison to the oil containing 200 ppm <italic>tert</italic>-butylhydroquinone and control. Differential scanning calorimetry corroborated the efficacy of ethyl acetate fraction phenolic and it is strongly recommended as method for validation of results. This study provides strong evidence related to the excellent protective effects against soybean oil oxidation of mashua phenolics. This crop could be utilized as an alternative source of natural antioxidants by the oil industry.</p>

<p>Oil oxidation is an autocatalytic reaction which generates hydroperoxides from unsaturated acylglycerols, which then are decomposed to lower molecular weight compounds. Antioxidants are used to extend the induction period of oxidation or slow down the oxidation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013211427794">Choe and Min, 2006</xref>). The shelf-life of lipids and foods containing lipid can be extended by retarding oxidative rancidity which in turn can be successfully achieved by the addition of synthetic or natural antioxidants. The most popular synthetic antioxidants still being widely utilized are derived from phenolic structures such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and <italic>tert</italic>-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ). The most important natural antioxidants found are tocopherols, ascorbic acid, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, amino acids, phospholipids and sterols. Antioxidants inhibit the oxidation by scavenging free radicals, chelating pro-oxidative metals, quenching singlet oxygen and photosensitizers, and inactivating lipoxygenase. Antioxidants show interactions, such as synergism (tocopherols and ascorbic acid), antagonism (α-tocopherol and caffeic acid), and simple addition. Synergism occurs when one antioxidant is regenerated by others, when one antioxidant protects another antioxidant by its sacrificial oxidation, and when two or more antioxidants show different antioxidant mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211427794">Choe and Min, 2009</xref>). The safety of some of these synthetic antioxidants has been questioned due to their toxic and carcinogenic effects exerted in animals and humans. Thus, their use is permitted only for certain foodstuffs and under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211427794">Hirose et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211427794">Ito et al., 1986</xref>). For instance, BHT and BHA have restrictions in foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211427794">Ito et al., 1985</xref>) and the use of TBHQ, the most potent synthetic antioxidant, has been banned in countries such as Japan, Canada, and the European Union. These restrictions together with the growing consumer preference for natural food additives have directed industry to search for natural sources of novel antioxidants. Phenolic compounds from plant extracts such as, spices, herbs, fruits and vegetables; however, exhibit substantial differences in antioxidant effectiveness with different fat and oil types (Zia-ur-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013211427794">Rehman et al., 2004</xref>). Their performance is related to their differences in molecular structures. Deep-fat frying is a quite popular procedure for the preparation and manufacture of foods either at home or in industry. During deep-fat frying, oil is exposed to elevated temperatures under air and moisture conditions. Due to these conditions, physical and chemical reactions occur (e.g. oxidation, hydrolysis, and polymerization of unsaturated fatty acids) altering the frying medium composition by producing volatile chain-scission products, non-volatile oxidized derivatives, and dimeric, polymeric or cyclic substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013211427794">Mariod et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013211427794">Stevenson et al., 1984</xref>). As frying continues, these compounds are transformed to off-flavors with potentially toxic effects (e.g. cytotoxic and mutagenic) turning the oil unsuitable for frying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211427794">Seppanen and Csallany, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Mashua is an Andean tuber that has sparked attention due to its economical value as a food and medicinal crop. Traditional use of mashua claims health improvement related to kidney and liver pain relief, skin eczemas, prostate disorders. These health promoting properties of mashua tubers seem to be related to the presence of specific phytochemical compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211427794">Grau et al., 2003</xref>). Mashua tubers contain a significant amount of phenolic compounds and a high antioxidant capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211427794">Campos et al., 2006</xref>; Chirinos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211427794">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013211427794">2008b</xref>). Flavan-3-ols, proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins were identified as the major contributors to the antioxidant capacity in this tuber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211427794">Chirinos et al., 2008a</xref>). Phenolics present in mashua, in addition, displayed good antioxidant properties against oxidative damage in biological structures rich in PUFA (LDL and erythrocytes) by using <italic>in vitro</italic> tests suggesting their possible future industrial application against lipid oxidation or in the cosmetic sector for the protection of biological tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013211427794">Chirinos et al., 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of this work was to evaluate the antioxidant efficacy of mashua phenolic fractions in the protection of crude soybean oil against oxidation under accelerated storage and frying conditions. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is presented as orthogonal technique to validate oil oxidative stability findings.</p>

<p>Mashua genotype ARB 5241 (Peel/purple, flesh/yellow) was provided by International Potato Center (CIP, Lima, Peru). Harvested tubers were immediately lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. Unrefined soybean oil free of additives was supplied by a local factory.</p>
<p>Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl chroman-2-carboxylic acid), 2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), 2N Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, BHT and TBHQ were purchased from Sigma Chemicals Co. (St. Louis, MO). All solvents and other chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and Fischer Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1082013211427794"><title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>Phenolics from mashua were extracted and fractionated following an optimized procedure described by Chirinos et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013211427794">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211427794">2008a</xref>) and schematically presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211427794">Figure 1</xref>. Briefly, 1 g of lyophilized mashua tuber was first extracted with 60 mL and subsequently with 30 mL of a solvent mixture methanol/acetone/water (45:45:10) containing 0.1% HCl in an orbital shaker for 60 min and 15 min, respectively. The extraction steps were carried out at room temperature and in darkness. Then, the mixture was centrifuged and vacuum concentrated at ≤40 °C until dryness. The resulting product was dissolved with Milli-Q water or absolute ethanol (99.9%), depending on the treatment followed. The resulting product dissolved in water is referred as Extract 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211427794">Figure 1</xref>) and the ethanol dissolved extract is referred as crude extract (CE). Extract 1 (25 mL) was further purified in a C<sub>18</sub> Sep-pak cartridge (10 g, 35 cm<sup>3</sup>, Waters, Milford, MA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211427794">Rodriguez-Saona and Wrolstad, 2001</xref>). Phenolic compounds were absorbed onto the column. Sugars, acids, and other compounds were eluted with 70 mL of acidified water (0.01% HCl). Phenolic compounds were then eluted with 100 mL of acidified methanol (0.01% HCl). Methanol was then removed under vacuum (≤40 °C) and the residue was dissolved in Milli-Q water or absolute ethanol depending on the treatment followed. The water dissolved residue is referred as Extract 2 and the ethanol dissolved residue as purified extract (PE). Furthermore, Extract 2 was submitted to a liquid–liquid partition using ethyl acetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211427794">Chirinos et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211427794">Kennedy, 2003</xref>). Thus, 6 mL of Extract 2 was mixed with 12 mL ethyl acetate. The partition included a 20-min agitation (200 rpm) in darkness. Then, the mixture was let to stand until two phases were observed and the organic phase was collected. A second partition was performed under the same conditions. The organic phases were assembled, evaporated at 40 °C until dryness and dissolved in absolute ethanol. This fraction is referred as ethyl acetate fraction (EaF). The remaining aqueous phase was lyophilized and then dissolved in absolute ethanol. This fraction is referred as aqueous fraction (AqF). Ethanolic CE, PE, EaF and AqF were flushed with nitrogen and stored at −20 °C until analyses.

<sec id="sec7-1082013211427794"><title>Antioxidant capacity, total phenolics and specific antioxidant capacity</title>
<p>Antioxidant capacity (AC) was determined with the ABTS procedure following the same procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211427794">Campos et al. (2006)</xref>. Absorbance was measured at 734 nm. AC was calculated as micromole of Trolox equivalents (TE)/mL from a standard curve developed with Trolox. Total phenolics (TP) were determined following the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211427794">Singleton and Rossi (1965)</xref> using gallic acid as a standard. Absorbance was measured at 755 nm and the results were expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/mL. The specific antioxidant capacity (SAC) was determined by dividing the AC/TP and the results were expressed as micromole of TE/mg GAE.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013211427794"><title>Peroxide value, polar compounds, free fatty acids, conjugated dienes and conjugated trienes assays</title>
<p>Peroxide value (PV) assays were performed following the Official Methods and Practices of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211427794">AOCS, Cd 8-53 (1998)</xref>. Conjugated dienes (CD) and conjugated trienes (CT) were determined according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211427794">IUPAC (1987)</xref>. For the determination of CD and CT values, soybean oil samples were diluted with iso-octano to bring the absorbance to the limit. The absorbance was measured at wavelengths of 232 and 268 nm for CD and CT values, respectively using a spectrophotometer Thermo Scientific GENESYS 6™ (Madison, WI). Free fatty acids (FFA) and polar compounds (PC) were determined according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211427794">AOCS (1998)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1082013211427794"><title>Accelerated storage tests</title>
<p>The protecting antioxidant effect of the ethanolic solutions: CE, PE, EaF and AqF were tested at 100, 300 and 600 mg of total phenolics per kg soybean oil (ppm) under accelerated storage. Thus, the different ethanolic extracts or fractions were mixed with oil and stirred for 15 min. A control (without any antioxidant added but with ethanol) and an oil sample with 200 ppm of BHT (dissolved in ethanol) were also tested in parallel. The quantity of ethanol and ethanol solutions used was limited for all treatments to 5% of the weight of the final oil solution. Subsequently, 10 g of each treatment were transferred to 50 mL open dark glass bottles and subjected to accelerated oxidation at 55 °C for 15 days in an oven with air circulation. BHT was used as reference due to its wide application in foods as antioxidant, due to its stability, low cost and efficacy. Samples were taken at 0, 7 and 15 days and PV determinations were carried out. The experiments were accomplished in duplicate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1082013211427794"><title>Frying procedure</title>
<p>Discontinuous frying was used throughout the experiment. The ethanolic CE, PE and EaF extracts or fractions at 200 mg of total phenolics per kg of oil (ppm) were tested during the frying procedure. In parallel, 200 ppm of TBHQ (dissolved in ethanol) and a control (no antioxidant added) were also evaluated. TBHQ was selected due to its highest thermal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013211427794">Sanhueza et al., 2000</xref>) with respect to other synthetic antioxidants (e.g. BHT, BHA). Similarly to the accelerated storage tests the ethanol or ethanol solutions quantities were limited to 5% of the final oil solution. For each experiment, 300 mL of oil was placed into an open fryer and heated at 175 ± 10 °C. Then 300 g of potatoes were peeled, cut into cubical bars (∼3 × 1.5 × 1.5 cm<sup>3</sup>) and washed with water. Ten batches of 30 g of potato were fried for ∼3 min with 20-min intervals between each frying operation. No replenishment of oil was made. The total heating period was ∼4.0 h, which included intermediate heating periods of ∼2 min to increase the oil temperature (after 20 min of rest) from ∼70 to 175 ± 10 °C. Oil samples were taken at 4, 7 and 10 frying batches and analyzed for PC, FFA and absorbances at 232 and 268 nm. Experiments were accomplished in duplicate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1082013211427794"><title>Differential scanning calorimetry assay</title>
<p>The oxidative stability of soybean oil was determined by using a PerkinElmer differential scanning calorimeter Pyris 6. The DSC assay is used for studying various heat-related phenomena in materials by monitoring associated changes in enthalpy. Oxidation is an exothermic process, thus the involved heat reaction makes it possible to use DSC for the evaluation of oxidative stability of oils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1082013211427794">Suja et al., 2004</xref>). The equipment was calibrated with pure indium and an aluminum pan was used as reference in order to obtain a baseline. Oil samples of 5 ± 0.1 mg were individually weighed in an open aluminum pan and placed into the sample chamber. The isothermal temperature was programmed at 140 °C and then 99.8% pure oxygen was flushed through the sample at 35 mL/min. The onset time of oxidation reaction referred as induction period (IP) closely corresponded to the intersection of the extrapolated baseline and the tangent line (leading edge) of the exothermal function. The effectiveness of EaF and TBHQ (both at 200 ppm) was assessed with the DSC assay by measuring their induction periods. The inclusion of the ethanolic extracts to the oil followed the same recommendations taken for the accelerated storage and frying tests described above.</p>
<p>Additionally the effectiveness of EaF, TBHQ and control treatments after frying was evaluated with the DSC assay by measuring their induction period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1082013211427794"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All quantitative analysis were performed at least in duplicate. Values of different results were expressed as the mean ± SD. The SPSS software for Windows 14.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for all univariate statistical tests. Principal component analysis (PCA), an unsupervised multivariate statistical technique, was performed using The Unscrambler Version 9.8 (CAMO A/S, Trondheim, Norway).</p>

<sec id="sec14-1082013211427794"><title>Phenolic compounds and specific antioxidant capacity of extracts and fractions from mashua tuber</title>
<p>The total phenolic contents determined for the ethanol CE, PE, EaF and AqF were 50.8, 58.0, 13.4 and 37.2 mg GAE/mL, respectively. The SAC values calculated for the ethanolic CE, PE, EaF and AqF in descending order followed this tendency EaF &gt; CE &gt; PE &gt; AqF with mean values of 18.3, 13.6, 12.8, and 11.6 µmol TE/mg GAE, respectively. The SAC value for CE was slightly better than for PE probably due to the presence of other antioxidant compounds like ascorbic acid, sugars, and aromatic amines present in the CE. Substantial amounts of ascorbic acid have been reported in mashua tubers in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211427794">Grau et al., 2003</xref>). In this study, purification of CE was a necessary step to remove non-phenolic compounds in order to enhance the antioxidant phenolic content present in the CE. In addition, this purification step helped to obtain a better dispersability of the phenolic compounds in the oil.</p>
<p>EaF displayed the highest value of SAC whereas the lowest value was displayed by AqF. Identification of the phenolic compounds present in this EaF fraction has been performed in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211427794">Chirinos et al., 2008a</xref>). Thus, flavan-3-ols (gallocatechin and catechin derivatives) and hydroxybenzoic acids were identified in this fraction. The type and amount of the different phenolic compounds contained in each fraction will have a huge influence on the SAC values.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1082013211427794"><title>Evaluation of the antioxidant efficacy of mashua phenolic compounds against soybean oil oxidation during storage</title>
<p>Currently, soybean oil can be considered as the major edible oil produced in the world. The good nutritional profile of soybean oil due to its high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids (∼85%) renders the soybean oil very susceptible to oxidative rancidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211427794">Su et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The evolution of PV values for the ethanolic CE, PE, EaF and AqF extracts or fractions at three 100, 300 and 600 ppm phenolics concentrations were tested under accelerated storage conditions at 55 °C for 15 days. A control (no antioxidant added) and oil containing the synthetic antioxidant BHT at 200 ppm were also tested. PV values increased with storage time for all treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211427794">Figure 2</xref>). Two phases were observed, one with a relative low oxidation rate (0–7 days) and the second one with a high oxidation rate (7–15 days). The low oxidation rate phase can be regarded as the oxidative induction period. At day 15, CE displayed the best antioxidant effect with PV values of 7.5, 10.6 and 11.0 meq O<sub>2</sub>/kg when CE was tested at 100, 300 and 600 ppm phenolics concentrations, respectively. PE, in contrast displayed PV values of 45, 40 and 33 meq O<sub>2</sub>/kg at 100, 300 and 600 ppm respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211427794">Figure 2</xref>(a) and (b)). A possible synergistic effect between ascorbic acid and other phenolics present in CE is not discarded. Ascorbic acid is a multifunctional antioxidant that can perform as a primary or as a secondary antioxidant. Ascorbic acid can act as antioxidant in food systems by diverse mechanisms such as quenching of singlet oxygen, reducing free radicals and primary antioxidant radicals, removing the molecular oxygen in presence of metal ions, acting synergistically with chelators, and regenerating primary antioxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013211427794">Schuler, 1990</xref>).

The control as expected, presented the highest PV value (89.2 meq O<sub>2</sub>/kg). Precipitations were observed when CE and PE were used during the assays probably due to the presence of impurities and/or phenolic compounds of low solubility degree in oil (e.g. anthocyanins). The high antioxidant protection of mashua extracts against soybean oil oxidation demanded the elucidation of the type of phenolic compounds involved. Thus, two different fractions from PE: AqF and EaF were submitted to their antioxidant efficacy evaluation.</p>
<p>The PV values for EaF and AqF at 100, 300 and 600 ppm phenolics during the accelerated storage can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211427794">Figure 2</xref>(c) and (d). At day 15, EaF at 100 ppm displayed a PV value of 36.1 meq O<sub>2</sub>/kg close to the one displayed by BHT (33.6 meq O<sub>2</sub>/kg) and better than the one displayed by AqF (53.0 meq O<sub>2</sub>/kg) at the same concentration. In addition, EaF at 300 and 600 ppm phenolics displayed better antioxidant protection (PV values of 11.5 and 15.9 meq O<sub>2</sub>/kg, respectively) than the AqF (PV of 27.2 and 59.0 meq O<sub>2</sub>/kg) at the same concentrations. The oil containing AqF phenolics presented precipitations. In this AqF fraction phenolics such as anthocyanins are scarcely soluble in edible fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211427794">Chirinos et al., 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, EaF mainly composed of flavan-3-ols and hydroxybenzoic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211427794">Chirinos et al., 2008a</xref>) exerted a better protective effect due to its better solubility in the soybean oil. These results are in accordance to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211427794">Bonilla et al. (1999)</xref> who studied the extraction of phenolic compounds from red grape marc to be used as food lipid antioxidants.

<p>The evaluation of polar compounds (PC) to assess lipid oxidation of the frying oil is one of the most reliable criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013211427794">Dobarganes et al., 1999</xref>). PC in the frying oil is composed of breakdown products, non-volatile oxidized derivatives, polymeric and cyclic substances which are produced during the deep-frying process. In addition, micro particulates and soluble components from the food being fried end up in the oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211427794">Sanibal and Mancini-Filho, 2004</xref>). CE, EaF, TBHQ at 200 ppm and control treatments revealed, as expected, an increase in PC values during the frying process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013211427794">Figure 3</xref>). After 10 batches of frying, PC for the different fractions accumulated as follows: EaF (11.8%) &lt; TBHQ (22.0%) &lt; control (27.2%) &lt; CE (29.9%). PC values higher than 25–27% indicate that the oil is not suitable for human consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013211427794">Mariod et al., 2006</xref>). Data subjected to regression analysis revealed a linear accumulation of PC in all treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013211427794">Figure 3</xref>). EaF presented the lowest slope compared to TBHQ and the other treatments indicative of low accumulation of PC in the soybean oil. Thus, EaF at 200 ppm is capable of protecting soybean oil against oxidation during frying under the tested conditions.

In the score plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013211427794">Figure 4</xref>(a)) three clusters are observed and encircled. In the correlation loading plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013211427794">Figure 4</xref>(b)) it is observed that the content of conjugated dienes and trienes is positively and highly correlated to the frying batch as expected and to the treatments encircled in the left part of the score plot which did not include EaF. A cluster was formed with almost all treatments concerning EaF at different frying batches and the TBHQ treatment up to frying batch 4 (middle circle), demonstrating the efficiency of EaF against oil oxidation during frying compared to the other treatments. The FFA accumulation for the EaF treatment remained relatively unaltered during the frying process, while for the other treatments slight FFA reductions were observed. FFA are formed in large quantities as a result of hydrolysis, pyrolysis and oxidation, due to free radical formation and cleavage of double bonds during frying promoted by the presence of food moisture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211427794">Paul and Mittal, 1997</xref>). Some researchers consider FFA as a good measure of the quality of the frying oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013211427794">Lin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013211427794">Plessis and Meredith, 1999</xref>) but others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211427794">Paul and Mittal, 1997</xref>) have questioned FFA to monitor oil degradation since they are moderately volatile and an unknown amount is lost during heating. On the other hand, oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids is accompanied by an increase in the UV absorption of the product. The absorbances at 232 nm (conjugated dienes, CD) mainly depends on the primary oxidation step and is correlated with PV, while, absorbances at 268 nm (conjugated trienes, CT) is related to the presence of some secondary oxidation compounds particularly those containing a carbonyl functional group such as aldehydes and ketones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211427794">Besbes et al., 2005</xref>).

<sec id="sec17-1082013211427794"><title>DSC monitoring of soybean oxidative stability</title>
<p>The antioxidant potential of mashua EaF against oxidation of soybean oil was validated by an alternative accelerated method such as DSC. DSC has been recommended as an appropriate and objective method for assessing the oxidative stability of edible oils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013211427794">Tan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013211427794">Velasco et al., 2004</xref>). Oxidation is an exothermic process and the undergoing heat reaction makes it possible to use DSC. This reaction produces isothermal mode traces, where, first the curve proceeds very slowly until a rapid exothermic reaction happens. This point corresponds to a sudden increase in the oxidative rate. The time required to reach this end point is known as induction period (IP). Thus, prolonged induction times are indicative of high stability against lipid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211427794">Silva et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013211427794">Velasco et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The protective effects of EaF at 100, 200, 300 and 400 ppm, BHT and TBHQ at 200 ppm and a control (without antioxidant) were evaluated using DSC at 140 °C and under saturated oxygen conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1082013211427794">Figure 5</xref>). At 200 ppm, IP values of 36.7, 35.0, 50.0 and 46.8 min were obtained for the control, BHT, EaF and TBHQ treatments, respectively. Thus, EaF showed better protective effects than BHT and TBHQ. EaF at concentrations from 100 to 400 ppm exhibited a dose-dependent trend with respect to IP during soybean oil oxidation. A polynomial equation was found to describe this relationship (IP = −6 × 10<sup>−5</sup> concentration<sup>2</sup> (ppm) + 0.0749 concentration (ppm) + 34.236); (<italic>r</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.999). By extrapolation, it can be predicted that increasing the concentration of EaF ≥ 400 ppm would result in only a slight improvement in terms of antioxidant protection. Other studies on vegetable oils and fats have evidenced analogous trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013211427794">Kouri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211427794">Litwinienko et al., 1997</xref>). In order to prove the validity of the mathematical model, the EaF concentration that ensures equal protection to TBHQ (200 ppm) was calculated. This concentration is equal to 269.7 ppm and the value obtained from DSC is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1082013211427794">Figure 6</xref>. Thus the model was properly adjusted.

<p>All the data presented together during the storage and frying experiments indicate that mashua EaF possesses compounds with very interesting antioxidant properties protecting soybean oil against oxidative damage. Probably, the protective effects demonstrated by EaF are related to its high flavan 3-ol contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211427794">Chirinos et al., 2008a</xref>).</p>

<p>This study provides strong evidence about the antioxidant potential of mashua polyphenols against soybean oil oxidation during accelerated storage and frying. The performance of mashua polyphenols was almost equal or even better than the results obtained with synthetic antioxidants such as BHT and TBHQ. The extraction with ethyl acetate appeared as the most convenient solvent for recovery of phenolics antioxidants that can be easily incorporated in oils and protect against oxidation. The production of mashua extracts and its use as potential natural antioxidants and food preservative could economically benefit the native Andean population where the tuber is extensively cultivated. In addition, we have demonstrated the suitability of using DSC as an orthogonal technique to validate our results in terms of assessment of the stability of soybean oil oxidation when mashua phenolics are incorporated.</p>
