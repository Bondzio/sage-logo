<abstract>
<p>Recognition of the importance of autopoiesis to biological systems was crucial in building an alternative to the classic view of cognitive science. However, concepts like structural coupling and autonomy are not strong enough to throw light on language and human problem solving. The argument is presented though a case study where a person solves a problem and, in so doing relies on non-local aspects of the ecology as well as his observer’s mental domain. Like Anthony Chemero we make links with ecological psychology to emphasize how embodiment draws on cultural resources as people concert thinking, action and perception. We trace this to human interactivity or sense-saturated coordination that renders possible language and human forms of cognition: it links human sense-making to historical experience. People play roles with natural and cultural artifacts as they act, animate groups and live through relationships drawing on language that is, at once, artificial and natural. Thus, while constrained by wordings, interactivity is able to fine-tune what we do with action-perception loops. Neither language nor human problem solving reduce to biological sense-making.</p>

<title>1 The setting</title>
<p>Recognition of autopoiesis in biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059712313482804">Varela, Maturana, &amp; Uribe, 1974</xref>) opened up an alternative to classic cognitive science. In approaching human cognition, however, we are wary of derived concepts such as <italic>sense-making</italic> or <italic>autonomy</italic>. While allowing world-side complexity, for some purposes, such constructs overemphasize an observer’s coupling with an observed world. This matters in species whose activity unfolds under a degree of collective control. Humans, for example, enact history without any awareness. They do so by coordinating in a social world as they undertake projects, play roles, serve organizations and evoke the potential of verbal, material and institutional resources. In stressing the environment’s affordance-potential, like Anthony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059712313482804">Chemero (2009)</xref>, we seek to connect enactivist views with work in ecological psychology. We do so with reference to a case study. In the paper’s core, we scrutinize how a person uses embodiment in a transformation problem. As he concerts thinking, action and perception, we stress the importance of historical or non-local resources. Using repetitions, these serve to take the measure of his own unfolding action-perception. This extends sense-making: events depend on interactivity or sense-saturated coordination that, we claim, grounds human cognition.</p>
<p>Tracing human languaging to embodiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059712313482804">Maturana (1988)</xref> grants that phenomenology enables <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> to access a ‘consensual domain’. Cognitive dynamics thus enact a partly consensual, or shared, social world. The approach resembles Thomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059712313482804">Reid’s (1983)</xref> 18th-century view that habit and custom connect artificial and natural language. By socializing perception, he argues, language exerts ‘a natural kind of magic’. People use nature and cultural artifacts as they act, animate groups and live social relations. In current terms, this gives rise to interactivity or ‘mutually choreographed activity’ whereby ‘agents mutually align their behaviors with cultural patterns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059712313482804">Thibault, 2011</xref>, p. 236). Accordingly, we turn to the co-function of ‘artificial’ and ‘natural’ aspects of language. In solution probing, bodily coordination connects speech and action. Turning from minds and brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059712313482804">Varela, Thompson, &amp; Rosch, 1991</xref>), we stress that human embodiment allows social meshworks to self-organize as people repeatedly reconnect non-local patterns. Although focusing on a single example of ‘thinking’ (i.e., finding a solution to a problem), we claim that interactivity is ubiquitous. Since it is enriched by wordings and non-local resources (custom), it prompts people to act and attune in a social world. Though sense-making is necessary to language, its power is not sufficient to engender even everyday human activity (e.g., caregiver–infant interaction, organized games, language).</p>

<title>2 Whole-body activity</title>
<p>Even today, many think that inner minds represent the world and set off ‘processing’ of verbal content. Language is identified with word-strings that are cranked out by a system that codes propositional attitudes. While not our aim to contribute to the literature against representationalism, we too reject such views. In turning to embodiment, however, our main concern is with how functional coordination is extended by what the folk call ‘thinking’. In a case study of how one person tackles the river problem, we show the importance of a normative dimension and frozen patterns of behaviour. The person concerned monitors his doings, evaluates them and tracks what he discovers. As human agents manage embodiment they make extensive use of cultural or systemic resources in tasks as diverse as, writing a paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059712313482804">Menary, 2007</xref>), deciding to trust a computer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059712313482804">Ben-Naim et al., 2010</xref>) or seeking an invoice number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059712313482804">Steffensen, 2013</xref>). While ‘effective, embodied action’ in the world ‘actually constitutes an agent’s perception’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059712313482804">Stewart, Gapenne, &amp; Di Paolo, 2010</xref>, p. 7), we do not think this coupling is sufficient to explain actions by individual members of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic>. Unlike most social mammals (and other primates), humans also use cultural resources that reconfigure body-based intelligence.</p>
<p>Language is often viewed as separable from perception and vocal and visible gesture. It is treated as semiotic, symbolic or amodal; this builds on a view presented by Aristotle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059712313482804">Harris, 1996</xref>). Given the importance that has since been ascribed to propositions, language is often reduced to inscription-like entities (‘linguistic forms’). Once separated from bodies, people, affect and the environment, many attribute language to systems that allegedly process ‘forms’. In Per Linell’s terms, they fall foul of written language bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059712313482804">Linell, 2005</xref>) or, in those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059712313482804">Roy Harris (1981)</xref>, they adopt the language myth. Speech sounds and written marks become instances <italic>of</italic> something (words, linguistic patterns and content). Language and thought are ripped away from place and time when forms are treated as ‘like’ word strings. When seen as indices of knowledge – when identified with invariant tokens – linguistic forms become ‘vehicles’ of (mental) content. In turn, such views sustain conduit views that trace communication to knowledge of verbal units (‘words’ or ‘forms’). Today, form-based or ‘code views’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059712313482804">Love, 2004</xref>) are under attack. Many concur with Maturana that speech and writing belong to different cognitive domains or, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059712313482804">Kravchenko’s (2009)</xref> terms, texts and talk constitute ‘ontologically different phenomena’. Indeed, whereas marks have real-duration, talk is evanescent. Even if both can be <italic>analysed</italic> as usage-patterns, utterance-types, sentences etc., talking is embodied by living beings. Speech does not reduce to forms: transcription reveals, not the essence of language, but skills in identifying phonetic gestures. Furthermore, analysis masks its basis in coordinated movement (or languaging). Once this is acknowledged, language can be seen as public, dialogical and based on connecting situated activity with historical echoes. Far from reflecting amodal content, it extends embodiment as people use perceived wordings to coordinate actions in a partly shared social reality.</p>

<title>3 Coordination in language and thinking</title>
<p>In early psycholinguistic work, due attention was given to cognitive dynamics or gestures that induce physical change in time. Later, however, the focus shifted to ‘higher’ cognitive functions that were posited to be separate from speech, gesture and action. On the distributed view, however, language arises in bodily coordination. Its first-order aspect comes to be extended by perceiving verbal patterns or, in other terms, taking a language stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059712313482804">Cowley, 2011</xref>). People use language as part of action and perception and yet, at times, treat it if it <italic>really</italic> consisted in verbal units. It is central to the case study reported below that the protagonist shifts between using language as part of action and taking a language stance. By tracing language to coordinating functions, the view fits with Nikolay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059712313482804">Bernstein’s (1967)</xref> seminal work on physiology. He showed that, far from controlling single muscles, neurons connect up coordinative structures. In his terms, living systems use repetition without repetition; they generate synergies. Furthermore, Bernstein applied the logic to all cognitive activity. In spite of this, when sophisticated coordination (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059712313482804">Bullowa, 1979</xref>) was found to underpin mother–infant interaction, it was not seen as pro-linguistic. Instead of tracing <italic>intersubjectivity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059712313482804">Trevarthen, 1979</xref>) to cognitive events, its roots were sought in the infant’s brain. Thus, in emphasizing dynamics, we turn from intersubjectivity and its neural correlates to the normative, sense-saturated events of human coordination.</p>
<p>The dominance of input-output models ensures that, overlooking infant coordination, social interaction is often traced to turn-taking (Sacks, Schegloff, &amp; Jefferson, 1967). Although intended as a methodological tool, appeal to a mechanism presents ‘participants’ as agents who utter sequences of utterance-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059712313482804">Clark, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059712313482804">Pickering &amp; Garrod, 2004</xref>). Not only can this ‘save’ representationalism, but embodiment is marginalised as gesture, paralanguage, posture etc. In short, the microsociological view draws on written language bias. Recently, however, David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059712313482804">McNeill (1992)</xref> and Susan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059712313482804">Goldin-Meadow (2005)</xref> have re-embodied language by tying it to how people gesture about circumstances. Once body dynamics are part of language, its ontogeny can be traced to pro-language or intersubjective behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059712313482804">Cowley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059712313482804">Thibault, 2011</xref>). Intrinsic motivations arise as babies find their moves shaped by movements and gain skills in making and attending to verbal patterns. Far from reducing to forms, language is, at once dynamic and symbolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059712313482804">Rączaszek-Leonardi, 2009</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059712313482804">Love’s (2004)</xref> terms, first-order activity calls up second-order cultural constructs. The results are variously known as utterance-activity, public language-use or first-order languaging. More precisely, language becomes ‘whole-body sense-making activity that enables persons to engage with each other in forms of coaction and to integrate themselves with and to take part in social activities that may be performed either solo or together with other agents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059712313482804">Thibault, 2011</xref>, p. 216). In recognizing that sociocultural patterns enable movements to transcend situations, one moves beyond inscription-based models.</p>
<p>Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059712313482804">Turvey (1977)</xref> linked Bernstein’s work into ecological tradition by emphasizing synchronies and synergies. These occur motorically and, when coordinating, people learn. In experiments, they can prompt people to develop symbols even if the materials make this hard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059712313482804">Galantucci, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, coordination can stand in for conventions: without knowing how, people can develop analysis amenable procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059712313482804">Mills, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, emergent procedures allow dyads to surpass individual performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059712313482804">Fusaroli et al., 2012</xref>). Emphasis on a history of coordination connects ecological and enactivist views. To accommodate phenomenology, however, the enactivist turns away from functional coordination. Instead, appeal is made to sense-making that arises from how mind and interaction self-organize as organisms come to construct their individual worlds. Early work treated the physical world as a medium whose perturbances set off change in an organizationally closed system. Then, anticipating a social turn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059712313482804">Di Paolo (2005)</xref> argued that autonomy depends on self-maintenance that is also adaptive: bodies find new uses for a medium. Later, participatory sense-making was traced to emergent patterns that enslave a dyad’s actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059712313482804">De Jaegher &amp; Di Paolo, 2007</xref>). This prompts both internal self-organization and learning. Evidence that humans exploit such processes is found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059712313482804">Auvray, Lenay, and Stewart’s (2009)</xref> work on perceptual crossing where people learn to discriminate between three identical stimuli. Without realizing, parties are attracted to certain patterns – they tend to select the stimulus manipulated by another person. Interaction thus shows autonomy and, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059712313482804">Di Paolo, Rohde, and De Jaegher (2010)</xref>, this allows agents to modulate their detachment from events. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059712313482804">Froese’s (2012)</xref> terms, human intelligence has another ‘level’ of organization. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059712313482804">Shanon (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059712313482804">Bottineau (2010)</xref>, he treats ‘language’ (verbal techniques) as sense-making about sense-making. In short, the medium of action becomes a ‘source of creativity’ that sets off second-order participatory sense-making.</p>
<p>Creativity is ascribed to how interindividual sense-making shapes emergent behaviour, adaptivity and learning. While crucial in simpler creatures, it is striking that humans also develop remarkable skills in teasing out hidden affordance potentials. Rather than focus a putative consensual domain of organism–medium coupling, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059712313482804">Järvilehto (1998)</xref>, we ask how an organism/environment system achieves results. In so doing, we do not challenge enactivism; rather, we stress that human intelligence arises in a history of becoming within a social reality. Furthermore, we find parallels with how computers have evolved to fit our biases. As shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059712313482804">Kirsh and Maglio’s (1994)</xref> seminal work, Tetris players ‘think’ by coordinating in a rapid or pico-scales.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1059712313482804">1</xref></sup> Skilled computer users discover norms by coordinating with a computer medium whose affordance potential is partly uncovered by an expert. Humans rely on interactivity to react to the machine’s reactions and, thus, learn <italic>about</italic> relations. While using adaptivity, learning and strategy building, much depends on a program. This lies outside the observer’s world and, so, what they do is irreducible to sense-making. Unexpected results often trigger judgements whose affective valence prompts perseverance or, indeed, changes in strategy. People synergize. In HCI, interactivity is sense-saturated coordination that shapes systemic function (namely of a human–computer system). Below, we pursue a similar ‘progressive perception-action loop’, where parts of a system continually ‘mutually specify’ each other in co-implicational relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059712313482804">Brinck &amp; Lijenfors, 2012</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1059712313482804">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>4 Sense-saturated coordination</title>
<p>Tracing language to interactivity overthrows written language basis. Pursuing sense-saturated coordination, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059712313482804">Steffensen (2013)</xref> offers a case study of how two people solve the problem of completing an invoice by finding the (legally required) CVR number. In so doing, each relies on the other they also enough, to sustain shared focus on the problem (and its importance). They constitute a distributed cognitive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059712313482804">Steffensen, 2013</xref>): from this perspective, solution probing can be seen as part of problem solving. Specifically, it arises as an action trajectory leads to synergies. The problem’s solution becomes a change the layout of affordances that is recognized as such. It turns on what is called an event-pivot whose microgenesis can be traced across the <italic>event trajectory</italic> shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059712313482804">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1059712313482804-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Looking for the invoice takes about 20 minutes and, for most of the time, is dominated by a fixation bias arising from how the problem is framed (i.e., looking for a code). Frustration mounts during vain efforts to find the number – accompanied by near verbatim repetitions of the problem. After several cycles, a reframing point emerges: one party defines the problem within the problem. Shifting from <italic>the invoice sender’s</italic> perspective, ‘Black’ adopts that of the receiver. He says (original in Danish):<disp-quote>
<p>hvis det var ‘mig  |  så røg den ‘bare  |  hen i ‘stakken</p>
<p>‘if it were me’  |  ‘then it just went’  |  ‘in the pile’</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Giving the utterance a theatrical rendering, Black throws the document into the air and catches while his actions use syllable prominence ‘<italic>mig</italic> ([‘ma<sc>i</sc>], ‘me’), ‘<italic>bare</italic> ([‘bɑːɑ], ‘just’) and ‘<italic>stakken</italic> ([‘sɑdgŋ], ‘the pile’) as a Zeitgeber. In Steffensen’s terms:<disp-quote>
<p>As Black starts his utterance, he is holding the invoice in front of him in his left hand. As he starts on his first intonational group, Black makes a slight upward movement in his right hand; then, he lets go of the paper, and catches it again, app. 3–4 cm closer to the table. The movement is <italic>perfectly synchronised</italic> with the prosodic pattern: the upward movement co-occurs with the first syllable of the utterance, <italic>hvis</italic> (‘if’), and the catch of the paper is perfectly synchronised with the prominent syllable <italic>mig</italic>, spoken as his thumb touches the paper (130 ms into a stressed syllable that lasts 200 ms) just as his voice begins to fall away … Quite literally, he receives (catches) the invoice at <italic>exactly the same time</italic> as he utters the deictic <italic>mig</italic> (‘me’).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This dramatization prompts his conversation partner (‘White’) to ‘see’ that the receiver would receive the document on headed paper. As such, the CPR number would be printed under the company logo. In fact, there is no problem! In short, their difficulties arose from printing on plain paper. This is the event pivot: afterwards, the parties gradually realize that they have solved the problem. Interactivity and close attention to each other’s doings shape the trajectory. Far from relying on goals and plans, the parties use solution probing. They solve the problem without knowing what they are doing – they rely on integrating aspects of the said with finely coordinated activity.</p>

<title>5 Back to the lab</title>
<p>In modelling <italic>Homo economicus</italic>, Herbert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059712313482804">Simon (1959)</xref> viewed problem solving as a behavioural process. Like von Neumann machines, people were taken to use algorithms to search an abstract search space. Solutions were traced to hypothetical processes and mechanisms. The approach permits predictions about heuristics, likely mistakes and what stands in for thinking ahead. While one of the triumphs of cognitive psychology, the approach highlights ‘well-defined problems’ or cases where people do not face the unexpected. In another tradition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059712313482804">Hutchins (1983)</xref> found that Micronesian navigation use what Westerners see as exotic beliefs in floating islands. Yet, coupled with using sea, sky and stars, the beliefs sustain truly remarkable navigational feats. In the US navy, such myths are not used by a crew who use technology to navigate into port (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059712313482804">Hutchins, 1995</xref>). On this distributed view, using machines to solve problems differs from practical approaches. Rather as <italic>Homo economicus</italic> is unlike a rational agent, real-problem solvers contrast with algorithmic systems. People use interactivity and external resources to solve, for example, mathematical problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059712313482804">Kirsh, 2009</xref>). Given rich resources, they improve performance in, say, the cheap necklace problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059712313482804">Fioratou and Cowley, 2009</xref>) or finding words in scrabble tiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1059712313482804">Vallée-Tourangeau &amp; Wrightman, 2010</xref>). Material resources also alter perseverance effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059712313482804">Vallée-Tourangeau, Euden, &amp; Hearn, 2011</xref>) and transform Bayesian reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059712313482804">Villejoubert &amp; Vallée-Tourangeau, 2011</xref>). Since embodiment has a functional role in ‘thinking’, there is much to recommend giving attention to how people do solution probing.</p>

<title>6 Introducing the river problem</title>
<p>The river problem is well known in cognitive psychology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059712313482804">Jeffries et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059712313482804">Knowles &amp; Delaney, 2005</xref>). It has various names (e.g., missionaries and cannibals, hobbits and orcs) and will be familiar to many. Participants are told a story in which they are responsible for a boat and six parties (here three pongos (Ps) and three air cadets (As)) who want to cross a river. In working out how to do it, they have to remember that only two parties fit into the raft at any time and that, during a crossing, one person must row the raft. A complication arises in that pongos must not outnumber cadets because, if they do, they will attack (and the solver will fail). In the version used in the case study, a solution can be reached in 11 moves: (I) send over either P/A or PP; (II) leave P (bringing back A or P); (III) send over AP; (IV) bring back A; (V) send over AA; (VI) bring back AP; (VII) send AA; (VIII) bring back P; (IX) send over PP; (X) bring back P; and (XI) send over PP. While based on the standard task, in what is reported below, we focus on – not problem solving – but one person’s solution probing and, especially, events before V–VI.</p>
<p>Our focus is on <italic>how</italic> successful participants use the available resources. In work reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059712313482804">Nash (2012)</xref>, the task was undertaken in a 2×2 between subjects design. In one condition, air cadets who had been through a basic leadership programme and, in the other, they were about to do so. The groups were split between a pen-and-paper condition and one that used a <italic>papier maché</italic> model, raft and toy soldiers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059712313482804">Figure 2</xref>). In all cases, their officer corrected mistakes – and participants were informed that they would receive no help with the task. This was combined our interest in the use of external resources (including people) with military emphasis on independent decision making. Given a qualitative focus, participants had only 5 minutes to complete. No instructions were given as to how the task should be undertaken and no mention was made of whether they should talk about what they were doing. Given time constraints, only five of the 38 participants found a solution: of these, all were from the leadership group who used the physical model (see Figure 2 above). Next, therefore, we focus on how one cadet, Billy, probes for solutions. We focus on Billy, first, because he was one of the five solvers. Second, right from the start, he talked aloud about what he was doing.</p>

<title>7 Cadets and pongos</title>
<p>Billy sets out by coming to terms with the puzzle’s opportunities and limits. Like his fellow cadets, he uses his errors to learn as he acts. For space reasons, we leave aside the first 3 minutes to focus on what is, analytically, a key moment. This occurs at ‘reality checkpoint’, just before moves V–VI. The challenge is that, at this point, the participant must ‘think two steps ahead’. He must see both that he can send over two cadets and <italic>also</italic> that one can come back with a pongo. Not only do the associated difficulties induce many cadets to restart but, to find a solution, Billy must break the pattern of ‘bringing one back’. First, however, we sketch how his understanding develops. Analysis begins when, in line with procedure, Billy is told that 2 minutes are left. The speech is transcribed in tone-units (bursts). Silences of over 5 seconds are marked as #####. The announcement that he has 2 minutes left is placed in a separate column. Speech-bursts are numbered.</p>

<title>8 Thinking as solution probing</title>
<p>On the folk view, transcription offers a window on the mind. Like Micronesian floating islands, the view is useful because, in the first place, it permits human reasoning (behaviour) to be contrasted with logic and/or computation. One can thus pinpoint imperfection and biases in Billy’s reasoning: for example, he repeats himself and fails to ‘see’ certain possibilities. Second, like the myth of floating islands, belief in the external expression of inner thoughts has functional value. In spite of 3 minutes of failure, Billy uses verbalization in 7–12 to bring about new understanding. However this is explained, it alters the course of events by making explicit how the situation is for him. After move IV, two pongos are on the far bank and the raft is on his side of the river. This permits reasoning, which, while not framed as an academic text, suggests the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1059712313482804" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>(6–7) If he takes a cadet over, his guys will be outnumbered on this bank.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(8–9) If he takes a pongo over, his guys will be outnumbered on that bank</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(10–11) If he takes two cadets over, they will be outnumbered as soon as one brings the raft back.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This is consistent with what he does later and is correct.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1059712313482804">3</xref></sup> Like computer output, his speech gives him some detachment from the situation. It relates what he has just experienced to a culturally derived procedure that can be understood as updating working memory. Having ruled out alternatives, he ‘moves on’. Crucially, this constrains up-coming action. Much is gained, at times, from treating speech as a window on the mind. However, what comes next is quite different – it depends heavily on interactivity.</p>
<p>Without acting (or drawing a conclusion), Billy re-immerses himself in the situation. He exploits action-perception while, in 12–13, repeating what was said in 10–11. In 14, he blurts, ‘Pongo come back’. Unless traced to interactivity, this is ‘out of the blue’. Furthermore, if construed as akin to ‘I could take my two cadets over and a pongo can come back’ (evidence is offered for this interpretation), it resembles an insight. Far from ‘following’, it arises <italic>without</italic> stating that he can take two cadets over or recognizing that the ‘reasoning’ of (c) mistakenly assumes that no-one can be placed on the raft (in fact, this must be done). However, Billy shows no sign of noticing his quasi-insight and, worse, proceeds to verbalize-and-enact what can be done (in 15ff. and VIII–XI). After all, if he had grasped his own thought, there would be no reason to think it all over again. Next, therefore, we turn to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059712313482804">Steffensen’s (2013)</xref> analysis of a related cognitive event.</p>
<p>Steffensen illustrates a case where a problem is solved by a distributed system consisting of two people and the paraphernalia of an office. Early on, the system senses a problem, which, over time, is defined and, later, solved. The trajectory features both an event pivot (when what will be the solution emerges) and, before this, reframing that effectively engenders a solution. For Billy, the (unnoticed) ‘insight’ (14) is the event pivot (which prefigures VIII–XI). The pre-pivot appears when he ‘gets to’ the problem’s core (in 10–11). This matters because, at noted, the low solution rate is largely due to the fact that, at this point, most participants choose to restart. Billy, however, stops, vocalizes and falls silent: silence both precedes and follows the pre-pivot. Finally, though without parallel in Steffensen’s office, the previous utterance pairs (6–7 and 8–9) serve as the shell from which the event-pivot emerges. The events can be understood in relation to the trajectory shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1059712313482804">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>As a distributed system enacts an event trajectory, people move, monitor progress and probe for solutions. Ceasing to be a window to the mind, transcription becomes a poor record of whole-body activity. It is of value, however, to pick out the framing (italics), reframing (bold), the approximate timing of the end of each speech-burst (given in seconds) and the event-pivot (underlined italics).</p>
<graphic id="img1-1059712313482804" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1059712313482804-img1.tif"/>
<p>Taken as a record of the system’s trajectory, the officer’s interruption galvanizes Billy (7–10). Indeed, in 5, Billy has lost concentration (he knocks a piece over) – perhaps this reminds the officer to check the time. Hearing he has 2 minutes, Billy straightens up both his body and the raft (or equipment). In what may be a matter of behaving responsibly (or saving face), Billy proceeds by verbalizing what he has (half) grasped. Using his focus of attention (i.e., the raft on this side of the river), in 7–8, he sees that taking a cadet away will lead to the remaining one being outnumbered. Then, switching the model from one hand to the other, he enacts taking a pongo over and stops while pointing to where the cadets would be outnumbered (9–10). Meanwhile he looks at the near bank. By making explicit that taking a single party over gains him nothing, he has taken stock.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1059712313482804">4</xref></sup> Thus far, nothing new. Strikingly, this framing is followed by a remarkably long pause that lasts over 5 seconds.</p>
<p>He now reframes the problem. Though repeating what he said, Billy’s attention turns to perceiving and acting. (Gaze allows him to <italic>see</italic> that that just as sending one pongo over would lead to the cadets being outnumbered, they would also be outnumbered if he sent two over.) In 11 he articulates the only option for moving forwards, ‘If I take my two air cadets across’ – as he does so, he puts the pongo down, places air cadets on the raft, looks at the officer twice (just as he does when, in fact he finds the solution) and begins to move the raft. Without shifting gaze, his face puckers, and, muttering ‘he’s outnumbered there’, he makes a disgusted expression. Although the analyst-observer identifies this as a crucial reframing, it does not feel that way to Billy. He cannot possibly know that he has discovered the core of the problem – rather than repeat the pattern of sailing two figures across and leaving one behind (as in moves I–II and III- IV), he must change strategy (in V–VI). He has reduced the possibility space and, of course, resisted any temptation to give up. His concentrated expression suggests that he feels that taking two cadets across offers little. Unbeknownst to him, he has eliminated all possibilities bar one. Although unsaid, just because cadets cross in the raft, there is no reason for it to carry only cadets on the return. Without making this explicit, Billy advances by integrating perceiving, acting and speaking.</p>
<p>Instead of being overwhelmed (or starting over), Billy faces up to the reality checkpoint. He puckers his lips and places his tongue in front of his lower teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1059712313482804">Figure 4</xref>) in a display (and, perhaps, a reminder) of motivation.</p>

</fig>
<p>Billy looks at the bank on his left and moves his hand away from where the raft is. As nothing new is visible, he seeks affordance potential in the two visible pongos. Next, his gaze returns to the raft as he falls motionless. Having remained still during the silence, he then looks back across the river, stops, and then back at the raft. As he does so, he readies his hand to take up a toy soldier: however, he does not. Rather, saying, ‘Cadet goes over’, his hand serves a proxy for acting in synchrony with, ‘comes back, he’s outnumbered’. As he does so, he shows a hint of a smile – as if having saved the cadet from the pongos. While a repetition of 11–12 (as suggested by the abbreviated form of ‘cadet goes over’), he checks that the situation is indeed as verbalized. This repetition is not mere repetition because it is contextualized by actively perceiving the world. Without being explicit, he grasps that has to do something different with the two cadets (6–10) (i.e., take one man over and bring a pongo back). Knowing that there is something more gives rise to silence and stillness (for 1600 ms) as he gazes at the two pongos on the far bank (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1059712313482804">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In 15, as he sees the other possibility, the pivot-event co-occurs with a striking hand movement. As his hand moves the direction of the far bank, he suddenly reverses the movement in synchrony with blurting out ‘pongo come back’. In a phonetic transcription, one might transcribe a low head, falling tone on the prominent ‘pon’ syllable and slight fall on the tail.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1059712313482804">5</xref></sup> This is shown on the transcription below:</p>

<p>However, what is most striking is how it balances ‘cadet goes over’ (spoken with a high head) and the lack of stress on ‘come’ that in an utterance whose rapidity is synchronized with movement shown by the blurring of his left hand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1059712313482804">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Though Billy does not yet realize it, he has the solution. Just as in the case reported by Steffensen, only in moments following its discovery, does it sink in. Billy senses this: just as when he mistakenly thought he had the solution (before the 3-minute mark), he glances at the officer for confirmation. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1059712313482804">Figure 7</xref>.</p>

<p>Although showing no sign of realizing that he has solved the problem, Billy anticipates that he may be on track. When his commanding officer gives nothing away, he chooses to enact taking the raft across with his two men on board (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1059712313482804">Figure 5</xref>) and bringing back a pongo who crosses twice as he collects the rest of the party. Had the pivot event been a textbook ‘insight’ (a Eureka moment), such a move would be unnecessary. Close observation of his body during utterances 16–20 show no smile at all – just a slight relaxation of his finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1059712313482804">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Rather as in grasping that he has understood the problem, he slowly realizes that he has the correct solution (in VIII–XI). He speaks faster and, by the time he says (in 19) ‘who gets back’, his action aligns the model-world to his understanding. Though not yet certain of the solution (taking two air cadets over, sending a pongo back with one and then using pongos to transport the rest of the group) recognition dawns as he smiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1059712313482804">Figure 9</xref>). He is rewarded by a ‘well done’ from the officer that elicits hand rubbing – a public display of achievement.</p>

<title>9 Towards a systemic view</title>
<p>Though Billy’s doings can be described in terms of heuristics, errors and lack of forward planning, algorithm-based models leave aside details of behaviour. Specifically, they do not show how Billy identifies a decision point (before move VII–VIII) and, later, finds a way of going on (in and after move VIII). It is our contention that this kind of behaviour is less amenable to description in terms of concepts like sense-making and autonomy than with respect to human interactivity. Billy’s actions depend on how he manages a distributed system by modulating his own body–world coupling. At moments, he is a more autonomous; at others, he is intensely engaged with the model. Solution probing exploits these shifts. During the ‘framing’ of 7–10, he grasps his own understanding or, in other terms, publicly reformats experience. He uses non-local resources (e.g., denotata and hypothetical thinking) to step back from action. Immediately afterwards, before the quasi-insight (15), he re-engages by using looking to seek affordance potential. In switching, he connects feeling, normative patterns and whole-body coordination. Interactivity is sense-saturated both phenomenologically and in enabling a person to use circumstances to evoke non-local patterns (i.e., aspects of what the folk call ‘meaning’).</p>
<p>Much seems to co-occur with detaching /being immersed in events. However, these shifts quite clearly depend on linking sense-making with the said and imagined by using (among other things) repetitions without repetition. This is especially clear at the event-pivot when Billy blurts out ‘pongo come back’. Between his first framing and his gradual recognition that this is indeed (a possible) solution, it is possible tentatively to identify six cycles of repetition:</p>
<list id="list2-1059712313482804" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In framing (6–10), Billy repeats what he learned so far.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In reframing (11–12), Billy repeats what active perception shows – that he must move two cadets over.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In setting up the pivot-event (13–14), Billy repeats what he has just said.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Active perception prompts him to say ‘pongo come back’ (15) and to repeat (or at least reformat) what he sees.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>While saying 16–24, his actions repeat what he has just said.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Uttering 16–24 makes explicit and, in one sense, repeats what (15) implies.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For a cognitivist, repetition or perseverance is redundant. Evidently Billy uses, not information processing but, rather, ways of shifting attention between the perceived, the said and the results of real and imagined actions. In connecting enactivist and ecological perspectives, we stress that Billy’s sense-making is constantly being monitored with respect to the setting’s affordance potentials. Sense-saturated coordination links the felt with the normative as he acts (and enacts a world). Furthermore, as he does so, language, logic and working memory play out through him. His embodiment depends on bidirectional coupling that links him with both the invariances of the setting and his experience with the slow dynamics of culture and logic. Eventually, Billy discovers the <italic>only</italic> possible legal moves (VIII–IX). Accordingly, one must look beyond the observer and the observer’s world to the organism–environment system. Echoing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059712313482804">Brinck and Liljenfors (2012)</xref>, Billy draws co-implications from progressive action-perception loops. However, he depends less on mutual influence with the other (the officer) than monitoring his own interactivity in ways that allow him to adjust his own speech, action and feelings. In contrast to participatory sense-making, this is not a matter of being enslaved by an emergent pattern but, rather, one of using the invisible logic of material and cultural resources. Seeking something, during utterances 7–10 he authors hypothetical thoughts; he partially detaches from the situation.</p>
<p>At reality checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1059712313482804">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1059712313482804">4</xref>), he is at his most autonomous. He uses his immediate experience (and errors) to verbalize his understanding in hypothetical thinking. At this moment, Billy gives sustained attention to the words that that he is speaking and, using what is said updates working memory. He assimilates just-completed activity (the first 3 minutes) with experience that dimly echoes propositional logic. There is no need for precision – skilled procedures allow him to soak up implications of the said. By taking a language stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059712313482804">Cowley, 2011</xref>), he ‘changes’ the situation. Perhaps this is what Froese calls the higher ‘level’ that permits sense-making about sense-making. Now, having behaved in ways resembling a logical operator, Billy re-immerses himself in the flow of events. It is close attention to the world – and, no doubt, silent thinking – that prompts the pseudo-insight (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1059712313482804">Figures 5</xref>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1059712313482804"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1059712313482804">7</xref>). Broadly, it is by shifting between roles that Billy plays the responsible air cadet. His performance meets shared standards of exploiting resources that spread culture across environments and technologies, formal patterns (e.g., wordings, numbers) and repetitions that bind individual habits into social expectations (e.g., customs and practices). In ecological terms, Billy links his ability to perceive invariances with skills in rooting out the affordance potentials of the material and social setting often, these belong to a world that lies beyond observation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1059712313482804">
<title>10 Learning from solution probing</title>
<p>While resolving nothing about human problem solving, the case study shows quite clearly that Billy is no <italic>Homo economicus</italic>. Of course, Herbert Simon would agree. Algorithmic models were never meant to capture activity by individual living beings. Our case is only that well-defined problems depend on more than heuristics, search, errors and lack of forward planning. Indeed, the advantage of focusing on solution probing is that it draws on, not the naked brain, but how a person’s whole-body intelligence emerges in engaging with material and social resources. It depends on an organism–environment system or, in folk terms, lived experience of a changing situation. The importance of the person appears, above all, in how the concrete problem space is used to come up with ways of prodding, probing and imagining its affordance potential. Early on, Billy uses the language stance and hypothetical thinking. Later, he turns to repetition and reformatting to uncover the situation’s logic. Third, though not our focus, Billy realizes that he has a solution by entwining what is said and done with the sense of ‘pongo come back’. The solution arises in enacting a kind of narrative.</p>
<p>The distributed view of language traces human behaviour to interactivity. Unlike models of thinking based on appeal to forms, what we do, feel and say unites the normative with a moment’s affordance-potential. Where wordings are spoken, perceived or imagined, cultural history plays out through a person. Belief that words are anchored to mental representations thus parallels Micronesian belief in floating islands. Just as islands are <italic>really</italic> connected to the earth’s crust, verbal patterns <italic>actually</italic> float in a sea of multi-scalar dynamics. Furthermore, like belief in floating islands, treating words as anchors allows people to mimic computational systems (briefly). This is done by entwining interactivity into strategic use of local practices. It is through skills in moving into and away from the language stance that Billy gains from immersing himself in the setting and, then, using wordings, taking a step back. Given the dual ontology of language, cognition extends beyond the continuous process of sense-making. Billy’s embodiment enables him to draw on traditions and learned procedures. While his own experience matters, he also draws on other people’s: he mimics them when he takes the language stance or imagines being attacked by pongos. This, indeed, is why he pays close attention to what he (and his officer) actually say while carefully using other non-local resources. By so doing, he places himself in history: he acts as a Royal Air Force cadet, uses artifacts and institutions – and, in so doing, lives these roles and relationships. In Thomas Reid’s terms, this arises because human language is partly artificial. Second-order patterns (including ‘words’) connect habits with institutional and material constructs. As a result of the education of attention, artificial ways of thinking extend human embodiment. Systemic resources resemble a Tetris program whose functions appear in forms of coordination that draw on repetition without repetition. We use interactivity that is normative and feelingful. Though not natural magic, hidden patterns act as attractors (or future causes) of sense-saturated coordination. Interactivity fills lives with feeling: both face-to-face and in the imagination, movements and wordings, ever so gradually, lead to the spread of socially shareable meanings.</p>

<p>Logically, he overlooks one possibility. Since, the raft is on the bank with two pongos and two cadets, he could, in principle, send the pongos over.

<bio>
<title>About the Author</title>
<p><bold>Stephen J. Cowley</bold> is Hans Christian Andersen guest professor at the University of Southern Denmark and a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Hertfordshire. Although his PhD was in linguistics, since 2000, he has lectured in psychology and cognitive science. His empirical work has focused on prosodic, verbal and kinematic interactions within families, between mothers and infants, with robots, and in medical simulations. He has a live interest in all forms of problem solving. He coordinates the Distributed Language Group, a community that aim to transform the language sciences by refocusing attention on how directed, dialogical activity imbues human intelligence with a collective dimension. He has published over 60 academic papers and has recently been responsible for edited volumes entitled, <italic>Distributed language</italic> (Benjamins, 2011) and, with F. Vallée-Tourangeau, <italic>Cognition beyond the brain: Computation, interactivity and human artifice</italic> (Springer, 2013).</p>
<p><bold>Luarina Nash</bold> is a graduate in psychology from the University of Hertfordshire. She is also an adult volunteer in the Air Training Corps and holds the rank of sergeant. Her special interest is in distributed cognition and how this can be used in the real world. She is currently a senior support worker who helps with young adults with diagnoses of autism and mental health disorders.</p>
