<abstract>
<p>The promise of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines rests with the ability to promote widespread uptake especially among populations at high risk of cervical cancer and other associated disease outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine health beliefs and culturally specific influences of HPV vaccine acceptability among African American college females. Approximately 76 percent of participants reported HPV vaccine acceptability. Predictors of acceptability included: higher perceived benefit and lower racial pride. Findings can be used to inform development of campus-based HPV educational approaches to promote widespread HPV vaccine acceptability and safer sex practices among African American college females.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the USA, genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) with 6.2 million new cases occurring yearly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311412833">Weinstock et al., 2004</xref>). The highest rate of HPV infection is found in college-aged women 20–24 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311412833">Dunne et al., 2007</xref>). African American compared to Caucasian American women have a higher prevalence of HPV infection (39.2% vs 24.2%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311412833">Dunne et al., 2007</xref>). As such, African American women are at greater risk of developing HPV-associated diseases such as cervical cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311412833">Altekruse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311412833">Dunne et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, high-risk (cancer-causing) types of HPV have been identified as the primary cause of cervical cancer and linked to other anogenital cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311412833">Parkin, 2006</xref>). Currently, two HPV vaccines are clinically available to women aged 9–26 to protect against high-risk types of HPV associated with 70 percent of cervical cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311412833">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311412833">2010a</xref>). HPV vaccines have the potential to substantially reduce racial, geographic, and economic disparities in cervical cancer incidence and morality if widespread vaccination is realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311412833">Harper, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105311412833">Pruitt and Schootman, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies have found that African American women are 19 to 21 percent less likely to receive at least one dose of the HPV vaccine and 16 percent less likely to complete the three-dose vaccine series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311412833">Chao et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311412833">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311412833">Dempsey et al., 2010</xref>). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found no racial differences in vaccine uptake, but found that African Americans compared to Caucasian Americans (23% vs 29%) were less likely to complete the full vaccine series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311412833">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010b</xref>). These data may suggest that even when health care access is constant across groups, disparities in HPV vaccine uptake and completion remain.</p>
<p>The reasons for emerging disparities in HPV vaccination are multi-faceted extending beyond access to care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311412833">Chao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311412833">Hsu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311412833">Toffolon-Weiss et al., 2008</xref>). Research suggests that health beliefs influence whether an individual will accept an HPV vaccine and undergo vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311412833">Hsu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311412833">Rosenthal et al., 2010</xref>). Such beliefs, real or perceived, are important components of public health initiatives promoting vaccination. Some evidence also suggests that distrust of government and the medical community serve as barriers to HPV vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311412833">Marlow et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311412833">Toffolon-Weiss et al., 2008</xref>). Largely, distrust is a construct historically rooted in the African American community and is important to consider when addressing barriers to health behavior engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311412833">Gamble, 1993</xref>). In addition to identifying barriers, it is equally important to focus on intrinsic cultural facilitators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311412833">Airhihenbuwa, 1995</xref>). Racial pride, a prominent cultural attitudinal characteristic, has been shown to enhance receptivity to, acceptance of, and salience of health promotion efforts targeting African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311412833">Landrine and Klonoff, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105311412833">Thompson, 1991</xref>). As such, racial pride, as a facilitator of behavior engagement, may prove beneficial in promoting HPV vaccination among African Americans.</p>
<p>HPV vaccine acceptability does not always lead to uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311412833">Gottlieb et al., 2009</xref>). However, determining the influence of sociocultural factors such as health beliefs, distrust, and racial pride is a first step in identifying a more meaningful set of factors that can be modified through intervention. To date, no published studies have focused on exploring predictors of HPV vaccine acceptability specifically among African American college students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311412833">Gerend and Maglorie’s (2008)</xref> study which included a predominantly (although not exclusive) African American sample of college students found that previously having sex, greater number of sexual partners, and higher perceived risk of HPV infection were predictive of HPV vaccine acceptability. Given the paucity of literature, additional focus on young African Americans who are disproportionately affected by HPV and associated disease outcomes is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311412833">D’Urso et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311412833">Gerend and Magloire, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1359105311412833">
<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>The current study was theoretically guided by the Health Belief Model (HBM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311412833">Rosenstock, 1974</xref>) and the PEN-3 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311412833">Airhihenbuwa, 1992</xref>). The HBM is one of the most widely used behavioral theories and has been previously used in HPV vaccine research among college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311412833">Hsu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311412833">Painter et al., 2008</xref>). The HBM posits that engagement in preventive health behaviors depends on an individual’s perceived susceptibility to disease, severity of health outcomes, benefits of and barriers to behavior engagement, and cues to motivate action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311412833">Rosenstock, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>The PEN-3 model centralizes culture as the primary reason for engaging in health behaviors and the primary consideration for health promotion programs. The model has been used in cancer research, but has not been used to understand and examine HPV vaccine acceptability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311412833">Kline, 2007</xref>). The letters P, E, N are used as acronyms for constructs in the three categories. The first category, health education (<italic>P</italic>erson, <italic>E</italic>xtended Family, <italic>N</italic>eighborhood), recognizes that health behavior intervention can take place at the individual, family, or community level. The second category, educational diagnosis of health behavior (<italic>P</italic>erceptions, <italic>E</italic>nablers, and <italic>N</italic>urturers), is aimed at identifying factors that influence or hinder behavior engagement. The third category, cultural appropriateness of health behavior (<italic>P</italic>ositive, <italic>E</italic>xotic, and <italic>N</italic>egative), is intended to identify culturally embedded beliefs, practices, and influential others. The model posits that constructs from the ‘educational diagnosis of health behavior’ category should be examined as positive, exotic, and negative.</p>
<p>The HBM and PEN-3 overlap as both assess beliefs and cues to motivate behavior engagement. For example, the construct of ‘cues to action’ in the HBM may examine the influence of important others in health decision making which is consistent with the construct of ‘nurturers’ in the PEN-3. However, the PEN-3 model extends health behavior assessments beyond the individual level into a sociocultural context. In the current study racial pride was explored as a ‘positive enabler’ of health behavior and health care distrust as a ‘negative perception’. In combination, the HBM and PEN-3 are thought to produce a more meaningful set of factors to address beliefs and attitudes relative to HPV vaccination.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of health beliefs and culturally specific factors on HPV vaccine acceptability among African American college females in the south-eastern USA. We hypothesized that women with higher perceived susceptibility to HPV infection, higher perceived severity of HPV-associated health outcomes, higher perceived benefit of vaccination, higher racial pride, more cues to action, lower perceived barriers to vaccination, and lower health care distrust are more likely to report HPV vaccine acceptability.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-1359105311412833">
<title>Study overview</title>
<p>A cross-sectional sample of 575 African American college students (male and female) attending three historically black colleges/universities in the south-eastern USA were recruited. This research is focused on the 363 female participants for whom the HPV vaccine was clinically available at the time of the study. Data on males are reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311412833">Bynum et al., 2011</xref>). Participants were recruited from January to April 2009 from introductory classes such as sociology and psychology. These classes generally enroll students from different school classifications (e.g. freshmen, sophomore) and degree majors. After written informed consent was obtained, participants were asked to complete a 52-item self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed by the study team based on a review of the literature, existing survey items, and/or previously used items. The questionnaire included items assessing HPV knowledge and related health beliefs, health care distrust, racial pride, sociodemographic characteristics, and sexual history. At the conclusion of the study, participants were given an HPV fact sheet developed by the CDC and other informational resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311412833">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006</xref>). Participants included in these analyses met the following criteria: female; 18–26 years of age; self-identified as Black/African American; were able to hear, speak, write, and comprehend in English; and reported previously hearing of HPV. A total of 215 women met the study criteria. The study was approved by the University of South Carolina and participating historically black colleges/universities Institutional Review Boards.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1359105311412833">
<title>HPV vaccine acceptability</title>
<p>HPV vaccine acceptability was assessed using one item, ‘Would you get a vaccine to prevent HPV infection?’ Response options were ‘yes’, ‘no’, and ‘don’t know’. As we were interested in identifying factors that contribute to reporting vaccine acceptability vs all other responses, ‘no’ and ‘don’t know’ responses were collapsed to create a dichotomous indicator variable (1 = acceptability; 0 = non-acceptability). HPV vaccine acceptability data were collected before the second HPV vaccine Cervarix was approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration. Therefore, items referred only to the Gardasil vaccine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1359105311412833">
<title>Knowledge</title>
<p><italic>HPV Knowledge</italic> was assessed on a 10-point index using items commonly found in the literature (e.g. HPV can cause abnormal Pap smears/Pap tests) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311412833">Bynum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311412833">D’Urso et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Pap Test Knowledge</italic> was assessed using six items commonly found in the cervical cancer literature (e.g. A Pap smear checks for changes in the cells of a woman’s cervix) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311412833">Buki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311412833">Bynum et al., 2009</xref>). Response options for the two knowledge indices were ‘true’, ‘false’, and ‘don’t know’. Items were measured on a unipolar scale whereas correct responses were given a score of 1 and incorrect or ‘don’t know’ responses a score of 0. Items were summed to create an HPV and Pap test knowledge index score.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359105311412833">
<title>HPV and HPV vaccine health beliefs</title>
<p>Two items assessed <italic>Perceived Susceptibility to HPV Infection</italic> (e.g. It is extremely likely that I will get HPV in my lifetime), <italic>r</italic> = 0.42. Three items assessed <italic>Perceived Severity of HPV Health Outcomes</italic> (e.g. Cervical cancer is a serious disease), α = 0.80. A single item assessed <italic>Perceived Benefit of HPV Vaccination</italic> (i.e., Getting the HPV vaccine could save my life). Three items assessed <italic>Perceived Barriers to HPV Vaccination</italic> (e.g. I don’t think vaccines work), α = 0.58. Six items assessed <italic>Cues to HPV Vaccine Acceptability and Uptake</italic> (e.g. If my mother approved of the HPV vaccine then I would approve of it also), α = 0.90. Health belief items were measured on a four-point ordinal response scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree. Items were averaged to create scale scores for each health belief construct.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1359105311412833">
<title>Health care system distrust</title>
<p>A shortened version of the 10-item Health Care System Distrust scale was used, α = 0.67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105311412833">Rose et al., 2004</xref>). Five items were used to assess participants’ trust of the health care system including their perceptions of interactions with doctors and medical procedures (e.g. Medical experiments can be done on me without my knowing about it). Responses were measured on a four-point ordinal response scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree. Items were averaged to create a scale score.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1359105311412833">
<title>Racial pride</title>
<p>The racial pride scale measured cultural constructs prevalent in the Black community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311412833">Lukwago et al., 2001</xref>). Six items were used to measure racial pride, α = 0.76 (e.g. Black men and women should keep up with issues that are important to the Black community). Participants were asked to respond to the items on a four-point ordinal response scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree. Items were averaged to create a scale score.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1359105311412833">
<title>Sexual history</title>
<p>Six items were used to assess sexual history. Participants were asked whether they ever had sex, age at first sex, lifetime number of sexual partners, alcohol and drug use at last sex, condom use at last sex, and whether they had ever been diagnosed with an STI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1359105311412833">
<title>Sociodemographics</title>
<p>Information about participants’ age, school enrollment classification, relationship status, living arrangement, and parents’ highest level of education were obtained.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section13-1359105311412833">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Cronbach’s alpha was calculated for concepts represented by three or more items and Pearson correlation for scales with two items. Descriptive statistics summarized sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics of study participants. Independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare differences in HPV and Pap knowledge and health belief constructs between those who reported HPV vaccine acceptability and those who did not. Chi-square tests were used to compare differences in categorical sexually history items (i.e. STI history).</p>
<p>Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess predictors of HPV vaccine acceptability. Although ‘don’t know’ and ‘no’ responses were collapsed into one category to create a ‘no’ variable, the percentage of those responding ‘don’t know’ to the dependent variable are reported in the results. First, for the dependent variable, logistic regression was used to explore sociodemographic (i.e. age, school classification, relationship status, and mother/father educational level) and sexual history (i.e. age at first sex, lifetime number of sexual partners, alcohol use at last sex, condom use at last sex, and STI history) variables as predictors of HPV vaccine acceptability. The final regression models included knowledge, conceptual constructs, as well as any sociodemographic and sexual history items identified as statistically significant in the first regression model. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 17.0 (Chicago, IL). Statistical tests were set at the alpha level of 0.05 and 95 percent confidence interval for odds ratios.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to use culturally relevant theory to explore influences on HPV vaccine acceptability and one of the few to focus predominantly on African American college students. This study highlights the importance of identifying barriers to and facilitators of HPV vaccine acceptability as such factors are important to target in health initiatives promoting uptake. The findings of this study provide insight into HPV message framing and communication efforts targeting college-aged African American populations.</p>
<p>Overall knowledge of HPV was moderate with the average number of participants responding correctly to 50 percent of items. This finding contrasts other studies reporting higher levels of HPV knowledge among college populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311412833">Bendik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311412833">Dillard and Spear, 2010</xref>). Despite these knowledge deficits, the HPV vaccine was well accepted, with over 75 percent reporting acceptability. This finding among African American college females is consistent with other published studies reporting high HPV vaccine acceptability among predominantly Caucasian college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311412833">Allen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311412833">Jones and Cook, 2008</xref>). The high level of vaccine acceptability found in the current study is promising. However, as noted earlier, acceptability does not always lead to uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311412833">Gottlieb et al., 2009</xref>). It is therefore important that health initiatives focus on facilitators of behavior engagement and address barriers to the extent possible. Such a focus will be central to moving individuals from HPV vaccine acceptability and intent to uptake and completion.</p>
<p>Perceived benefit of HPV vaccination and racial pride were the only constructs that significantly predicted HPV vaccine acceptability. Racial pride was a negative predictor of HPV vaccine acceptability. That is, the higher participants scored on the racial pride scale the less likely they were to report HPV vaccine acceptability. Racial pride is intended to act as a protective factor to encourage engagement in preventive health behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311412833">Kreuter and Haughton, 2006</xref>). However, the opposite was found among this sample of women. This finding warrants further investigation to elucidate the observed negative relationship between racial pride and HPV vaccine acceptability. The strongest predictor of vaccine acceptability was perceived benefit of vaccination which was a positive predictor. Participants with a higher perception of vaccination benefits were over three times more likely to report vaccine acceptability. This suggests that promoting benefits of vaccination will be central to vaccine promotion efforts targeting young African American women.</p>
<p>Other health belief variables such as perceived susceptibility and severity were not predictive of vaccine acceptability. This is in contrast with other studies that have found an association between other health belief constructs and vaccine acceptability among college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311412833">Gerend and Magloire, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311412833">Hsu et al., 2009</xref>). Some research has also found an association between distrust of government and the medical system and non-acceptability of the HPV vaccine among parents of adolescent daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311412833">Marlow et al., 2007</xref>). However, in the current study, health care distrust was not predictive of vaccine acceptability. This is an important and promising finding and suggests distrust may not play a significant contributing role in HPV vaccine decision making among young African American women.</p>
<p>In combination with health beliefs, sexual history (i.e. age at first sex and STI history) was not predictive of HPV vaccination which is inconsistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311412833">Hsu et al., 2009</xref>). Findings suggest that health beliefs rather than sexual history play a more central role in vaccine acceptability among African American college women. Nonetheless, it is important to note that increased efforts should focus on promoting safer sex practices among all populations especially African American college women. About 19 percent of participants reported using alcohol/drugs at last sex, one-third reported not using a condom at last sex, and one-fourth reported a prior STI diagnosis. As sexual behavior is a risk factor for HPV infection, these findings have important implications for future STI prevention and HPV vaccine promotion efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311412833">Goodman et al., 2008</xref>). As an HPV and general STI risk reduction strategy, it is important that HPV communication and messaging target modifiable risk behaviors such as condom use (decrease risk of acquisition) and alcohol/drug use (increase risk of acquisition) in combination with HPV vaccination (prevent acquisition).</p>
<p>There are limitations to this study that should be considered when interpreting results. First, the study was conducted among a non-randomly selected sample of students attending historically black colleges/universities. Therefore, study results may not be representative of the larger college population. Second, all data were self-reported which may have produced socially desirable responses. Third, data are cross- sectional which limited the ability to assess shifts in beliefs over time. Lastly some measures had low reliability.</p>
<p>The findings of this study can be used to guide development of culturally appropriate health programs to promote knowledge, HPV vaccine uptake, and safer sex practices among African American college women. Any effort to promote HPV vaccination must provide accurate and balanced information regarding risks and benefits of vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311412833">Haug, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105311412833">Rothman and Rothman, 2009</xref>). Study results suggest that HPV vaccine promotion and communication should heavily focus on identifying, addressing, and promoting benefits of vaccination. Additional research is needed to validate the findings of this study.</p>
