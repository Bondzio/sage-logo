<abstract>
<p>Although many learning disability types are formally recognized in major classification systems such as <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> and ICD-10, Nonverbal Learning Disorder (NLD) is not despite over 40 years of literature addressing its theoretical and neuropsychological foundation, its major features, and the methods by which to assess and diagnose it. Currently, there is no general agreement regarding the defining features of NLD and their relationship to daily functioning. Presented here is a description of NLD in the context of a model aimed at providing a standard language and framework for describing health and health-related states: the <italic>International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)</italic>. It is proposed that the ICF model can guide clinical thinking, professional practice—including assessment, diagnosis, and treatment—and research with respect to NLD, eventually leading to the inclusion of NLD in formal classification systems.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>Bien que plusieurs types de difficultés d’apprentissage se retrouvent dans des systèmes de classification tels que le Manuel diagnostique et statistique des troubles mentaux (DSM-IV) et la Classification internationale des maladies (CIM-10), le Syndrome de dysfonction non-verbale (SDNV) ne s’y trouve pas et ce, malgré plus de 40 ans de littérature relative à son fondement théorique et neuropsychologique, ses caractéristiques importantes, et les méthodes par lesquelles il doit être évalué et diagnostiqué. À l’heure actuelle, il n’existe pas de consensus quant aux caractéristiques qui définissent le SDNV ainsi que le rapport de ces caractéristiques au fonctionnement quotidien. Le présent article offre une description du SDNV dans le contexte d’un modèle qui vise la standardisation d’un langage et un cadre pour décrire la santé et des états de santé connexes, soit: la Classification internationale de fonctionnement, du handicap et de la santé (CIF). Il est proposé que le modèle de la CIF puisse guider la réflexion clinique, la pratique professionnelle (y compris l’évaluation, le diagnostic et le traitement) et la recherche eu égard le SDNV, soutenir éventuellement à son inclusion dans des systèmes de classification formels.</p>

<body>
<p>Whereas the term <italic>learning disabilities</italic> (LDs) connotes a unitary construct or disorder often associated with the deficient achievement of basic academic skills, converging scientific evidence accumulated over at least the past 40 years has demonstrated convincingly its heterogeneous nature. This heterogeneity is manifested in patterns of academic and information processing strengths and weaknesses, and it is also reflected in major classification systems as domain-specific academic deficits, such as Reading Disorder or Mathematics Disorder in the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0829573512436966">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) or Specific Reading Disorder or Specific Disorder of Arithmetical Skills in ICD-10 (World Health Organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0829573512436966">[WHO], 1992</xref>). It is estimated that the majority of LDs involve reading or language deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0829573512436966">Kirk, Gallagher, &amp; Anastasiow, 2003</xref>). Less commonly occurring and, consequently, less well understood and defined are LDs that are rooted in so-called “nonverbal” cognitive processes, such as visual perception, visual-spatial reasoning, visual-motor coordination, and problem solving involving visual imagery or tactile perceptual abilities, to name a few. Numerous studies have found that when nonverbal cognitive processes are selectively impaired, the individual often demonstrates an academic profile of better developed reading and spelling than arithmetic skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512436966">Rourke, 1989</xref>). Deficits in social perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0829573512436966">Ozols &amp; Rourke, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0829573512436966">Petti, Voelker, Shore, &amp; Hayman-Abello, 2003</xref>) as well as in interpersonal skills and emotional adjustment have also been commonly reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0829573512436966">Tranel, Hall, Olson, &amp; Tranel, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>This particular pattern, along with other presenting features, has been given various labels, including among them <italic>developmental right-hemisphere syndrome</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0829573512436966">Gross-Tsur, Shalev, Manor, &amp; Amir, 1995</xref>), <italic>right-hemisphere deficit syndrome in children</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0829573512436966">Voeller, 1986</xref>), <italic>syndrome of nonverbal learning disabilities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512436966">Rourke, 1989</xref>), and <italic>nonverbal learning disorder</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0829573512436966">Ris &amp; Nortz, 2008</xref>). The term <italic>nonverbal learning disorder</italic> (NLD) is adopted here partly for reasons discussed by Ris and Nortz, which include among others its origins in special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0829573512436966">Johnson &amp; Myklebust, 1967</xref>), the many early subtyping studies conducted by Rourke and colleagues of children with learning disabilities that were seminal in describing the clinical neuropsychological characteristics of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0829573512436966">Rourke &amp; Finlayson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0829573512436966">Rourke &amp; Telegdy, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0829573512436966">Rourke, Young, &amp; Flewelling, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0829573512436966">Strang &amp; Rourke, 1983</xref>), and the historically and conceptually closer affiliation of NLD to developmental psychopathology and, thus, the psychiatric formulations of a “disorder” than to a neurological “syndrome.” The choice of the term <italic>disorder</italic> over <italic>disabilities</italic> should in no way minimize the importance of demonstrating that the constellation of neuropsychological strengths and weaknesses has a direct and significant impact on daily functioning. Including dimensions of psychosocial or adaptive functioning in a definition of NLD would be consistent with the inclusion in many <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> disorders of a diagnostic criterion stipulating that the condition results in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of daily functioning. Although NLD is not formally identified in any current classification system, the findings from several hundred peer-reviewed journal articles, the publication of dozens of books and book chapters, and the creation of a half-dozen or so websites dedicated to this disorder have revealed the clinical features that characterize this disorder and provide compelling evidence supporting its validity.</p>
<p>In the absence of a formal consensus regarding diagnostic criteria, clinicians making this diagnosis must be familiar with the neuropsychological, academic, emotional, and adaptive characteristics of the disorder as described in the research literature, as well as their relative importance in establishing the diagnosis. The clinician should be familiar with the details of Rourke’s NLD model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512436966">Rourke, 1989</xref>), including its relationship to Piaget’s theory of cognitive development and the Goldberg-Costa model of hemispheric specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0829573512436966">Goldberg &amp; Costa, 1981</xref>). Also essential is a solid understanding of the cognitive processes evaluated by various psychological tests used in the clinical assessment of NLD and the specific clinical and psychometric characteristics of disorders that might present similarly, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Argued here is also the need for a model to guide clinical thinking, professional practice—including assessment, diagnosis, and treatment—and research with respect to NLD. The <italic>International Classification of Functioning, Health, and Disability</italic> (ICF) published by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0829573512436966">WHO (2001)</xref> serves such purposes well. In addition to many other advantages, considering NLD in the context of the ICF framework would clarify ambiguity associated with the imprecise and often interchangeable use of terms such as <italic>deficit, impairment</italic>, and <italic>disability</italic> used clinically and in the literature that potentially confound the issue of diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0829573512436966">Ris &amp; Nortz, 2008</xref>). Based on sample demographics of published studies, it seems that most individuals with NLD come to the attention of psychologists during the middle or late childhood years, presenting typically with the developmental form of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512436966">Rourke, 1989</xref>). As with most learning disabilities, however, the impairments associated with NLD are lifelong. With more individuals presenting for initial assessment of this disorder in young adulthood, it is essential that clinicians undertake evaluations of NLD with a clear understanding of the neuropsychological profiles and lifelong histories that are consistent with this diagnosis. Whereas published studies focusing on adults with NLD have increased over the past few years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0829573512436966">Wasserstein, Vadhan, Barboza, &amp; Stefanatos, 2008</xref>), our knowledge of this disorder is still largely based on published studies of children. Nonetheless, as will become apparent from what follows, the findings from such studies when couched in the context of the ICF model are relevant to understanding its adult presentation also.</p>
<p>What follows this brief introduction is a description of the ICF model, including its principal components related to functioning and disability and their relevance to the conceptualization of NLD. No attention will be given to the role of contextual factors, as this would require a great deal more discussion on topics largely speculative at this point due to the lack of research addressing the role of these factors in the diagnostic process. Then a summary of the literature relevant to our current understanding of the principal identifying features of NLD is presented in conjunction with their relationship to the ICF model. This leads logically into a discussion of issues related to the assessment and diagnosis of NLD, including matters related to the test instruments, the assessment process, and differential diagnosis. The article concludes with a summary of the principal features of NLD and a discussion of the value of conceptualizing NLD in the context of the ICF model.</p>

<title>The ICF Model</title>
<p>In 2001, the WHO published its revised edition of a system initially designed to classify the consequences of disease or disorder. Whereas the ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases–Tenth revision) serves as a classification system for health conditions (e.g., diseases and disorders), the ICF provides a framework for describing the functioning and disability associated with health conditions, always in the context of environmental and personal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0829573512436966">WHO, 2001</xref>). The revised version ushered in many advantages over the first edition, including its adoption of a biopsychosocial model of human functioning as compared with its previous emphasis on disease more or less alone as the determinant of health and functioning, the recognition that an individual’s functioning is the result of a complex interaction between the health condition and contextual factors, and the dynamic, bi-directional interaction among the components of the model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0829573512436966">Figure 1</xref>). In 2007, the WHO published a version of the ICF pertinent to children and youth that is designed to better reflect the rapid changes that occur in the first two decades of life in physical, social, and psychological development, as well as the associated growth in competence, societal participation, and independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0829573512436966">WHO, 2007</xref>). By fulfilling its purpose of classifying health and health-related states, instead of people, the model can be instrumental in developing a conceptualization of functioning and disability as related to NLD, in understanding the interrelationship among the components of health, and in providing “a common and universal language for clinical, public health, and research applications to facilitate the documentation and measurement of health and disability” (p. vii).</p>

<p>In this model, the neuropsychological processes evaluated during testing are considered body functions. If these functions are normatively deficient, abnormal, or otherwise in a reduced state of health, then they would be considered “impaired.” For example, the “deficits” in spatial reasoning and fine motor coordination typical of individuals with NLD would be considered “impairments,” as these are body functions. The inadequate execution of everyday tasks such as solving math problems and regularly and independently brushing one’s teeth are considered “limitations in activities,” whereas reading at age level would be considered an intact activity. A person’s inability to be involved in a community organization such as scouts, to make a bank deposit or withdrawal, or to adequately make use of public transportation are considered “restrictions in participation” (involvement in life situations). In the context of this model, functioning and disability are the result of the complex and dynamic interactions among the entities that constitute each component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0829573512436966">WHO, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The utility of this model is apparent in the manner in which it has helped guide thinking regarding certain developmental disorders such as cerebral palsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0829573512436966">Rosenbaum &amp; Stewart, 2004</xref>) and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0829573512436966">American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, 2010</xref>). Elements of its components and their interrelationship are also evident in the definition of learning disabilities advanced by various special interest organizations, such as the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada (LDAC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ldac-acta.ca/learn-more/ld-defined/official-definition-of-learning-disabilities.html">http://www.ldac-acta.ca/learn-more/ld-defined/official-definition-of-learning-disabilities.html</ext-link>). Notable in LDAC’s definition is the description of specific academic skill deficits (i.e., limitations in activities in the ICF model, such as reading) due to “impairments” in one or more psychological processes (e.g., phonological awareness, a body function in the ICF model).</p>

<sec id="section2-0829573512436966">
<title>The Principal Identifying Features of NLD</title>
<p>Several studies have addressed the clinical features of NLD, with much attention focussed on the pattern of neuropsychological strengths and weaknesses. Essentially, all of the primary, secondary, tertiary, and verbal assets and deficits presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512436966">Rourke’s (1989)</xref> model of NLD constitute body functions in the ICF (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0829573512436966">Table 2</xref>). For the most part, the academic, psychosocial, and adaptive features of NLD relate to the activities and participation component of the ICF. Rourke proposes a dynamic “downstream” relationship among the assets and deficits, such that the primary neuropsychological assets and deficits lead to the secondary neuropsychological assets and deficits and so on, ultimately leading to the pattern of academic, psychosocial, and adaptive characteristics of the disorder. This causal sequence underscores the prominent role that the neuropsychological assets and deficits play in the daily functioning of the individual with NLD. Linking this particular sequence of causal events to the Body Functions, Activities, and Participation components of the ICF model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0829573512436966">Figure 1</xref>) provides a common language and means by which to conceptualize functioning and disability as it relates to any health condition, including among them NLD.</p>

<p>In conceptualizing the cognitive processes involved in learning disabilities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0829573512436966">Johnson and Myklebust (1967)</xref> also described a hierarchy of experiences, one which starts with sensation and evolves by gradation to perception, imagery, symbolization, and finally conceptualization, adding that the most basic of experiences are nonverbal in nature. The notion that there is a causal hierarchy is shared by these two models. Whereas Johnson and Myklebust considered verbal learning disabilities to be at the level of symbolization, and thus often affecting conceptualization, the deficits in NLD were considered to be at the level of perception and imagery, in effect constituting a fundamental distortion of the individual’s total experience. To illustrate their point, they noted the following:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The child with a nonverbal learning disability is like the child who lacks color vision. He has no difficulty in learning the <italic>word</italic> red, but cannot acquire the <italic>experience</italic> red, so he cannot distinguish it from the experience green or yellow. When he uses the <italic>word</italic> red, as required by daily activities, it connotes only a vague, conglomerate impression often unrelated to the actual circumstances. The manifestations nonverbally are distortions of perception and of mental imagery. (p. 273)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Numerous studies conducted by Rourke and colleagues since the 1970s have contributed substantially to the evolving conceptualization of NLD and the recognition of the clinical features that often accompany it. The major features have been summarized in several publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0829573512436966">Rourke, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512436966">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0829573512436966">Tsatsanis &amp; Rourke, 2008</xref>). Based on these various studies, the functional assets can be summarized as follows (“assets” refer to processes or activities that are essentially developed to adequate or better levels for the individual’s age):</p>
<list id="list1-0829573512436966" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Visual, auditory, and tactile sensation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Basic motor skills that are acquired through simple repetitive activities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Auditory-linguistic abilities, such as phonological awareness and sound-symbol correspondence.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fundamental listening comprehension and oral expression (basic receptive and expressive language skills), including word knowledge and wealth of general factual information.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Auditory attention and rote verbal memory.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Near age-appropriate or better word reading and spelling skills, with misspellings that are phonetically accurate (e.g., <italic>formilyor</italic> instead of <italic>familiar</italic>).</p></list-item></list>
<p>The deficits (impaired functions or activity limitations) can be summarized as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0829573512436966" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The processing of complex tactile information (tactile perception)—This is evident on both sides of the body (tested with the upper extremities) but usually more marked on the left side (e.g., left hand).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gross and fine motor coordination—When the upper extremities are tested separately, the impairment is usually greater on the left side of the body.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Visual-perceptual and visual-spatial reasoning abilities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nonverbal problem-solving and concept-formation abilities, including problems with using feedback to guide behaviour in novel or otherwise complex situations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Difficulty adapting to novel, complex, or changing situations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ability to understand the more complex aspects of verbal material, especially that which is abstract or that requires verbal reasoning abilities such as making inferences and understanding cause–effect relationships. This is the case whether the material is oral or written (i.e., listening comprehension or reading comprehension).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An overreliance on basic oral language as a means for relating socially and coping with anxiety. Speech is often rambling and may include the use of words or expressions that are poorly understood or out of place. Often evident are problems with topic maintenance, concrete thinking, verbosity, and verbal self-monitoring (e.g., uttering awkward or offensive remarks without understanding their effect on others).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Weak mechanical arithmetic and math reasoning skills in conjunction with better developed word-reading and spelling skills.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Weak social skills reflecting difficulties with social perception, social judgment, social withdrawal, and interpersonal relationships.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased risk for experiencing excessive anxiety and depression.</p></list-item>

<p>Unlike other learning disability subtypes, the characteristics of NLD are pervasive in nature, involving a multitude of neuropsychological, academic, and psychosocial functions. In an attempt to identify empirically the relative importance of the various neuropsychological and academic features that characterize NLD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0829573512436966">Harnadek and Rourke (1994)</xref> compared three groups of children on 15 variables associated with these two domains. The groups included 29 children with NLD, 29 children with reading and spelling disabilities (RS), and a group of 27 nonclinical children (NC). Test variables were submitted to a stepwise linear discriminant function analysis. Most tests were from the Halstead-Reitan batteries and allied procedures and were chosen based on their sensitivity to the deficits associated with NLD or RS disabilities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512436966">Rourke, 1989</xref> for a description of the tests and measures). Based on test composites, three domain variables best discriminated (&gt;95% accuracy) the NLD group from the RS and NC groups. The domains reflected (a) visual-perceptual-organizational abilities, (b) fine motor coordination (psychomotor abilities), and (c) tactile perception and nonverbal problem solving. From a specific test standpoint, the visual-perceptual-organizational variable used in the study was a composite measure comprising scores on the Target Test and Trail Making Test, Part B. The two other domain measures were based on the Grooved Pegboard Test and the Tactual Performance Test, respectively. The authors noted that the principal identifying features of NLD were those considered to be <italic>primary</italic> in the NLD model (impairments in body functions in the ICF model).</p>
<p>Two studies by Rourke and colleagues that followed proposed classification rules for differentiating NLD from Basic Phonological Processing Disabilities (BPPD), a disorder characterized academically by weaknesses in reading and spelling skills. The first study focused on rules for classifying children ages 9 to 15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0829573512436966">Pelletier, Ahmad, &amp; Rourke, 2001</xref>) and the second study for classifying children ages 7 and 8 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0829573512436966">Drummond, Ahmad, &amp; Rourke, 2005</xref>). The rules were based on performance on specific tests considered to reflect the features that characterize NLD and BPPD. Because the rules for younger children were considered to be still under investigation, only those for older children are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0829573512436966">Table 3</xref>. However, similarities were evident. Referring to the criteria for older children, at least at this preliminary point it was found that impairments in visual-spatial-organizational abilities (Criterion 1 and 4 for older children) as compared with better developed verbal abilities (Criterion 3), as well as impairments in tactile-perceptual and nonverbal problem solving abilities (Criterion 6) and better developed reading than arithmetic skills (Criterion 5) were important in identifying younger children with NLD.</p>

<p>Consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0829573512436966">Harnadek and Rourke (1994)</xref>, these two studies demonstrated that impairments in visual-perceptual abilities, tactile-perceptual abilities, fine motor speed and dexterity, and higher-order problem-solving abilities in the context of adequately developed basic verbal and sensory (visual, tactile, and auditory) abilities are important features of NLD. Other studies have provided indirect evidence in support of this conclusion. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0829573512436966">Casey, Rourke, and Picard (1991)</xref> using cross-sectional and longitudinal designs examined developmental changes in neuropsychological, academic, and socioemotional functioning in children with NLD. The cross-sectional analyses comparing younger and older children (<italic>n</italic> = 15 for each group; <italic>M</italic> = 8.6 and 12.6 years of age, respectively) demonstrated similar scores between the groups on measures reflecting oral language (VIQ), tactile sensation, basic motor abilities (e.g., grip strength), and reading and spelling skills, whereas lower scores were demonstrated by the older group on measures that emphasized visual-perceptual (PIQ), tactile-perceptual (e.g., finger agnosia), fine motor (e.g., Grooved Pegboard Test), problem-solving (Category Test and Tactile Perceptual Test), and arithmetic skills and abilities. Nine of the children in the study received at least two neuropsychological evaluations thus enabling a comparison of their performance longitudinally at two points in time (<italic>M</italic> = 8.7 years of age at the first testing and 11.0 years of age at the second testing). Although the longitudinal analyses yielded somewhat different results, the overall importance of impairments in visual-perceptual, tactile-perceptual, and problem-solving abilities as features of NLD was apparent. In effect, similar or better scores were evident on measures of oral language, tactile sensation, simple motor abilities, and reading and spelling, whereas scores remained similarly low at the second testing compared with the first on measures that emphasized visual-perceptual, tactile-perceptual, fine motor, problem-solving, and arithmetic skills and abilities. Again, the findings provided support for the importance of impairments in the neuropsychological domains of visual perception, tactile perception, fine motor, and problem solving.</p>
<p>Guided by Rourke’s research on NLD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0829573512436966">Ris et al. (2007)</xref> studied a sample of children and adolescents with spina bifida myelomeningocele (SBM), a condition known to be frequently associated with the features of NLD, to determine among other things the individual risk or base rate of NLD in this population. The total sample of 116 participants included 44 children with SBM, 28 children who presented with the features of NLD but no medical condition, and 44 control volunteers. From the battery of neuropsychological tests administered, a subset considered to be indicators of NLD were selected <italic>a priori</italic> based on Rourke’s published research. For each case, the variables (test scores) were coded categorically as either in the impaired range or not, and then the variables for all participants were subjected to a latent class analysis, a method for finding subtypes of latent classes from multivariate categorical data. Important to the discussion here is that the two-class model provided an excellent fit to the data, with the two “subtypes” being significantly different on tests of visual spatial perception (Judgment of Line Orientation or JLO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0829573512436966">Benton, Hamsher, Varney, &amp; Spreen, 1983</xref>), nonverbal problem solving (Children’s Category Test; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0829573512436966">Boll, 1993</xref>), fine motor speed and dexterity (Grooved Pegboard Test), and tactile perception (Finger Tip Number Writing). The classes did not differ significantly on the IQ indicator (VIQ &gt; PIQ by at least 10 points), the achievement indicator (WIAT Basic Reading subtest &gt; Numerical Operations subtest), the paralinguistic indicator (Developmental Test of Nonverbal Accuracy at least 1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0829573512436966">Nowicki &amp; Duke, 1994</xref>), or an indicator of internalizing problems (Internalizing Scale <italic>T</italic>-score of at least 60 on the Behavior Assessment System for Children; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0829573512436966">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 1992</xref>). Overlapping with other studies, the results from this study support the importance of impairments in visual-spatial abilities, tactile-perceptual abilities, nonverbal problem-solving abilities, and fine motor coordination as key features of NLD.</p>

<title>Assessment of NLD</title>
<p>To arrive at a proper diagnosis of NLD, it is essential that the assessment procedures be sufficiently broad to cover all of the functional domains that characterize its clinical presentation, as evident from the studies reviewed. Conceptualizing the sources of information within the context of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0829573512436966">Sattler’s (2008)</xref> “four pillars of assessment” enables the clinician to structure the assessment in such a way to address all of the components of the ICF model and, consequently, issues related to functioning, disability, and contextual factors. The pillars (or sources of information) include norm-referenced measures, interviews, behavioural observations, and informal assessment procedures (e.g., written language samples, school records, and medical records). If the conceptualization of NLD is a disorder that not only involves body functions (i.e., psychological, neuropsychological, and information processing assets and deficits) but also necessarily includes either limitations in activities, restrictions in participation, or both, then it is essential that the clinical information include not only test data but also evaluative information on the performance of age-appropriate daily activities, which might include learning, taking care of oneself, or getting along with others (i.e., adaptive functions). Daily activities can be construed as “occupational” in nature, which most often for children and young adults include activities that takes place in a school setting (e.g., learning as well as academic and social skills). If problems in emotional adjustment (e.g., anxiety or depression) are also part of the diagnosis, which remains open to debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0829573512436966">Ris &amp; Nortz, 2008</xref>), then the assessment will need to include procedures for gathering this information as well.</p>
<p>Because NLD is not included in any diagnostic system such as the <italic>DSM</italic> or ICD, one must rely on research findings to determine the information needed to conduct a diagnostic assessment. Considering norm-referenced tests as a source of information, it should be clear by this point that psychological testing must include measures that evaluate all of the principal assets and deficits usually associated with NLD. Relevant <italic>body functions</italic>, which are typically evaluated in a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, include:</p>
<list id="list3-0829573512436966" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>attention, concentration, and working memory;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>learning and memory, preferably for both verbal and nonverbal material;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>verbal and other language-related abilities (e.g., oral comprehension, oral expression, verbal fluency, abstract verbal reasoning and conceptualization, and auditory-verbal perception);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>visual perception (e.g., spatial perception and reasoning using various types of visual materials, both concrete and abstract);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>tactile perception (e.g., perceiving and identifying without the benefit of sight numbers written on the finger tips or the shapes of blocks placed in the hand);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>motor performance with the arms and hands (e.g., motor speed, eye–hand coordination, and motor strength);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>processing speed or cognitive efficiency; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>higher-order cognitive processes (e.g., reasoning, problem solving with novel information, planning, and the ability to use feedback to generate and refine problem-solving strategies).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although norm-referenced tests are also often used to gather information about an individual’s academic skills, adaptive skills, and psychosocial adjustment, such information can, and should, be obtained from other sources as well, such as clinical interviews, direct behaviour observations, and documents that describe the individual’s development and functioning (e.g., school report cards and other assessment reports). In the context of the ICF model, this information is directly relevant to the individual’s activities and participation and is a necessary addition to determine whether there is a predictable relationship among body functions, activities, and participation to support a diagnosis of NLD. For example, the findings from research studies have demonstrated a strong causal link between phonological awareness (<italic>body function</italic>) and the development of the <italic>activity</italic> of reading (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0829573512436966">Stanovich, 1988</xref>). Consistent with this finding, individuals with NLD perform well on a test that requires them to blend spoken sounds to form words (e.g., “ba-na-na”). They also perform well on tests of word reading and they make misspellings that are phonetically accurate. Given the research findings, one would also expect to see poor arithmetic skills and adaptive limitations in the context of impairments in visual-perceptual and visual-spatial abilities, reasoning and problem solving, and fine motor skills.</p>
<p>It follows that psychological testing more or less limited to an intelligence test and academic achievement tests—major components of a so-called psychoeducational assessment—is inadequate to render a diagnosis as it excludes key neuropsychological processes relevant to the clinical picture of NLD. Typically absent in such assessments are measures of tactile perception, fine motor speed and dexterity, and nonverbal reasoning and problem solving involving visual-spatial and tactile-perceptual abilities—impaired neuropsychological processes that are considered among the cardinal features of the disorder. Unfortunately, clinical experience suggests that a misdiagnosis of NLD is sometimes made primarily on the basis of a VIQ &gt; PIQ discrepancy and deficient math skills, a pattern that can arise for reasons other than NLD. In particular, children with ADHD can present at least superficially with similar IQ, academic, behavioural (especially at a younger age), and social features even though the two disorders are distinct with respect to the neuroanatomical substrates, course, and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0829573512436966">Hale, DeLuca, &amp; Casey, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Obviously, the selection of tests to include in the assessment should be based on the psychological domains of interest and a sound knowledge of the latent constructs (body functions) tapped by each test. Most neuropsychologists will include as part of their comprehensive battery of tests the age-appropriate version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale and an academic achievement test that covers at least word reading, spelling, and arithmetic skills, such as the WIAT-III or WRAT-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0829573512436966">Butler, Retzlaff, &amp; Vanderploeg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0829573512436966">Sullivan &amp; Bowden, 1997</xref>). Other important measures derived from the Halstead-Reitan batteries include Hand Dominance Exam, Kløve-Matthews Sensory-perceptual Examination, Finger Tapping Test, Dynamometer Test (Grip Strength), Trail Making Test, Tactual Performance Test, Grooved Pegboard Test, and the Category Test.</p>
<p>The developmental history and adaptive functioning of individuals with NLD have been described to varying lengths by others and are too extensive to present here. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0829573512436966">Casey and Strang (1994)</xref> provide an accessible overview of the typical presenting concerns, as well as the educational, communicational, daily living, and psychosocial aspects of the clinical picture. Briefly, they noted that individuals with NLD usually come to the attention of professionals because of problems with social skills and the weak arithmetic skills. Often, they are described as odd, socially awkward, overly anxious, withdrawn, unkempt, and clumsy. Because of their problems with gross motor coordination, they often avoid participating in sports or other physical activities. Problems with fasteners, such as buttons, shoe laces, or bread bag ties, are examples of their poor fine motor skills (activity limitations). They frequently have difficulty negotiating the premises of buildings, such as a shopping mall or the corridors of buildings, even their own school, a finding consistent with their impairment in visual-spatial perception and reasoning. Clinical experience suggests that very few adults with NLD drive a car (restrictions in participation), an impression that awaits empirical verification.</p>
<p>Much of the information described above pertaining to activities and participation as well as that related to contextual factors can be gathered by (a) clinical interview, which might include the identified client, a spouse or partner, parents, or some combination of informants; (b) standardized questionnaires completed by the client and involved others focussing on psychosocial adjustment and adaptive functioning (e.g., MMPI-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0829573512436966">Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, &amp; Kaemmer, 1989]</xref>; ASEBA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0829573512436966">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001]</xref>; Vineland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0829573512436966">Sparrow, Chiccetti, &amp; Balla, 2005]</xref>); and (c) direct behaviour observations in and out of the testing room. Information gleaned from a review of documentation can reveal patterns of functioning that are either consistent or inconsistent with a diagnosis of NLD. Given the importance of this information in the diagnostic process, clinicians engaged in the assessment and diagnosis of NLD should be very familiar with the detailed description by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512436966">Rourke (1989)</xref> of the characteristics, dynamics, and clinical presentation of NLD.</p>

<title>Other Assessment and Diagnostic Considerations</title>
<sec id="section5-0829573512436966">
<title>Tests, test revisions, and domains of neuropsychological functioning</title>
<p>A valid concern about the classification rules proposed by Rourke and colleagues is that they are based on specific and in some instances dated tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0829573512436966">Ris &amp; Nortz, 2008</xref>). Indeed, it would be, for example, unethical for a psychologist to continue using the WISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0829573512436966">Wechsler, 1949</xref>) or the WISC-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0829573512436966">Wechsler, 1974</xref>) as specified in Criteria 3, 4, and 8 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0829573512436966">Table 3</xref>). For sound psychometric reasons, intelligence tests and academic achievement tests are periodically updated. Other tests important to the assessment of NLD, however, have not undergone revisions, although researchers have compiled and published reasonably up-to-date or otherwise demographically relevant norms to maintain their usability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0829573512436966">Heaton, Miller, Taylor, &amp; Grant, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0829573512436966">Mitrushina, Boone, Razani, &amp; D’Elia, 2005</xref>). It has been argued that many neuropsychological tests attempt to measure optimal performance instead of typical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0829573512436966">Lezak, Howieson, &amp; Loring, 2004</xref>). As such, they are presumably not as vulnerable to generational changes. Consequently, measures such as the Category Test, Grooved Pegboard Test, and Tactual Performance Test—measures demonstrated to be sensitive to the key impairments characteristic of NLD—have not likely outlived their diagnostic usefulness.</p>
<p>Although there are compelling reasons for using the latest versions of intelligence tests, revisions might entail changes in the underlying constructs being measured, rendering questionable the extent to which the findings from previous research studies, which inform interpretation, apply to the revised version. In the case of the WISC-IV, for instance, the changes were sufficiently substantial that the publisher considered it “distinct from its predecessor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0829573512436966">Wechsler, 2003</xref>). Notably, the Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI) of the WISC-IV, formally known as the Perceptual Organization Index (POI) in the WISC-III, is considered to place greater emphasis on fluid reasoning abilities than visual perceptual abilities, an intentional change. Excluded from the WISC-IV are the Object Assembly and Picture Arrangement subtests from earlier versions, and two new subtests were added to the PRI (Matrix Reasoning and Picture Concepts), the validity of which are not well established in clinical populations. The Picture Completion subtest, although not excluded, became a supplemental subtest, a score on which even if administered does not contribute to the PRI. As a result of these various changes, the classification rules as proposed by Rourke and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0829573512436966">Drummond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0829573512436966">Pelletier et al., 2001</xref>) cannot be applied to the revised version of the WISC without empirical evidence supporting their relevance. Moreover, there is no study that addresses the relationship of the PRI to NLD. The fourth edition of the WAIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0829573512436966">Wechsler, 2008</xref>) ushered in similar changes, with some subtests dropped and others added. Whether assessing a child or an adult for NLD using one of the current versions of the Wechsler Scales, the psychologist must be aware of these limitations. Even if somewhat dated, consideration should be given to administering the Object Assembly and, perhaps, the Picture Arrangement subtests from the corresponding previous edition as scores on these have been shown to be low in NLD, especially the former of the two.</p>
<p>In the context of the ICF model, emphasis is placed on the particular domains of functioning and not on the measurement instruments used to evaluate them. This conceptualization is also in keeping with the diagnostic approach articulated in the <italic>DSM</italic> and ICD. That is, diagnostic criteria reflect functions or symptoms and not specific tests. In this way, for instance, if a test-specific classification rule related to the assessment of visual-spatial abilities cannot be applied, then the psychologist can draw from other tests that reflect the same or similar constructs. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0829573512436966">Ris et al. (2007)</xref> found that one of the greatest differences between the two latent classes that emerged in their study, one reflecting the taxon (subtype resembling NLD) and the comparison class, was performance on the Judgment of Line Orientation Test (JLO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0829573512436966">Benton, Sivan, Hamsher, Varney, &amp; Spreen, 2004</xref>), a measure emphasizing visual-spatial processing. It is inevitable that some tests will be revised and new ones introduced, which will require psychologists to keep abreast of the professional literature and periodically change their assessment batteries.</p>

<title>NLD versus ADHD</title>
<p>An overlap in some features, at least superficially, between NLD and ADHD has been frequently observed, raising questions regarding the relationship between these two disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0829573512436966">Wasserstein, Vadhan, Barboza, &amp; Stefanatos, 2008</xref>). Although impairments in so-called higher-order processes, such as reasoning, problem solving, and behavioural regulation, have been reported in both disorders, recent research studies suggest that the disorders do, indeed, differ in the nature of their higher-order cognitive impairments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0829573512436966">Hale, DeLuca, and Casey (2008)</xref> compared children with NLD and ADHD on the Category Test and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), two measures considered to reflect reasoning, concept formation, sustained attention, and flexibility in thinking, to name a few. The ADHD group performed roughly within the average range on all variables associated with each measure, whereas the NLD group performed below average on both measures with the exception of scores on the WCST reflecting perseverative errors and failure to maintain set. On the Category Test, the mean <italic>T</italic>-score for the ADHD group was 53 (average range), whereas the NLD group obtained a mean <italic>T</italic>-score of 26 (moderately impaired).</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0829573512436966">Semrud-Clikeman, Walkowiak, Wilkinson, and Christopher (2010)</xref> examined differences among children diagnosed with NLD, ADHD-Combined Type, ADHD-Predominately Inattentive Type, and Asperger syndrome (AS) on a variety of neuropsychological tests. Also included was a control group that did not meet criteria for any of these groups. Based on the research criteria proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0829573512436966">Rourke and Tsatsanis (1996)</xref>, children were included in the NLD group if they demonstrated a profile characterized by deficiencies in motor and visual-motor skills, social skills, and math skills in conjunction with average basic reading and verbal skills. Compared to the NLD groups, the ADHD group performed better on the Performance Scale of the WASI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0829573512436966">Wechsler, 1999</xref>); on the VMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0829573512436966">Beery, Buktenica, &amp; Beery, 2004</xref>) and Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure, both measures of visual-motor skills; on the JLO, a measure of visual-spatial perception; with the right hand on the Grooved Pegboard Test, a measure of fine motor speed and dexterity, and on the Social Skills Rating Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0829573512436966">Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990</xref>), an overall measure of social skills.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that the key impairments in NLD are not limited to higher-order cognitive processes. They are also at the <italic>perceptual</italic> level, both visual <italic>and</italic> tactile, which is not characteristic of ADHD, and as such must be differentiated from impairments in mental organization and other higher-order cognitive processes (i.e., executive functions) often seen in ADHD that can present as perceptual impairments on measures such as the Performance IQ of the Wechsler Scales due to the multidimensional nature of these tests. In effect, the findings from recent investigations suggest that individuals with NLD can be differentiated from those with ADHD on the basis of a comprehensive assessment that extends beyond intelligence and academic achievement tests.</p>

<sec id="section7-0829573512436966">
<title>NLD versus AS</title>
<p>Although a growing number of research studies and popular books link NLD and AS (or Asperger disorder as it is known in <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>), the nature of the relationship is controversial on several fronts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0829573512436966">Davis &amp; Broitman, 2011</xref> for a more detailed presentation of the issues related to the relationship of NLD and AS). Whether the two disorders are similar neuropsychologically is questionable, with the results of at least one study suggesting that most children with AS exhibit many of the neuropsychological features of NLD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0829573512436966">Klin, Volkmar, Sparrow, Cicchetti, &amp; Rourke, 1995</xref>), whereas the results of other studies have provided less support for this view (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0829573512436966">Miller &amp; Ozonoff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0829573512436966">Ozonoff, South, &amp; Miller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0829573512436966">Poirier &amp; Gaucher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0829573512436966">Semrud-Clikeman et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, some of these studies were designed to examine the validity of AS, the findings of which in conjunction with others suggest that AS and high functioning autism are synonymous, thus reinforcing that AS is, unlike NLD, on the autism spectrum (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0829573512436966">Mayes, Calhoun, &amp; Crites, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0829573512436966">Witwer &amp; Lecavalier, 2008</xref>). The doubtful validity of AS as a specific disorder and the still unrecognized diagnostic status formally of NLD complicates this differential diagnosis issue. Nonetheless, to the extent that AS is essentially a form of autism, it is clear that a diagnostic assessment of each requires certain specific and nonoverlapping assessment procedures as well as specific clinician expertise with each.</p>

<sec id="section8-0829573512436966">
<title>Current Status and Future Directions</title>
<p>Although many issues remain unresolved regarding NLD, the research findings to date are fairly consistent in describing the principal neuropsychological characteristics of the disorder and provide support for the validity of NLD as a clinical entity (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0829573512436966">Casey &amp; Rourke, 1991</xref>). The evidence is rooted largely in the neuropsychological literature, which dates back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0829573512436966">Johnson and Myklebust’s (1967)</xref> “psychoneurological” approach to understanding learning disabilities. The principal features of the disorder include (a) perceptual impairments involving the visual and tactile modalities; (b) impairments in fine motor speed and dexterity; (c) impairments in higher-order cognitive processes related to concept formation, abstract thinking, reasoning, and novel problem solving; (d) adequate or better basic verbal abilities; (e) adequate auditory, visual, and tactile sensation; and (f) adequate auditory attention and memory. Frequently, this combination of neuropsychological strengths and weaknesses has been shown to impact on everyday functioning, most notably with respect to limitations in the development of math skills, social skills, and emotional adjustment.</p>
<p>Conceptualizing NLD in the context of the ICF addresses certain issues that have been a source of confusion, issues that might have stalled its inclusion as a health condition within the dominant classification systems published by the WHO and the American Psychiatric Association. The ICF articulates what constitutes the components of human functioning and their interrelationship. Distinguishing among body functions, activities, and participation, it provides a common language to characterize each. Terms such as impairment, activity, limitation, and disability have clear definitions that can be applied to any health condition. Within this model, NLD would be considered a disability to the extent that there is a demonstrated relationship consistent with the research literature among the impairments, activity limitations, and restrictions in participation. As such, test results alone, neuropsychological or otherwise, are insufficient to render a diagnosis of NLD. Similarly insufficient are limitations and restrictions in the absence of corresponding impairments in body functions (i.e., neuropsychological processes).</p>
<p>Endeavouring to understand an individual’s functioning and to formulate a diagnosis, the ICF model can be used to guide the selection of measurement tools. Considering domains of functioning rather than decision rules based on specific tests is an advantage for the reasons described above, provided of course the psychologist is knowledgeable of the characteristics of the disorder and the methods by which these can be validly measured. Such an approach to describing the “criteria” (defining features) associated with NLD is consistent with the major classification systems.</p>
<p>Still unresolved is the constellation of features necessary to establish a diagnosis. As others have suggested (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0829573512436966">Fletcher, 1989</xref>), not all of the features of a condition need to be present in order to make a diagnosis. Although criticisms have been raised regarding test-based criteria, the results of certain studies focussing on this approach (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0829573512436966">Drummond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0829573512436966">Pelletier et al., 2001</xref>) and many others have provided compelling evidence regarding the key neuropsychological <italic>processes</italic> (i.e., body functions) relevant to the diagnosis of NLD. Some investigators have questioned the importance of math deficits or problems in psychosocial adjustment in making the diagnosis of NLD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0829573512436966">Ris &amp; Nortz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0829573512436966">Wasserstein et al., 2008</xref>). To be consistent with the ICF, as well as other classification systems, it would be necessary to demonstrate that the impairments in neuropsychological processes are associated with significant problems in daily activities, such as math, personal hygiene, or social interactions, a relationship that Rourke (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0829573512436966">1989</xref>) has advocated for years. Considering NLD in the context of the ICF model, however, provides a “. . . unified and standard language and framework . . .” by which to describe its features and the dynamic relationship among them, as well as to guide clinical practice and further research.</p>
