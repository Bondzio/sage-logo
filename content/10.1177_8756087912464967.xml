<abstract>
<p>This work studied the effects of thermal and UV-accelerated aging on the antibacterial performance and the physical, structural, and mechanical properties of linear low-density polyethylene and poly(vinyl chloride) resin doped with nano-silver colloid, by varying the dosage of nano-silver colloid, contact time, and aging time. Antimicrobial performance was evaluated by plate count agar method against <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The results indicated that <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cell count decreased with increasing contact time for poly(vinyl chloride) film but increased with increasing contact time for linear low-density polyethylene film. The maximum %bacteria reduction for linear low-density polyethylene film never reached 99.9% for any nano-silver content; but poly(vinyl chloride) film achieved 99.9% bacterial reduction with nano-silver content of 200 ppm at a contact time of 150 min. The addition of nano-silver colloid to poly(vinyl chloride) film did not affect the lightness; however, it significantly decreased the lightness of linear low-density polyethylene film. Aging increased the brittleness of both linear low-density polyethylene and poly(vinyl chloride) films with nano-silver colloid added. Antibacterial performances of linear low-density polyethylene and poly(vinyl chloride) films were more sensitive to UV aging than to thermal aging. Changes in antibacterial performance from both types of aging could be explained by physical and structural changes on the film surfaces.</p>

<sec id="sec1-8756087912464967" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polyethylene (PE) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) films are currently the most widely used plastics in many applications, including packaging films, medical devices, and household products. Their popularity in the plastics industry is due to their low production and product cost, light weight, and excellent resistance to chemicals and environmental conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8756087912464967">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756087912464967"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8756087912464967">3</xref></sup> PE and PVC films used in food and toy packaging are particularly likely to be involved in direct human contact. For this reason, microbial contamination of plastic film has become an issue of great importance. A conventional method of addressing this concern is by incorporating one or more antimicrobial agents into plastic films and other products during the processing and/or surface finishing stage. The primary objective is to inhibit, reduce, or retard the growth of microorganisms on the packaging films.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8756087912464967">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8756087912464967">5</xref></sup> Examples for specific applications of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and PVC with anti-microbial agents, such as silver, are food packaging, home appliances, medical and medicinal devices. The incorporated antimicrobial agents are usually divided into two categories, based on their chemical composition: organic and inorganic agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-8756087912464967">6</xref></sup> Organic antibacterial agents, such as sorbic, benzoic, and acetic acids, have limited applications, and are most often used in alcohol solutions due to their low heat resistance, high decomposability, and short life expectancy. As a result, inorganic antimicrobial agents have been introduced in the plastic film industry in order to moderate the above-mentioned shortcomings. Examples of inorganic agents are silver-substituted zeolite, triclosan, and carbendazim. These may be synthetic compounds, but they are organic chemicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8756087912464967">7</xref></sup> The incorporation of antimicrobial agents into plastic film products can be achieved either by coating onto the film surface or blending into the polymer matrices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8756087912464967">8</xref></sup> However, plastic films containing antimicrobial agents also have limits on their service (shelf) life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8756087912464967">9</xref></sup> Silver and silver-based compounds have been extensively investigated for use as antimicrobial agents that are biocompatible and non-toxic to human cells, but that have a deterrent effect against microorganisms when they are well-dispersed and non-agglomerated in plastic matrices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-8756087912464967">10</xref></sup> When comparing silver and silver-based compounds with other metals (gold, copper, lead, and zinc), silver exhibits higher toxicity to microorganisms and lower toxicity to mammalian cells. The release of silver ions enables inhibition of microbial activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8756087912464967">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8756087912464967">12</xref></sup> It has been suggested that the particle size of the silver can affect antimicrobial performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8756087912464967">13</xref></sup> That is, if the size of the silver particles was decreased down to the nanoscale level (e.g. 12–16 nm), their antibacterial efficacy would increase due to greater total surface area per unit volume. Sung et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8756087912464967">14</xref></sup> prepared polypropylene (PP) compound supplemented with micro- or nano-sized silver powders, and evaluated the antibacterial activities. They found that the PP compound with nano-sized silver exhibited much better antimicrobial performance than the compound with micro-sized silver. Apart from the particle size of silver, antimicrobial efficacy is also dependent on the mixing method, contact time, carrier and plastic type, and standard testing method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8756087912464967">15</xref></sup> Pongnop et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8756087912464967">5</xref></sup> examined the effect of incorporating technique on the antibacterial performance of various olefin thermoplastic films containing nano-silver colloids; they found that spray coating was much more effective than dry blending. All neat thermoplastics alone were unable to inhibit <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> growth, except for PVC film. The incorporation of silver particles into the films affected the hydrophilicity of the film surfaces and improved the antibacterial activity. Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8756087912464967">16</xref></sup> found that plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) was an effective method for embedding Ag or Cu in the surface region to enhance the antibacterial properties and contact angle values of medical-grade PE. Dogan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-8756087912464967">17</xref></sup> studied the antibacterial efficiency of aluminum foil coated with silver-supported or zinc-supported zeolite and found that silver-supported zeolite demonstrated better resistance to bacteria only when the silver ions loaded in zeolite exceeded 1% by weight.</p>
<p>The properties, including antimicrobial performance, of plastic film products are expected to change during the course of their shelf life as a result of exposure to oxygen, UV radiation, and heat and mechanical stresses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8756087912464967">9</xref></sup> It is well documented that the structural and mechanical properties of PE and/or PVC films during thermal and UV aging change significantly, and that these two properties have an interrelationship. Shi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756087912464967">2</xref></sup> studied the influence of UV irradiation on the photodegradation mechanism of PVC; they found that as UV aging time increased, PVC exhibited higher polarity, as evidenced by increases in carbonyl, hydroxyl, and hydroperoxide groups. This also indicated that an efficient oxidation on the PVC surface had occurred. Chiellini et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8756087912464967">18</xref></sup> studied the oxidative degradation of LDPE films under accelerated aging conditions and found that contact angle values decreased with increasing aging time. The rate of degradation was greater at higher temperature. Accelerated aging also resulted in higher elastic modulus, with some cracks appearing on the film surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8756087912464967">19</xref></sup> Scaffaro et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8756087912464967">20</xref></sup> studied the effects of aging on the antimicrobial properties of polymers by examining the photo-oxidation behavior of antimicrobial ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA)/nisin film aged by a QUV machine, using <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> as the testing bacteria. They found that the ability to kill the bacteria was reduced with increasing aging time and that the antimicrobial properties eventually disappeared entirely after prolonged aging.</p>
<p>Based on a recent literature review, except for the work of Scaffaro et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8756087912464967">20</xref></sup> there is little information on the effects of environmental conditions, such as heat, UV radiation, and moisture, on the antimicrobial properties of plastic products incorporating antimicrobial agents. These properties are complex and change continuously, not only with aging time but also due to a combination of many factors, such as the type of matrix, type and concentration of antimicrobials, type and level of aging, and temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756087912464967">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8756087912464967">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8756087912464967">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8756087912464967">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8756087912464967">15</xref></sup> However, changes in the antimicrobial properties of plastic materials during their service life (aging) can be explained and understood by monitoring their observable mechanical and structural properties. Moreover, it is essential to know the length of time that an added antibacterial agent would be effective in plastics, and whether the overall properties would change with time under extreme environmental conditions, such as exposure to prolonged heat and UV radiation. Therefore, the primary aim of this work was to study the effects of thermal and UV aging on the antibacterial properties of LLDPE and PVC films containing nano-silver colloid. Surface and morphological properties, as well as mechanical and structural properties of LLDPE and PVC films, were evaluated under the same conditions as for the measurement of antimicrobial properties. The effects of nano-silver colloid content and contact time were of primary interest in evaluating antimicrobial performance. Experiments were conducted using a shake flask method coupled with plate count agar (PCA) technique, with <italic>E. coli</italic> as the test bacteria.</p>

<sec id="sec3-8756087912464967" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>LLDPE (M3804RU(P); Siam Cement Group, Bangkok, Thailand) and PVC (Siamvic 258 RB; Thai Vinyl, Bangkok, Thailand) were used as polymer film matrices. Silver colloid (SNSE; Koventure, Bangkok, Thailand) was employed as the antibacterial agent, and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922) served as the test bacteria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-8756087912464967"><title>Film preparation</title>
<p>The experimental procedures for preparing LLDPE and PVC films with nano-silver colloid were given as follows: LLDPE and PVC were each blended with nano-silver colloid by a dry blending process; the blends were then kept in desiccators for 7 days before being dried in a hot-air oven at a temperature of 40°C. Blend samples were formed into film samples using compression molding technique. Mold pressure, mold temperature, and time were 100 kg.cm<sup>−2</sup>, 180°C, and 5 min, respectively, for LLPE; and 180 kg.cm<sup>−2</sup>, 185°C, and 1 min 30 s, respectively, for PVC. Silver colloid concentrations ranged from 0 to 1000 ppm when blended with LLDPE and from 0 to 300 ppm when blended with PVC. The difference in the amount of silver loaded into the two polymers was based on the results of trial and error tests that yielded 99.9% antibacterial efficacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-8756087912464967"><title>Effects of thermal and UV aging</title>
<p>For thermal aging, LLDPE and PVC blended with nano-silver colloid were placed in a hot-air oven at 50°C for different aging times ranging from 0 to 32 days. Accelerated photodegradation studies were performed using a QUV accelerated weathering tester (Q-Lab, Westlake OH, USA), in accordance with standard test method ASTM G154 (2001). Nano-silver/LLDPE and nano-silver/PVC blends were exposed to ultraviolet A (UV-A) radiation of 0.77 W/m<sup>2</sup>/nm at 60°C for 8 h, and then to condensation at 50°C for 4 h. As with thermal aging, the UV aging time varied from 0 to 32 days.</p>

<sec id="sec6-8756087912464967"><title>Plate count agar test</title>
<p>The plate count agar method was used for quantitative assessment of bacteria reduction, following the standard of ASTM E-2149 (2001). Prepared films were cut into 5 × 5 cm<sup>2</sup> samples. Nutrient broth (NB) was used as a growth medium for <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria in overnight inoculums. After diluting the medium with peptone solution (1 g/L peptone, pH 6.8–7.2), bacteria were cultivated at 37°C for 24 h. The initial suspended bacteria of 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL were placed into 250 mL flasks containing 50 mL of peptone solution; film specimens were then added to each flask. Flasks were shaken on a reciprocal shaker at a speed of 100 r/min at 37°C ± 0.5°C for contact times of 30, 90, 150, and 210 min. A tenfold serial dilution was then conducted until the bacteria colony were in the range of 30 to 300 colonies by dropping suspension bacteria (100 µL) onto agar in sterile Petri dishes. The inoculated plates were cultured at 37°C ± 0.5°C for 24 h; then the viable cell count and percentage reduction of bacteria (<italic>R</italic>) were calculated using equation (1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8756087912464967">5</xref></sup>:

<p>Contact angle measurement can be used to indicate quantitative changes in wettability, sensitivity, surface chemistry, roughness and/or degradation of polymers doped with silver colloid. Contact angles of deionized water on LLDPE or PVC doped with nano-silver colloid were assessed before and after thermal aging and QUV accelerated weathering, using a contact angle goniometer (model 100-00; Ramé-hart Instrument Co., Succasunna NJ, USA). The contact angle values reported in this work were the average values from five independent determinations for each sample.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-8756087912464967">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-8756087912464967">2</xref> show the effect of nano-silver colloid content on antibacterial performance, expressed in terms of viable cell count and percentage reduction (%<italic>R</italic>) of bacteria, for LLDPE and PVC films using various contact times. The viable cell count increased with increasing contact time for LLDPE, whereas the opposite effect was observed for PVC. Additionally, PVC with nano-silver content of 100 ppm exhibited bacteriostatic behavior, while bactericidal behavior was evident with nano-silver loadings of 200 ppm or greater. The increase in viable cell count for LLDPE indicated that the growth rate of <italic>E. coli</italic> was faster than the killing rate of nano-silver. The results of %bacteria reduction corresponded to those of viable cell count. The %<italic>R</italic> of <italic>E. coli</italic> for LLDPE and PVC films under contact times from 0 to 210 min appeared to improve. The maximum %<italic>R</italic> for LLDPE was 54.7%, obtained with nano-silver content of 300 ppm and 210 min contact time; whereas the maximum %<italic>R</italic> for PVC was 99.9%, obtained with nano-silver content of 200 ppm and 150 min contact time. It should again be noted that different nano-silver loadings were used in LLDPE and PVC films, based on a determination of the optimum concentrations of nano-silver to achieve the maximum %<italic>R</italic> value, 99.9%. No attempt was made to compare the antibacterial performance of LLDPE and PVC films for any given nano-silver content. The differences in silver content and contact time for obtaining the maximum %bacteria reduction suggest that nano-silver colloid in PVC was more effective at killing bacteria. This may be associated with a dehydrochlorination reaction in PVC resin during the preparation of PVC film in a hydraulic press,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8756087912464967">21</xref></sup> where chlorine atoms residing in PVC film migrate to the film surface and enhance its bactericidal properties. This is substantiated by Julia et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-8756087912464967">22</xref></sup> who dipped broccoli florets into chloride solutions and found a considerable reduction of <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria, and by Min et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-8756087912464967">23</xref></sup> who synthesized AgCl nanoparticles by ion exchange reaction between silver nitrate and HCl vapor and found the AgCl would have taken part in killing <italic>E. coli</italic> and caused the percentage <italic>E. coli</italic> reduction for the PVC film.

</fig></p>
<p>One of the possible reasons that LLDPE with nano-silver could not obtain 99.9% reduction of bacteria was an under-dosage of nano-silver in LLDPE. Therefore, the loading of nano-silver to the LLDPE was increased to 1000 ppm; the results are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-8756087912464967">Figure 3</xref>. It can be seen that although a relatively high dosage of nano-silver was used, the maximum %bacteria reduction was still only 84.4%. The LLDPE matrix may act as barrier against nano-silver migrating to the film surface.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-8756087912464967">Figure 4</xref> shows that changes in color (<italic>L*, a*, b*</italic>) for LLDPE film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-8756087912464967">Figure 4(a)</xref>) and PVC film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-8756087912464967">Figure 4(b)</xref>) were influenced by thermal and QUV aging. It was observed that the initial <italic>L*</italic> (lightness) of PVC film was less than that of LLDPE film. The addition of silver colloid to PVC films did not affect the lightness but significantly decreased the lightness of LLDPE film. This was because silver particles have opaque properties, which were experimentally measured in this work to be <italic>L*</italic> = 12.6, <italic>a*</italic> = −2.55, and <italic>b*</italic> = 3.84. Adding nano-silver colloid would hence be expected to decrease the lightness of LLDPE. In the case of PVC, the unchanged lightness was caused by the fact that PVC under thermal or QUV aging is likely to degrade via a dehydrochlorination reaction, which generates polyene and carbonyl sequences and turns the PVC itself to a brown color.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-8756087912464967">24</xref></sup> The color change due to polyene generation appears to suppress any color change caused by the addition of nano-silver. This explains why the color of PVC film did not change with increasing nano-silver content. The values of <italic>a*</italic> and <italic>b*</italic> of LLDPE and PVC films did not change with nano-silver content. Thermal aging had a slight effect on the values of <italic>a</italic>* and <italic>b</italic>*, but the differences were in the range of experimental error (±2.5%).

Elongation at break exhibited some sensitivity to the effects of nano-silver content as well as thermal and QUV aging, whereas tensile modulus and tensile strength were unchanged. This finding corresponds well with the work of Scaffaro et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8756087912464967">20</xref></sup> who found that the elongation at break of EVA supplemented with nisin was reduced with increasing UV aging time. In the present study, increasing silver loading resulted in a reduction of elongation at break, the effect being more pronounced for PVC film. QUV aging had a comparatively greater impact on the decrease in elongation at break than thermal aging. The reduction in elongation at break directly suggested that the addition of nano-silver colloid and QUV/thermal aging increased the brittleness of LLDPE and PVC films.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-8756087912464967">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-8756087912464967">7</xref> show the effects of type of aging and aging time on %<italic>R</italic> of <italic>E. coli</italic> for LLDPE and PVC films containing two selected loadings of nano-silver colloid. Generally, it was found that QUV aging had a greater effect than thermal aging on the antibacterial performance of LLDPE and PVC films. For LLDPE film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-8756087912464967">Figure 6</xref>), thermal aging did not seem to affect the antibacterial performance; the effect of nano-silver loading was much more pronounced. This may be because LLDPE itself is a thermally stable thermoplastic, especially at the low temperature used for thermal aging (50°C) in this work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-8756087912464967">25</xref></sup> Interestingly, LLDPE film subjected to a QUV test exhibited lower antibacterial activity, as evidenced by a significant drop in the %<italic>R</italic> of bacteria with aging time. This could be explained by investigating the surface property changes of LLDPE film after thermal and QUV aging. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-8756087912464967">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-8756087912464967">9</xref> show the SEM micrographs of sample surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-8756087912464967">Figure 8(a)–(c)</xref>) and contact angle values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-8756087912464967">Figure 9(a)</xref>) before and after thermal and QUV aging. It can be seen that no changes in the physical-morphological surface or contact angle value were caused by thermal aging. However, the surface morphologies appeared to change with increased QUV aging time, together with a progressive reduction in contact angle value. This indicated the presence of cracks in the LLDPE film, allowing nano-silver to migrate to the film surface. However, during the condensation cycle in QUV aging, the emerged or migrated nano-silver may have been washed away by water. Therefore, the ability of the nano-silver particles to kill the bacteria was reduced.

<p>In the case of PVC film, similar behavior was observed. Thermal aging had no impact on the antibacterial performance, whereas QUV aging worsened the performance. However, it is interesting to note that although the antibacterial performance of PVC film with nano-silver was lowered by QUV aging, the percentage reduction of bacteria (%<italic>R</italic>) still approached 99.9% in most cases (aging times). When compared with LLDPE film, the %<italic>R</italic> values for PVC film were much greater for any given thermal and QUV aging times. This can be explained by the differences in surface property changes of PVC and LLDPE films (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-8756087912464967">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-8756087912464967">9</xref>). It can be seen that the changes in surface morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-8756087912464967">Figure 8(d)–(f)</xref>) and contact angle reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-8756087912464967">Figure 9(b)</xref>) for PVC film after thermal and QUV aging were more significant than those for LLDPE film, suggesting that more nano-silver particles were able to migrate to the surface and kill the bacteria. The reduction of contact angle value indicates higher hydrophilicity of the film.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8756087912464967">16</xref></sup> In addition, during thermal and QUV aging, although the temperatures used were low (50–60°C), this was sufficient for PVC to undergo a dehydrochlorination reaction, producing chlorine atoms that promoted the bactericidal ability against <italic>E. coli</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-8756087912464967">22</xref></sup> This is why the %<italic>R</italic> values for PVC film were still higher after QUV aging.</p>

<sec id="sec17-8756087912464967" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The effects of thermal and QUV aging on the antibacterial performance of LLDPE and PVC films containing nano-silver colloid were studied. <italic>E. coli</italic> cell count increased with increasing contact time for LLDPE film, but the opposite behavior was observed for PVC film. The structural change of PVC film during processing played an important role in the antibacterial performance of the final film product. The maximum %bacteria reduction for LLDPE was 54.7%, obtained with nano-silver loading of 300 ppm and 210 min contact time; whereas, the %<italic>R</italic> for PVC reached 99.9% against <italic>E. coli</italic> with nano-silver content of 200 ppm and a contact time of 150 min. The addition of silver colloid to PVC films did not affect the lightness, but it significantly decreased the lightness of LLDPE film. The addition of nano-silver colloid, together with aging, increased the brittleness of the LLDPE and PVC films; only elongation at break was reduced by the addition of nano-silver. Aging by QUV had a comparatively greater effect than thermal aging on the antibacterial performance of LLDPE and PVC films. QUV aging was observed to worsen the killing performance against <italic>E. coli</italic>, the effect being more pronounced in LLDPE film.</p>
