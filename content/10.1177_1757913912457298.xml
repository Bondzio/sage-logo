<p>Professor Sir Alexander Wiseman Macara, Sandy to his many friends, sadly passed away on 21<sup>st</sup> June after a long struggle against bowel cancer. He died peacefully at home with his family. On behalf of the Council, and RSPH members and staff, we extend our deepest sympathies to Sandy’s wife, Lady Sylvia, and to their two children, Alexandra and James.</p>
<p>Sandy Macara completed his medical training at Glasgow University, followed by postgraduate public health studies at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In due course he and his family moved to Bristol, where he became Consultant Senior Lecturer in Public Health and Epidemiology at the University.</p>
<p>The son and grandson of Church of Scotland Ministers, Sandy had a clear view of what was right and just. This, together with the poverty so evident during his childhood, led to his unwavering commitment to public health, social justice, and a reduction in health inequalities. He was quite prepared to take on the ‘monstrous and cynical’ tobacco industry, doing more than his fair share to secure the legislation that led to smoke-free public places. Research just released shows that 37% of ex-smokers say that the ban introduced on 1<sup>st</sup> July 2007 helped them to quit. What a legacy! Sandy Macara was also an unswerving champion for the NHS, criticising the introduction of the internal market in the mid 1990s as an ‘infernal bazaar’.</p>
<p>His public pronouncements and rhetorical style led to his appointment as Chair of the British Medical Association (BMA). Widely regarded as one of the most successful BMA Chairs in recent times the immediate past Chair, Hamish Meldrum, commented: <italic>“It is terribly sad to hear about Sandy’s death. The profession has lost a great doctor and the BMA has lost one of its leading figures over the last 30 years.”</italic></p>
<p>Sandy was an extraordinary man, a giant in both public health and health care. He possessed both courage and wisdom, a rare combination by themselves. Combined with his detailed knowledge of health policy and an intellect sharper than a surgeon’s scalpel, he will always be remembered as a ‘mover and shaker’. A powerful advocate, a mediator when necessary, and someone who just got things done!</p>
<p>But Sandy also had another side. Warm hearted and sociable, he was considerate and kind to colleagues in need of support. Many a public health professional has cause to be grateful to Sandy at a difficult time in their career. However, Sandy was able to move seamlessly from individual to institutional support, championing the National Heart Forum of which he was Chair and then President for over thirteen years.</p>
<p>Besides playing an active role during the refurbishment of 28 Portland Place during the days of the Royal Institute of Public Health, he also did much to support the RSPH behind the scenes following the merger of the RIPH and the Royal Society of Health in October 2008. Chief Executive of the RSPH Richard Parish knew Sandy Macara well: <italic>“I have lost a dear friend and mentor. Public health has lost a leader and champion. And the world has lost one of the most generous and decent people it has been my privilege to know”.</italic></p>
<p>A memorial service will be held on 15th October 2012 at St Pancras Parish Church, Euston Road, London, NW1 2BA at 11am.</p>

<p>Professor Richard Parish, Chief Executive of the Royal Society for Public Health joined members from the NHS, local government and third sector at a recent <italic>Guardian</italic> public health seminar.</p>
<p>The <italic>Guardian</italic> public health debate, the second in a series, looked at both the opportunities and the risks presented when public health becomes part of local councils’ responsibilities from next April. The event heard from four experts, including Professor Parish, and who also answered questions from audience members drawn from the sector.</p>
<p>Professor Parish spoke of the public health challenges facing public health professionals in the coming years, including: lifestyle-related issues such as obesity; the threat of communicable diseases, such as pandemic flu; and also the effects of climate change, including floods. He emphasised that the priority for the new era is to get a core of services that are consistent across England.</p>
<p>Professor Parish stressed the potential advantages for public health in becoming part of a local council that is already involved in the field through its responsibility for education, social care, local planning and economic sustainability. Yet he did offer a note of caution, voicing concern that not all local authorities understand what is needed of them.</p>
