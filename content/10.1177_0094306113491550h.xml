<p>This admirable introduction demonstrates that, in contrast to the often-cited refrain, there are indeed those “who still read Parsons.” Luckily for us, Sandro Segre is among them. With this slim volume, Segre has managed to condense Parsons’ theoretical framework and intellectual development into an accessible format that should prove valuable to those seeking to explore his work. And there are important reasons why sociologists should. Parsons was one of the most influential social theorists of the past century, and his ideas regarding human action, social integration, and the functionalist approach more generally, continue to shape sociological research. While the “general theory,” which he championed, has been subjected to sharp criticism since the 1960s, the sensibility underlying Parsons’ approach remains very much a part of the sociological landscape. Whatever one’s theoretical inclination, it would behoove practicing sociologists to develop some familiarity with Parsonian structural functionalism.</p>
<p>Segre’s introduction supplies a useful reference to consider before tackling Parsons’ formidable <italic>oeuvre</italic>. The book’s six chapters provide a roadmap to Parsons’ conceptual apparatus, major works, and research, as well as, offer an assessment of its reception throughout the twentieth century. Chapter One supplies an overview of the concepts and theories developed by Parsons and orients the reader to a highly abstract theoretical system. The next three chapters consider the key stages of Parsons’ intellectual development. The first period (1928–1937) covers Parsons’ study of classical European social theorists and his early formulation of a voluntaristic theory of action. Segre identifies the years from 1938 to 1963 as a second period covering the mature development of a unitary theory of action and the pattern-variable framework. The final period (1964–1979) sees the application and extension of these ideas by Parsons to consider evolution and change in social systems. During this time, Parsons especially turned his attention to changes in American society, considering such topics as education, the integration of classes and racial groups, and individualism. The last two chapters delve into Parsons’ research on specific themes and interpretations of his work toward the end of the last century. Chapter Seven rebuts the charge that Parsons failed to apply his ideas to empirical research by describing his work on German fascism, the professionalization of the university system, and ethnic inequality. The concluding chapter reviews responses to Parsons’ work by a varied group of scholars including Charles Camic, Pierre Bourdieu, Jeffrey Alexander, and Anthony Giddens.</p>
<p>All told, this volume offers a fine introduction to a theorist who remains influential to the discipline. The book is an appropriate resource for upper-level courses in contemporary sociological theory or for anyone seeking to familiarize themselves with the work of Talcott Parsons.</p>
