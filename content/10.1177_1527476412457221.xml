<abstract>
<p>In the aftermath of the 2011 UK riots, two main themes emerged in public discourse: (a) that the riots were criminal and materialistic in intent and linked to the reality television driven “miswanting” of poor youth and (b) that the riots were a manifestation of a national crisis generated by the absence of public and civic responsibility among (female) denizens of public housing estates. The author argues that, far from telling us about the cultures of poor youth, reality television programs, notably those produced by the BBC, elucidate the agenda of political elites driving “Austerity Britain” to “harden” the views of British citizens against the poor and marginalized. She explores the new harsh realism of <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> identifying a shift from the earlier left-wing concerns of the British social-realist movement, toward a right-wing sensibility, which has coincided with significant changes to state policy toward the most vulnerable segments of Britain’s population.</p>

<p>As we watch the reports online and on television news, there is a sense in which this has become the latest reality television, and the mobs running through the streets, smashing windows, looting stores and setting the cities aflame like a modern day Atlanta, have become participants and—in their own eyes—the latest celebrities. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412457221">Henwood 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On August 6, 2011, local protests triggered by the shooting death of a young black man by police in the area of Tottenham, London, ended in a riot. As news of the events in Tottenham spread across Britain, young people took to the streets and riots broke out in London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Nottingham, Bristol, and elsewhere, lasting five days, causing significant damage to property and resulting in one thousand arrests and three deaths. The response of largely conservative political elites to the riots invoked the three great themes of British civil strife since World War II—state-sponsored violent suppression of protest, public housing, and the politics of consumption promoted by a neoliberal society. I would contend that no other contemporary cultural form has emerged to rival UK television’s historical capacity to speak to these themes, and therefore it is no surprise that reality television is invoked in Melanie Henwood’s account (which I quote as typical of media comment) in this context.</p>
<p>Henwood, as with other 2011 media commentators, condemns the young rioters, not only as undisciplined <italic>consumers</italic> of new, and “immoral” forms of media—notably reality television—but also as amateur <italic>producers</italic> of new forms of mediatized texts, in which they see themselves become “visible” to the larger public. The Conservative Work and Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan-Smith, reinforced this view, commenting that “the obsession with celebrity culture in Britain driven by shows such as <italic>The X Factor</italic> has inspired ‘materialistic consumerism’ among Britain’s poor youth, and is a root cause of the Riots” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1527476412457221"><italic>The Telegraph Reporter</italic> 2011</xref>). Implicit in this discourse is the notion that reality television is somehow “not quite British.” The rhetoric of right-wing commentators such as Duncan-Smith connects popular forms of television consumption to working-class “hedonism.” Well-meaning left-wing critiques of cultures of consumption among postindustrial British youth can also promote “bourgeois puritanism,” and give it scientific credence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527476412457221">S. Hall et al. 2008</xref>, 213).</p>
<p>The constant vilification, denigration, and humiliation of poor British youth, and their cultures, are odd features of the UK press, and are complemented by the equally negative and fearful portrayal of them in hit British “hoody horror genre” films such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476412457221"><italic>Eden Lake</italic> (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527476412457221"><italic>F</italic> (2011)</xref>, and, most viciously, in British comedy series such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476412457221"><italic>Little Britain</italic> (2003–2006)</xref>. Against this background, there is no surprise in the fact that young poor people, like the UK rioters, should make reckless and hopeless gestures toward what French social theorist Henri Lefevbre calls “a sort of fame” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412457221">1991</xref>, 247), misrecognized as “celebrity” by elites. Social critical theorist Stanley Cohen argues that the history of social control in the United Kingdom is masked by two kinds of transformations: the transparent/real and the opaque and illusory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412457221">1985</xref>, 76–90), and it is this second I am concerned with here. The representation of the riots as criminal and materialistic in intent masks the policy origins of social deprivation and policing cultures targeting non-white youth that were foundational to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527476412457221"><italic>The Guardian</italic>/London School of Economics 2011</xref>). In this article, I argue that, far from telling us much about the cultures of poor youth, reality television programs, notably those produced by the national broadcaster, the BBC, have much to say about the agenda of the political elites driving “Austerity Britain”—an agenda that has as its core objective the “hardening” of the views of British citizens against the poor and the marginalized. This hardening of attitude has been gendered in significant ways.</p>
<p>Although a majority of the rioters were men, in media representations, young girls caught up in the riots, or young women connected to rioters, and, overwhelmingly, mothers of young people involved in the riots, became the scapegoats onto which the hatred of the nation was projected. As national media accounts of the riots unfolded, the rioters came to be increasingly described as having emerged into the public high streets from proximate social-housing estates. The moral degeneration of these “communities,” misrecognized as the cause of the riots, was attributed to women, particularly the “single” mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527476412457221">Platell 2010</xref>). Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron specifically targeted the segment of the rioters who were denizens of social housing by threatening to remove all their benefits and to evict not only the young rioters but also their nonparticipant families from their homes. In peddling his dose of hard reality to these people, Cameron told journalists that life would be “tougher” for evicted tenants, but “they should have thought about that before” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1527476412457221">Wintour and Topping 2011</xref>). Reality television “star,” the New Charter Housing Trust in Manchester (which had been featured in <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic>, a program of concern to this essay) joined in, reassuring “tenants that New Charter Housing Trust Group strongly support the Police in bringing <italic>the criminals</italic> to justice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527476412457221">New Charter Housing Trust Group 2011a</xref>, emphasis added). It could be said that Cameron’s actions were indicative of what Giorgio Agamben has called a “state of exception” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1527476412457221">Ticineto-Clough and Willse 2011</xref>, 7), an exceptional moment of crisis in which the rioters and all who belong to them are put outside the law. Critics of Agamben contend that, far from exceptional, so-called “emergency laws” categorized as indicative of a moment of crisis are in general neither “temporary nor categorically distinct from larger state practices” (Hussain quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1527476412457221">Ticineto-Clough and Willse 2011</xref>, 7). Agreeing with this criticism in the UK context, I would contend that there is clearly a thread of continuity between the current situation and the long and violent history of elite practices in relation to the social right to the poor to shelter and space in the United Kingdom, and that we can see this if we examine the television cultures that precede the riots. In Britain, reality television emerges as the key form in which the notion of the social-housing estate as lifestyle choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476412457221">Doughty 2010</xref>) for the undeserving (female) poor is promoted.</p>

<title>Postdigital “Slumming”: From Social Realism to Hard Realism</title>
<p>A look at the TV schedules tells us that the average British viewer of the state channels is an avid consumer of media-driven representations of poverty and of poor people, particularly those living on council housing estates. The majority of these representations congregate in the form of reality television, although they may be classified as “observational documentary” by their promoters. London-based professional/executive (white and mostly married) male audiences, the target audience of postdigital BBC1 &amp; 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1527476412457221">Thinkbox 2011</xref>), it seems, enjoy “realism,” although not critical realism, as long as it gives them a “window to other worlds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412457221">Bennett et al. 2008</xref>, 138). This kind of reality TV is particularly attractive if it can allow these audiences to indulge in what I call postdigital slumming—a chance to observe the poor and the working-class failing as parents, as residents, as owners of pets, as household managers, or as holders of menial jobs. In this article, I explore the new harsh-realism of <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic>, aired on the BBC2 in 2010 and 2011, with reference to two other recent series, <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476412457221">BBC1 2008–2011</xref>) and <italic>The Scheme</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412457221">BBC1 2010–2011</xref>), screened in a similar post <italic>Newsnight</italic> slot on the same channel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527476412457221">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> is made by Raw TV productions for BBC Scotland and produced by Lucy Willis. Each series (comprising 4-hr-long episodes) reached audiences of 2.5 million. It also had a very successful repeat run on BBC2 in the same slot in March 2012. Initially, the program included representations of the housing officer as a sort of benevolent social worker, but as the series progressed, storylines were hooked on very invasive depictions of, and the subsequent eviction of, “undesirable” tenants by a force described as the “enforcement team” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1527476412457221">Willis 2010</xref>). The series is set in housing estates owned by a number of landlord associations (New Charter Housing, Housing Pendle, Oldham la, Aksa Housing Association, and First Choice Homes Oldham) in Manchester, in the North West of England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527476412457221">Land 2011</xref>). It is worth noting that Raw TV has been involved in the making of other recession-driven reality television shows such as <italic>Ultimate Guide to Penny Pinching</italic> for Channel 4 and <italic>Gold Rush Alaska</italic> for US Discovery Channel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527476412457221">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic> was made in 2008 and attracted over a million viewers. Directed by Michelle Friel and Julian Kean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476412457221">2011</xref>), and produced by Friel Kean films, BBC describes it as “a documentary series filmed over a year in Scotland’s only women’s prison, which reveals an intimate and often shocking portrait of jail life” (aired on the BBC2 in 2011). Set in the state-run Corton Vale Prison, and narrated by Steven Wren, this short series comprises three 1-hr episodes, and includes scenes of the council estates from which prisoners came and to which they (briefly) return. In each episode, we are introduced to key characters. The program hinges on the individual’s trajectory as they reap the consequences of their actions outside, and inside, the prison; officers are our guides as to which prisoners deserve our sympathy and which do not. As with <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic>, we learn nothing about the private lives of the professionals involved—only the women inmates.</p>
<p>The same team behind <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic> made <italic>The Scheme</italic>, which also attracted high viewership. Set in an Ayrshire housing scheme, the series is described on the BBC website as “a documentary series following the dramatic highs and lows of daily life for six different families all living in one large housing scheme in Kilmarnock” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412457221">BBC1 2010–2011</xref>). A large number of the narrative strands in <italic>The Scheme</italic> focus on young women and girls. These women are portrayed, variously, as drug or alcohol addicted, involved with or sheltering “unsuitable” men, engaging in disorderly behavior, “irresponsibly” pregnant, or failing to engage with work or school.</p>

<title>From “Social Realism” to “Hard Realism”</title>
<p>In spite of the filmic quality of these programs, and their high production values, they reflect many of the features of global reality TV subgenres, particularized here in the context of a BBC public service remit and a surveillance operation openly carried out on behalf of landlords and of the state. This type of “public interest” reality television, which I believe to be new and specific to Britain, moves away from the fantasy and makeover aspects of commercial genres, and combines British “social-realist” aesthetics and a focus on ordinary people of limited economic means, with a harsh and punitive perspective. To examine this shift, it is worth looking at the historical connections between the evolution of British social realism in documentary film and television and the BBC as public service broadcaster.</p>
<p>In the postwar period, the UK Parliament, in return for the license fee, demanded that national broadcasters show a minimum of social seriousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1527476412457221">Walker 1986</xref>, 369). The so-called “Tuesday documentary” type program was mandatory for all the ITV networks, as well as for the BBC. One format, which lent itself to social seriousness in a cost-efficient and timely way, was the “news interpretation” format that gave young filmmakers like John Gold, director of 300–400 episodes of <italic>Tonight</italic> for the BBC from 1958 to 1964, Tony Garnett, and Ken Loach the means to make television programs on the subjects that interested them in six months, where an equivalent film would take six years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1527476412457221">Walker 1986</xref>, 369). The opening up of television to this new talent was paralleled by advances in technology, notably with the more mobile Arriflex cameras with transistorized sound synchronization. The effect of this technology was that the program makers were able to achieve even closer contact with their subjects. These filmmakers pioneered the kind of approach to subjects that has become a hallmark of reality television, and sought to achieve the same effect of “reality,” however constructed, as the items on the news that preceded their dramas—the postnews slot was thus essential to this project. As Gold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1527476412457221">Walker 1986</xref>, 371) put it, “up to then one had to ask people to repeat things for the cameras: now they could ‘behave’ more normally because they were less aware of me and asked to do less.” Gold, best known for his feature film, <italic>The Bofors Gun</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1527476412457221">1968</xref>), claims he was the first to use handheld cameras on television (the cine-verite-technique). Gold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1527476412457221">Walker 1986</xref>, 371) argues that his commitment to “not swerving away from painful social realties” is as a result of having “this Puritan thing.”</p>
<p>The painful reality of the politics of public housing has long been a concern of British television makers. This interest is in marked contrast to the US documentary, where the politics of public-state-sponsored housing has, with the notable exception of direct-cinema advocate Frederick Wiseman’s <italic>Public Housing</italic> (Wiseman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1527476412457221">1997</xref>), not attracted much interest among mainstream film and television makers. In the United Kingdom, however, historically, public housing has consistently been a theme of the radical left, and as such has provided British television with documentaries such as Ken Loach’s <italic>Cathy Come Home</italic> (aired on the BBC in 1966), dramas such as Alan Bleasedale’s <italic>The Boys from the Blackstuff</italic> (aired on the BBC in 1982), and soap-opera narratives such as Phil Redmond’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476412457221"><italic>Brookside</italic> (1982–2003</xref>, Channel 4). The writer of the 1996 BBC drama series <italic>Our Friends in the North</italic>, Peter Flannery, a series considered by many commentators to be one of the greatest masterpieces of twentieth-century television drama, describes it as a 9-hr “epic about post-war British Housing Policy” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412457221">Hearn 2010</xref>, 3).</p>
<p>Flannery’s <italic>Our Friends in the North</italic> took as its dramatic subject the dismantling of public housing from the 1960s to the 1990s. Architectural historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412457221">Lynsey Hanley (2007</xref>, 115) outlines the speed with which “this once cherished center piece of Bevanite socialism was picked apart”—by what she insists is “thoughtlessness”—poor workmanship leading to poor living conditions, Brutalist design, lack of maintenance, and power-crazed council leadership—to “create an architectural/space machine, which traps the angry and exhausted social-housing resident into a perpetual night-time, where the sun never shines, and where every inch of public space seems more threatening than inviting.” In the 1970s and 1980s, as recession deepened, the Conservative British-Local Authority Housing Officers began to concentrate “problem families”—the poorest households that found it hard to cope—together. The result was, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412457221">Hanley (2007</xref>, 115), further alienation, nihilism, and a creeping sense of lawlessness.</p>
<p>Since the era of <italic>Our Friends in the North</italic>, the public housing narrative, with some rare exceptions, has become almost totally dominated by right-wing rhetoric. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412457221">Hanley (2007</xref>, 5) writes, “Council estates are nothing to be scared of unless you are frightened of inequality,” the modern housing estate of the national imagination is the one that has affected state policy. To date, it would seem, the left have failed to develop a form capable of countering the concentrationary tendencies of right-wing biopolitics as manifested in dominant media cultures. Loach and Garnett wanted <italic>Cathy Come Home</italic> to lead to the nationalizing of the building industry and home ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1527476412457221">Walker 1986</xref>, 376). In spite of the furor generated by the program, it did not result in any real or significant change in government policy. To elicit sympathy for the plight of the homeless working class and to dispel notions of homelessness as a product of individual fecklessness or social pathologies, Loach’s protagonists are “white” English and in poorly paid work; Cathy is not the benefit single mother of the tabloid imaginary. A further weakness in the narrative is its feminization of the forces that conspire against the young couple—the domineering mother-in-law, the nasty nurse, the puritanical trustee of the shelter, the social worker who takes Cathy’s children from her. This characterization facilitates an emotional response premised on misogyny, rather than political awareness. In a like manner, <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic> ultimately reproduces, rather than critiques, neoliberal notions of lifestyle, choice, and more problematically, the prisoner as unit.</p>
<p>Just as the much earlier <italic>Cathy Come Home</italic> captures the deliberate degradation of the public housing stock that preceded the marketization of state shelter for the poor, <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic> obliquely captures a similar moment in the privatization of prisons. Although Corton Vale is a national prison, its conditions have been allowed to deteriorate to the extent that they are much worse than in the private prisons. This divide is also gendered and corporeal in its effects. In 2011, Brigadier Hugh Monro, Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland, reported that prisoners at Corton Vale are so cramped in cells that they are unable to sleep, that their food is allowed to go cold, that there are 2-hr waits for the toilet, and 16-week waits for emergency dental treatment for inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1527476412457221">Scott 2011</xref>). <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic> downplays the reality of the prison conditions. The program instead attempts to solicit audience sympathy for certain younger prisoners as victims of destiny, but this well-intentioned portrayal backfired, opening the door for right-wing tabloids to call for more, not less, punishment of the women prisoners in their response to the program—<italic>The Sun</italic>, for example, described Corton Vale as a “cushy nick for women” and as a “Travel Lodge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1527476412457221">Reid 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The Monro report found that the majority of women were imprisoned for relatively minor “crimes” (thieving, disorderly behavior)—not something reflected in <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic>, which focuses almost totally on women incarcerated for violent crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1527476412457221">Scott 2011</xref>). This report has had no impact on sentencing. In the context of the privatization of the prison system, the capacity to endlessly extend sentences at the public expense is crucial to the sustainability of prisons as businesses run for profit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527476412457221">D. W. Miller 2010</xref>). The point here is that, like social-housing tenants for landlords, for the private prison, the prisoners are a type of cash crop; it pays the prison owners to keep them inside, with a state guaranteed income. In <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic>, Episode 2, a woman who was sentenced for three years for a drug offense outside the prison gets ten years for a similar drug offense inside the prison.</p>
<p><italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> represents a different type of reality television from the well-meaning (but in fact voyeuristic) <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic> and <italic>The Scheme</italic>. I call this type of program “harsh reality” reality television. <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> is doubly deceptive—Not only does it borrow the social-realist aesthetic and technology of the British left-wing television makers to imbue “quality” to its representations, but in occupying the same postnews slot as the social-realist programs of the past, it also performs a masquerade of “public-mindedness.” It is important to note that the term <italic>social housing</italic> is misleading—In reality, the estates depicted are owned by private landlords, whose profit derives from state benefits in the form of rent paid from the public purse. According to David Rigby, former business director of New Charter turned “housing communications consultant” and series adviser for <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic>, social-housing landlords and their agents, the housing officers, feel that they have been unfairly represented by the national television channels, notably BBC’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1527476412457221"><italic>Panorama: The Great Housing Rip Off</italic> (2010)</xref>, which reported on how the shortage of social housing has led to a boom for private landlords, and by the local press who highlight rack renting, appalling living conditions, and bullying of tenants by social-housing landlords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527476412457221">Land 2011</xref>).

<title>Postdigital Slumming: Watching the Poor Citizen Fail</title>
<p><italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476412457221">BBC1 2011</xref>) makes for uncomfortable viewing. The hallmarks of the social-realist aesthetic, the notion that the unintrusive camera combined with frequent close-up “portraiture” was designed to allow people to behave as they would “normally,” are used here to put people on the spot, and subject them to intense scrutiny. I found Episode 1, Series 2, almost unwatchable in its cruelty toward the young subject. In it, a young male tenant, Steven, is grilled by Ivan Wright, “from the enforcement team” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476412457221">BBC1 2011</xref>) about his difficult past (he had grown up in care) and his “extravagant” keeping of exotic pets (he is only allowed to keep one pet). If Steven thought he would gain sympathy by presenting his case to the public, he was wrong. The camera’s baleful eye hones in on his frustration and despair (described as “abusive behavior” by the BBC) at being subjected to the will of the enforcer for our entertainment. The repeated insets of a shot of his house, which is shot from below, to give it a sinister, secretive aspect, add to the case against him that he is “weird.” Eventually, we learn that he has been forced out. The “harsh reality” reality television format restores the dominant voice-over/commentator of conservative actuality television news, which the socialist-realist pioneers sought to dispense with, preferring self-effacement to strategies of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1527476412457221">Tinney 2011</xref>). In the tabloid press, the range of behaviors condemned by <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> legitimates a view that if you are a council estate resident, and indulge in behaviors that are deemed extravagant or annoying, and if your older children are out and about unsupervised (although many middle-class children are also neglected in this manner), then you are “terrorizing the neighborhood.” In Conservative Party discourse, such behaviors are conceived as the cause of something David Cameron refers to as “Broken Britain” and are represented as a threat to the “nation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527476412457221">Stratton 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The notion of “Broken Britain” reframes behaviors within the private space of the home as criminality within a discourse of US-style public “homeland” security, deploying inflammatory rhetoric that heightens the legitimizing of unlimited state power. Drawing on the theories of William Walters, Imogen Tyler comments,
<disp-quote>
<p>We have been aware for some time that the front line is here, at home. . . . William Walters terms this reconfiguration of the relations between citizen, state and territory “domopolitics”: “a fateful conjunction of home, land and security” which “rationalizes a series of security measures in the name of a particular conception of home.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527476412457221">2010</xref>, 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Tyler’s understanding of “Domopolitics” as a performative politics that employs the rhetoric of home as a means of sanctioning exceptional measures, including the violent subjugation of noncitizens, is useful in the context of reality TV. Integral to this refiguring of the nation and, indeed, of the international order <italic>as a space of homes</italic> is the notion of failing private citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527476412457221">2010</xref>, 7, author’s emphasis).</p>
<p>A marked feature of all of these BBC2 series is that, unlike Channel 4’s <italic>Tower House of Commons</italic>, they are all located in the Northern regions of Britain, and all portray the denizens of the housing estates as predominantly white. BBC2 is currently running yet another reality TV series of the same genre—<italic>The Estate</italic> (BBC Northern Ireland), directed by Natalie Maynes, set in the Ballysally housing estate in Coleraine—in the same time slot. It is useful to note that, while there are extensive council estates in London, as far I can determine, the only form in which the viewer is offered representations of these estates is in the form of quality gangster fiction genres exemplified by, for instance, Channel 4’s <italic>Top Boy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412457221">Bennett et al. 2008</xref>). In my view, the absence of London social-housing estates in the BBC “hard realism” programming is not accidental, and is connected to the biopolitics of a city that operates in service to global elites as it has emerged under the Coalition Government.</p>
<p><italic>The Scheme, Neighbourhood Watched</italic>, and <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic> are, I suggest, televisual performances of the increasing involvement of the early twenty-first century state in domestic spaces and the development of a centralized, rational, and bureaucratic apparatus for control and punishment of citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412457221">S. Cohen 1985</xref>). Key to this social control is the visible segregation (and concentration) of deviants into asylums/enclosed spaces, the central theme of <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic>, but also, although not as obviously, of <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic>.</p>
<p>The Coalition Government’s housing policy, the capping of the amount of rent paid by the state below the going rates in an area, in force since January 2012, has resulted in the concentration of more and more of the poorest public tenants, out of London and other big cities, and into the lowest value housing in the most deprived locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1527476412457221">Wintour 2011</xref>). Young women of little educational and economic means are the most exposed to these policies, and the most “concentrated” in these areas. Their life stories are a key attraction for television “slummers.”</p>
<p>Reflecting on his experience of Buchenwald, David Rousset concluded that “the fact that this universe of the concentration camp exists is not unimportant for the meaning of the universe of ordinary people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412457221">Lefevbre 1991</xref>, 243). Following Rousset, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412457221">Lefevbre (1991</xref>, 243) argues that there is a link between the experience of the camps and what he calls the “logic of the housing estate.” He insists that there is a connection between what he calls “the scientific barbarity” of the camps and the “dehumanized rationality deeply hidden beneath what is absurd and cruel in our modern lives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412457221">1991</xref>, 245). Writing in the context of 1950s France, a decade when French right-wing elites reasserted themselves following their retreat in the initial postwar period, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412457221">Lefevbre (1991</xref>, 245) argues that “if Fascism represents the most extreme form of capitalism, the concentration camp is the most extreme and paroxysmal form of a modern housing estate, or of an industrial town.” Lefevbre’s point deserves emphasis for it involves something important in any consideration of the capitalist housing estate in the twenty-first century United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Identifying a civilizing shift in UK twentieth-century social control, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476412457221">Phil Cohen (1981)</xref> argues that the inflicting of pain moves in its focus from the body to the mind. It would appear, however, that the punishment of the bodies of women and children is once again “allowable” in the context of the “state of exception,” which the UK Coalition Government imagines to have emerged after the Riots in Britain, which is really a return in many ways to the conditions of Victorian Britain. Both <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic> and its BBC3 spin-off <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527476412457221"><italic>Kids Behind Bars</italic> (2011)</xref> contain scenes of violent physical restraint of children by up to four (mostly male) adults, which pass without comment. The act of declaring a “state of exception,” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476412457221">Andrew Benjamin (2011)</xref> has argued, is crucial to the biopolitics of the concentrationary imaginary because it reconfigures the state as a sovereign (not democratic) power with the discretion to pardon or to punish whole swathes of the population on whim. Thus, in spite of the desperately sad life histories of the subjects of these programs, this endless cycle of seemingly socially concerned reality television programs has not resulted in a softening of attitudes toward the people portrayed in them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476412457221">Bubb 2012</xref>). The pleasures of reality TV, I would suggest, are premised on the “sovereign” (and frequently cruel) wish of the viewer vis-à-vis the subjects of the programs. The viewer, like the state, bases this judgment on his observation of the subject—thus dominant specularity, the God-like ability to watch the subject’s every move, is essential to this sovereignty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476412457221">Mark Andrejevic (2009</xref>, 322) has pointed out that the function of reality TV has been to promote surveillance and surveillance technology as an integral part of a twenty-first century lifestyle, centering on the increased blurring of public and private uses of surveillance. This surveillance, it is essential to note, is gendered.</p>
<p>In <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> tenants of the New Charter Housing Association allow housing officers to set up surveillance of the neighboring tenants in their bedrooms and attics, and to gather evidence to evict them—“result!” exults one fan, when this scenario is realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1527476412457221">Stockdale 2011</xref>). Not unlike the inmates of Channel 4’s <italic>Big Brother</italic> camp, tenant Lisa, the female subject of Episode 2, Series 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1527476412457221">Figure 1</xref>), is “reformed” through threat of eviction, although there are no cash prizes waiting at the end. In <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic>, failing to agree to surveillance, and, more importantly, to the screening of material collected by secret filming is not seen as the assertion of a right to privacy—It is seen as an index of the guilt of the subject, who has “something to hide.” In this way, <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> thus reproduces the lethal logic of the witch-dunking pond. The face of Laura, the second of two “disorderly” female tenants depicted in Episode 2, Series 2, is pixelated but she is identified by name, and her fate broadcast. The pixilation has the added advantage for the filmmakers of emphasizing that these are real life, not docudrama subjects. Laura is not only evicted by the enforcers but also is subject to a court order, and runs the risk of imprisonment. The lesson is clear—Either renounce your wicked ways and wear the scarlet letter as a warning to others as Lisa does, or you will be “moved on.”</p>

</fig>
<p>In <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic>, this key term—“moving-on”—suppresses the impact of expulsion from social housing for its dependents. When eventually the “moving on chain” reaches a cul-de-sac—the lowest form of housing—the next step for these women is imprisonment (as for the subjects of <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic>) or the infamous antisocial behavior order (ASBO) camps introduced under Labor Prime Minister Tony Blair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527476412457221">Oliver 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527476412457221">3</xref></sup> The representation of the housing officer in <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> demonstrates that the project of policing and social control in the United Kingdom today has been fragmented, and has increasingly shifted to the petty bureaucratic and technocratic classes in private organizations, who have been given ever greater powers of surveillance, incarceration, and control of citizens, powers that are not subject to the rigorous regulations applied to public bodies. Readers of <italic>Inside Housing</italic>, an independent, online journal for those with a professional interest in UK housing matters, were perplexed at the lack of any apparent regulation or check on the New Charter housing officer’s power, as depicted in the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1527476412457221">Stockdale 2011</xref>). They were also concerned at the speed at which <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> depicted a cycle of infraction-warning-repeat infraction-serving of court order-eviction-prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1527476412457221">Stockdale 2011</xref>). The form of each episode of the program is goal driven and collapses temporality to provide a speedy resolution to the tensions generated by the narrative while throwing off the painful inhibitors of due process or principles of natural justice for the tenant. Drawing on a discourse of crisis, Cameron called for “fast-tracking” eviction of the families of rioters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527476412457221"><italic>The Guardian</italic>/London School of Economics 2011</xref>), a case of the law mimicking <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic>. In reality, the state of exception produced by the riots was a combination of old and new “the product of the proliferation of new laws passed and regulations passed in an ad-hoc or tactical manner, and the use of older laws” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1527476412457221">Ticineto-Clough and Willse 2011</xref>, 6). The incarceration of those targeted by the state as responsible for the disorder associated with the 2011 Riots perfectly demonstrates Andrea Smith’s view of the biopolitics of the governance, violence and exception, as continuity, not exception. April Miller, writing on 1920s popular press reporting of celebrity female criminal cases, demonstrates that the media presentation of such cases, where the skewed public record in the newspapers diminishes any clear understanding of the person behind the personality, can become an “integral component for critiquing and evolving a system of penalty used for managing the modern female offender” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527476412457221">2011</xref>, 78–9). I would argue that the promotion of social disintegration and the punishment of the female offender’s family are central to that management in neoliberal discourse.</p>
<p>At no stage does <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> link the practices of the housing officers themselves to the production of localized disequilibrium and intergenerational conflict and breakdowns in community relationships. As readers of <italic>Inside Housing</italic> also noted, the program fails to engage critically with the issues of density of housing and cramped living space, combined with lack of investment in appropriate structures such as sound insulation (walls are paper thin) and of amenities and alternative spaces for social gathering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1527476412457221">Stockdale 2011</xref>). There is an important difference between the urban ghetto and the world of the privately owned social-housing estate. The problem with the older (prewar/pre-Thatcher) working-class neighborhoods, a problem solved by Conservative Housing Policy, was the spatial facilitation of social cohesion as a force of resistance and of agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476412457221">P. Cohen 1981</xref>, 132–68). Furthermore, in the older working-class urban communities, disapproval of the peer group acted as an effective brake on the kind of nuisance behaviors, such as late-night noise, fighting, dumping in gardens, and ownership of aggressive pets, which make life difficult among neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527476412457221">Hoggart 1957</xref>, 57–85).</p>
<p>In spite of their obvious social benefits, strong family ties and community ties, where they exist outside the patriarchal unit, the primary social unit of capitalism, are typically represented in all three of these programs as a liability: “In the 4th episode of series 2, Housing Officer Sandra Proctor ‘faces a dilemma’—the homeless grandson of an elderly tenant has moved in, against the rules, and now will not leave his grandmother in peace” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1527476412457221">Willis 2010</xref>). The weakness of the woman in this scenario is that she wants to keep seeing her grandson. The viewer joins the other neighbors in keeping close watch on her so that she does not weaken. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412457221">Lefevbre (1991</xref>, 152) questions bourgeois assumptions about, and contempt for, the social “promiscuity” of the “masses,” notions that are premised on bourgeois ideals of individualism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412457221">Lefevbre (1991</xref>, 152) contends that this individualism is nothing more than “the dreary, ludicrous repetition of individuals who are curiously similar in their way of being themselves, their way of keeping themselves to themselves, their speech, their gestures, their everyday habits.” Failing to “keep yourself to yourself” in <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> is failing to adhere to ideals of successful bourgeois citizenship, and punishable by eviction and worse.</p>
<p>Critics of <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> said that the housing officer involved set up the two women for the program, given that he had selected these young mothers to move into a nice house (bound to provoke viewer anger) far from their families, and into an estate populated by pensioners, in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1527476412457221">Stockdale 2011</xref>). The role of the housing officer in the selection process is key to understanding the “rational irrationality,” thoughtlessness and lack of accountability in modern social-housing policy. The viewer is invited to share the frustrations of housing manager Karen Hyland (Episode 4, Series 2) when her “ambitious three-way (house) swap” plan collapses in the face of opposition from the tenants selected for the swap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1527476412457221">Willis 2010</xref>). The landlord has the power to withhold and give consent to these “swaps,” but the tenant does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1527476412457221">New Charter Housing Trust Group 2011b</xref>). In October 2011, the BBC heavily promoted the Coalition Government’s “swap your home for a job” scheme in its TV and radio news programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476412457221"><italic>BBC Radio 4</italic> 2011</xref>). Although not made explicit, the implication is that failing to “volunteer” to swap to another area to take up a low paid job away from friends and family, in another region, could result in benefits being cut, and could be used as grounds for eviction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1527476412457221">Wintour 2011</xref>, 4). Clearly, the new “swap your home” scheme reflects an understanding of housing for those of few economic means as short term, transient, and a luxury that Austerity Britain can no longer afford.</p>
<p>Michael Zimmerman’s argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1527476412457221">2000</xref>, 276–78) that the deportation and murder of the Roma under National Socialism was driven by the intersection of national elite interests with the interests of local bureaucrats, aided by an obedient and compliant police force, is useful in the context of public housing policies in the United Kingdom today. The practices of these bodies are designed to, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1527476412457221">Zimmerman (2000</xref>, 276–78) argues, promote the itinerancy of “undesirable people” as far as possible, policies, I suggest, not entirely remote from those promoted by programs such as <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic>. Zimmerman suggests that the division of responsibilities among these agents—the enforcers, the landlords, and the housing officers—and the objectification of the people targeted by such schemes, relieve the strain on those responsible and reduce their inhibitions. Following George Lukacs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476412457221">T. Hall 2006</xref>, 158), part of the dubious pleasure of reality television, is that the human life observed by the camera becomes calculable within the format constructed by the genre.</p>
<p>Reification in the reality TV format of programs like <italic>Neighbourhood Watched</italic> and <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic> works on the viewer to suppress any feelings of guilt about the “poverty” voyeurism, which these programs promote as pleasurable viewing. Although <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic> is, in fact, a program on a very serious subject, the title locates it as “popular” and “accessible,” linking it discursively to well-established global television formats and suggesting a play on the culture of postfeminist titillation as in such US media franchises as <italic>Girls of the Playboy Mansion</italic> and <italic>Girls Gone Wild</italic>. BBC2 has broadcast <italic>Kids Behind Bars</italic> and <italic>Babies Behind Bars</italic>, and a US version of <italic>Girls Behind Bars</italic> was screened on ITV in 2011. Warnings about explicit language and scenes of a sexual nature in the title sequence are another aspect of this titillation and serve a double purpose. Population racism is a not-so-subtle subtext of these reality television programs—One of the tensions at work in all the examples cited here is an anxiety generated around the capacity for reproduction among “failing citizens,” as with the drug-addicted couple in <italic>The Scheme</italic>. As researchers in the field of biopolitics have noted, neoliberalism of the type promoted by these “hard realism” reality television series “has fundamentally challenged the idea embedded in the Keynesian welfare state as well as Foucualt’s account of such a state in terms of biopower—the idea that the life and growth of the state’s population would be protected and secured by the state” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1527476412457221">Ticineto-Clough and Willse 2011</xref>, 7).</p>
<p>I have argued that reality TV programming on the UK national channel, BBC2, is significant to the state’s response to the 2011 Riots and constitutes evidence that what appeared as exceptional in the elite response to the riots was but a manifestation of the long project of punishment and control visited on those deemed superfluous to the new postcredit crunch economy. The BBC, at least on its national channels, in its attempts to appeal to its elite male audiences, and to appease its Coalition Government paymasters, is moving away from its public service traditions, increasingly positioning itself as an instrument of the privatized state, a mouthpiece of the neo-Victorian/corporatist form promoted by English elites in the contemporary United Kingdom. This positioning is the price exacted of the BBC by its “niche” audience for the license to broadcast. There is, I would insist, every indication that the ultimate goal of this class is to starve a “problem” indigenous female population, and their families, into bonded service work, ultimately to replace, through punitive measures, the immigrant labor force on which certain employers in the private sector have relied. This is no longer a hidden agenda in the contemporary UK as the Coalition’s controversial “mandatory work activity” for the unemployed shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527476412457221">Malik 2011</xref>). An investigation has been called into allegations that 80 job seekers, bussed up to do unpaid “work experience” for the recent Queen’s Jubilee, were ill fed, forced to sleep out under London Bridge, change in public, and stand for hours in pouring rain in cellophane ponchos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1527476412457221">Malik 2012</xref>). Commentators such as Melanie Henwood might then be grateful that Britain is still at the stage where its young people are rioting for new shoes and televisions. As long as the reality output of the nation’s channels continues to entertain privileged elite audiences with the televised struggles of the poor to go on living, it is not beyond the bounds of reason to suppose the next UK riots will be for food and shelter.</p>
