<p>The organizational sciences have contributed enormously to the corpus of knowledge regarding methods to be used in research on individuals, groups, and organizations. We have been particularly influential in areas such as meta-analysis, construct validation, analysis of nested data, qualitative analysis, and measurement invariance.</p>
<p>In some areas, however, we have much to learn from fields outside of the organizational sciences. This includes some of the areas mentioned in the previous paragraph. The purpose of this Feature Topic (FT) is to publish work that describes methodological advances that are relevant to our research but that have been made outside the organizational sciences. In particular, I sought articles that describe such advances and explain/illustrate why it is important that we understand and embrace them.</p>
<p>And I got what I sought.</p>
<p>Volk and Köhler tackle not one but two issues that I had hoped to include in this FT. For decades, economics has been using a variety of games (e.g., the Prisoner’s Dilemma) to uncover consistencies, often irrational, in human decision making. These games have revealed unexpected truths about phenomena such as risk tolerance, trust, and negotiation, but most of us in the organizational sciences know little about them. More recently, economics has embraced the trend toward neuroscience, resulting in “neuroeconomics.” Volk and Köhler explain how neuroimaging and economics games have been combined and how they can be combined to address organizational phenomena. They begin by describing the games themselves as well as the sorts of phenomena to which they have been applied and the inferences that they allow. They then show how functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to discover the neurological underpinnings of the phenomena that these games have elicited. Most important for our purposes, Volk and Köhler offer detailed suggestions for how combinations of neuroimaging and economics games could be used to discover the underpinnings of organizational phenomena. Specifically, they identify organizational studies that have used economics games and explain how fMRI could be used to address the questions in these studies more directly. This, in my opinion, is the future, and this article helps us to understand how we can embrace it.</p>
<p>The topic of Uhlmann et al. is implicit measurement. Although the organizational sciences have contributed enormously to implicit measurement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1094428112460014">Bing, LeBreton, Davison, Migetz, &amp; James, 2007</xref>; &amp; James, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1094428112460014">James, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094428112460014">Johnson &amp; Saboe, 2011</xref>), other fields have made great strides as well, and our field is relatively unaware of them. Uhlmann et al. fold advances from cognitive and social psychology into our own work in this area to create a framework for categorizing implicit measures that help to guide their use. Their Table 2, in addition to being the longest table in Christendom, should be the starting point for anyone wishing to learn about implicit measures. But these authors, like Volk and Köhler, also explain how the techniques that they describe could be used to attain deeper understanding of specific organizational topics. I have complained for years that our field has been stubbornly resistant to alternatives to self-report in spite of its well publicized limitations. Sooner or later, we are going to acknowledge as a field the perils of self-deception and intentional distortion, and we are going to take alternatives such as implicit measurement more seriously. This compendium provides us with the information that we need to get moving in that direction.</p>
<p>Vancouver and Weinhardt discuss computational modeling. This is one of those topics about which most of us have heard and about which few of us know anything. We all understand in the abstract that the phenomena that we study are far more complex than we care to admit, for if we admitted to the complexity, then we would have to incorporate it into our theories. For practical reasons, we can’t incorporate myriad stable individual differences, variable individual differences, the effects of the characteristics of others, of the group, of the unit, of the organization, of the region, and so on. Rather than give up, we simply hope that the words in our results and discussion sections, which are based on studies designed to test less complex theories, wouldn’t be terribly different even if we had included these factors. Vancouver and Weinhardt show how computational modeling can help us to develop internally consistent theories of complex processes. Specifically, these authors talk us through the process, from choosing a problem of study through the design, implementation, and interpretation of computational models. We will always be a data-driven field, but computational models help us to develop and refine our theories so that, if nothing else, we avoid testing theories that cannot possibly hold.</p>
<p>As Kepes, Banks, McDaniel, and Whetzel show in the next article, although we have made tremendous contributions to meta-analysis, there is a lot to be learned from other areas, particularly medicine. Indeed, because replication is so common in medicine and so uncommon in the organizational sciences, meta-analysis is perhaps better suited to medicine than to our field. Thus, they have made considerable advances of which our field exhibits little awareness. In particular, medicine has made great strides in the study of publication bias in meta-analysis. This issue used to receive a lot of attention in the organizational sciences, but nowadays we seldom see more than a token Failsafe N being reported. Medicine, on the other hand, has created many tools for evaluating publication bias. Some of these are enhanced versions of techniques with which we are familiar (e.g., funnel plots) while others are more sophisticated (e.g., Begg and Mazumdar’s rank correlation test). Kepes et al. begin by explaining the various factors that might cause publication bias. They then describe the various methods that exist for detecting it and the situations in which each method is appropriate. I suspect that this article will serve as the basis for publication bias tests in the organizational sciences for years to come.</p>
<p>Social network analysis in its many forms has taken off in recent years. And yet the procedures that exist lend themselves primarily to the study of people in close proximity, be it actual or virtual. Dionne et al. offer a methodology for studying connections among people at a societal or even a global level. Their Retrospective Relatedness Reconstruction (3R) uses Web searches to discover how different people are connected and how those connections change over time. For example, they applied this method to identify similarities among economic and industry leaders between 2005 and 2009 and were able to show that as the financial crisis unfolded, connections between leaders changed. In 2005, the public and the media made little connection between Alan Greenspan and people like Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner. As the crisis grew, however, Greenspan was often linked to the Wall Street brass and was described in the same (negative) terms. Although this example may be a bit far afield for some of us, it also suggests a variety of possibilities. This method could be used to compare top management connections within and between industries, and these connections might in turn predict organization- or industry-level outcomes. It could be used to examine connections as a consequence of business-relevant legislation (e.g., connections among health insurance executives before and after provisions of the Affordable Care Act take effect). This method opens up a new world of research questions that we simply couldn’t address in the past.</p>
<p>The next article, by Dass and Shropshire, introduces us to Functional Data Analysis (FDA). Lest the reader imagine that this is the opposite of Dysfunctional Data Analysis (i.e., the kind that my students claim I teach to them), these authors explain that FDA is used to extract and evaluate specific information about curvilinear and other higher order effects over time. We in the organizational sciences typically use hierarchical linear model (HLM) to analyze longitudinal data. HLM is an extremely useful technique, but it is limited in certain ways. For example, HLM assumes that within-person dynamics conform to a single functional structure, whereas FDA allows within-person functions to assume any structure at all. FDA also allows more flexibility regarding time-varying relationships and has greater forecasting power for highly dynamic relationships. Dass and Shropshire begin by explaining what FDA is and illustrate it using examples from finance, economics, marketing, and management information systems (MIS). They then get into the nuts and bolts of FDA, ending with descriptions of three forms of FDA, functional principal components analysis, functional regression, and functional clustering. Finally, these authors illustrate all three types of analysis with data from a large firm-level database. Just as HLM brought us to a new level (if you will) in the analysis of longitudinal data, so could FDA bring us to yet a higher level by allowing us to uncover more complexity over time. This article provides the starting point for such a journey.</p>
<p>The final article by Kruschke et al. was another that I was hoping to see in this Feature Topic. There has been a lot of energy around Bayesian analysis over the past few years, but apart from the basic Bayesian formula for the probability of a hypothesis, we in the organizational sciences don’t know very much about it. This article tells us what we need to know in order to make up our own minds about the superiority of Bayesian analysis. It also explains in detail how one conducts these analyses and how one phrases the results and discussion sections of an article that uses them. My hope had been for an article that could provide for the Bayesian novice all of the information that he or she needs to understand the underpinnings of Bayesian analysis, the differences between Bayesian and frequentist analysis, the specific steps for conducting Bayesian analysis, and the strategies for making sense of the results of such analysis. That was my hope, and that was what I got. If Bayesian analysis takes off in the organizational sciences, the launching point will be right here.</p>
<p>This is my first Feature Topic, and I couldn’t be more pleased with the articles that are included in it. Each article introduces us to methods that we need to know and does so in a way that allows us to apply those methods to our own research. I offer my sincere gratitude to the authors, editors, and reviewers who made this FT possible.</p>
