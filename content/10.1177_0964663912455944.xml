<abstract>
<p>This article investigates the acts of protest that occurred in the city of Barcelona and other Spanish cities in 2001 in response to imminent toughening of the Foreigners’ law 8/2000. The sit-ins, demonstrations and hunger strikes led to negotiation with the government and the government’s acceptance of some of the undocumented migrants or <italic>‘sinpapeles’</italic> demands for regularization of their status. At the same time, the <italic>sinpapeles</italic> also expressed a critique of the entire anti-immigrant border regime. These events demonstrated that citizenship could not be viewed exclusively as a fixed regime. Rather, it was a site for legal and political contestation. With the emergence of new subjects as claimants of rights, a number of scholars have pointed to the need for an alternative vocabulary of citizenship studies, one that includes certain practices that were previously excluded. The concept ‘acts of citizenship’ offers an approach to investigating such actions that considers actors not currently recognized as legal and political subjects. Applying this concept to the struggles of the <italic>sinpapeles</italic>, this article demonstrates how a number of acts converted previously undocumented immigrants into subjects of legaity, and to a certain extent, into citizens.</p>

<title>The <italic>Encierros </italic>of Undocumented Immigrants</title>
<p>On 20 January 2001, approximately 350 people, mainly undocumented immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Morocco, Eastern Europe and sub-Saharan Africa, gathered in the Catalunya Square in Barcelona, demanding ‘<italic>papeles para todos’</italic> (papers or documents for all).They were protesting against the immigration policy of the Partido Popular (PP), the main conservative party in Spain, and against the Foreigners’ law 8/2000, which was due to come into force a few days later. One of the main reasons for the mobilization of immigrants was that the new law reinforced the government order that any foreigner who did not have the necessary permits to stay, work or reside in Spain should be considered ‘illegal’.This condition of illegality entitled the police to arrest and detain‘illegal people’, and expel them from the country within 72 hours. The message was circulated widely through political statements and the media:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The government will expel at least 27,000 immigrants. The Interior Ministry has begun to send notice forms to 27,751 immigrants informing them that they must leave Spain. In the letter it is stated that their application for regularization has been rejected and they now qualify for the special expulsion process foreseen by the new Foreigners’ law. (<italic>El País</italic>, 22 December 2000)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unlike in other regions, the extraordinary regularization process of 2000 resulted in high rates of refusal of applications in Barcelona. Specifically, 71% of the requests made in the province of Barcelona (over 35,000) were rejected. This contrasts sharply with other neighbouring provinces such as Girona, which hovered around 14%, or the Spanish capital, Madrid, which had a rate of 15%. As the news story implied, those whose requests to stay in the country had been refused were in fear that denial notifications arriving in late December 2000 and January 2001 would also include notice of initiation of removal proceedings.</p>
<p>At this time, undocumented immigrants had become increasingly marginalized in Spanish law and politics (De Lucas, 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663912455944">Calavita, 2005</xref>). On 3 January 2001, 12 Ecuadorian migrants were killed in a car accident on their way to the fields where they worked as <italic>jornaleros</italic> (peasants or day labourers) in the underground agricultural industry in Lorca (a region of Murcia). This story caught the attention of the media, exposing a reality that prevailed in most parts of Spain: that thousands of people all over the country were living in precarious employment situations, in agriculture, construction, domestic service and the service sector, without contracts, fair rates of pay or social security, and with no possibility of recourse to the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0964663912455944">Martínez Veiga, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0964663912455944">Pedone, 2005</xref>). The assembly that took place on 20 January in Barcelona, at least in part, reflected solidarity with demonstrations that had taken place in Murcia following the tragic road deaths, because immigrants there were suffering similar exploitation.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the previous Foreigners’ law 4/2000, legal and administrative permits would now be a condition for the right to meet, demonstrate, organize and go on strike, and to receive elementary education, effectively denying any kind of social and political participation to illegalized people. Spain’s undocumented immigrants were considered to be what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0964663912455944">Isin and Rygiel (2007</xref>) have called neither subjects nor objects of immigration policies, but ‘abjects’. Going beyond Arendt’s well-known idea of ‘the right to have rights’ as a consequence of statelessness, abjects are those people whose right to have rights is suspended or, ‘who have not the rights that they have’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0964663912455944">Isin and Rygiel, 2007</xref>: p. 183). This category can be applied to refugees who are‘illegal’ and economic migrants located in abject spaces, such as detention camps, border zones or even stigmatized urban spaces, for example, some areas of Barcelona (Delgado, 2008), where government strategies have beenaimed at reducing people into abject non-existence. However, in opposition to Agamben’s concept of ‘spaces of abjection’, Isin and Rygiel (following Ranciere) argue that abject spaces are also locations for resistance and contestation. As we will see, in spite of the restriction of their rights and the criminalization of the inhabitants of these spaces, immigrants were able to coordinate their efforts rapidly and effectively, and their protests continued for several months, not only in the buildings, squares and streets of Barcelona, but also throughout Spain. After massive demonstrations and a tough face-to-face-negotiation process with the Spanish government, the parties finally achieved a compromise, the Agreement of Barcelona of 8 March 2001. The agreement compelled the government to regularize almost all of those who had taken part in the sit-ins, or <italic>encierros</italic>, in Barcelona. Perhaps the most interesting development was that the same conditions contained in the agreement were later applied in other parts of Spain where simultaneous sit-ins had taken place. Finally, as the Minister of the Interior announced in June 2001, the agreement would also apply to all undocumented immigrants in Spain (<italic>La Vanguardia</italic>, 7 June 2001; <italic>El País</italic>, 7 June 2001).</p>
<p>According to a rigid application of the new Foreigners’law, undocumented immigrants were not allowed to organize, strike or even to demonstrate, and they were certainly not entitled to encroach on immigration policy-making. However, through their resistance they intervened, albeit partially, in the regularization policy of the PP government. However, since those involved were non-citizens, illegal immigrants or abjects, from what analytical perspective can one investigate the <italic>encierros </italic>and other similar struggles? The necessity of a new vocabulary of citizenship has been debated at length. Both Bosniak’s concept of ‘post-citizenship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663912455944">2000</xref>, 2001) and Isin’s ‘acts of citizenship’ (2008, 2009) imply a shift in theoretical approach towards the inclusion of those practices carried out by undocumented immigrants, such as abjects, that do not fit the formal conception of citizenship, but are relevant to a revised definition of it.</p>
<p>The following analysis of struggles in Barcelona will serve as an empirical illustration of how acts of citizenship can be investigated. The empirical material for this study was obtained through the collection of academic writings on the sit-ins in Barcelona and the rest of Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912455944">Aierbe, 2001</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0964663912455944"> Aparicio, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0964663912455944">Laubenthal, 2005</xref>; Montalbán, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0964663912455944">Provencal and Molina, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663912455944">Suarez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663912455944">Torres, 2001</xref>), interviews in general magazines, and personal recorded interviews with key actors, such as members of the <italic>sinpapeles </italic>movement, jurists and lawyers, and members of other social movements involved (pseudonyms have been used to protect the identity of interviewees as promised before the interviews). Because the field work was done during 2007–2008, some years after the sit-ins happened, the richest source of information was provided by hundreds of written documents and audio-visual records from the time of the protests, as ‘sources that stopped time’. Since my aim was to investigate how <italic>sinpapeles</italic> immigrants, regardless of their abject status, performed, negotiated and constituted themselves as subjects of legality or, in other words, as citizens, it was essential to include and analyse those documents that were not issued directly from any positive legal norm, but that were produced by the <italic>sinpapeles </italic>immigrants themselves. These documents have a high legal content in terms of the speech and symbolism they use.</p>
<p>This article aims to present some of the most relevant circumstances of the <italic>encierros</italic> or sit-ins in Barcelona and across Spain in 2001 and should be useful to anyone aiming to link, compare and contrast them with more recent protests in Spain and elsewhere (e.g. the contemporary <italic>indignados</italic> or outrage movement). It is the case that, since 2001, government strategies and technologies that construct <italic>sinpapeles</italic> as abjects have multiplied. These include anti-terrorist measures related to immigration (especially after the 9/11 attacks), regression in rights and freedoms as a result of increasingly tight border controls (Frontex, the EU agency for the border control, was created between 2002 and 2005), and the development of neoliberal policies of labour-management promoted by the World Bank, World Trade Organization and International Organization for Migration. In this sense, like the French <italic>sans-papiers</italic> in 1996, the reverberations of the ‘papers for all’ protests are still to be felt in social movements for the rights of migrants in Spain and Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663912455944">Barbero, 2010</xref>). Acts of protest are still happening as heirs to, or followers of, those struggles. However, in contrast to the significant attention paid to the French <italic>sans-papiers</italic>, there has been hardly any discussion, let alone analysis, of the Spanish <italic>sinpapeles</italic>. Thus, it is helpful to place some contemporary protests within this historical context and examine their social and political significance. In this article, there is no attempt to establish a single narrative; rather, it aims to extract the actions of the main participants (the <italic>sinpapeles</italic>, social movements and anonymous people) from political and legal documents arising from the struggle and engage them in dialogue with critical citizenship studies. This article thus contributes to research of resistance practices that challenge the boundaries that formal citizenship imposes.</p>

<title>Citizenship Beyond Law: The Search for a New Vocabulary for Non-citizens’ Practices</title>
<p>Many studies since <italic>Return of the Citizen</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0964663912455944">Kymlicka and Norman, 1994</xref>) have emphasized the mutations experienced by the citizenship regime as a result of the influences of, and the effect on, migration caused by changing citizenship regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0964663912455944">Aleinikoff, 1990</xref>; Bauböck, 1994; Bosniak, 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912455944">Brubaker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0964663912455944">Soysal, 1994</xref>). This interpretation, combined with the work of activists and cause lawyers and the development of progressive jurisprudence, has allowed for significant advances in the field of immigrants’ rights, both nationally and internationally, in terms of how those rights are understood, recognized and enforced. However, the study of citizenship also needs to go beyond the analysis of the positivistor formal legal sphere.</p>
<p>Some authors, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0964663912455944">Santos (1995</xref>) or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0964663912455944">Mezzadra (2006</xref>), have signalled the need to look beyond the legal conception of citizenship in order to recover those practices and groups whose aspirations are constantly denied or made invisible by the formal, dogmatic and hegemonic use of citizenship as a legal status. As Mezzadra has said:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>an analysis of citizenship cannot be limited to legal and institutional definitions. Research in recent years has taught us to understand social practices, movements and subjective behaviour as critical for the consideration of citizenship; that research, even within the institutional perimeter of citizenship itself, can question the concept, forcing its particular boundaries. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0964663912455944">Mezzadra, 2006</xref>: p. 92)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The assumption that citizenship is an institution fixed to positive legal norms impedes consideration of what is happening at the social level. Moreover, how could such a limited conception capture those expressions that affect law-making but that are not produced by formal citizens?</p>
<p>In an article reflecting on the denationalizing process of citizenship, Linda Bosniak concludes her argument by posing the question of whether the concept of citizenship itself helps us to bridge the gap between those, on the one hand, who consider that certain non-national activities or practices should fit inside the institution of citizenship and their opponents, on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663912455944">Bosniak, 2001</xref>: p. 249). She concludes that, while the denationalization of citizenship argument is perfectly plausible, ‘it varies in its power and persuasiveness according to the discourse of citizenship at issue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663912455944">Bosniak, 2001</xref>: p. 245). She observes that disagreement on the denationalization of citizenship ‘is no longer an empirical one, but has become linguistic and conceptual… especially when the social practices and institutions ordinarily designated by the term begin to take non-national forms, they can still be characterized as citizenship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663912455944">Bosniak, 2001</xref>: p. 245). Where is the relevance of considering certain non-national or post-national practices as citizenship? Bosniak’s final statement raises a very pertinent point for the present argument. Considering the possibility that ‘the idea of citizenship is so closely tied to the hegemony of the nation centred thinking that it will resist redefinition in denationalized terms’, she proposes that ‘an alternative rhetorical strategy would be to argue not that citizenship is moving beyond the nation state, but that we are moving beyond citizenship altogether’. This is why ‘there might be good reasons for taking a postcitizenship stance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663912455944">Bosniak, 2001</xref>: p. 246).</p>
<p>In an article on French <italic>sans-papiers </italic>in which Anne McNevin reflects on how the policing of irregular migration sustains a logic of political belonging, she turns to Engin Isin’s concept of ‘being political’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0964663912455944">Isin, 2002</xref>) as a framework to ‘analyse and imagine alternate forms of membership and alternative bases for claims-making upon a political community’ (McNevin, 2007: p. 137). This lens is also useful in investigating what happened in the streets of Barcelona. As I will try to illustrate in this article, <italic>sinpapeles, </italic>probably like French <italic>sans-papiers</italic>, developed an alternative form of understanding citizenship, far beyond formal rights or legal membership. For Isin, citizenship should be understood as the process through which ‘certain groups constitute themselves as capable of being political, in the sense of being endowed with the capacity to be governed by and govern other citizens differentiated from strangers and outsiders’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0964663912455944">Isin, 2002</xref>: p. 280). One of the main consequences of considering citizenship as a regime of government necessarily refers to the way it includes those strategies of resistance against government or domination that outcasts engage in. This resistance is displayed through individuals’developing symbolic, social, cultural and economic practices that enabled [them] as political agents under new terms [to take] different positions in the social space than those in which they were previously positioned’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0964663912455944">Isin, 2002</xref>: pp. 275–276). In this sense, McNevin’s use of Isin’s ‘being political’ provides a suitable framework for the <italic>sans-papiers</italic>’ struggles in a neoliberal context where ‘illegality’ is used as a technology for the government of migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912455944">Bigo and Guild, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0964663912455944">De Genova, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0964663912455944">Rygiel, 2010</xref>; or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0964663912455944">Squire, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0964663912455944">
<title>Is the Acts-of-Citizenship Perspective Suitable for a New Comprehension of Migrant Struggles?</title>
<p>The problem of how to find a new vocabulary to describe those concrete episodes of struggle that do not fit within the borders of formal citizenship remains because they are not performed by citizens but by immanent outsiders or abjects. Not only are such people not considered as political–legal subjects, but they are also criminalized and prosecuted because of their status. The idea of ‘acts’ and, more precisely, ‘acts of citizenship’ introduced recently by Engin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0964663912455944">Isin (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912455944">2009</xref>) provides a possible solution in the sense that it adds a different perspective from which to look at certain practices.</p>
<p>One of the issues on which I will reflect here is that Isin’s ideas about acts of citizenship were not articulated specifically in a legal or socio-legal sense. Isin does, indeed, take into account factors such as laws, rights and even the concept of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0964663912455944">Isin, 2008</xref>: p. 35). However, his focus is on how certain acts constitute different groups as claimants of justice, rights and responsibilities when they are not recognized as political subjects. The question I pose here is whether this framework might also be useful in understanding events in Barcelona in 2001. In other words, did those acts and deeds that culminated in the Barcelona Agreement and its legal consequences constitute certain subjects, the <italic>sinpapeles</italic> migrants, as legal subjects with the capacity to intervene in the production of norms and regulations?</p>
<p>When referring to acts of citizenship, Isin’s interest lies in the relationship between new figures of citizenship and the emergence of new sites, scales and acts that enable actors to claim rights. In his words, ‘what we need to understand is how these sites, scales and acts produce new actors who enact political subjectivities and transform themselves and others into citizens by articulating ever-changing and expanding rights’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912455944">Isin, 2009</xref>: p. 368). For Isin, the need for a new vocabulary is demonstrated by the fact that the majority of studies on the concept of citizenship have failed because they have focussed on ‘three ontic aspects of citizenship: extent (rules and norms of exclusion and inclusion), content (rights and responsibilities) and depth (thickness or thinness of belonging)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0964663912455944">Isin, 2008</xref>: p. 37). The utility of this kind of studies is limited because the concepts of actors that they use, in reference to extent, content and depth, are ‘already produced… the scene has already been created’. In contrast, when the concept of acts of citizenship is applied, ‘acts produce actors that do not exist before acts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0964663912455944">Isin, 2008</xref>: p. 37).</p>
<p>There are three main characteristics that build the concept of an act of citizenship and these are: the dialogical principle of citizenship; rupture; and the distinction between justice and law. Firstly, the idea of ‘being political’ derives from a <italic>genealogical investigation of political subjectivities </italic>through which citizenship is viewed as a dialogical principle that involves certain forms (orientations, strategies, technologies). Otherness is constructed towards strangers, outsiders and aliens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0964663912455944">Isin, 2002</xref>) and acts of citizenship are related to the way in which each of these subjects celebrate, perpetuate, impose, resist and break the modes of being political with each other. At the same time, this idea differs from the established notion that citizenship is a static concept linked to membership. While this last concept, according to Isin, would be limited to the way of governing conduct within social groups, conceiving citizenship as dialogical implies an investigation of ‘conduct across social groups all of which constitute a body politic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912455944">Isin, 2009</xref>: p. 371).</p>
<p>A second quality that acts of citizenship express is <italic>rupture</italic> and, subsequently, social transformation. Acts entail a rupture with ongoing situations, such as status (which brings us back again to the idea of membership of an established order), rituals, customs, habits and routines (in this sense incorporating Bourdieau’s concept of <italic>habitus</italic>). This notion contrasts with traditional studies of citizenship that have focussed on the practices of everyday life and, consequently, have developed the necessity of considering the subject as deserving of the title of citizen. On the contrary, investigating acts of citizenship implies examining the purpose served by an act in breaking with the established order –deviating from the script – in order to change it. The break can be intentional or not, and with or without regard to its possible consequences.</p>
<p>Thirdly, social transformation and rupture are closely related to <italic>seeking justice by any means, respectful of the law or not</italic>. While most specific acts are not necessarily conceived as emancipatory by their actors (essentially because actors do not pre-consider themselves as activists), we, as interpreters, orientate the acts towards the claim of justice or against injustice. Acts of citizenship are enacted by non-citizen subjects who suffer from the misrecognition of basic rights or by citizens who support non-citizens’ struggles as an act of solidarity. However, framing acts of citizenship within the scope of justice does not mean that they need to be founded on law or enacted in the name of the law. Sometimes, the law provides subjects with the tools to claim rights and justice, but, at other times, the law does not recognize claimants as legitimized actors. On occasion, it may even be the case that the law considers actors to be offenders who can be prosecuted according to its remit. This is the reason why, in my view, acts of citizenship can sometimes be enacted through deeds that are considered illegal or go beyond the margins of formal state law. My aim is not to favour illegal over legal practices, but to analyse how informal practices can be used to claim rights and justice.</p>
<p>Construction of otherness, rupture and struggle for justice are basic characteristics of acts of citizenship, but to be more precise, as Isin notes, acts of citizenship are defined as ‘those acts that transform forms (orientations, strategies, technologies) and modes (citizens, strangers, outsiders, aliens) of being political by bringing into being new actors as activist citizens (that is, claimants of rights) through creating or transforming sites and stretching scales’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912455944">Isin, 2009</xref>: p. 383). In the next part, I will analyse the struggles of <italic>sinpapeles</italic> in Barcelona mainly from this acts-of-citizenship perspective.</p>

<title>Acts of Citizenship and the Struggles of <italic>Sinpapeles </italic>in Barcelona</title>
<p>Before the struggles that occurred in Barcelona and across Spain, others by undocumented people had already taken place around Europe. Since the 1970s, France has been the scene of protests by irregular immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663912455944">Balibar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912455944">Krueger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0964663912455944">Siméant, 1998</xref>). In March 1996, 430 immigrants, originating from former colonies such as Mali, Senegal, Guinea and Mauritania, occupied the church of Saint Ambroise in Paris. Fifty of them went on hunger strike. They were the <italic>sans-papiers</italic>. The ensuing evictions, detentions and deportations by the French government were countered with more demonstrations, more hunger strikes and the occupation of other spaces, such as the church of Saint Bernard de-la-Chapelle in July of that same year. Madjiguène Cissé was one of the spokespersons of the <italic>sans-papiers</italic> movement and her book <italic>Parole de Sans-papiers</italic> (‘word of <italic>sans-papiers</italic>’) describes the occupation of several churches in Paris. The words are eloquent:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>On March 18th, 1996, as if coming out of a dark tunnel, dazzled by the lights of the television cameras, three hundred Africans emerged as something obvious. They demanded regularization. The occupation of the Church of Saint Ambrose, in the 11tharrondissement, had been a surprise. For many people, this occupation was merely a desperate reaction, with no future. It had occurred barely three months after the tension between French workers and the Juppe government, which at that time had yielded only minor concessions in order to maintain Juppe’s Social Security plan. However, this protest marked the beginning of a conflict with the French government that lasts even until today. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0964663912455944">Cissé, 2000</xref>: p. 13)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the French <italic>sans-papiers</italic> movement, the efforts of immigrants towards the legalization and recognition of rights have expanded worldwide. These struggles for rights and regularization and against deportation processes have resulted in a long list of acts of protest by undocumented immigrants, clandestine workers, illegalized persons and asylum seekers that have occurred across Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0964663912455944">Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0964663912455944">Koopmans <italic>et al., 2005</italic></xref>; Laubenthal, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912455944">McGregor, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0964663912455944">McNevin, 2006</xref>), the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0964663912455944">Benjamin-Alvarado, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0964663912455944">Coutin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0964663912455944">McNevin, 2011</xref>), Canada (Nyers, 2006) and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0964663912455944">McNevin, 2011</xref>). The problems of the <italic>sinpapeles</italic> in Spain (a country that has only recently had high levels of immigration) also merit closer examination. While this movement and the context of governing immigration share common features with other aforementioned immigrant movements in the Global North, this analysis of the struggles of <italic>sinpapeles </italic>in Barcelona and in Spain in 2001 aims to bring local experiences to the understanding of the fight for a different legality.</p>

<title>Who were the <italic>Sinpapeles </italic>in Barcelona?</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>Policemen are always asking us for our papers, when we travel, when we work, when we walk … and we don’t have them. We call ourselves <italic>sinpapeles</italic>. Although it isn’t a legal term, it seems much more real than illegal or irregular. Some lawyers tell us it’s a lawless term that places us in a limbo but we like it because it gives us a platform from which to claim the most basic rights that laws deny us. (Norma Falconi, Spokesperson of the Assembly of Immigrants)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>When the mass meeting in Catalunya Square on 20 January 2001 began, nobody could foresee the consequences. As in Paris, its full impact was not anticipated. <italic>Assemblea Papers per a Tothom </italic>already had a long history of organizing demonstrations, collecting signatures on petitions and holding public meetings throughout the 1990s. However, the qualitative impact of these activities had been limited. Not even the government, which wanted to maintain order, knew what was going to happen when the new Foreigners’ law came into force. As one of the leaders of <italic>Papeles para todos</italic> said:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[W]hen the law was due to come out, the government asked the leader of an important trade union if there would be any problems in the streets, especially with <italic>Papeles para todos</italic>. He told them that we were very noisy and radical, but that nobody would follow our message. Two days later we were immersed in one of the biggest immigrant struggles this country has ever seen. (Norma Falconi, Spokesperson of the Assembly of immigrants)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Apart from some <italic>Papeles para todos </italic>activists, the majority of the people who had gathered in the square were anonymous immigrants worried about future immigration policy and wanting to know what possible protection they could expect and what avenues of protest were left open to them. Most were middle-aged men, and a few women, from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Morocco, sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe and, to a lesser extent, Latin America.</p>
<p>Most of the people from sub-Saharan Africa, mainly Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone, had been camped out in a corner of the same square for almost a year, the so-called ‘Black corner’. Their situation was grotesque. The Spanish authorities had left them in a legal limbo. Initially detained after their arrival by sea on the Canary Islands, they had been taken by the authorities to the continental territory of Spain, specifically to Barcelona airport, where they were then abandoned. They had been given deportation orders, which meant that, although they had not been deported, they would never be able to regularize their situation nor access formal work permits because they were ‘illegal’.</p>
<p>Many of the Eastern European attendees at the protests had been encamped in another area, in this case in the Espanya Industrial Square in the neighbourhood of Sants (a location known for a tradition of collective action). As a woman from Bulgaria told me:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[W]e used to work as domestics, cleaning houses, and the men in construction. These are hard and dangerous jobs, but since we had no papers or contract rights, you cannot ask for job security and if you have an accident no one will help. You are just exploited. My boss always promised me a contract but it never arrived and so, of course, you cannot apply for a formal job. If you do not have a contract you have no papers and no papers if you do not have a contract … In the end we were sent to live in the streets. Usually police came and told us to leave but we had nowhere to go. (Maria, occupant of the Espanya Industrial Square and the Church of Sant Agustí)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although their causes and contexts where different, both groups, Africans and Europeans, came together by the end of 2000 under the united slogan ‘Papeles, vivienda, trabajo’ (Papers, housing and work), joining with protesters and activists from <italic>Papeles para todos</italic>.</p>
<p>The North Africans, mostly Amazigh people from Morocco, had been living in Spain for years. Many had been employed in agriculture in the south-east and, more recently, in the building industry of Barcelona, but always without permits or contracts. Some of them were peasants from rural areas, with few educational skills, and others were university students who had fled their own countries because of their political opposition to their governments.</p>
<p>The presence of a South-Asian collective of protesters at the information-sharing meeting on 20 January was completely unexpected by the organizers. While South Asians could be found working in the city’s restaurants, bars and markets and as street vendors, their social visibility, especially in politics, was practically nil. At that time, there were no organized bodies established around the Pakistani, Indian or Bangladeshi communities or the mosques, as there are today.</p>
<p>In this sense, most of the actors were people exploited by the black market. They were not activists, much less people who conceived of themselves as having the capacity to intervene in the modification of legal rules that located them in the margins. However, the act of occupying the churches, stating their demands and negotiating with the state constituted them as something other than mere illegal migrants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0964663912455944">
<title>‘This was our last weapon’: Acts of Resistance</title>
<p>As discussed above, Isin argues that acts are those deeds that enable actors to claim rights. In the struggles of Barcelona, there were a number of acts through which <italic>sinpapeles</italic> enacted political subjectivities to articulate rights that they were not legally entitled to exercise. In doing so, at the same time, the <italic>sinpapeles</italic> created new sites of contestation and struggle.</p>
<p>According to the Spanish Foreigners’ law 8/2000, irregular immigrants were prevented from enacting the most basic political rights, such as the right to meet or demonstrate, the right to go on strike or the right to join associations and trade unions. However, even before the law entered into force, they were already exercising most of those rights that were being seized from them. As one of the <italic>sinpapeles</italic> explained:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he first thing they will try is to take away your rights so that you cannot defend yourself. Then, when you are helpless is when you start to fear and when fear is inside Church, then you will do what they want. (Abdel Said, Pakistani immigrant in Santa Maria del Pi)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this sense, if political capacity is one of the core parts of being human, its existence draws the line between <italic>bare life</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663912455944">Agamben, 1998</xref>) and subjectivity. The deprivation of rights was seen not only as a legal outrage, but also as the removal of elementary channels for making claims and as a strategy for governing migrants. Thus, the sit-in and the hunger strike became acts of defiance against this denial of the ability to make claims. Civil disobedience was the only alternative possible. As a young Moroccan told <italic>La Vanguardia</italic> newspaper, ‘[W]e are weak, we cannot sleep or get up because our legs fail us. But this protest is the only weapon we have left before the new law, which excludes us and condemns us to the margins’ (<italic>La Vanguardia</italic>, 24 January 2001).</p>
<p>Protesters were aware of the damage that ‘this last weapon’, the hunger strike, could cause:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It was the only way to express our anger without resorting to violence. We could not continue to tolerate that level of exploitation and abuse. It was away of pressuring the government. We were aware that somebody might die. But it was the only way we could fight. (Bhai Singh, Indian protester in Santa Maria del Pi Church)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I have already referred to two relevant acts of protest in this case study: the mass meeting of 20 January 2001 and the occupation of 11churches in Barcelona. It is worth bearing in mind that the occupation of public squares was not simply a protest. It was the only solution to homelessness created by the state’s abdication of its duty to provide shelter, even to undocumented people. However, there are other acts of resistance that deserve to be included in what follows, such as inward and co-ordinated acts, demonstrations, acts of solidarity, negotiations and the production of norms.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the <italic>encierro</italic>, a new subjectivity began to be shaped. As one of the leaders told us, ‘the assembly <italic>Papeles para todos</italic> became diluted’. A new form of polyhedral organization came to shape the protest. The militants who had led the original assembly assumed different tasks. There was a general assembly that met every day in the main hall of Church of Santa Maria del Pi. These crowded assemblies usually took place when no other religious event was programmed and everyone had the right to speak through the public address system, although some of the communities had already chosen a leader to speak on their behalf. Everything that was said in the assembly was translated into the main languages of the sit-in: Spanish, Catalan, English, Urdu, Bengali, French, Arabic, Amazigh and Hindi. At the same time, each church had its own assembly and sent its spokesperson to the general assembly.</p>
<p>Various committees were also established, to deal with specific tasks such as public liaison, logistics, press releases, medical care, legal advice and negotiations. The assembly of <italic>sinpapeles</italic> was self-organized and autonomous. The clearest example of this autonomy was the assembly’s refusal to accept the terms of an agreement negotiated by its own lawyers. Although the text had been accepted by the government and would have brought matters to a close in early February, the assembly made the decision to reject the draft agreement because it did not provide a reasonable guarantee of compliance by the state.</p>
<p>Resistance by the <italic>sinpapeles</italic> would not have lasted as long as it did, and been as effective as it was, without support from outside. Solidarity from the general public was apparent from the very beginning. Apart from the <italic>Papeles para todos</italic> activists and volunteers who joined the committees, popular support was evident through the numerous campaigns that were organized. The <italic>Plataforma de Suport als Immigrants en Lluita</italic>, or Group in Support of Immigrants in Struggle, was the main organizer of collective acts (faxes, letters and emails to institutions and embassies, and demonstrations). Like the <italic>Papeles</italic> <italic>para todos</italic> assembly, this platform brought together various social groups that either defended freedom of movement or called for the end of the border regime. This platform sometimes found itself in conflict with the <italic>Plataforma per la Ciudadania i la Convivència</italic>, or Platformfor Citizenship and Coexistence, which was formed mainly by unions such as Comisiones obreras, Union General de Trabajo; or non-governmental organizations such as SOS Racisme, Amnesty International, Médicos sin Fronteras, Caritas, Iniciativa per Catalunya-Vers, Esquerra Republicana and the Socialist Party of Catalonia. Many of these organizations had a long history in the field of immigration and the fight against racism, but most shared a mainstream vision of the necessity to manage migration flows, which distinguished them from the <italic>Plataforma de Suportals</italic>. However, the most important difference was its advocacy of hunger strikes and sit-ins as legitimate acts of protest.</p>
<p>One significant act of solidarity organized by the <italic>Plataforma de Suportals Immigrants en Lluita </italic>was a petition campaign. Almost 63,000 people signed the solidarity call-sheet, acknowledging their sympathy with the <italic>encierros</italic> and supporting the stated claims of the immigrants. Leading artists from Catalan and Spanish theatre and the literary and music scenes met in the church of Santa Maria del Pi to show support.</p>
<p>It was not long before the issues raised by the protestors were discussed in the European Parliament. On 14 February 2001, MEP Alain Krivine addressed the Chamber:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The European Union must indeed guarantee equal treatment for third-country nationals legally resident within a Member State territory, according to the Tampere Conclusions. It must also, however, grant the same rights to the people who, driven by the increasingly restrictive policy on identity papers, visas and asylum rights, are forced to work in unacceptable conditions, without social protection. At this time when 700 immigrants in an irregular situation in Spain are on hunger strike, we need a policy to regularise their situation throughout Europe.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Some days later, on 21 February, the <italic>sinpapeles </italic>received a letter of support signed by Alain Krivine and some other MEPs belonging to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL), a left-wing group within the European Parliament.</p>
<p>On 26 January 2001, more than 5000 people gathered outside the government prefecture to support the actions of the immigrants that were already taking place in six churches around the city. After the event, some of the <italic>sinpapeles </italic>who had attended the demonstration began a further improvised demonstration on their way back to Santa Maria del Pi church. The demonstration ended in Pi square, where they raised banners with slogans such as ‘No one is illegal’ and ‘We don’t want the immigration law’. The largest demonstration held in Barcelona in the context of the <italic>encierros </italic>in 2001 took place on 4th February. It attracted around 50,000 people, who demanded the regularization of <italic>sinpapeles, </italic>marching under the motto: ‘For the recognition of rights and dignity of immigrants’. It started at Catalunya Square, the epicentre of the struggles. Many immigrant groups and anonymous supporters carried colourful banners written in Arabic, Berber, English, Urdu and other languages, bearing slogans, such as ‘Detention centres, killing centres’, ‘Papers for all’, ‘No one is illegal’ and ‘All people are immigrants’.</p>
<p>Although Barcelona was one of the major scenes of the protest, other cities in Spain, such as Murcia, Valencia, Almeria and Madrid, had their own sit-ins and demonstrations. The need for solidarity among these different and distant geographical points led to the creation of a state-level coordinating committee where ideas, strategies and information could be shared. As its manifesto said:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The unity of the struggle has always been a basic weapon to achieve equality … It is essential to bring together all the sit-ins and protests in a coordinated manner, as this will increase the strength of the movement and facilitate support for it in broad sectors of the local population.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Under the motto ‘Parlem els immigrants’ (we the immigrants talk), the first state-level meeting was held in Barcelona from 10 to 11 February 2001. The spokespersons went on to meet several more times at other locations where sit-ins were carried out, such as Murcia, Valencia and Madrid.</p>
<p>All of these acts strongly influenced the negotiation process. This was the moment when the <italic>sinpapeles</italic> shifted from being rights claimants to subjects of legality. The main demands, ‘papers, housing and work’, were gradually shaped into more precise claims. While the importance of all of the committees set up by <italic>sinpapeles</italic> should not be disregarded, the legal advice and negotiation committees where crucial in the resolution of the struggles. Formed by immigrants who had legal knowledge and by activist jurists, the legal advice committee ‘translated’ the political demands into legal terms and drew up the documents that would later be used in negotiations with the authorities. On the other hand, the negotiation committee was formed by a member of each community and a member of <italic>Papeles para todos. </italic>This committee held interviews with several institutions, such as the Generalitat de Catalunya, the Catalan autonomous government; the Sindic de Greuges, the Catalan ombudsman, who acted as a mediator with the central government, and, finally, the Delegación del Gobierno en Cataluña, the Spanish prefecture in Catalonia that had the legal competence over immigration.</p>
<p>It was the first time that <italic>sinpapeles</italic> immigrants had negotiated face to face with the Spanish government and produced an agreement with de facto binding force, although no official would ever recognize it publicly. For this reason, the agreement had to be signed by the big trade unions on behalf of the migrants and not by the migrants directly. This is why <italic>Papeles para todos</italic> was formally treated only as a ‘guest’ in the act of signature of the so-called Agreement of Barcelona of 8 March. As Norma Falconi, spokesperson of <italic>Papeles para todos,</italic> member of the union Confederación General del Trabajo and member of the negotiations commission, stated:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The agreements we sign today are a worthy outcome of the struggle that began 50 days ago with our <italic>encierro</italic> and our hunger strike. We consider that immigration laws are by their own nature discriminatory and their purpose is to establish a special legal framework for certain persons because of the mere fact of being born in a foreign land …We believe that what is achieved is only a small step. So we make clear at this time that we will continue fighting for the claims that have been explicit, decent living conditions and equal treatment for everyone.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Falconi’s argument provides a firm basis for interpreting the struggles of the <italic>sinpapeles</italic> as acts of citizenship. Over a sustained period, these acts of resistance disrupted police efforts to detain and deport immigrants and to prevent them from organizing and reclaiming rights. They also disrupted the whole migration policy of the Spanish conservative government. People who had been pushed to the margins of the law were enacting rights that existed but were not recognized, such as the right to meet and take part in demonstrations. They even enacted rights that were not formally recognized, such as the right to go on hunger strike or stage a sit-in. Finally, and most importantly, following the utopian demand of ‘<italic>papeles para todos</italic>’, they enacted the right to claim and define a regularization process.</p>

<sec id="section7-0964663912455944">
<title>Struggles across Multiple Scales</title>
<p>The <italic>encierros</italic>, hunger strikes, demonstrations and other acts of resistance took place in physical locations, such as churches, streets or public buildings. However, since our objective is to demonstrate that these acts of citizenship not only constituted political subjects but also subjects of legality, we also need to see how the struggle was placed across the boundaries of multiple political and legal scales. As Isin notes, acts of citizenship cannot be embedded in already existing scales such as the local, the national, the international, the ethnic, or the sexual, as if these were watertight compartments. Rather, ‘acts of citizenship stretch across boundaries, frontiers and territories to involve multiple and overlapping scales of contestation, belonging, identification and struggle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912455944">Isin, 2009</xref>: p. 371). In a similar sense, Boaventura de Sousa Santos links the notion of struggle to the necessity of approaching it from a trans-scalar perspective. He calls it <italic>interlegality</italic> referring to the intersection of different legal orders in our everyday lives, and also in conflicting circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663912455944">Santos, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to seek those subjects of legality, I will investigate how, during those three months of struggle, the resistance that <italic>sinpapeles </italic>opposed was shaped across different scales of legality and the political, for example: the state Foreigners’ law on the national scale; religious scale; universal human rights on a transnational scale; customs from immigrants’ places of origin on a religious and natural law scale; and, of course, what I would call the insurgent scale.</p>
<p>To begin with, the state-level scale was probably the most relevant. On the one hand, the different acts of protest occurring simultaneously unified the struggle at a state level. On the other hand, the Foreigners’ law was the state-level legal framework imposed by the government during the conciliation process. This is why the initial demands by the <italic>sinpapeles </italic>for the cessation of police repression, for the non-application of deportation sanctions and the regularization of all immigrants in Spain were refused by the government. It did so in the name of legality. In this sense, legality – state law – was a way of limiting regularization and the recognition of rights. Several ministers even referred to European law, such as the conclusions of the Tampere European Council (October 1999), to justify their position. Supranational norms, they argued, prevented them from accepting the demands posed by the immigrants.</p>
<p>This line of argumentation was disassembled by activist lawyers who always based their demands on international humanitarian treaties and the democratic and social principles of European law. The spokesperson of the Defence Commission of the Bar Association of Barcelona, Elvira Posada, invoked the inalienable jurisdictional guarantees in borders and to detainees. She also made reference to the compromises aimed at eradicating racism and xenophobia that foresaw the conclusions of Tampere and said nothing about the inconvenience of regularization processes.</p>
<p>During the struggle, the voluntary work of lawyers in interpreting the legal order in a progressive way was decisive. Owing to the necessity of presenting the initial political demands in legal format, the four basic claims demanded at the beginning of the <italic>encierros</italic> were transformed, or we could even say ‘juridified’, into what the assembly of immigrants publicly presented on 27–28 January. Firstly, it demanded the extension of the revision assumptions foreseen in the 239/2000 and 142/2001regularization decrees to those who were not able to fulfil all the requirements. Secondly, the urgent assignment of a special budget was necessary for the acquisition of staff and the means to sort out delays in the departments and offices in charge of regularization procedures. Thirdly, the assembly of <italic>sinpapeles</italic>, together with other migrants, wanted a guarantee that detentions and expulsions would not be carried out. Finally, the granting of residence permits could and should be done according to what the law called ‘exceptional circumstances and humanitarian reasons’. Later, these four claims became even more grounded in formal law during negotiations with the ombudsman and those within the government, which led to the Barcelona agreement.</p>
<p>However, not everything was based in positive formal law. Most of the demands claimed during the struggles in 2001 were based in natural law. The protestors were claiming a kind of universal values system that should be inherent for all human beings. Some of these values had been positivized recently in international treaties but not guaranteed or even recognized by Spanish immigration regulations. It is possible to set out three main ideas that fit the protestors’ demands based on universal values. The first comprises <italic>dignity</italic> and <italic>respect</italic> for humanity: during the <italic>encierros</italic>, many voices claimed, and are still claiming, that contemporary migration regulation promotes a range of abuse and exploitation. The second is <italic>
</italic>
<italic>equality</italic>, as ‘papers for all’ refers to equal access to rights regardless of origin, nationality, gender and legal status. The third is <italic>freedom</italic>, related to the right to move and establish oneself freely within territories without the obstacles that borders and controls represent.</p>
<p>It is not insignificant that all the <italic>encierros</italic> in Barcelona, and some in the rest of Spain, took place in Catholic churches. Although the Spanish state constitutionally declares itself ‘non-confessional’ (article 16.3), in some circumstances religious norms prevail over state law, at least in practice. The power of the words pronounced by the parish priest, Mossen Vidal, ‘the Law of the Gospel is beyond the Foreigners’ Law’, had an enormous symbolic weight. Mainly, it prevented the police from entering Santa Maria del Pi because it effectively located a non-positive norm – the Gospel – above an organic law, and, at the same time, resurrected a historical rule of asylum in sacred buildings. Of course, the police could have entered the church following a mere order of the sub-delegate or any other high public officer, but a kind of non-written rule had stronger legitimacy than the formal legal order. Eleven churches became sanctuaries for almost 1000 <italic>sinpapeles </italic>during the time of the strictest immigration policy in recent Spanish history.</p>
<p>In fact, the <italic>encierros</italic>, or the occupation of public squares and buildings, hunger strikes, boycotts, assemblies, demonstrations and civil disobedience, were not mere instruments of protest. Since <italic>sinpapeles</italic> were considered as outlaws, these were the only peaceful tools that irregular immigrants could use because they were deprived of any right to political and social participation. There was not a single article of state law that recognized any of these means of action. ‘Allegality’, conceived as the space where state law is absent, was the only way to make their voices heard.</p>
<p>Finally, of course, inside the <italic>encierros</italic> there was a degree of self-organization and certain norms were observed. For instance, assemblies had their own procedures. Not everybody could talk at once because order had to be respected. Another example is the high level of internal cohesion. During the <italic>encierros</italic>, unity became the supreme norm. Divided, the immigrants would have had no strength. That is why the government tried so many times to break up the cooperative by attempting to make deals with individual leaders or collectives. These situations generated moments of internal conflict and were solved sometimes with dialogue, sometimes with expulsion from the <italic>encierros</italic> or with the relegation of the leader. I have already described above how each <italic>encierro</italic> had its own assembly where most problems were solved and how <italic>sinpapeles</italic> and volunteers formed different committees that were in charge of the diverse needs of the struggle (health, negotiations, financing, food, disseminating information). In the end, a complex structure was established where each group, committee or spokesperson had a special task, given by the assembly, and to whom they were accountable. In short, the immigrants developed their own legality, an almost self-governing normative system made up of a number of rules to maintain internal order and external struggle. As had been the case with their negotiations, the tactic was to find those gaps across scales that could be used for their struggle. <italic>Sinpapeles</italic> were invisible when it came to rights granted by state law but not when it came to protest or democratic decision-making. In these instances, they managed to flow across boundaries of law, breaking the trichotomy of legality, illegality and allegality.</p>

<title>Conclusion: <italic>Sinpapeles</italic> as Legal Activist Citizens</title>
<p>
<italic>Sinpapeles</italic> migrant movements constituted themselves as subjects of legality not only when they acted as political subjects against the law that tried to deny them political subjectivity but, specifically, when they positioned their struggles amongst multiple legal orders and finally achieved the goal of ‘papers for all’ that was stated in the political Agreement of Barcelona. This agreement, as mentioned before, was implemented in all the administrative sections of the Immigration Office and concluded in the regularization of 330,000 immigrants in June 2001. Analysis of the struggles of <italic>sinpapeles </italic>both through acts of citizenship and from a legal perspective has allowed us to conceive of citizenship as strategies and technologies that constitute claimants of political rights as political subjects. Moreover, it has made it possible to include those acts that constitute subjects in the production of norms. Indeed, this new perspective makes the empirical facts complement what Isin theorized from a political perspective. We have shifted from ‘the right to claim rights’ to the ability to determine the content of those rights.</p>
<p>To conclude this article on the <italic>sinpapeles</italic> movement in Barcelona, we need to answer an important question related to its theoretical approach. What kind of citizenship did the <italic>sinpapeles</italic> enact? Coining the idea of the ‘activist citizen’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912455944">Isin (2009</xref>) takes issue with Balibar’s interpretation of <italic>sans-papiers</italic> as ‘active citizens’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0964663912455944">Balibar, 2001</xref>). Balibar certainly argues that the <italic>sans-papiers</italic> had enlarged the concept of citizenship to include unwanted immigrants. For him, their most important contribution in this respect was that they behaved in accordance with the French republican tradition of citizenship; that is to say, they participated actively through a sustained period of mobilization and, in doing so, they became what one might call authentic ‘French citizens’ and this entitled them to the right to stay. By contrast, following Isin’s perspective, I argue that <italic>sipapeles </italic>were not acting through already written scripts, such as voting or taxpaying, or enacting themselves as authentic French republicans. Instead, they were creating a new scene and writing a new script that cannot be described by the term ‘active citizenship’. They were creating a new subject in the sense that they transformed themselves from illegalized subjects to legal subjects. Not only did they enact the right to access those rights that had been denied to them by the Foreigners’ law, but they also participated in the design of the process of legalization itself.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the demand ‘<italic>papeles para todos</italic>’ was a statement of the intention to make possible a new type of activist citizenship, rather than an active legal and political citizenship. Indirectly, it meant seeking an end to injustice and the production of a new legality. For this reason, rather than following an already existing script, the acts of staging a sit-in, demonstrating, striking and negotiating carried out by the <italic>sinpapeles</italic> created a new opportunity for claiming justice against the contemporary regime of selective control of migration. In turn, these acts developed a new understanding of citizenship. The reflection on the constitution of legal subjects to which I referred above must be located again at an abstract-theoretical level. The struggles analysed in this article only had a limited geographical and temporal impact. However, in my opinion, they have opened the door for further research on <italic>sinpapeles </italic>migrants and other groups deprived of the privilege of citizenship status. More research is needed to discuss how these and other subjects erupt into the public space and demonstrate their ability to produce, modify and eliminate norms as another element of contested citizenship. The rupture not only occurs when subjects are recognized by the legal system as subjects of rights, but also when, after being persecuted by the system itself, those subjects end up negotiating and signing a document that leads to the regularization of thousands of people. If Isin proposes certain strategies and technologies through which subjects become political, can we then refer to strategies and technologies of becoming legal subjects too?</p>
