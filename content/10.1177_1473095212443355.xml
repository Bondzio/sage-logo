<p>Yosef Jabareen ties fear to planning in his empirical research conducted in Israel/Palestine, offering scholarly research in planning an important concept that is termed a ‘space of risk’. Yet, Jabareen’s research fails to outline the key theoretical aspects of fear which underpin his concept. The importance of fear to planning practice lies in helping planning scholars, and in particular those conducting research in cases of violent conflict, to understand the complexity that underpins spaces of anxiety, risk and threat. Analysis in this article therefore attempts to further conceptualise fear in planning theory, building upon and complementing Jabareen’s conceptualisation of a ‘space of risk’. A fresh area for scholarly research in planning theory emerges that addresses the politics of fear and the impact that fear has on the production of spaces in violent settings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fear has been a central theme in anthropology, criminology, geography, sociology and urban politics. The discipline of geography, for example, includes three approaches that address human difference through the lens of fear: 1) individual fear, 2) feminist geography and 3) ‘globalised fear’. Albeit in different ways, the difference in these approaches is located at the juncture between the ‘known’ and ‘unknown’ that produce competing interests fuelled by, for example, social hierarchies and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473095212443355">Harrison, 2007</xref>). In this vein, risk in geography is clearly articulated, implying the ‘unknown’ or, perhaps better stated, ‘the undeciderable’, which ‘haunts society as a spectre and induces anxiety’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473095212443355">Gunder, 2008</xref>: 201). In contrast, despite well-established publications (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212443355">Pain, 2009</xref>), fear’s conceptualisation in geography is far from clear-cut due to ‘fundamental differences over methodologies, politics and explanations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473095212443355">Shirlow and Pain, 2003</xref>: 17).</p>
<p>In planning, the debate associated with fear and risk is rather different. Human difference in planning theory is rooted in identity and diversity (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473095212443355">Amin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473095212443355">Healey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473095212443355">Gaffikin and Morrissey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1473095212443355">Watson, 2006</xref>). These literatures conceptualise difference, adopting the template of risk. In contrast, as this article argues, the issue of fear is still highly marginal to the main stages of theoretical development in planning theory. One exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473095212443355">Gunder (2008</xref>: 186) who nevertheless conflates fear with risk, suggesting that the latter is ‘fear of the repressed, undecidable and unknown’. In this respect, Gunder’s articulation of fear ‘is the name we give to our uncertainty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473095212443355">Bauman, 2006</xref>: 2). Hence, fear in planning theory appears to be masked by risk to the extent that this fear has ‘become the invisible companion to debates about risk’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473095212443355">Furedi, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">Jabareen’s (2006)</xref> empirical study, which sheds light on the importance of fear to planning practice and in particular to planning in violent settings. His analysis, largely using a Nazareth case study, offers a template to conceptualise fear in planning theory. In so doing, he develops the concept of a ‘space of risk’ that points to a ‘lived space’ marked by a minimal degree of trust. ‘Defenceless’ ethnic groups emerge in this space due to urban riots, terrorising and in particular conflicting urban identities anchored in territorial disputes. The issue of fear seriously challenges collaborative practices in planning, thereby having an impact on how planners approach territorial dispute. In this vein, a space of risk is also useful in so far as it helps planners develop practical alternatives to injustice and socio-spatial discrimination.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Jabareen’s concept of a ‘space of risk’ has two problems. First, this concept not only lacks the theoretical grounding of fear in its conceptualisation, but also conflates fear with risk. For example, Jabareen’s analysis provides a simple definition of risk. Accordingly, risk poses a threat embodied in uncertainty. Another example concerns how we might discern ‘anxiety’, or how planning scholars interpret ‘risk’. These are questions that remain as yet unanswered in Jabareen’s analysis. A useful starting point to address these questions is Beck’s concept of ‘risk society’. However, this concept remains untouched in a space of risk. The second problem concerns fear of the ‘defenceless’. Despite this fear being evident in spatial practices of the everyday, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">Jabareen (2006)</xref> observes in his Nazareth case study, his concept of space of risk does not specify how planners might articulate this fear, or rather, how fear has its impact spatially.</p>
<p>This article therefore argues that fear in planning theory not only appears to be masked by risk but also that fear is incompletely theorised – the notion of a ‘space of risk’ has already started this theorisation. In an attempt to develop this argument, this article has two aims. The first aim is to complement Jabareen’s analysis of conceptualising a space of risk. This article accordingly seeks to develop the key theoretical aspects of fear which underpin a space of risk. The second aim is to foreground the role of fear in planning theory. In this respect this article addresses what fear does to repress ‘defenceless’ ethnic groups and how this fear shapes ‘lived space’ within violent settings. To fulfil these two aims, the article proceeds as follows. Rather than outlining a clear definition of fear, as described in the Special Issue of <italic>Urban Studies</italic> (2001), this article begins by reviewing attempts to understand fear from the three geographical perspectives of the individual, feminist geography and ‘globalised fear’. This understanding is developed in the section that follows on planning practice in violent settings. Conclusions are then drawn in a final section responding to the article’s two aims.</p>

<title>Understanding fear</title>
<p>This section narrates the three geographical perspectives of fear. Its analysis examines each approach, drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela’s (2010)</xref> concept of fear. For Koskela, whilst fear from an individual perspective is pure emotion, it rests on two other aspects that shape its outlook. One is the social relations that interpret how spaces are socially produced. Koskela suggests that this production is tied to how ‘we’ intersect with ‘Others’, rather than being embodied in individuals’ emotions. ‘We’ accordingly adopt ‘telling’, as a strategy, in an attempt to spread the message about fearful ‘Others’. As a result, fear accentuates in the process of ‘othering’ because ‘Others’ are always blamed when ‘we’ are frightened. The second aspect is the impact of fear on the ‘spatial realities’ of the everyday, to the extent that without fear configuring spatiality it remains pure emotion leading to ‘a state of mind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>). Whilst fear emerges as a consequence of social relations, its impact is effective at the spatial level. The three sub-sections that follow illustrate how we might understand fear from the perspective of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela’s (2010)</xref> concept.</p>
<sec id="section3-1473095212443355">
<title>The individual (humanistic) model of fear</title>
<p>Individuals’ emotions (for example anger, anxiety, terror, worry or fear) are at stake in this model. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela (2010)</xref>, these emotions intertwine multiple and unpredictable realities which are governed by subjectivity. Anxiety, fear and risk underpin these realities, bringing to the fore how individuals judge incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473095212443355">Nussbaum, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, ‘anticipated anxiety about crime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473095212443355">Banks, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473095212443355">Leslie et al., 2003</xref>) on the one hand implies an incomplete emotion provoking fear to survive when facing the ‘unknowable’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473095212443355">Banister and Fyfe, 2001</xref>), and on the other, is a constantly changing state of perceptions, largely rooted in ‘individuals’ subjectivity and biography’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473095212443355">Lupton and Tulloch, 1999</xref>). Risk overshadows such perceptions suggesting how individuals strive for the ‘extra-rational’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473095212443355">Lupton and Tulloch, 1999</xref>). Risk in this respect marks those frightened as ‘irrational’ because their fear records in the human mind information about how ‘Others’ experience pain, anxiety or uneasiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473095212443355">Banks, 2005</xref>) to the extent that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212443355">Pain (2009</xref>: 469) defines risk as the ‘unpredictable, uncontrollable and ultimately incommunicable’. Consequently, illusion overwhelms such a perspective and prevents any ‘real risk’ assessment. Anxiety is central in this assessment because it emerges in response to threats embodied in ‘integrity of the Self at the unconscious level’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473095212443355">Lupton and Tulloch, 1999</xref>: 513).</p>
<p>Fear intertwines anxiety and risk. This is because fear is ‘locally’ produced by ‘non-rational’ ‘Others’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela (2010)</xref> suggests. However, her argument does not tell us how such production might happen. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473095212443355">Banks (2005)</xref> addresses this question, arguing for the time-space ‘structuring forces’ of the everyday. Such forces construct various contexts, for example, fear of crime. In this context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473095212443355">Banks (2005)</xref> observes that being a victim is neither governed by an individual’s history nor shaped by his/her experience (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>), thereby casting doubt on arguments about the ‘situatedness of fear’ anchored in individuals’ subjectivity.</p>
<p>Albeit in different ways, Banks’ and Koskela’s analyses suggest that fear is an emotion that correlates with an individual’s geography. This is because emotions leave their imprint about places in human minds. In turn, places are not only configured through ‘meanings constructed by experience’ but also through ‘the more passive and direct modes of [this] experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>: 390). Hence, emotions use affiliation/belonging in an attempt to shape a ‘sense of place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473095212443355">Gold and Revill, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1473095212443355">Rose, 1993</xref>). While affiliation might be a key in the spatiality aspect of an individual model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela (2010</xref>: 391) suggests two terms that develop this aspect further. First, ‘topophilia’ describes ‘a strong sense of place or local identity’ paying attention to meanings, feelings and, in particular, to disgust and fear. The second term is ‘topophobia’ that labels some places as being dangerous in an attempt to warn us about our safety, thereby affecting the sense of belonging to these places. Albeit in different ways, the two terms conceptualise fear and play a key role in fuelling a discourse of [in]security. In so doing, this fear anchors in human minds negative images labelled to certain places, leading to a ‘landscape of fear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1473095212443355">Tuan, 1979</xref>). Social mobility in the quest to achieve one’s safety – or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473095212443355">Hubbard (2003)</xref> calls the ‘ecology of fear’ – is a key to shaping the parameters of this landscape. Tuan’s landscape of fear addresses social mobility at the physical scale of place, ignoring individuals’ perceptions of a particular landscape. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473095212443355">Hubbard (2003)</xref> therefore describes Tuan’s landscape as a ‘bunker mentality’ marked by concrete-tower buildings of rough surfaces. Hubbard further questions how Tuan’s landscape of fear provokes the production of emotions. In essence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473095212443355">Hubbard’s (2003)</xref> critique sheds light on what evokes fear which remains untouched in the literature debating the ‘landscape of fear’.</p>
<p>One exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1473095212443355">Valentine’s (2008)</xref> analysis that examines the geography of encounter in an attempt to establish ‘meaningful contacts’ capable of filling the gap between value and practice. Valentine’s analysis does not address how spaces are utilised in the face of the ‘unknown’. One response suggests that fear is tied to memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>), particularly those that are constructed around frightening or unpleasant stories. Accordingly, memories parallel permanent fixtures installed in human minds spurring individuals to escape their anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473095212443355">Neill, 2001</xref>) who in response advocate ‘escapism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>). Individuals vary in relation to what might be conceived in their perceptions as risky places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473095212443355">Shirlow and Pain, 2003</xref>). However, a lack of trust commonly encourages the exercise of control, rather than protection. In so doing, individuals manage their fear spatially by seeking ‘familiarity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095212443355">Low, 2001</xref>) by, for instance, ethicising spaces through spatially ‘coded’ symbols of aesthetic and colour codes that use colours of human skin as a template to construct boundaries of ‘colour-coded’ neighbourhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1473095212443355">Webster, 2003</xref>) which offer protection from imagined threats.</p>
<p>Racist fear overshadows these boundaries that create ‘spatial hindrances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>) in the effort to form identity and eventually political sovereignty. Spatially ‘coded’ symbols are socially imposed hindrances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095212443355">Schuermans and De Maesschalck, 2010</xref>) that are identified either through cultural practices or religious clothes. These codes inspire those resisting the imposition of cultural diversity to feel uncomfortable. Therefore, a sense of risk emerges. To remedy this risk, physical design is common. However, such solutions are ‘naïve and simplistic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1473095212443355">Whitzman, 2007</xref>) because they are aesthetic and ignore the social aspects of spaces. The importance of these aspects lies in the illusion that, on the one hand, labels ‘Others’ as committing crime, for example. On the other, this illusion suggests that ‘whiteness’ has no place for so doing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095212443355">Schuermans and De Maesschalck, 2010</xref>). Note that ‘whiteness’ is labelled to ‘white western populations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212443355">Pain, 2009</xref>) that reside in wealthy urban quarters marked by ‘planned developments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095212443355">Maher, 2003</xref>). ‘Nonwhite’, in contrast, implies ‘chaotic’ developments that overwhelm residential quarters, mainly inhibited by the working class.</p>
<p>Another response brings to the fore the fact that spaces are politicised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1473095212443355">Shirlow, 2003a</xref>). Peter Shirlow, who conducted empirical research in Belfast in an effort to examine the link between fear and the spatial perceptions of risky places, interprets illusion further suggesting collective ‘self’ that is ‘loyal, trusted and true’. In contrast, the collective ‘Others’ imply ‘evil’ without the need for verification. The result is an exhausting struggle transmitted spatially, which leads to ‘communally devoted places’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473095212443355">Shirlow, 2001</xref>) built on myth and ethnic ‘imagining’ in an attempt to distinguish these places from the ‘territorial other’. In this light, the strategy of ‘telling’ fuels distinctions by spreading the message that ‘collective others’ are deviant, thereby encouraging individuals to monitor their spatial mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1473095212443355">Shirlow, 2003a</xref>). Subjective coding is key in laying the template for violence through devices instituted locally in an attempt to form ideological unity marked by culture, legitimacy and politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473095212443355">Shirlow, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In essence, Shirlow’s research brings to the fore the notion of desire coupled with a ‘fear paradox’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473095212443355">Hubbard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473095212443355">Lupton and Tulloch, 1999</xref>). Accordingly, fear influences urban communities differently. For example, the elderly, upper and middle-income classes are more frightened than others of being victimised. In reality, these groups are less likely to be threatened. Hence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473095212443355">Lupton and Tulloch (1999</xref>: 509) term such groups ‘the passive victims’, or ‘prisoners of their fear’. This is because these groups develop comprehensive knowledge or ‘mental maps’ of risky places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473095212443355">Shirlow, 2001</xref>), which on the one hand identify ‘Others’ as ‘strangers’, who evoke fear because they are labelled as ‘deviant or transgressive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473095212443355">Shirlow and Pain, 2003</xref>: 15). These ‘Others’ are therefore categorised as ‘potentially dangerous rather than simply as different’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>: 403). On the other hand, ‘mental maps’ cast light on awareness tied to a ‘telling’ strategy, thereby warning those frightened about risky places. Those frightened therefore adopt ‘avoidance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473095212443355">Hubbard, 2003</xref>) using surveillance – as is the case with ‘familiarity’ – that is compatible with a border of control in an attempt to distinguish between ‘us’ and fearful ‘Others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473095212443355">Lawsona, 2007</xref>). What might fuel a desire to exclude ‘Others’?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095212443355">Low (2001)</xref>, drawing on Oscar Newman, suggests that those frightened would ‘always’ choose to live in isolation from ‘Others’ to the extent that separation becomes anchored in an us ‘mentality’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473095212443355">Shirlow (2001)</xref> interprets this isolation tying fear to ‘desire’. A culture of hating ‘Others’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095212443355">Schuermans and De Maesschalck, 2010</xref>) marks this intersection, advocating a desire to live in gated spaces, which is fuelled by anger at, and fear of, fearful ‘Others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095212443355">Low, 2001</xref>). ‘We’ do so because in a culture of hate ‘Others’ pose a threat to welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473095212443355">Shirlow, 2003b</xref>). In this vein, safety is not the primary concern. Rather, prestigious living is sought, fuelled by desire that maintains stark difference using ‘exclusivity’ in the effort to distinguish ‘us’ from fearful ‘Others’. Class and race are the tools in the quest to be socially homogenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095212443355">Maher, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In the end, the humanistic model uses individuals and their social relations to understand fear from the perspective of identity. Fear in this perspective is on the one hand inextricably tied to ‘Others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473095212443355">England and Simon, 2010</xref>), and on the other, it is ‘unspecified, flickering, non-personal [and] not power related’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>: 392). The perspective examines classifications of age, class, ethnicity and gender that define the social markers (for example mobility, housing, access and employment) and their spatial locations. In so doing, how individuals perceive threats is crucial because theorists of the humanistic model use these perceptions to address how this fear configures spatiality. Individuals’ perceptions encourage social boundaries and create spaces marked by excluding ‘Others’, whose identities evoke the illusion of posing threats. These threats accordingly exist outside the social relations to the extent that many scholars (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>) label the humanistic model as trivial. This is because this model ignores that threats may well stem from inside the social relations.</p>

<sec id="section4-1473095212443355">
<title>Feminist geography’s model of fear</title>
<p>Day-to-day practices are at stake in feminist urban studies. Fear in these practices produces power relations tied to difference rooted in gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473095212443355">Pain, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1473095212443355">Thomas, 2005</xref>). Gendered fear, or fear of difference, emerges which is not that of the ‘unwanted’, as described in individual model. Rather, fear from this gendered perspective is socially produced by weaving a relation in which ‘Others’ are labelled as a threat. Fear in this relation is constantly challenged, resisted and reshaped, leading to excluding ‘Others’, as described in the individual perspective of fear, discussed in the preceding sub-section. However, two key distinctions mark feminist geography. Firstly, fear lays the template for ‘an arena of conflict’ mobilised by political ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473095212443355">England and Simon, 2010</xref>) – rather than merely a concern with the object, as described in the individual model. The second distinction lies in the emotional perspective of fear. Emotions in feminist geography are not about how individuals relate to place, as the individual model suggests. Rather, emotions in feminist geography remain ‘meaningful through experience and interpretation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>: 393). Feminist geography therefore witnesses a change in conceptualising fear. As Koskela suggests, this shift implies that fear from a gendered perspective is embedded in the ‘power-related’ contexts of the everyday. Women accordingly receive fearful images labelled to particular places, not only because of how they individually conceive their surroundings but also because of how space is monitored by varying ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Two concepts mark the change in this conceptualising of fear. One is the ‘gendered geography of fear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1473095212443355">Whitzman, 2007</xref>), which emerges in response to the neglect of women’s role in human geography research. This concept challenges the ‘taken-for-granted’ knowledge that informs our surroundings. Feminist geography uses the local scale in an effort to examine how gender has evolved, or is being reshaped, in the everyday (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473095212443355">Bondi and Rose, 2003</xref>). Women’s mobility is paramount in these studies, suggesting gender inequality in public space to the extent that ‘the city [is] for men, the home for women’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473095212443355">Enjeu and Save, 1974</xref>: 10). To address these inequalities, Suzanne Mackenzie suggests that gender is integral to the ‘production and reproduction’ of urban capitalism. Her work also suggests a move beyond a spatial dichotomy of public and private spheres. However, critics (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473095212443355">Connell, 1987</xref>) point out the failure of socialist-feminists to recognise the problems inherent in sexuality.</p>
<p>To stem the failure, attempts in feminist geography (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473095212443355">Knopp, 1992</xref>) have questioned the relationship of sexuality and spatiality, which is studied through the lens of gendered space in an effort to address how women use this space in response to males’ violent behaviour. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473095212443355">Bondi and Rose (2003)</xref>, for example, suggest that women’s use of this space is circumscribed by either their fear of crime or their concern about safety. Another example is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1473095212443355">Rose (1993)</xref>, who examines ‘stereotypical images’ that help women mark risky spaces, thereby adopting ‘avoidance’. Women do so because they are ‘active agents’ modifying their spatial mobility, or rather, they choose to remain indoors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473095212443355">Hollander, 2001</xref>). Therefore, women unintentionally enable spaces dominated by males. A sense of space emerges which is marked by harassment and sexist imagery, fuelling women’s fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1473095212443355">Rose, 1993</xref>). However, as Deborah Lupton suggests, fear, risk and everyday practice are not explicitly interlinked. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473095212443355">Listerborn (2002)</xref> in this respect recognises a dichotomy that marks the public space as either ‘enabling’ or hindering women’s spatial mobility.</p>
<p>Gendered space is more than about men and women who create, define and claim space. Instead, the lynchpin of gendered space is a ‘fear paradox’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473095212443355">Brownlow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473095212443355">Pain, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1473095212443355">Whitzman, 2007</xref>). This paradox is inherent in the relationship of fear, gender and risk which conceptualises fear as socially constructed. Here, women are statistically at lower risk of experiencing violence than others, despite feeling most at risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1473095212443355">Whitzman, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473095212443355">Bondi and Rose (2003)</xref> note that women become victims twice: the first is the fear of violence and the second, the irrationality of this fear. This accentuates the ‘power of uncertainty’ derived from insecurity and worries, and negates the likely risks of women becoming victimised (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>). Risk is therefore not aligned to scientific equations. In contrast, it closely relates in gendered space to emotions emerged from women’s personal experiences and their memories.</p>
<p>Another concept that shifts the conceptualisation of fear is the discursive of fear in relation to gender identities. Gender is a central theme in this concept; however, it is coloured with differences such as class, ethnicity and race. These differences in turn shed light on ‘axes’ of identity, which are not only constructed through lived experiences but also tied to particular spaces, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473095212443355">Bondi and Rose (2003)</xref> observe. Their work attempts to address how spaces – conceived as ‘materially grounded social construction’– shape the everyday practices of gender identities. Fear discourses are prominent in this shaping which create, and hold onto, ‘the shifting boundaries’ developed ‘between deviance and belonging, order and disorder’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473095212443355">England and Simon, 2010</xref>: 204). To put it differently, such discourses point to how differences in the local context help shape gender identities and their consequent relations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473095212443355">Soja and Hooper (1993)</xref> suggest that the ‘cultural politics of difference’ drive social and spatial divisions, leading to the ‘empowerment’ of a particular ethnic group. This is because socially constructed power differentials establish categories of difference, enabling one group’s hegemony. A ‘struggle’ of ‘brute fashioning’ creates socially constructed space marked by strategic shaping. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473095212443355">Soja and Hooper (1993</xref>: 183) draw on American feminist author bell hooks in an attempt to interpret such shaping through marginalised spaces as ‘a spatiality of inclusion, rather than exclusion’; however, how to address inclusion remains veiled in shadow in their work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473095212443355">Jacobs and Fincher (1998)</xref> fill the gap, conceptualising difference as socially produced. Strategic shaping marks this production. Therefore, it notes difference constructed through ‘empowerment, oppression and exclusion [which] work[s] through regimes of difference’ (pp.2–3).</p>
<p>Fear of difference, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473095212443355">Jacobs and Fincher (1998)</xref>, lays the basis for such a regime and brings to the fore the formulation of social control. A struggle of unequal social relations has at its core how to use and control space in which women oppose and obey – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1473095212443355">Gill Valentine (2008)</xref> calls this opposition ‘patriarchal social control’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473095212443355">Mehta and Bondi (1999)</xref> address this struggle by adopting post-structuralist theories of subjectivity. Note that these theories define the ‘discursive production and reproduction of gendered identities’ as ‘constructed and lived’ whilst rejecting the notion that this reproduction emerges due to a predefined set of particular meanings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473095212443355">Mehta and Bondi (1999)</xref> reframe this definition by developing the notion of ‘embodied discourse’. Gender identities accordingly configure actors as ‘agents’, who are capable of resisting and complying. Nevertheless, Mehta and Bondi appear to neglect in their ‘embodied discourse’ the strategic shaping of embodied identities in the social practices of resistance and compliance.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above critique, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473095212443355">Bondi and Rose (2003)</xref> tie the fear of difference to anxiety. ‘Gendered geographies of fear’ also describe anxiety in relation to defending ‘gender regimes’. Bondi’s and Rose’s description of anxiety is rather different in this respect. It discusses anxiety from the perspective of the ‘gendered politics of struggle’. This perspective addresses how best to intervene strategically in the face of ‘positive/optimistic’ or ‘negative/pessimistic’ discourses. In essence, this perspective describes the extent to which femininities and masculinities successfully manifest themselves in their urban surroundings. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1473095212443355">Price (2010)</xref> observes, multiple discourses of femininities and masculinities shape the urban, thereby configuring gender identity. In these discourses, differences not only remain amongst women but also between men and women.</p>
<p>Overall, whilst fear remains socially produced, as described in the individual model, this fear is politically shaped, embodying power relations in feminist geography. Two concepts emerge which attempt to explore this shaping. One is the ‘gendered geography of fear’ and the other is the discourse of fear in relation to gender identities. The latter concept describes the political shaping of fear more closely than the former, which describes ‘unhelpful’ perspectives marked by oppositions: for example, private-public, offenders-victims, men-women, safe-unsafe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1473095212443355">Whitzman, 2007</xref>). This is because the discourse of fear in relation to gender identities highlights difference as a key factor that drives gender inequalities. Albeit in different ways, both concepts suggest that fear configures spatiality at the ‘local scale’, thereby ignoring how this fear spreads at the global level.</p>

<title>Globalised model of fear</title>
<p>A globalised fear perspective not only replaces ‘local others’ with ‘global others’ or ‘evil other[s]’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1473095212443355">Sparke (2007)</xref> suggests, but also connects global tensions with insecurities that occur at the local level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>). The ‘war on terror’ in the wake of the terrorist attack on the Pentagon and World Trade Center in 2001 has led to modern societies in the West becoming obsessed with security. One result of this obsession is that frightful experience produced locally affects the broader culture and economy, thereby evoking widespread anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212443355">Pain, 2009</xref>). Another result is that fear shapes how ‘we’ relate to ‘Others’, leading to a relationship marked by excluding fearful ‘Others’. Such a relationship appears similar to that of the individual model. However, in ‘globalised fear’, the political geography ties fear to the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095212443355">Pain and Smith, 2008</xref>). Two aspects emerge. First, fear, caused by a humanitarian crisis or an environmental disaster, rapidly spreads at the global scale, ignoring national boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473095212443355">Bauman, 2006</xref>). Secondly, fear remains anchored in particular places, or rather, ascribed to certain social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095212443355">Pain and Smith, 2008</xref>). The two aspects spur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473095212443355">Furedi (2006)</xref> to suggest a ‘new’ global fear that marks the 21st century.</p>
<p>A ‘culture of fear’ is at stake as this ‘new’ perspective points to a ‘risk-averse’ response to situations embodied in negative reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212443355">Pain, 2009</xref>). This is because a ‘culture of fear’ embodies mistrust, leading to distorted social relations that become the template for a ‘shaken’ society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>). Messages, spread across the globe, overshadow different societies with widespread and shared illusions that are constructed through a ‘gung-ho conviction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1473095212443355">Sparke, 2007</xref>). The source of potential threat remains at the local scale, but is difficult to identify or to avoid to the extent that individuals are unable to question what is the truth. How fear affects these individuals, or how they handle threats, are of secondary importance in a ‘culture of fear’ perspective, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095212443355">Pain and Smith (2008)</xref> suggest.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela (2010)</xref> suggests that despite threats being labelled unpleasant or unavoidable, individuals do not mitigate these threats. Conversely, individuals hold onto fear in an attempt to justify defending their territories in the face of unknown threats that stem from an ‘outside’ and/or are marked by ‘randomness’. In particular, a paradox marks global fear. Its advocates suggest that ‘whiteness’ and/or the privileged classes advocate fear in an effort to mobilise political actions. This fear excludes those who either belong to ‘blackness’ or the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473095212443355">Gregory and Pred, 2007</xref>). For example, governmental institutions promote a threat/terrorism discourse in an attempt to justify their political policies or legitimate their exercise of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>). The mass media perpetuates acting strategically which has at its heart distorting the reputation of fearful ‘Others’. The media in this respect reinforces discourses about vague threats that affect global security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473095212443355">Shirlow and Pain, 2003</xref>). In turn, the media creates ‘symbolic enemies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>) coupled with ‘imaginary fear’ that uses emotions as ‘not necessarily passive, negative and disempowering’. Rather, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473095212443355">Pain (2010</xref>: 236) maintains, emotions in the global perspective ‘lead to individual and collective action’. A ‘risk society’ emerges, one which is shaken by the ‘unpredictable, uncontrollable and ultimately incommunicable’ conditions. Individuals, in this society, are obliged to search for own ways of defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473095212443355">Furedi, 2006</xref>). Therefore, a growing demand for urban security lays grounds for a popular culture in which fear is present at all ‘spatial, temporal and social’ levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212443355">Pain, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212443355">Pain (2009)</xref>, drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473095212443355">Katz’s (2007)</xref> work on the urban texture of police presence and security measures, suggests that social and political structures form threat’s very ‘texture’ in everyday life. Pain’s analysis argues that fear is promoted in the quest to ‘market urban fear’, evident in a steadily increasing consumption of security products and services. ‘Protection’ in this context lies at the intersection of desire and control. Since full security cannot be guaranteed, the subsequent frustration experienced by individuals leads to ‘a desire to locate and punish the culprits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473095212443355">Bauman, 2006</xref>: 130). Control is a determinant factor in the effort to gain better grip on the uncontrollable and thus fear is central to ‘feigning control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212443355">Pain, 2009</xref>). At the juncture between desire and control, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212443355">Pain (2009)</xref> notes that the concern with a society’s own welfare is less paramount. Defence becomes more important as a means of maintaining social control and spatial exclusion.</p>
<p>The ‘state-of-art’ security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473095212443355">Hubbard, 2003</xref>) associated with marketing properties interprets the forces that drive exclusion, thereby further suggesting how to ‘market urban fear’. This is due to the potential such security has which enables politically constructed fear of exercising power. In this context, fear is defined as ‘purposely representational of certain social ideals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473095212443355">Domosh, 1998</xref>: 210). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473095212443355">Neill’s (2001)</xref> empirical analysis suggests that these ideals are not only concerned with a particular image of the cosmopolitan environment but also with ‘deliberately’ averting sectarian troubles. Clearly, the state intervenes politically. In violent settings, the state fuels fear, using the media’s representation of crime and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473095212443355">Banks, 2005</xref>). This is because the media accentuates a global threat that affects the whole community at large whilst ignoring individuals’ emotions. This particular bias spurred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473095212443355">Pain (2010)</xref> to develop a ‘new’ geopolitics of fear that comprises four aspects.</p>
<p>One aspect concerns emotional geopolitics. Accordingly, fear is itself an emotion that emerges in the wake of terrorism to ‘a lesser degree’ than other emotional reactions, such as anger or hate. Fear also declines in parallel with time and distance. Despite fear of terrorism rapidly spreading across the globe, it grows and remains anchored in sites of terrorism, at the local scale. The second aspect is feminist geopolitics that addresses the question of ‘who might have become a more fearful subject’. As previously discussed, fear is tied to the privileged but largely affects the marginalised. Therefore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473095212443355">Pain (2010)</xref> suggests a third aspect that is ‘alter-geopolitics’. This aspect opposes dominance in the existing geopolitics. She then draws in her analysis on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473095212443355">Keye Askins’ (2008)</xref> notion of a ‘transformative geopolitics’. The latter resists the imposition of hegemonic state discourses and, instead, encourages ‘positive interactions’ inspired by the belief that fearful ‘Others’ may have the capacity for ‘a positive change’. Pain’s four aspects shed light on a dichotomy occurring between global risks and local fears. ‘Disempowering identities’ is a key cause of this dichotomy where political forces are blamed for manipulating emotions. Who is ‘in power’ and how power is effective remain veiled in shadow. Local fear has the potential to address these questions, thereby not only interpreting activities on the ground but also comprehending the state’s amplification of fear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095212443355">Pain and Smith (2008</xref>: 14) argue, therefore, that everyday fear potentially ‘speaks back, resists, and changes seemingly immutable forces’. Yet, this potential remains ‘untapped’, thereby requiring scholars’ attention for further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473095212443355">Pain, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the end, interpreting fear from the global perspective offers different insights to that of the ‘individual’ or ‘feminist geography’ perspective. One difference relates to individuals’ emotions, which are ignored in this perspective. Another difference concerns social relations. Despite these relations in the global perspective paralleling those described in the individual model, in the former these are configured in accordance with the state’s strategic shaping; this shaping brings to the fore a fresh aspect of fear which is termed a ‘culture of fear’. ‘Imaginary fear’ evoked by ‘symbolic enemies’ is accordingly privileged and/or politicised. A further difference concerns the spatial impact. In the global perspective, fear is spatially materialised and marketed, but remains effective at the local scale.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-1473095212443355">
<title>Tying fear to planning practice in violent settings</title>
<p>Having discussed the three approaches towards fear developed in geography, one may ask how these approaches, considered together, help an understanding of fear for planning theory and practice? First, we can understand fear as something often being politicised. Fear in this aspect is not the ‘unwanted’, or rather, the negative and/or ‘irrational’, as the individual model may suggest; rather, fear may be deployed as part of the state’s strategy towards its political ends. Materiality and territoriality are the lynchpin of politicising fear, creating arenas of struggle through which the strategic shaping of the state is accomplished, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095212443355">Pain and Smith (2008)</xref> suggest. Fear is accordingly ‘a product of the power relations that shape moral codes of the everyday conduct as well as those of international affairs’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095212443355">Pain and Smith, 2008</xref>: 9). The political aspect of fear configures ‘Others’ as ‘symbolic enemies’ evoked by an ‘imaginary fear’.</p>
<p>Second, fear intersects desire and control. A ‘paradox’ emerges in this intersection. The elderly and the middle class termed in the individual model of fear as ‘prisoners of their fears’ are on the one hand at low risk; yet on the other hand, these particular groups remain more frightened than others. A culture of hating ‘Others’ emerges, suggesting a desire that fuels the exclusion of deviant ‘Others’. Safety is not the primary concern in this culture but rather maintaining the difference. The ‘fear paradox’ is also evident in feminist geography. Women are accordingly more frightened, despite being at low risk. This sense of insecurity and anxiety then drives women’s desire to impose restrictions on their spatial mobility. The result is a desire to remain indoors. ‘Globalised fear’ also emphasises a paradox, largely inherent in a ‘culture of fear’, that locates fear to those labelled to ‘whiteness’ or the wealthy group. However, this fear equally affects ethnic minorities, the poor and the marginalised. A desire marks this paradox because the wealthy group holds onto this desire in an attempt to calm its fear by means of defence, apparent in surveillance technologies.</p>
<p>Analysis in the previous section suggests that fear produces spaces marked by exclusion, rather than by inclusion. The politics of fear help mobilise this exclusion, justifying the ‘necessity’ for surveillance and control. In this vein, fear is translated into control mechanisms and thus fear becomes materialised. The spatial management of fear varies, shedding light on the exercise of control.</p>
<p>In the individual model of fear, this exercise is by means of ‘escapism’ and ‘avoidance’. Individuals are said to believe that particular spaces pose threats. Therefore, such beliefs spur them to avoid these spaces, escaping their anxieties. The result is ‘spatial hindrances’ manifest in physical space and socially imposed circumstances of aesthetic and/or colour coding. ‘Familiarity’ and ‘telling’, as strategies, are central to these circumstances, which in turn propagate fear. In feminist geography, ‘stereotypical images’ and the ‘power of uncertainty’ fuel insecurity and worry, encouraging women to avoid certain spaces. Furthermore, gender as a central theme in feminist geography brings to the fore an ‘embodied discourse’ of fear which is about a struggle caused by unequal social relations of resistance and complying. ‘Globalised fear’ goes further, introducing a ‘culture of fear’ where moral dominance excludes ‘Others’ in an attempt to defend territories, rather than to maintain welfare. ‘Globalised fear’ does so by adhering to the principles of closure that are embodied in a ‘mobility regime’ constructed around affiliations and loyalties. Central to this regime is the media, devoted to achieving the ‘political ends’ of the state, or perhaps the ends of other actors aligned with the interests of the state.</p>
<p>Third, there is the fear of difference. In this regard, the individual model might not be described as ‘naive’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela (2010)</xref> claims. Rather, this model addresses difference from a narrow perspective in an attempt to distinguish between ‘us’ and fearful ‘Others’. Nevertheless, the individual model misses humans’ values labelled to differences, thereby ignoring power relations in its interpretation of fear. Feminist scholarship recognises these values embodied in spaces marked by ‘arena[s] of conflict’. Accordingly, difference in feminist geography is a struggle ‘constructed and lived’ around acting strategically. Peter Shirlow’s empirical research has examined the nature of acting strategically; using Belfast as a case study, he argues that fear is tied to difference. In this relationship, difference spurs a sense of belonging in an attempt to establish loyalties anchored in ‘local identity’. In turn, these loyalties support social boundaries of control that exclude fearful ‘Others’. Hence, ‘local identity’ is a central theme in the fear of difference, accentuating social and territorial controls backed by the politics of fear.</p>
<p>How does the understanding of fear outlined above better inform planning, particularly in violent settings? This section applies this understanding to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">Jabareen’s (2006)</xref> case study. In turn, the above aspects contributing to an understanding of fear suggest a conceptual frame that guides the remainder of this section.</p>
<p>The first aspect is that fear is politicised. This is true in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">Jabareen’s (2006)</xref> Nazareth case study. Research participants interviewed in this research affirm that the Israeli state played a major role in fuelling the eruption of violence around the Central Plaza, between Nazareth’s Christians and its Moslem residents. The state used planning mechanisms, such as giving a permit to construct a mosque in close proximity to the Church of Annunciation, as a tool to maintain its political ends of national hegemony and political sovereignty over Palestinians. Planning in this respect was used as a cover for an essentially political agenda. Indeed, Jabareen quotes Hana Hamdan, a planner in Nazareth, who states that ‘planning served not as a mediator but as a conflict producer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">2006</xref>: 317). Palestinians in this context were denied their rights to design the central plaza so that they could fulfil their ‘heart’s desire’. Fear is adopted in this conflict configuring the social relations of the two Palestinian communities in Nazareth, strategically shaped by the Israeli state, leading to sectarian lines that separate these communities at the local scale.</p>
<p>A ‘culture of fear’ overshadowed these lines in Nazareth, evoked by ‘symbolic enemies’ imagined and constructed around myth building compatible with ‘a virtual’ dispute, as Jabareen’s analysis suggests. Members of the other religious affiliation in this dispute become ‘symbolic enemies’ to the extent that ‘beloved neighbours have become an enemy’, as one interviewee in stated. For example, there were guards positioned at the key entrances of both communities’ neighbourhoods. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">Jabareen (2006)</xref> reports, a Muslim entering a Christian neighbourhood was interrogated in an effort to identify his religious identity, distinguishing an ‘us’ from an ‘Other’. A further example of a ‘culture of fear’ concerns other Muslims who attacked a Christian driver because of her crucifix. These examples drew on fear that stems from an outside, neighbourhoods from the other community or neighbourhoods from the ‘territorial other’. The examples also emphasise that fear is not only produced by the Israeli state but also by Palestinian communities – the marginalised and repressed. Indeed, fear in these communities is transmitted spatially, which is apparent in Jabareen’s quotes such as: ‘It was like going to a different state. You needed the right passport to enter’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">2006</xref>: 319).</p>
<p>The second aspect is that fear intersects with desire and control. The struggle over urban identity fuels the desire to separate Christian and Muslim communities in Nazareth. For example, according to an interviewee in Jabareen’s research, despite living in harmony in the past ‘Male Muslims and Christians were organised separately in the neighbourhood as worriers and enemies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">2006</xref>: 314). Symbolic elements in Nazareth, such as minaret, crucifix or church dome, acted as a source of potential threat, stemming from the identity of the other’s community. Religious identity, in itself, began to intensify violent conflict and consequently fear: ‘The Islamist leaders will use it [the mosque] only for provocation,’ one interviewee suggests in Jabareen’s analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">2006</xref>: 318). Hence, these elements became strategies adopted in the Nazareth case study to spread the message about the fearful ‘Others’. A struggle emerges that was coupled with a desire to rule the Nazareth Municipality, as Jabareen argues. Therefore, safety was not the main concern in the central plaza violence; rather it was about a dispute anchored in power relations. This desire was clearly evident in the two municipal elections following this violence, which occurred in April 1999. In these elections, Christians chose the Democratic Front and Moslems supported the Islamic Movement. One interviewee reports: ‘I voted for the Islamic movement in the Municipal elections because I want them to build the mosque in the plaza’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">Jabareen, 2006</xref>: 316). A desire is also evident in a Christian women’s fear that encourages imposing restrictions on her spatial mobility: ‘I have changed my driving routes in the city [Nazareth]. Today, I prefer not to enter some neighbourhoods’ (p.318).</p>
<p>Adhering to fear therefore justifies why Christian and Moslem communities in Nazareth continued to guard their neighbourhoods in the face of an imagined ‘Other’. The spatial management of this fear reflects the many strategies adopted to exclude fearful ‘Others’, as described in the three approaches developed in geography. ‘Familiarity’ is used in the Nazareth case in the effort to code fearful ‘Others’ using symbols of the religious affiliation to the extent that Christians and Moslems were ‘labelled by their religion’ or, as Jabareen suggests, the violence revolves around ‘Is it the minaret of the mosque or the dome of the church?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">2006</xref>: 315). Fear emerges in this violence, intertwining anxiety and worry. The ‘power of uncertainty’, in the Nazareth case, lays the foundation for individuals feeling insecure and worried, as Jabareen observes. This uncertainty stems from the ‘scarcity of resources’ available to both marginalised Palestinian communities in Nazareth, particularly since the establishment of Israeli state after 1948. As one interviewee claims: ‘We are a defeated nation, a fragmented minority who lost everything. Nothing remained for us after 1948. We are competing over the little that we have. And it is embodied in the small poor plaza’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">Jabareen, 2006</xref>: 315).</p>
<p>Christians and Moslems in Nazareth therefore adopted ‘escapism’ or ‘avoidance’ in an attempt to escape their anxieties, thereby exercising control that helps their communities to regulate their fears. Indeed, as Jabareen reports, ‘people tend to walk along the less risky routes and avoid places of violence and group conflict’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">2006</xref>: 318).</p>
<p>A ‘mobility regime’ therefore marks the Nazareth case that is constructed around ‘extended family’, religion and sectarianism. Belonging and loyalty are practised by distinguishing between ‘us’ and fearful ‘Others’ and transmitted spatially. For instance, ‘Muslims buy from Muslims and Christians from Christians’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">Jabareen, 2006</xref>: 319). Notably, loyalty to ‘communally devoted places’ not only distinguishes between the conflicting groups of Christians and Moslems in Nazareth but also within the same ethnic group: ‘Because I am not in favour of building the mosque, some of my previous Muslim friends have stopped taking to me’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">Jabareen, 2006</xref>: 317). Such regime establishes the basis for excluding ‘Others’. As one interviewee notes: ‘At the entrance of a Christian neighbourhood, I was asked about my religious affiliation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">Jabareen, 2006</xref>: 319).</p>
<p>Fear of difference was at the heart of the ‘mobility regime’ in Nazareth, which badly affected the residents’ sense of belonging (what Koskela terms ‘topophobia’). For example, one interviewee quoted in Jabareen’s analysis reports that upon entering a Christian neighbourhood ‘Other young people, who know me personally, came and said: Leave him alone. He is our friend’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">2006</xref>: 319). In addition to urban identity – a central theme in the fear of difference because it forms loyalties constructed around myth building and imagined fear – Jabareen suggests that ‘trust’ intersects with risk to create newly defined social boundaries that exclude fearful ‘Others’. The result is distorted social relations leading to ‘shaken’ society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela, 2010</xref>). In the case of Nazareth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">Jabareen (2006)</xref> suggests that trust is a key because it explains why individuals lack faith in co-existence and instead search for alternative constitutions developed around ‘religious affiliation and kinships’. As Jabareen argues, ‘The people’s trust in their religious group has increased, while trust between the groups has decreased’ (p.320) .</p>
<p>Now, what general findings can be drawn from applying the understanding of fear to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">Jabareen’s (2006)</xref> case study of Nazareth and, in turn, how do these findings enrich planning theory and practice. Note that fear in planning practice in violent settings is evoked by a ‘culture of fear’ that is constructed by myth building (‘virtual dispute’). The understanding of fear in these settings does not align to a particular perspective developed in geography. Rather, this understanding draws on all the perspectives developed in geography. Indeed, despite a ‘culture of fear’ spreading across neighbourhoods of Nazareth, as described by the global perspective, its effects remain manifest at the local scale, configuring the social relations of hate and distrust amongst the conflicting communities, as described by feminist geography. Fear, as shown in the Nazareth case, also stems from ‘outside’ the social boundaries because this fear labels the other community as fearful ‘Others’, as described by the individual perspective of fear.</p>
<p>In this article, weaving together the three geographical understandings of fear produces a comprehensive theory. This theory, which arguably underpins the theoretical aspects of a ‘space of risk’, makes a useful contribution to geography literature concerned with examining fear. This theory functions slightly differently in planning practice in violent settings, despite remaining in principle the same. Fresh aspects emerge that explain this difference. First, fear is politicised, leading to a ‘fear paradox’. This is true in planning practice in violent settings. As shown in the Nazareth case study, planning itself is adopted as a template to fuel violence, rather than to mediate violent conflict. Fear in this template is not the ‘unwanted’ or ‘irrational’. Rather, it is advocated according to the state’s political ends. However, this paradox is further complicated in planning practice since fear is promoted not only by privileged groups or the state regime but also by marginalised groups.</p>
<p>Second, fear intersects desire and control to exclude fearful ‘Others’ in planning practice in violent settings, which suggests the quest to remain in power, rather than to hold onto ‘prestige’ or maintain welfare, as developed in geography. Nevertheless, safety as before is not the primary concern. The ‘power of uncertainty’ fuels violence in violent settings, thereby strengthening the desire to remain apart. Desire’s effect is evident at the spatial level through the imposition of restrictions on mobility. A ‘mobility regime’ designed to exclude fearful ‘Others’ has emerged in Nazareth. ‘Extended family, religion and sectarianism are used to distinguish ‘us’ from fearful ‘Others’. These tools enable the exercise of control where ‘familiarity’ is a key in planning practice in violent settings. ‘Avoidance’ is adopted in these settings so that those frightened escape their anxiety and worry. Collectively, the exercise of control in planning practice in violent settings further supports the argument for a comprehensive theory of fear in which insights are not aligned to a particular perspective.</p>
<p>Fear of difference is a further theoretical aspect that shapes the ‘lived space’ of the violent settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela (2010)</xref> suggests memories tied to fear. This is evident in the Nazareth case study. Jabareen quotes one interviewee: ‘What I remember most is that we were not rich families. So, we, Christian and Muslim young women, used to exchange clothes among us. Exactly like sisters do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212443355">2006</xref>: 314).</p>
<p>Shirlow’s research in Belfast suggests that illusions constructed around myth building and ethnic ‘imagining’ distinguish between collective ‘self’ and collective ‘Others’. Illusion is also apparent in the Nazareth case, which is constructed around ‘virtual dispute’, imagined conflict. Planning practice in violent settings, as shown in Nazareth, offers a further response. It suggests the notion of trust in conjunction with loyalties and affiliations. Accordingly, individuals have a growing faith in their group’s affiliation in the events of violence, whilst they distrust members of other groups to a large extent.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article has two aims. The first seeks to identify the theoretical aspects that underpin a ‘space of risk’. To this end, the analysis in this article has applied Koskela’s concept of individuals, their social relations and configuring spatiality to the individual, feminist geography and ‘globalised’ models of fear. These three perspectives collectively provide a theory of fear. In the individual model, fear is primarily an individual emotion evoked by the fearful ‘Others’. This fear ties individuals to places, using categories embodied in pre-fixed classifications of identities. In turn, it creates social markers in the effort to configure individuals’ use of spaces. This use is evident in mobility, for example. Critics of the individual model point to this model’s failure to address power relations. Feminist geography incorporates power relations by suggesting that fear is socially produced. However, it is anchored at the local level only, thereby ignoring the global scale. ‘Globalised fear’ explains how fear spreads across the globe, foregrounding the strategic uses of fear. The state plays a central role in this respect, advocating fear in an attempt to achieve its ‘political ends’. However, ‘globalised fear’ does not conceptualise emotions and fears at the local scale. These are examined in the individual model and feminist geography, respectively. This critique of the global perspective advances the ‘new’ geopolitics of fear. In particular, local fears challenge the strategic shaping of the state in the global perspective, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212443355">Koskela (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212443355">Pain (2009)</xref> suggest.</p>
<p>The analysis of the three geographical perspectives of fear therefore suggests a comprehensive theory that underpins the theoretical aspects of a ‘space of risk’. Accordingly, fear in planning practice in violent settings follows a ‘culture of fear’ constructed around imagined threats. Besides, this theory suggests a number of theoretical aspects to further conceptualise a ‘space of risk’. First, fear is politicised in planning practice in violent settings which is marked by ‘fear paradox’. A two-pronged perspective emerges in this paradox. The first concerns planning that further fuels violence. The other perspective is the nature of this paradox, which is at odds in planning practice in violent settings as fear is advocated not only by the state regime but also by the marginalised. The second theoretical aspect that underpins a ‘space of risk’ is that fear in planning practice intersects with desire and control. The desire to remain in power explains why co-existence is an ideal. The ‘power of uncertainty’ is the template to this desire which fuels excluding fearful ‘Others’. Desire in planning practice in violent settings is apparent in a ‘mobility regime’ designed to exclude fearful ‘Others’, using ‘avoidance’. The exercise of control therefore marks conflicting societies. In this exercise, ‘extended family’, religion and sectarianism are useful tools so that ‘we’ could ethicise the social boundaries constructed around ‘us’ and territorial ‘Others’. The third theoretical aspect relates to the fear of difference that is prominent in this respect. Despite memories and illusions interpreting how to ethicise social boundaries, the perspective of trust constructed around loyalties and affiliations is a central theme in this aspect in planning in violent settings.</p>
<p>The second aim of this article is to unmask fear in planning theory. As analysis in this article argues, fear in planning theory is not only masked by risk but also draws on incomplete theorisation. The theoretical aspects, which underpin a ‘space of risk’ and are initiated in this article, outline how the politics of fear impact on the production of space. These insights offer a valuable and fresh agenda for scholarly research in planning theory. However, these theoretical suppositions are in need of further empirical research in planning, to further specify the scope and limits of a ‘space of risk’. Hence, the invitation is made here for other planning scholars to empirically apply these theoretical suppositions that underpin a ‘space of risk’ in the effort to further sharpen the theorising of fear in planning theory.</p>
