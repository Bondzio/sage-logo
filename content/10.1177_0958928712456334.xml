<p>With this edited volume Pieter Vanhuysse and Achim Goerres wish to shed light on the consequences of population ageing – one of the major policy challenges in advanced democracies. To do so they have brought together a group of senior and early career scholars from both sides of the Atlantic. Vanhuysse and Goerres depart from a simple and well-known fact. The demographic composition of advanced democracies is undergoing a shift in favour of the elderly as a consequence of low fertility and increased longevity. The overarching question for the eleven chapters is what implications this demographic shift has for the political arena and for the policies emerging from democratic institutions.</p>
<p>Certainly, this volume is not the first to address the topic of population ageing. Nonetheless, the book undoubtedly represents an original and timely contribution to existing research. While demographers, sociologists and social policy researchers have paid close attention to the implications of population ageing in recent years, ‘an explicitly comparative political science approach’ (p. 17) has been missing. The editors rightly stress that although not a new topic in political science (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928712456334">Lynch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0958928712456334">Pampel and Williamson, 1989</xref>), the discipline has an unfinished research agenda in this area. Population ageing has potential repercussions not only for pay-as-you-go pension systems, but also for anything from family policy, healthcare and labour policy to issues of intergenerational redistribution to party politics and ultimately democracy. The chapters presented explore these dynamics by focusing explicitly on the political aspects that underlie social programmes that target particular age groups (e.g. old age pensions, childcare provisions and parental leave arrangements). A number of important questions are explored: Do we see a shift in peoples’ attitudes towards such ‘generational policies’? Is the changing age structure leading to the emergence of a new political dividing line that manifests itself across age groups or cohorts? Are political parties reacting by changing their rhetoric and party programmes? How, if at all, is the role of political institutions as mediators in policymaking processes affected by older populations?</p>
<p>By including contributions that discuss a wide range of social policy areas (e.g. family, old age, labour, gender), the volume offers a much-needed broadening of the research agenda related to generational politics. Driven by the urge to scrutinise the theoretically appealing assumption that more age-biased population structures lead to policies that favour the old, there has thus far been a too narrow focus on policies aimed at the elderly (such as retirement rights and old age pension generosity). One of the merits of this book is to demonstrate that to fit the label ‘<italic>generational</italic> politics’ the research agenda should comprise the life-course from the cradle to the grave. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0958928712456334">Myles (2006</xref>: 135) has usefully reminded us that welfare state reforms typically involve the (arguably conflicting) goals of achieving ‘intergenerational fairness, intra-generational solidarity and gender equity while at the same time creating conditions for a strong economy and sound public finances’. With its investigations into social programmes aimed at different stages of the life course, the volume stands as a valuable empirical extension of Myles’ observation. That is, it presents a set of empirical analyses that are sensitive to the multiple dimensions and possible political cleavages (e.g. class, gender, region, age, generation) that come into play in advanced democracies which are struggling to restructure their welfare states in light of extreme fiscal pressures.</p>
<p>Considering the book’s richness in terms of methodological approaches as well as specific puzzles, it is evident that the editors have left aside any personal theoretical biases that they may have. Chapter authors have been given free reins to define focus, working with the methods they see appropriate. Ranging from small–comparative case studies to formalistic, model-based analyses, the contributions represent different ontological and methodological traditions. This methodological pluralism is refreshing and gives room for an inventive exploration of issues that a more stringent conceptual framework would most likely have rendered out of range. In short, the volume caters for a broad range of interests and anyone even vaguely concerned with the consequences of population ageing for modern welfare states will find something useful.</p>
<p>At the same time, the open-ended approach comes with a price. Some chapters stand out as more convincing, well-written and to the point than others. At times the book feels a little like a collection of articles with the common link between the individual chapters being rather blurred. As a consequence, it is difficult to pin down the main findings of the book. A concluding chapter, which draws some tentative conclusions or at least identifies some of the new questions emerging from the substantive chapters and outlines potential avenues for further research, could have strengthened the book’s overall coherence.</p>
<p>Nonetheless Vanhuysse and Goerres have put together a book that enhances our knowledge base for an enlightened debate about how population ageing affects the making of social policies, but that deliberately stops short of any definite conclusions and easy explanations. As the editors point out, the subject matter is ‘little known territory’ (p. 17) and what is provided is a ‘complex picture of the manifold dynamics of generational politics’ (p. 1).</p>
