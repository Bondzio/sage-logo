<abstract>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a serious autoimmune disease that can be life threatening and fatal if left untreated. Causes and prognostic indicators of death in SLE have been well studied in developed countries but lacking in developing countries. We aimed to investigate the causes of mortality in hospitalized patients with SLE and determine the prognostic indicators of mortality during hospitalization in our center. All SLE patients who were admitted to Sarawak General Hospital from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2010, were followed up in a prospective study using a standard protocol. Demographic data, clinical features, disease activities and damage indices were collected. Logistic regression and Cox regression analysis were used to determine the prognostic indicators of mortality in our patients. There were a total of 251 patients in our study, with the female to male ratio 10 to 1. Our study patients were of multiethnic origins. They had a mean age of 30.5 ± 12.2 years and a mean duration of illness of 36.5 ± 51.6 months. The main involvements were hematologic (73.3%), renal (70.9%) and mucocutaneous (67.3%). There were 26 deaths (10.4%), with the main causes being: infection and flare (50%), infection alone (19%), flare alone (19%) and others (12%). Independent predictors of mortality in our cohort of SLE patients were the presence of both infection and flare of disease (hazard ratio (HR) 5.56) and high damage indices at the time of admission (HR 1.91). Infection and flare were the main causes of death in hospitalized Asian patients with SLE. The presence of infection with flare and high damage indices at the time of admission were independent prognostic indicators of mortality.</p>

<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that predominantly affects young women. SLE can be life threatening and fatal if left untreated. Survival in SLE patients in developed countries has improved considerably over the last three decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312465780">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312465780">2</xref></sup> Recent studies report survival of 85% at 10 years and 75% at 20 years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312465780">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312465780">8</xref></sup> whereas a study in 1955 showed a survival of less than 50% at five years. Despite the improvement in survival, lupus patients still have a significant estimated mortality risk of three times that of the general population.</p>
<p>SLE has been reported to be more prevalent among Asians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312465780">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312465780">11</xref></sup> Asian patients with SLE have been reported to have a higher mortality rate compared with Caucasian patients in earlier studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312465780">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312465780">14</xref></sup> Later studies showed that Asian patients in developed countries have similar mortality rates to Caucasian patients. Poverty, level of education, cultural and behavioral factors were found to be confounders to ethnicity in determining clinical outcome of SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312465780">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Causes and prognostic indicators of death in SLE have been well studied in developed countries but lacking in developing countries. There is scarce clinical information on mortality studies among Asian lupus patients in the developing world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312465780">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312465780">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of our study was to investigate the causes of mortality in hospitalized SLE patients and determine the prognostic indicators of mortality during hospitalization in our center.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0961203312465780" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>We performed a prospective study of all hospitalizations in our patients with SLE (as defined by the 1997 revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312465780">19</xref></sup> managed in the Department of Medicine at Sarawak General Hospital in Sarawak, Malaysia, during a five-year period between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2010.</p>
<p>Sarawak, located in the island of Borneo, is the largest state in Malaysia. Sarawak has a resident population recorded in the year 2005 census of 2.316 million. The majority are the native population (71.6%), which comprises Iban (29.9%), Malay (21.1%), Bidayuh (8.4%), Melanau (5.4%) and diverse smaller ethnic groups (5.8%). The largest non-indigenous group is the Chinese (27.5%). Less than 1% are from other ethnic origins. Sarawak General Hospital is an 800-bed tertiary public hospital that is located in Kuching, the capital city of Sarawak. It is the largest public hospital providing sole tertiary rheumatology care in Sarawak.</p>
<p>All SLE admissions were identified from admission records located in the general medical wards. Patient information was collected from case notes, outpatient medical records and hospital discharge summaries. Demographics of patients, date of SLE diagnosis, number of ACR criteria present and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia were collected. Information on the study admission included date of admission, date of discharge, reasons for admission, SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312465780">20</xref></sup> Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/ACR Damage Index (SDI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312465780">21</xref></sup> cumulative prednisolone dose for the past 12 weeks prior to admission and the outcome, including the length of hospital stay, readmission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. Clinical remission was defined as a SLEDAI score of 0 and a physician global assessment (PGA) of 0. Antibody profiles of the patients included antinuclear antibody (ANA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), anti-Ro and anti-La. Treatment regimens were also collected.</p>
<p>Analysis was performed using SPSS version 10.0 (SPSS, Chicago IL, USA). Standard statistical methods were used to provide descriptive statistics. Logistic regression was used to determine the prognostic indicators of mortality in our patients. Due to the variable period of follow-up time after each patient’s first admission to the end of the observation study, Cox’s regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for factors that predicted readmission to the hospital during the study period. All analyses were based on the first admission to the hospital during the study period.</p>

<p>The main clinical manifestations in our patients were: hematologic (73.3%), renal (70.9%), malar rash (67.3%), photosensitivity (54.2%) and oral ulcer (41.8%). Other manifestations were arthritis (36.3), pleuritis (21.5%), pericarditis (18.3%), neurological (16.3%) and discoid lupus (6.8%). ANA were positive in 90.8% patients whereas dsDNA were positive in 50.2% patients. Only 6.4% of our patients had secondary antiphospholipid syndrome.</p>
<p>The most common comorbidity found in our lupus patients was hypertension (43.8%). Only eight patients had diabetes mellitus and six had dyslipidemia. Four patients had a history of stroke and two patients had ischemic heart disease.</p>
<p>Most of our patients were on prednisolone (86.9%) and hydroxychloroquine (85.7%). The common immunosuppressants used by our patients were: azathioprine (23.1%), cyclophosphamide (19.1%), mycophenolate mofetil (7.6%), cyclosporine A (3.6%) and methotrexate (0.8%). The mean cumulative prednisolone dose for the 12 weeks prior to admission in our patients was 553.66 ± 857.28 mg.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203312465780"><title>Hospitalizations pattern</title>
<p>There were a total of 465 hospitalizations during the study period. The main causes of hospitalizations were: flare of SLE (77.5%), infection (27.9%), renal biopsy (20.4%) and other (8.6%). In 22.1% of admissions, there was concurrent infection and active SLE. The total percentage is more than 100% as some patients had more than one reason for admission.</p>
<p>Active lupus nephritis accounted for 66.3% of clinical flares that required admission. Patients who were admitted with flare of SLE had a mean SLEDAI score of 14.2 ± 7.25 and SDI of 0.4 ± 1.03.</p>
<p>Infections occurred in 27.9% of all admissions. The majority of infections were pneumonia (49 episodes), septicemia (31) and cellulitis (31). The other infections were urinary tract infections (10), meningitis (two) and septic arthritis (one). Gram-negative organisms were the main isolates from our study population, accounting for 66.7% of positive cultures. Gram-positive organisms were isolated in eight admissions. There were seven episodes of herpes zoster infections and two episodes of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection. There was one episode of scabies, one episode of cryptococcal meningitis and one <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> infection.</p>
<p>The mean length of stay for our patients was 8.53 ± 8.39 days (range 1–59). The length of stay differed significantly for different causes of admission: flare of SLE (8.79 ± 8.16 days), infection (10.89 ± 0.93), renal biopsy (5.63 ± 0.52) and others (8.29 ± 0.47). Patients who were admitted for both infection and flare of SLE had a longer length of stay compared to other patients (13.30 ± 9.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Readmission occurred in 31.1% of our patients, with 23.9% being admitted three times or more during the study period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203312465780"><title>Causes of death</title>
<p>There were 26 deaths (10%) during our study period, including 22 females and four males as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312465780">Figure 1</xref>. Compared to the survivors, they had a significantly higher mean age of 36.08 ± 15.61 years and a longer mean disease duration of 52.73 ± 60.6 months (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00). They had a mean length of stay of 15.62 ± 13.31 days, which is significantly longer than those who survived (7.89 ± 6.62 days, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00). They had a significantly higher mean SDI of 1.88 ± 2.08 compared to the survivors’ mean SDI of 0.44 ± 0.91. The majority of them were admitted to the ICU (73.1%) and needed ventilation support (61.5%) and dialysis support (42.3%). In comparison, out of 225 patients who survived, only 44% were admitted to the ICU, 6.2% needed ventilation support and 3.6% needed dialysis support. In summary, the patients who died needed significantly more intensive medical supportive therapies compared to the survivors (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00).

</fig></p>
<p>Both infection and flare contributed to 13 deaths (50%) while five deaths each were due to infection alone and flare alone. The other three deaths were due to pulmonary embolism, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and multifocal infarct. There were no deaths due to malignancy.</p>
<p>Active lupus nephritis was present in 13 deaths while neuropsychiatric lupus was present in one death. The remaining four deaths had clinical flare hematologically. They had a median SLEDAI score of 15.5 ± 2.1. In respect to infections that were present among the deaths, the main culprits were gram-negative organisms; all 11 positive cultures were gram-negative organisms.</p>
<p>A significant proportion of patients (42.3%) died within one year of diagnosis. Only 34.6% patients died after five years of diagnosis. Both flare and infection contributed to more deaths within one year of diagnosis than those with disease of more than five years’ duration (81% vs 11%). The deaths due to pulmonary embolism and ischemic encephalopathy occurred in patients with disease duration of more than five years. The deaths with disease duration of more than five years had a mean SDI of 3.00 ± 2.26, which was the highest in our cohort. The patients who died had a mean cumulative prednisolone dose of 899.38 ± 1152.97 mg, which was significantly higher than the survivors’ cumulative prednisolone dose of 520.01 ± 818.93 mg (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.002). There was no difference in the treatment regimen involving methylprednisolone, hydroxychloroquine and immunosuppressants between the deaths and the survivors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0961203312465780"><title>Predictors of mortality</title>
<p>Univariate analysis showed that the presence of both infection and flare during admission (HR 9.33), high SDI at the time of admission (HR 0.50), length of stay (HR 0.92) and flare of SLE during admission (HR 0.40) were predictors of mortality in our patients. Age of onset, gender, nephritis, thrombocytopenia, SLEDAI score of more than 8, cumulative prednisolone dose and hydroxychloroquine usage were not predictive of mortality in our cohort. Multivariate analysis showed that the only predictors of mortality during admission were the presence of infection with flare of SLE (HR 17.01) and high SDI during admission (HR 0.42). Analysis using Cox regression showed that there were only two independent predictors of mortality, namely the presence of infection with flare of SLE (HR 5.56) and higher SDI (HR 1.91).</p>

<sec id="sec8-0961203312465780" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have described the causes and predictors of mortality in hospitalized Asian lupus patients in a tertiary-care center in Sarawak, Malaysia. The five-year survival rate in our cohort was 90%, consistent with worldwide studies that showed similar rate of survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312465780">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312465780">8</xref></sup> Our mortality rate of 10% is lower than the mortality rate of 20.2% reported by Yeap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203312465780">22</xref></sup> for Malaysian lupus patients from the period 1976–1990. The improvement in lupus survival is attributed to earlier diagnosis, more aggressive treatment, more judicious use of corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents, availability and advancement of renal replacement therapies and better management of associated complications like infection, hyperlipidemia and hypertension.</p>
<p>The pattern of mortality in our lupus patients mirrored the bimodal mortality pattern first described by Urowitz.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203312465780">23</xref></sup> Almost half of our deaths occurred within one year of disease onset. Both flare and infection contributed to more deaths within one year of diagnosis than those with disease of more than five years. Those with longer disease duration died later of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This finding also concurred with reports from developed countries that showed that atherosclerosis complications are emerging as the main cause of death in lupus patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312465780">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312465780">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203312465780">24</xref></sup> There was no mortality due to cancer in our cohort. This might be due to the short follow-up period, relatively young age and relatively fewer male patients in our current study.</p>
<p>The deaths in our cohort were older patients with longer disease duration, higher cumulative prednisolone doses and higher SDI. The majority of our deaths were treated in the ICU with ventilation and dialysis support, reflecting the complexities of seriously ill lupus patients. There was a significant group of deaths that occurred during the first year of diagnosis of SLE. Both active disease and flare of SLE contributed to deaths in this group of early deaths. This is consistent with findings from studies of other Asian countries that showed that infection and active SLE remain the main causes of mortality in the developing world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312465780">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312465780">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated age of onset, gender, ethnicity, disease activity, renal disease, central nervous system lupus, anemia and thrombocytopenia as predictors of mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312465780">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312465780">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312465780">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312465780">18</xref></sup> However, the above factors were not associated with mortality in our cohort. Recent studies have also shown the protective effects of hydroxychloroquine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203312465780">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203312465780">26</xref></sup> against mortality, but no effect was shown in our analysis. Univariate analysis in our study showed that the presence of both infection and flare during admission, high SDI, length of hospitalization and flare of SLE during admission were predictors of mortality in our patients. Multivariate analysis and Cox regression showed that the presence of infection with flare of SLE and high SDI during admission were predictors of mortality. Our current study concurred with other studies that showed that the concurrent presence of infection with flare and high damage indices are associated with poor outcome in SLE.</p>
<p>The concurrent presence of infection and flare of SLE was a predictor for poor outcome in our hospitalized lupus patients. This dangerous combination of infection with flare of SLE occurred in one fifth of our admissions and accounted for longer length of hospitalization. The presence of infection prolonged the mean length of stay by five days. This fatal combination also contributed to 50% of mortality within this study period. Timely vaccinations, reducing exposure to contagious contacts, screening for latent infections, minimizing exposure to corticosteroids, targeted prophylaxis for high-risk patients and anti-malarial therapy as standard of care have been advocated to reduce the incidence infections in patients with SLE.</p>
<p>Our deaths had a higher mean SDI compared to the survivors, and the late deaths had the highest mean SDI in our current study. This finding reflected the accumulation of damage as the disease duration increased. Several studies have shown that damage accrual occurred in a linear fashion over 10 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203312465780">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203312465780">28</xref></sup> Damage accrual is associated with a higher risk of mortality in patients with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203312465780">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961203312465780">30</xref></sup> In patients with longer disease duration, accrued damage supplants disease activity as the main contributor to mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312465780">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The average occurrence of five case fatalities per study year in our current study is much higher than one case fatality per study year in European countries. Nossent et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312465780">5</xref></sup> reported a low frequency of deaths within one year of disease onset in their SLE cohorts. Infections and cardiovascular events were the most frequent causes of death in both early and late fatalities with no gender differences for type of cause of death, disease activity, damage or comorbidity. In contrast, our current study showed that lupus patients in the developing world still have a higher fatality rate especially during the first year of disease onset.</p>
<p>Our current study has several limitations. Firstly, there was selection bias, as we included only SLE patients who were hospitalized and the data collected was limited to the duration of hospitalizations. Secondly, we did not evaluate the social economic status of patients, which is a known predictor of mortality. We are currently embarking on a further long-term follow-up of our patients.</p>
<p>Infection and flare were the main causes of death in hospitalized Asian patients with SLE. The presence of infection with flare and high damage indices at the time of admission were independent prognostic indicators of mortality.</p>
