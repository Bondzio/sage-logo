<body>
<p>The third edition of <italic>Learning in Adulthood</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam, Caffarella, &amp; Baumgartner, 2007</xref>) is indeed a “comprehensive” examination of the literature on adult learning. Although much of it is quite specific to those working in the adult learning field, it does offer interesting insights for music educators. It is a valuable resource for those looking to provide music teacher professional development to in-service teachers as well as to music education professionals working with undergraduate and graduate student learners. Music education researchers will also find the adult learning theories and discussion useful for planning and implementing research studies involving adult learners. Although reviews of the book have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1057083710397590">Dirkx, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1057083710397590">Millis, 2007</xref>), these previous reviews have not examined the text from a music education perspective. Thus, the goal in our review is to provide an overview of the text and make connections to the following areas of music education where applicable: (a) undergraduate music teacher education, (b) in-service education for music teachers, (c) graduate education, (d) adult beginners in instrumental music, and (e) adult learners in community music ensembles.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In the preface of the book, the authors state that they</p>
<p>have strived to put together a comprehensive overview and synthesis of what we know about adult learning: the context in which it takes place, who the participants are, what they learn and why, the nature of the learning process itself, new approaches to adult learning, the developmental theory in adult learning, and other issues relevant to understanding adult learning. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. x)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>All three authors are senior faculty in adult education and have spent their careers studying adult learners.</p>
<p>The book is divided into 4 parts and includes 16 chapters. Part 1 (“Adult Learning in Contemporary Society”) includes three chapters: “The Social Context of Adult Learning,” “Learning Environments and Learning Concepts,” and “Adult Learners: Who Participates and Why.” Especially relevant to music education, in Part 1, is the focus on changing demographics of the adult learner as well as a focus on issues related to informal learning. Part 2 (“Adult Learning Theories and Models”) consists of four chapters: “Knowles’s Andragogy, and Models of Adult Learning by McClusky, Illeris, and Jarvis,” “Self-Directed Learning,” “Transformational Learning,” and “Experience and Learning.” The concepts of self-directed learning in instrumental and vocal performance practicing, experience in music education as an apprentice model profession, and internal motivation as presented by Knowles, are especially relevant for music educators.</p>
<p>Part 3 (“Newer Approaches to Adult Learning”) includes “Embodied, Spiritual, and Narrative Learning,” “Learning and Knowing: Non-Western Perspectives,” and “Critical Theory, Postmodern, and Feminist Perspectives.” In an increasingly diverse and global community, there are many interpretations of what it means to learn. For music education, an understanding of these perspectives will help in educating the whole person, provide models of alternative cultural learning styles, and address issues of power and hegemony within traditional Western models of music education.</p>
<p>Part 4 (“Learning and Development”) includes five chapters: “Traditional Learning Theories,” “Adult Development,” “Cognitive Development in Adulthood,” “Intelligence and Aging,” and “Memory, Cognition, and the Brain.” This last section provides an overview of different learning theories and approaches to adult development. Drawing from the fields of neurobiology, educational and developmental psychology, and sociology, Part 4 is a rich resource for teachers of all subject matters.</p>
<p>The final chapter (“Reflection on Learning in Adulthood”) provides a summary and overview of the key concepts from the first 15 chapters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1057083710397590">Dirkx (2009)</xref> criticizes the books’ lack of connection to other fields:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The authors rely primarily on colleagues in adult education or human resource development as resources, thus paying less attention to higher education or other disciplines. For example, potential exciting linkages could be made with research in faculty development, teacher learning, or education for the professions. (p. 124)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We would agree that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al. (2007)</xref> do not make these connections but do not necessarily feel as if they could within the confines of a single volume. Thus, a primary goal in our review is to connect the work of this volume with music education and other relevant literature bases.</p>
<sec id="section1-1057083710397590">
<title>Part 1: Adult Learning in Contemporary Society</title>
<p>Chapters in Part 1 provide demographics of adult learners, including who they are, why they participate, and where they participate. The authors share that “For the first time in our society, adults outnumber youth, there are more older adults, the population is better educated than ever before and there is more cultural and ethnic diversity” (p. 7). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al. (2007)</xref> also share that</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>the oldest old, those over eighty-five-years old, are the fastest-growing segment of the older population . . . The number of adults over age eighty-five is expected to increase to about seven million in 2020 and to twenty million in 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1057083710397590">U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2004</xref>). (p. 8)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Music educators have recognized that with adults now outnumbering youth, the profession cannot afford to focus exclusively on “school music” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1057083710397590">Madsen, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1057083710397590">Yarbrough (2000)</xref> suggested,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Now that we have convincing research establishing that music is fundamental to the way we learn, the way we feel and the way we develop as human beings . . . We must expand the definition of music education, looking beyond schools for music learning, and affirm that everyone is a musician. (p. 205)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The recommendation that music education broaden beyond schools was not new in 2000. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1057083710397590">1992</xref>, within the MENC Publication <italic>The Music Educator and Community Music</italic>, Leonhard suggested,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>With the projected decrease in birthrate, the median age of our population promises to continue to increase. People will live longer and spend a growing number of years in retirement . . . the time has come to broaden the clientele for arts programs to include young adults, people of middle age, and senior citizens. (p. 32)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al. (2007)</xref> document in this first part of the book that the median age of the population has indeed continued to increase and that people are living longer. Recently, there has been attention to the senior adult population within the research on New Horizons Bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083710397590">Coffman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1057083710397590">Ernst, 2001</xref>). However, there are many additional questions to be asked about the adult learning of this population as well as the adult learning of those outside instrumental music and the learning of those adults in their “middle ages.”</p>
<p>The focus on globalization and technology in Part 1 of the book is interesting but somewhat outdated with regard to software and use of technology. One statistic in this section that does stand out is that “students twenty-five years of age and older now make up close to 50 percent of all college enrollments in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1057083710397590">Kasworm, Sandmann, &amp; Sissel, 2000</xref>)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 25). We are unaware of any studies that have examined this phenomenon in music education and suggest that this might be an area for future inquiry. If that statistic holds true for undergraduate music teacher education, then a large group of our preservice music educators are more “adult learners” than “upper adolescent learners,” and this should be of interest to those working in teacher education.</p>
<sec id="section2-1057083710397590">
<title>Learning Environments: Where Adults Participate</title>
<p>The most relevant concept for music education in this section is the focus on informal learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al. (2007)</xref> differentiate formal learning (in a degree or certificate program) from nonformal learning (organized learning opportunities outside the formal educational system). They share <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057083710397590">Coombs’s 1985</xref> definition of informal learning: “the spontaneous, unstructured learning that goes on daily in the home and neighborhood, behind the school and on the playing field, in the workplace, marketplace, library ad museum, and through the various mass media” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057083710397590">Coombs, 1985</xref>, p. 92, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 35).</p>
<p>Music teacher educators have historically written about the “informal learning” of preservice teachers, although they have not used that term. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1057083710397590">Robbins (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1057083710397590">Wing (1993)</xref> discussed informal learning in considering the power of the experiences that students have before they enter teacher education programs. Student “informal learning” has continued to be important in teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057083710397590">Conway, Smith, &amp; Hodgman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1057083710397590">Thompson, 2000</xref>). With regard to experienced teacher learners, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al. (2007)</xref> make an important reference to teacher professional development:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Workshop leaders putting on staff development programs in schools might learn as much as possible about the background and experience of the teachers in that school and what their knowledge base is with respect to the content of the workshop. There is nothing that turns teachers off more in these programs than being treated as if they know very little about the subject matter, especially if they have been dealing with it on a daily basis. (p. 28)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is a helpful suggestion for music teacher educators working in professional development.</p>
<p>The concept of informal learning for adults relates strongly to the music teacher professional development literature, which suggests “informal interactions” to be among the most beneficial professional development experiences for music teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083710397590">Bauer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057083710397590">Bauer, Forsythe, &amp; Kinney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057083710397590">Conway, 2007</xref>). Researchers who examine informal learning of preservice and in-service music teachers may benefit from consideration of the theories of informal learning as discussed in this book.</p>

<title>Part 2: Adult Learning Theory and Models</title>
<p>Part 2 of this book addresses foundational theories and models in adult education. Within each chapter, specific theories and their counterarguments are presented. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al. (2007)</xref> explain each theory in thorough detail and provide arguments for and against their validity. The concepts of andragogy as introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1057083710397590">Knowles (1970)</xref>, self-directed learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 105), and educational experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 159) are especially relevant to adult education in music and will be addressed in detail in this review.</p>
<sec id="section4-1057083710397590">
<title>Andragogy</title>
<p>Andragogy is the study of adult education and learning strategies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1057083710397590">Knowles (1970)</xref> developed a theory based on the following assumptions about adult learning: (a) as a person matures, her or his self-concept moves from dependent to self-directed; adults accumulate a “rich reservoir of experience”; (b) the readiness of an adult to learn depends on the developmental tasks of her social role; (c) adults focus more on immediacy of application than future application; and (d) internal motivation is strong, and adults need to see relevance to learn something (p. 84). There is debate about whether andragogy is even a theory at all, or more simply guidelines, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057083710397590">Brookfield (1986)</xref> suggests. Knowles has addressed this issue, asking that andragogy be thought of as “a model of assumptions about learning or a conceptual framework that serves as a basis for an emergent theory” (p. 87).</p>
<p>The relevance for music education is strong in these assumptions. The concepts of self-direction, experiences, immediate application, and motivation are often issues that arise. Preservice teachers, graduate students, and in-service music teachers frequently question the relevance of the material presented in college classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1057083710397590">Roulston, Legette, &amp; Womack, 2005</xref>). The information presented in this part of the book provides a framework for why learners might feel this way.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1057083710397590">
<title>Self-Directed Learning</title>
<p>Adult learners are more independent than youth. Therefore, it is important that learning environments reflect this. To be successful, adults need to formulate their own learning experiences with the teacher serving the role of coach, mentor, or guide. The responsibility of educators of adults “is to help learners, whether they are learning on their own or in formal learning programs, to be able to plan, carry out, and evaluate their own learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 107). Three processes of self-directed learning are outlined: linear, interactive, and instructional. Personal attributes of self-directed learners are then discussed.</p>
<p>For music education, self-direction, motivation, and self-regulation are essential for musicians and teachers of musicians alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1057083710397590">McPherson, 1999</xref>). Teaching techniques for independent learning is crucial for the learning process. This can include practice techniques for instrumentalists or vocalists, teaching strategies or rehearsal techniques that will need to be applied, or strategies for music classroom management. The increase in senior citizens participating in music, especially in the New Horizons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1057083710397590">Kruse, 2009</xref>) programs, especially depends on self-direction. Their life experiences and established expectations allow for them to accomplish a great deal outside the rehearsal environment. Practice techniques must be given so that these “beginners” can learn their instruments adequately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1057083710397590">
<title>Experience</title>
<p>Because of the life experience of the learners “the resource of highest value in adult education is the learner’s experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 161). Citations from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1057083710397590">Dewey (1938)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1057083710397590">Friere (1970)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1057083710397590">Kolb (1984)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1057083710397590">Usher, Bryant, and Johnston (1997)</xref> offer arguments as to how life experience influences learning. The role and purposes of educators are addressed on a continuum from “providing just-in-time assistance” to “problem posing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 170). Facilitator, mentor, and coach are presented as roles that acknowledge learner expertise. Concepts of reflective practice, situated cognition, cognitive apprenticeships, and anchored instruction are addressed as possible methods for gaining and using expertise.</p>
<p>Music education is largely an apprenticeship model profession; therefore, our personal experiences in education influence us in how we do our job, either positively or negatively. Just as teachers “teach how they were taught,” adult learners learn how they have learned their entire lives, and learn based on how they have engaged in teaching in other contexts. Acknowledging adult learners’ prior knowledge and experience is critical for instructors to facilitate learning of new concepts and to understand existing student biases.</p>

<title>Part 3: Newer Approaches to Adult Learning</title>
<sec id="section8-1057083710397590">
<title>Embodied, Spiritual, and Narrative Learning</title>
<p>In recent decades, adult learning theory has expanded its scope beyond traditional cognitive models to include embodied (somatic) and spiritual ways of learning. Emerging from critical theory, specifically feminism and multiculturalism, these other ways of knowing make up the tripartite of the mind, body, and spirit paradigm. The authors equate somatic or embodied learning to experiential learning, where the body is integral to the learning process. In music education, for example, one encounters this in conducting, the Dalcroze approach, and performance posture and technique. As such, seeing the body as a source of knowledge is known as somatic epistemology, a topic recently explored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1057083710397590">Shusterman (2008)</xref> and discussed among music educators and philosophers in the full issue of <italic>Action, Criticism and Theory</italic> (2010, Vol. 9, Issue 1).</p>
<p>Knowledge construction can also be associated with the spiritual dimension of human experience. The authors note that spirituality has become an increasingly important aspect of everyday life in our desire to seek meaning in our actions and interconnectedness of people and the world around us. The spiritual way of learning suggests thinking and acting creatively, using our imagination to establish emotional connections. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1057083710397590">Eisner (2002)</xref> states, “The arts are means of exploring our own interior landscapes” (p. 11).</p>
<p>The last section of this chapter discusses learning through personal narrative. People often view their lives as an unfolding story that is cultural, familial, individual, and organizational. Stories can be found in case studies, narrative inquiry, and other forms of qualitative research, emerging from postmodernist thought. The possibility of multiple interpretations of a given story provides insight into cultural differences and multiple truths. The important contributions of qualitative research in music education over the past few decades support this (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1057083710397590">Flinders &amp; Richardson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1057083710397590">McCarthy, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1057083710397590">
<title>Learning and Knowing: Non-Western Perspectives</title>
<p>When considering alternative perspectives on learning in adulthood, most of the theories presented in this book are rooted in Western epistemologies, which view the split between mind and body, privilege the individual learner over the group, and promote autonomy through independent thought and action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 222). Yet such an approach can be ethnocentric and oppressive without consideration of other forms of knowing. In our increasing global society, knowledge of other epistemologies and worldviews is essential to interacting with people from diverse cultures. This can be seen in music education through the implementation and exploration of a multicultural music curriculum.</p>
<p>In contrast to the traditional forms of teaching and learning in Western societies, which primarily promote the intellectual growth of the individual, many non-Western cultures focus on communal learning, promoting intellectual and spiritual growth. To illustrate this, the authors present descriptions of five different cultures: Confucianism, Hinduism, Maori, Islam, and African. All these cultures share a link with spirituality, community (interdependency), holistic, and informal approaches to the learning process. Emphasis is placed on the communal because “identity, self-concept, and self-esteem are developed and enhanced only in relation to others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 237). Whereas learning in Western societies is traditionally viewed as formal and within a school, learning in other cultures is viewed informally, day-to-day, and lifelong.</p>
<p>What can music educators gain from these non-Western perspectives on learning? First, these holistic, communal approaches lend support to our efforts to approach teaching and learning collaboratively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083710397590">Campbell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1057083710397590">Reimer, 2002</xref>). Additionally, in pluralistic societies, it is important to recognize different modes and styles of learning among our students and to adapt our pedagogy accordingly. Such understandings can only serve to broaden our own views regarding music education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1057083710397590">
<title>Critical Theory, Postmodern, and Feminist Perspectives</title>
<p>In Chapter 10, the authors explore critical theory, postmodern, and feminist perspectives. Recognizing that there are multiple interpretations and approaches to learning, these particular lenses help in raising critical questions about the assumptions we hold. In particular, they focus on race, class, gender, power and oppression, knowledge and truth, and how all these constructs intersect one another in society. While providing a brief discussion of each perspective and how it contributes to adult learning, they note the complexity of these discourses and their implementation in practice.</p>
<p>Critical theory is attributed in large part to the work of Habermas, and seeks to identify systems of power and oppression in order to emancipate and empower those in the margin. Postmodernism is a construct that accounts for multiple viewpoints, cultural pluralism, and the recognition that there is no single truth. Because of its open nature, postmodernism enables us to explore the aesthetic, spiritual, affective, and experiential forms of self beyond the purely rational. Feminism challenges patriarchy in society and feminist pedagogy explores “how knowledge is constructed, the development of voice, the authority of the teacher and students, and dealing with differences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 264).</p>
<p>These critical perspectives provide adult learners and educators additional theoretical lenses through which they interpret the world around them and empower those in the margin. The authors write, “Institutions of learning and the classroom itself reproduce the power structures found in society at large” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 263). Analyzing music education in North America from this perspective, the dominance of Euro-American music in schools can be seen as superior to other styles of music, relegating “the other” to the margin. Yet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083710397590">Bowman (2007)</xref> cautions, we need to view music “as actions and events that are always and intimately and constitutively connected to the lives and identities of people. Our musical exclusions, then, are always also exclusions of people” (p. 118). So what assumptions are made in designing a music curriculum and do we seek to maintain certain power structures (the status quo) with our actions? Who or what are we excluding? These are the questions critical theory, postmodernism, and feminist pedagogy can raise.</p>

<title>Part 4: Learning and Development</title>
<p>The beginning of Part 4 expands beyond the adult demographic to discuss traditional learning theories, primarily child-centered, within the approaches of behaviorism, humanism, cognitivism, social cognitive learning theory, and constructivism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al. (2007)</xref> use these learning theories to help draw connections to learning and development in the adult population. Similarly, music education has used learning theories that stem from behavioral and cognitive psychology “to describe, explain, and possibly predict musical behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1057083710397590">Taetle &amp; Cutietta, 2002</xref>, p. 279).</p>
<p>In Chapter 12, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al. (2007)</xref> consider characteristics of adult development that may be connected with learning. These attributes are organized and presented in four approaches: biological, psychological, sociocultural, and integrative models. Music educators who work with adult learners, especially senior adults, will benefit from a familiarization with these developmental changes.</p>
<p>Biological development refers to physical and biological changes during life, such as the deterioration in vision, hearing, or reaction time. Directors of adult music ensembles may need to adjust room lighting, rehearsal space and podium setup, print size of music, or the clarity and succinctness of their directions to accommodate physical changes. On working with adult instrumentalists, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1057083710397590">Rohwer (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1057083710397590">2009</xref>) also indicates that attention to adult learners’ personal supplies, such as chair pads, hearing aids, and glasses may need to be addressed. In addition to providing a learning space that is conducive to all learners, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al. (2007)</xref> point out that educators should be sensitive to psychological implications that can result from biological changes: “Most older adults who could benefit from hearing aids do not use them because they do not feel the need, do not want to be associated with a device that makes them ‘look old,’ or simply cannot afford them” (p. 303). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1057083710397590">Rohwer (2008</xref>) echoes this sentiment in an article on senior musicians and health: “If presented in an appropriate way, perhaps the delicate balance can be maintained between health and musical integrity, thereby allowing the senior adult musicians to have their music and health too” (p. 58).</p>
<p>“Most of the work in adult development has been driven by the psychological tradition and focuses on the individual’s <italic>internal</italic> process of development” (Merriam et al., p. 305). Merriam et al. portray several psychological development models, such as Erikson’s psychosocial development (p. 306) and Levinson’s age-graded model (p. 307), before discussing sociocultural factors that contribute to adult development. Elements such as age, race, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation affect how adults are recognized by and, in turn, respond to society. There are multiple roles that adults fulfill as they age: student, teacher, manager, novice, expert, professional, retired, parent, grandparent, spouse, and more. Based on his research of adult musicians within the New Horizons Band, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1057083710397590">Kruse (2009)</xref> agrees with Merriam et al. that music educators can better help and encourage their adult students when cognizant of their roles and educational goals.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 focuses on cognitive development, beginning with an overview of Jean Piaget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 326) and then discussing linear and categorical models of adult cognitive development. Models discussed include those conceptualized by William Perry, Marcia Baxter Magolda, and Robert Kegan, among others. The chapter concludes with an informative section on wisdom that many teachers of fine arts subjects may find of interest. “In incorporating the concept of wisdom in our thinking about cognitive development, mature adult cognition is more than just abstract logic, complex reasoning, and dialectical thinking; it also encompasses the ability to think, feel, and act ‘wisely’ in life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 357).</p>
<p>There has been an increase of research on the effects of music on adults’ emotional and cognitive abilities (Bugos, Perlstein, McCrae, Brophy, &amp; Bedenbaugh, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083710397590">Coffman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1057083710397590">Schellenberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1057083710397590">Schellenberg &amp; Moreno, 2010</xref>). Chapter 14, Intelligence and Aging, addresses the common assumption that intelligence declines with age. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al. (2007)</xref> encourage educators to consider how intelligence is defined and assessed. They also suggest the need to contemplate how childhood intelligence labels can later affect adult learners. The chapter surveys both traditional and alternative models of intelligence including those developed by Howard Gardner, Robert Sternberg, and Daniel Goleman.</p>
<p>The final chapter of Part 4, “Memory, Cognition, and the Brain,” addresses the common fear of memory loss for aging individuals, especially when “memory functions are often equated with learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>, p. 392). Merriam et al. focus on the many facets of memory including working, sensory, and long-term memory, explicit and implicit memory, as well as acquisition, retention, and retrieval of memory. Music performance often relies on memorizing musical passages as well as quickly recalling previously learned material such as fingering patterns. The authors give insightful suggestions for fostering memory capacity and skills that lend themselves easily to educators working with adult musicians in a variety of contexts. Such circumstances could include working with senior musicians in a community ensemble, adults beginning to play an instrument, or working with practicing teachers during in-service training. Music therapy, which is often prescribed for adults dealing with aspects of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1057083710397590">Raglio et al., 2008</xref>), could also benefit from the said suggestions.</p>
<p>Chapter 15 concludes with a brief section on new directions and discoveries within the study of cognitive neuroscience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083710397590">Meriam et al. (2007)</xref> advise that adult educators should not use the new, limited knowledge of brain function to inform them of adult learning tendencies “until the theoretical and empirical knowledge from the cognitive neurosciences on the brain have moved out of the laboratory and into the context of everyday life” (p. 418).</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>In criticizing much of the early work in teacher education pedagogy for not being focused on theory and being too focused on “best practice research,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1057083710397590">Grossman and Schoenfeld (2005)</xref> suggest,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The approach [early work in teacher educator pedagogy] was grounded not in a well-defined theory of teacher of adult learning, but rather in a kind of gritty empiricism, building on what seemed to work and discarding what did not . . .</p>
<p>In addition to better tools, we need better theory, which is itself a different kind of tool. Such a theory would go beyond the particulars of a specific pedagogical approach to help us understand more broadly the relationship between the pedagogies of professional education and features of professional practice. (p. 450)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p><italic>Learning in Adulthood: A Comprehensive Guide</italic> (3rd ed.) is a useful source for music education researchers and practitioners who are looking to push the research community beyond the “gritty empiricism” as mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1057083710397590">Grossman and Schoenfeld (2005)</xref> above in their study of adult learning within music teaching and learning. Music education researchers who study (or teach) undergraduate preservice teacher development, teacher career cycle, in-service teacher professional development, as well as those studying adult beginner musicians and community music may be able to use the theories presented in this book to frame and interpret their studies.</p>
