<body>
<p>It is my pleasure to discuss the article entitled “Clinical Trial Outcomes of High- and Extra High–Profile Implants.” To begin, I must disclose that I personally know several of the authors of the article, and my comments are directed at the scientific validity of this study; I hope my constructive criticism is taken at face value. I must also say that I was surprised to see this article accepted for publication, because I believe the study design does not provide meaningful data to support the conclusions.</p>
<p>In the article, the authors base their conclusions on 2 separate Premarket Approval (PMA) studies; however, these studies were not initially designed to assess the performance of high-profile implants compared with low- to moderate-profile devices. In fact, the PMA studies cited in the article were broad-based studies designed to examine safety and efficacy in groups of implants. Due to their size and broad objectives, the studies generated data that can help to answer general questions such as: Are these implants effective? Are they safe? How many reoperations or revisions were there? Unfortunately, the authors have attempted to use the data to answer a much more specific question that was not directly investigated in the source studies: What is the risk of adverse events with high- and extra high–profile breast implants compared with low- to moderate-profile breast implants? This is the fatal flaw. While data mining is always possible, it is important to understand that “over-mining”—although easy to perform with the right resources—results in scientifically invalid data.</p>
<p>Several statements in the article deserve a focused discussion, and each is discussed in turn below.</p>
<p>The authors state, “Personal and anecdotal experiences of plastic surgeons . . . have suggested that high- and extra high–profile breast implants may be associated with higher risks of adverse events (AE) such as chest wall deformity, breast ptosis, tissue thinning, parenchymal atrophy, capsular contracture (CC), malposition, or need for secondary surgery. <italic>Despite these suggestions, patients generally tolerate high-profile implants without issue</italic>” (emphasis added).</p>
<p>It would be helpful for the authors to clarify the basis for this statement. It seems odd to say that patients generally tolerate high-profile implants without issue. In fact, I disagree with that statement and also with the concept. The patient shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13484147">Figure 1</xref> is a perfect example. What should I have told her when she came to me 2 years after a subpectoral high-profile breast augmentation with uncorrectable problems? Patients want to know what went wrong. Telling her she is “generally OK” would not be acceptable to her or me. This is real life plastic surgery, and the decision that surgeons and patients make preoperatively result in lifetime consequences for patients.</p>

<p>A 30-year-old woman is shown (A) preoperatively and (B) 2 years after undergoing breast augmentation with a high-profile device placed subpectorally. The postoperative photograph shows evidence of rippling and implant-tissue mismatch. The primary surgeon believed a 400-cc volume was indicated, yet would never have been able to place a lower profile implant, as the width would have been too large. A high-profile implant was selected because it was close to the breast width, yet the volume is much too large based on tissue planning principles, so the effect of thinning and stretching overtime was inevitable.</p>

</fig>
<p>The patient’s postoperative condition may not be completely due to a high-profile device alone, but our current knowledge would point to a clear violation of tissue-based planning, because this is obviously a breast tissue–implant mismatch (which is clearly evident by the preoperative photograph).</p>
<p>It is true that some of my own patients have received high-profile implants and have achieved an acceptable long-term result; however, there have been problems as well. At the 2003 Breast Surgery and Body Contouring Symposium in Santa Fe, New Mexico, I presented a series of patients who received high-profile saline devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13484147">1</xref></sup> In this unpublished series, I found that patients with narrow breast base width (&lt;11 cm) and a more lax skin envelope (skin stretch &gt;3) had a higher incidence of soft-tissue stretch.</p>
<p>Next, the authors state, “<italic>However, the data presented in our report—adjusted for multiple variables, stratified by preoperative breast measurement, and driven by biodimensional planning and soft-tissue quality assessment—suggest that use of high- or extra high–profile implants is not associated with a greater risk of CC or secondary procedures</italic>.”</p>
<p>I was confused with this statement. Which variables were adjusted? What preoperative measurement was stratified? The Core gel and 410 studies did not collect any meaningful measurement for tissue-based planning. The only breast measurement that was noted in the Methods section was a “breast mound measurement”; this measurement has no role in implant selection.</p>
<p>The authors also state that the data are “<italic>driven by biodimensional planning and soft-tissue quality assessment</italic>.”</p>
<p>Where in either study cohort was this performed? In short, these planning assessments were not performed or recorded in the original studies. Again, the core flaw is that there are no tissue-based planning measurements collected with the original data. To properly answer the question of whether high-profile implants carry a higher or lower risk of AE than their low- to moderate-profile counterparts, the methodology would have needed to include an assessment or characterization of preoperative breast tissue to ensure that only patients with similar breasts were included in each group. This was not a component of the existing methodology, nor was it even mentioned as important. I believe this is a flaw that is beyond repair or revision, rendering the article scientifically invalid.</p>
<p>The authors also state, “<italic>In general, we recommend that surgeons stay within the biodimensional limits of the patient, considering factors such as patient size, skin elasticity, and breast tissue quality when selecting breast implants</italic>.”</p>
<p>It is curious that the authors recommend this, yet none of those parameters was included in the study. If “biodimensional planning” or more correctly termed “tissue-based planning” was used, the selection of a high-profile implant would have been a rare or nonexistent occurrence for a primary breast augmentation. Despite publishing/presenting extensively on tissue-based planning around the world for the past 10 years, I have rarely seen a breast that, when tissue-based planning principles were considered, warranted a high-profile implant selection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13484147">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13484147"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13484147"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13484147"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13484147"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13484147"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X13484147"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13484147">9</xref></sup> In fact, if a surgeon selects the implant on the basis of breast base width, a high-profile implant is too large (generally 400-600 cc). If the surgeon selects the device based on volume, a high-profile implant is too narrow. High-profile implants were, in fact, never intended for primary breast augmentation for these exact reasons. These implants are much more logically designed/utilized for breast reconstruction. Breasts augmented with high-profile devices tend to produce a supra-areolar convexity and a relatively empty upper pole above this, due to the narrow base diameter of the typical high-profile implant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13484147">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1090820X13484147-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Despite existing literature to the contrary and the flaws in their own data, the authors conclude, “<italic>Use of high- or extra high–profile implants is not associated with a greater risk of CC</italic>.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the variables that we know without any doubt that primarily affect the incidence of capsular contracture, including but not limited to concentration of Betadine, specific types and combinations/concentrations of antibiotic solutions, technique for pocket dissection, were never recorded. It is impossible to draw any conclusion regarding capsular contracture in a comparative study without these data points.</p>
<p>The authors cited a mean implant volume of 300 to 400 cc. The high-profile implants I have seen for revision in my practice are usually significantly larger and usually require correction of malposition, soft-tissue stretch, rippling, and associated soft-tissue coverage issues. What is important to clarify is that the absolute volume has some importance, but matching the implant to the tissues is even more critical. For many patients and surgeons, high-profile implants are an “end to the means” of desire for a larger implant. In the 17th century, Blaise Pascal taught us the principles of pressure (pressure = force/area), and there is no dispute that, based on those concepts, a high-profile implant will impart more pressure to the breast tissue. Studies have cited detrimental effects imparted from high-profile implants that have created this pressure issue, including parenchymal atrophy, skin stretch, and chest wall concavity. These effects, coupled with an oversized volume, increase the likelihood for postoperative sequelae. The notion that most high-profile implants are not oversized in terms of volume has not been my personal clinical experience. In fairness, high-profile implants are not the only implant type that can cause these issues; in fact, even with a properly sized and selected implant, small amounts of tissue atrophy and chest wall scalloping can occur. However, Pascal taught us that these effects are more destructive and severe with an oversized high- or extra high–profile implant. This concept is no different than the known principles of tissue expansion, where all tissues are progressively thin.</p>
<p>I believe that the “fatal flaws” in this article make it of little scientific value to the reader. The article includes authors who are employees of a breast implant manufacturer that has heavily marketed its high-profile implants. Publishing an article that supports the marketing campaign of a manufacturer and is also authored by employees of that company is, in my opinion, unacceptable. I have tried to be objective and examine the issue from different perspectives, but I come to the same conclusion every time: the article would be more impartial and therefore more valuable if it were authored by the surgeons alone, without the employees. The surgeon authors have disclosed an advisory relationship with the same company; however, this is not uncommon. At the end of the day, a relationship with a company should not discourage a surgeon from participating or authoring a study, as long as the relationship is disclosed and the information is valid and unbiased.</p>
<p>In summary, readers should be wary of large studies such as this one that mine data to answer specific questions that were not part of the original study design. My comments are an objective criticism of this article and do not detract from valuable relationship I have with several of the authors.</p>
<p>What is the fate of high-profile implants? I believe their primary application remains in breast reconstruction, and as surgeons continue to adopt proven tissue-based planning principles and select implants that “fit” the breast, high-profile implants will be placed only for primary augmentation in patients who have not been well educated or who choose to accept the inherent trade-offs of an implant– soft tissue mismatch.</p>
