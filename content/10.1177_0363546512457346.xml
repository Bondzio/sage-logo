<abstract>
<p>Treatment outcome researchers in orthopaedics frequently report only tests of statistical significance between group means to evaluate the effectiveness of a given intervention. Although important in establishing that mean differences are not caused by chance, these methods do not reflect the extent to which an intervention produces improvements that are meaningful and represent a return to health. This is an issue that is often of great interest to patients and clinicians. Other methods use a percentage change in an outcome measure (eg, 25% reduction in pain score) to classify treatment responders but often do not indicate whether the treatment restored a patient to normal. Researchers have developed several indices that provide a metric for statistically defining the amount of change that patients consider to be important. In this article, we focus on the concept of “clinical significance” and the different methods that have been developed to define clinically significant change using statistics. We then present a hybrid method that can classify whether a patient has returned to normal function. We apply this method to real patient data to illustrate its use with different outcome instruments commonly used in orthopaedic sports medicine. We advocate that the addition of these methods to reports from clinical outcome studies can deepen our understanding of the impact of interventions on patients’ lives.</p>

<body>
<p>Clinical outcome research is designed to test whether an intervention produces improvements in the condition of patients. Most typically, improvement is evaluated by comparing the average amount of change observed in a group of patients who received the intervention with the average change observed in patients who received no intervention or an alternative treatment. Statistical tests can indicate whether any observed improvement in the intervention group compared with a control group is likely to be a true difference as opposed to the result of chance. Such statistical comparisons do not, however, indicate whether the change was meaningful or important as opposed to a trivial difference. This concept, often referred to as “clinical significance,” is perhaps of greatest interest to the practicing clinicians and their patients who want to know the likelihood that a given treatment will actually make them feel better or even return them to full health. The lack of information about the practical impact of interventions on patients’ lives may be one reason that many well-designed outcome studies have had relatively little effect on clinical practice. There is therefore a need to enhance how we report the results from outcome studies so that they are more relevant, compelling, and interesting.</p>
<p>In this article, we briefly review ways in which clinical significance has been conceptualized and some of the more widely used methods that have been developed to operationalize or quantify clinically significant change. We then describe one such method that represents a hybrid approach that may be a useful tool for presenting and interpreting the results of clinical outcome studies. We also use real patient data to illustrate the application of this method with different outcome instruments commonly used in orthopaedic sports medicine. This approach is not intended to replace other methods of evaluating treatment outcome but can be used as a complementary or supplemental outcome metric.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363546512457346">
<title>The Concept of Clinical Significance</title>
<p>The traditional view of clinical significance pertains to change that is (1) noticeable and (2) important in the eyes of either the patient or the physician. The first quality, noticeable change, addresses the issue of the magnitude of the change. In particular, clinically significant change must be large enough that it can be detected reliably by some assessment instrument. For the purposes of this article, we will focus on patient-reported outcome instruments. In this context, clinically significant change must be large enough to be perceived by the patient, and the measurement instrument must be sensitive enough to detect this change. This is often referred to as the minimally detectable change (MDC) and has been operationalized in a number of different ways.</p>
<p>One way that MDC has been operationalized has been to use the “effect size,” which for clinical outcome studies is often calculated as the difference between group means on a measure divided by the standard deviation (SD) of the sample. For example, in a recently published study comparing the outcomes for second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (Hyalograft C, Fidia Advanced Biopolymers, Abano Terme, Italy) with microfracture,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512457346">14</xref></sup> the means at final follow-up on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form were 91.0 and 79.0, respectively, with a pooled SD of 12.8. The effect size for Hyalograft C compared with microfracture is then (91 − 79)/12.8 or .94, which indicates that the score of the average patient in the Hyalograft C group was almost one SD higher than the average person in the microfracture group and hence exceeded 83% of the microfracture group. The effect size provides a standardized index of the magnitude of change and can be used to compare change between studies that used different instruments. The interpretation of effect sizes, however, is somewhat arbitrary and dependent on the condition and treatment under consideration. By convention, an effect size of .2 is considered “small,” .5 is a “medium” effect, and .8 and above is considered to be a “large” effect. The developer of this method of calculating effect size has described a medium effect as that “large enough to be visible to the naked eye,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512457346">4</xref></sup> thus being an effect size of .5 (ie, a change of one half the SD from the sample mean at baseline would correspond to an MDC). As an example, a 10-point reduction on a visual analog scale of pain with an SD of 20 would be considered the MDC on that scale. A systematic review of studies of health-related quality of life instruments found the vast majority reported minimal differences of close to one half an SD for a wide variety of instruments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512457346">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another common method for determining MDC is the use of the standard error of measurement (SEM), which incorporates the reliability of the instrument used. A way of thinking about SEM is to consider that the score for a patient on an instrument is the sum of that person’s theoretical “true score” (eg, exactly how much pain has been experienced in the past week) and the “error” or factors that negatively affect the precision with which an instrument measures the true score (ie, “noise”). For an entire sample, how much patients’ observed scores differ from each other is then the sum of how much their scores truly differ and how much error was involved. The SEM is an estimate of how repeated observed scores of a person on the same instrument tend to be distributed around his or her “true” score. Instruments with high reliabilities have lower SEMs or smaller “bands of error” around the true score for a person. For the purposes of the present discussion, many researchers emphasize that the observed change in a patient’s score after an intervention must exceed this band of error around observed scores at baseline and at follow-up. In other words, the difference between the scores must be greater than one SEM to be considered actual change and not attributable to measurement error.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546512457346">i</xref></sup></p>
<p>These methods do not, of course, address the second criterion of clinically significant change, which is whether the experienced improvement is important according to some standard. Indices of the magnitude of change, such as effect size, have been used to define important change. For example, a “large” effect size is often considered to be a clinically meaningful change. The correspondence between effect sizes and what most would consider to be important change from a clinical standpoint, however, can be problematic when the control group does not change (eg, when the condition is very stable and not likely to improve naturally) and variability within treatment groups is low. Consequently, methods to quantify minimally important change (MIC) or minimal clinically important difference (MCID) have also been developed. These approaches attempt to statically operationalize how much change on a measure constitutes change that is both noticeable and meaningful to the patient. These methods are also useful in interpreting the clinical effect of an intervention by permitting the reporting of the percentage of patients who returned to health or became well after receiving treatment.</p>
<p>The MIC for a particular outcome instrument is commonly determined statistically using an “anchor” or some “external criterion, which is used to operationalize a relevant or important change.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512457346">5</xref></sup> This anchor is thus considered the gold standard of how much change the patient experienced and is usually assessed by one 7-point scale of perceived change or “patient global impression of change.” The researcher selects the point along the global scale that he or she considers to be MIC (eg, “somewhat better”). Patients are then classified as whether they experienced clinically important change based on if they reported the threshold level of change on this item. The MCID cutoff points for a patient-reported outcome instrument can be determined by evaluating all the possible scores on the instrument for how well they predict whether the patient reported the threshold level of improvement on the patient global impression of change item. Sensitivity (ie, the percentage of patients who were correctly classified by the score on the outcome instrument as improved, or “true positives”) and specificity (ie, the percentage of patients who were correctly classified by the score as not improved, or “true negatives”) are calculated at different cutoff values, and MIC is set to where the sum of the percentages of false positives and false negatives is minimal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512457346">5</xref></sup> A limitation of this type of anchor-based approach to determining MCID is that it does not indicate whether the change exceeds the measurement error of the instrument. In addition, the point along the anchor selected to determine “important” change is somewhat arbitrary and not based on statistical analysis. For example, one could argue that “somewhat better” does not necessarily represent meaningful and important improvement in a patient’s condition.</p>
<p>Other investigators have defined clinically important change as the percentage of improvement on an outcome measure score from baseline to follow-up. For example, the National Institutes of Health–funded Glucosamine/chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT) defined a positive response to treatment as a 20% reduction in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scale from baseline to 24-week follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512457346">3</xref></sup> Because the absolute magnitude of change could be relatively small, and hence trivial, for patients who have lower baseline scores (eg, a 20% reduction of pain for patients with baseline scores of 20 points would be a reduction of only 4 points), other systems have combined percentage change with absolute change on outcome instruments. The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) and the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) proposed a set of criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512457346">19</xref></sup> for classifying patients as treatment “responders” that requires a 50% or greater improvement in pain or function and an absolute change of 20 or more points on a 0-to-100 scale.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363546512457346">ii</xref></sup></p>
<p>So far, the methods presented that quantify detectable or important change are based on the difference in patients’ scores on an outcome instrument before intervention with their scores after intervention. A different approach to quantifying clinically significant change has been to define a state that represents health or normal functioning. This is sometimes referred to as a patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) in the clinical outcome literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512457346">21</xref></sup> A patient who attains this state is considered to have experienced clinically significant change independent of the magnitude of change experienced. Patients who experience MCID do not necessarily achieve an acceptable symptom state. For example, a patient whose pain score on a 100-point visual analog scale moves from 100 at baseline to 50 at follow-up would be classified by most methods as having achieved minimal clinically important change. However, this patient continues to report a fair amount of pain and likely would not consider himself or herself “well” or recovered. For specific outcome instruments, the PASS can be defined as the score beyond which most patients would consider themselves to be well. As with methods to quantify minimal clinically important change, this score is often determined by using a single anchor item (eg, “Taking into account all the activities you have during your daily life, your level of pain, and also your functional impairment, do you consider that your current state is satisfactory?”).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512457346">21</xref></sup> The PASS cut point is then usually established either by the score on the outcome measure representing the 75th percentile for patients who report themselves well on the anchoring item or by determining a score that best balances sensitivity and specificity as described earlier. A limitation of the PASS method as commonly employed is that one item is used as the gold standard for wellness. Single-item measures for multifaceted subjective constructs such as health or wellness are considered by many researchers to be quite vulnerable to unacceptably low reliability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512457346">15</xref></sup> Moreover, this method generally does not evaluate whether a patient’s change score exceeds the measurement error of the instrument.</p>
<p>Hybrid approaches to quantifying clinically significant change that incorporate both the construct of a return to health and the requirement to exceed a minimum amount of change have been developed by several researchers. A recent study evaluated several methods for defining clinically important change and concluded that such hybrid approaches are the most “clinically sensible with strong diagnostic accuracy.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512457346">2</xref></sup> The remainder of this article will be devoted to describing one hybrid method that we hope can be useful in presenting and interpreting the results from clinical outcome studies in orthopaedic sports medicine. We will use data from real outcome studies to illustrate some applications of this method.</p>

<title>The Jacobson Method</title>
<p>Over 25 years ago, the field of clinical psychology began to re-evaluate the manner in which the results of clinical trials were reported. Rather than only presenting the statistical significance of their findings, Neil Jacobson, a noted marital therapy researcher, advocated the use of a method that quantified the clinical significance of change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512457346">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512457346">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512457346">13</xref></sup> This approach began with the premise that clinically significant change should represent a return to normal functioning, which was defined as a patient’s outcome measure score after treatment being more likely to fall within the range of healthy individuals rather than that of impaired patients. In addition, the method includes a criterion that clinically significant change should be of a large enough magnitude that the postintervention score reflects real change rather than a chance fluctuation, that is, that the change exceeds the margin of measurement error. At the time of the development of this method, behavioral couples therapy (BCT) had consistently been shown to produce statistically significant improvement in marital satisfaction compared with control conditions. Jacobson’s approach, however, revealed that half of couples who received BCT had marital satisfaction scores still within the maritally distressed range at the end of treatment, despite statistically significant improvement compared with a control group,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512457346">9</xref></sup> and that a third of couples who were considered recovered had relapsed at a 2-year follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512457346">12</xref></sup> These findings were eye opening to researchers and led to the development of treatments that could result in better recovery rates and maintenance of treatment effects over time. The effect of this approach to clinical significance has been profound such that one of the leading journals that publishes results from psychotherapy clinical trials (<italic>Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology</italic>) now requires that “when reporting the results of interventions, authors should include indicators of clinically significant change” and specifically mentions the Jacobson method as an example. The use of this method for determining clinically significant change in orthopaedic sports medicine clinical trials might contribute to a greater understanding of treatment outcomes and possibly spur improvements in current interventions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512457346">
<title>Application of the Jacobson Method</title>
<p>Although this article is intended to give a fairly nonmathematical description of methods to quantify clinically significant change, the following section provides more detail about how to use the Jacobson method. SPSS syntax files (Chicago, Illinois), which are available from the first author, will perform the required calculations for several commonly used instruments in sports medicine including the IKDC, the WOMAC, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Outcome Measure.</p>
<sec id="section4-0363546512457346">
<title>Calculation of the Healthy Population Cut Point</title>
<p>As noted above, the Jacobson method defines clinically significant change as the extent to which an intervention moves a patient away from the range of the dysfunctional population or within the range of the healthy population. Consequently, the researcher must first establish a value on an outcome measure that represents a score that is more likely to fall within the distribution of scores for a healthy population than it is to fall within a distribution of scores of a dysfunctional population, assuming normal distributions. Jacobson described 3 methods for doing this that can be used depending on the data the researcher has available regarding a healthy population’s scores on a specific outcome instrument and the degree of overlap between the distribution of scores for a healthy population and the patient population.</p>
<list id="list1-0363546512457346" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>If normative data for the outcome measure used in the study are not available, then clinically significant change for a patient would be having a score within the dysfunctional population distribution before treatment (within ±2 SDs of the mean) and having a postintervention score greater than 2 SDs away from the patient population mean. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512457346">Figure 1</xref> for a dysfunctional population with a mean of 40 and an SD of 10. A posttreatment score in the shaded area would fulfill this criterion. If possible, it is recommended to aggregate data from several samples of the target population to standardize the dysfunctional norms. It should be noted that for conditions that are associated with extremely severe disabilities or symptoms, this method may not indicate a return to normal functioning.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If normative data are available and the distributions of the healthy and dysfunctional populations do not overlap, the preferred criterion for clinically significant change is moving to a score within the healthy population distribution (within 2 SDs of the healthy mean) after treatment (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512457346">Figure 2</xref> by the shaded region of the functional distribution). However, when the dysfunctional group is extremely dysfunctional, this criterion may be too stringent to reflect clinically significant change.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If normative data are available and the distributions overlap, criterion 2 could be too low a bar to cross. Therefore, the score value that represents a point where the area under the dysfunctional population distribution at the high end equals the area under the healthy population at the low end must be determined. This is the value in which a score is equally likely to belong in either group. Because distributions can have different shapes (eg, different SDs), this score is often not just half the distance between the 2 population means. To find this cut point (<italic>c</italic> in the equations below), each sample’s score must be converted to units of SDs (<italic>z</italic> scores), and the cut point value is the same distance from the dysfunctional mean as it is to the healthy mean in units of SDs. The area under the distributions is the same for the same <italic>z</italic> values regardless of the shape (assuming normal distributions).</p>

<title>Reliable Change Index</title>
<p>Jacobson also proposed the use of a reliable change index (RCI) to determine whether the magnitude of change for an individual patient is statistically reliable. The RCI indicates “whether change reflects more than the fluctuations of an imprecise measuring instrument.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512457346">13</xref></sup> It is calculated for each subject by dividing the change in scores on the outcome measure by the standard error of difference score or the following:</p>

<p>If the RCI is greater than or equal to 1.96, which represents the upper boundary for the 95% confidence interval, then the change is considered to be reliable and likely reflects actual change.</p>
<p>To summarize, the Jacobson method has 2 criteria for quantifying clinically significant change: (1) a patient’s score after treatment must fall within the range for healthy individuals (or well outside the range for the patient population), and (2) the change must be large enough that it is statistically reliable. If both criteria are met, the patient is considered “recovered.” If a patient’s RCI is greater than 1.96 but his or her final score does not fall within the healthy range, the patient is considered “improved.” Patients with RCIs less than 1.96 and greater than −1.96 are “unchanged,” while those with RCIs less than −1.96 can be considered “deteriorated.” To simplify patient classification, some researchers may wish to just classify patients as responders or nonresponders, although the full classification system can often reveal interesting details about the effects of intervention. The next section will use real patient data to illustrate the application of the Jacobson method in orthopaedic sports medicine clinical outcome research.</p>

<p>So this patient has both a postintervention score above the cut point of 68.4 and an RCI ≥1.96 and would therefore be classified as “recovered.”</p>
<p>For the entire sample, the Jacobson method classified 27% of patients as recovered, 9% as improved but not recovered, 58% as unchanged, and 6% as deteriorated based on their KOOS pain scale scores. By comparison, the Clinical Responder Criteria developed by the Osteoarthritis Research Society (OMERACT-OARSI Responder Index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512457346">19</xref></sup>), a composite index that requires responders to achieve high levels of absolute and percentage changes on a pain scale or lower levels of improvement on pain, function, and/or global assessment, classified 40% of patients as responders and 60% as nonresponders. There was good agreement between the classification systems (96% of those classified as “recovered” were classified as “responders”), although for this sample, the recovered status was more stringent than the responder index, as 18% of responders were classified as improved but not recovered and 27% were classified as unchanged by the Jacobson method.</p>
<p>The Jacobson classification method also allows for an exploration of the “shape of change” for groups based on their recovery status. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512457346">Figure 5</xref> it can be seen that all groups showed at least some pain reduction at the 2-week follow-up, whereas only those classified as responders at 6 months continued to report improvement over time. The improved group had a similar rate of improvement as the recovered group, did not progress after the 2-week follow-up, but did maintain their initial gains to the 6-month follow-up. Those in the deteriorated group reported much less pain at baseline than those in the other groups but experienced a dramatic worsening in pain after the 2-week follow-up. It could be illuminating to explore factors that might have influenced the change patterns in each group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most clinicians have an intuitive sense of what constitutes clinically significant change for their patients. If asked, most would describe a change in the patient’s condition that is meaningful and important to some aspect of the patient’s life. This could be a reduction in symptoms, improved activity level or quality of life, or increased functioning or performance. The Jacobson method described in the present article is one approach to operationalizing clinically significant change in a statistical manner. This method has the advantages of including an objective definition of recovery, is relatively simple to calculate, and can be applied to a variety of conditions, treatments, and outcome instruments. It allows researchers and clinicians to assess whether an individual patient exhibited clinically significant change if his or her pretreatment score was within the dysfunctional population distribution but the posttreatment score was within the normal or functional population distribution. An additional advantage is that the efficacy of an intervention can be reported in terms of the percentage of treated patients who return to normal functioning, which is of significant interest to both clinicians and patients.</p>
<p>It should be emphasized that any quantitative approach to defining clinically significant change should not replace traditional analyses of mean differences or the reporting of effect sizes. Rather, these methods are complementary, and inclusion of clinical significance metrics generally provides additional information rather than contradicting the results from standard inferential statistical tests. However, these methods often yield what can appear to be less robust treatment effects. Researchers should also, when possible, report other, less demanding, measures of clinically important change that do not require patients to enter the most functional sample distribution to be considered significantly improved such as the MCID.</p>
<p>One limitation of the Jacobson method is that it relies on information about a normal or healthy population. Most outcome instruments commonly used in orthopaedic sports medicine have not been administered to a general population of nonpatients so normative data are not available. In addition, the recovery cut point in this method is based on sample means and SDs, which can vary a great deal between samples, particularly with small samples, so the recovery cut points may be quite different between studies. As recommended earlier, we strongly urge researchers to pool data from several samples of the target population to standardize the dysfunctional norms. Another limitation of this method is that for some patient groups, it can be difficult to define an appropriate normative comparison group. For example, for competitive athletes, simply moving within the normal population distribution might not be an adequate assessment of recovery. The question of interest for these patients is often the ability of a treatment to allow them to return to their level of performance prior to the injury. On the other hand, return to play can be an incomplete assessment of recovery, as the athlete may continue to experience significant pain or disability despite participating at the prior level of competition. Moreover, return to play statistics can only be utilized for athletes who may represent only a percentage of the patient sample. An additional limitation of the Jacobson method is that operationalizing clinically significant change in terms of return to normal may not be realistic for all conditions (eg, osteoarthritis). For these conditions, it might be more appropriate to use measures of MCID.</p>
<p>It is our hope that researchers consider the inclusion of some quantitative measure of clinically significant change when reporting the results of intervention studies. In a nonsystematic review of outcome studies that used patient-reported instruments published in <italic>The American Journal of Sports Medicine</italic> (<italic>AJSM</italic>) between October 2010 and September 2011, only 5 of 88 (5.6%) employed such measures. An additional 22 (25%) did report the percentage of athletic patients who returned to their sport at their preinjury level, which provides important but different information. More routine reporting of clinical significance has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of research and research communication in sports medicine. Our intent is that this article will provide interested researchers and clinicians an understanding of these methods and the tools to employ one of the most commonly adopted approaches by researchers in other disciplines.</p>

<p>This formula is derived by a simple algebraic manipulation of the formula for the variance (<italic>S</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>) of observed scores (<italic>obs</italic>) as the sum of the variance of true scores (<italic>t</italic>) and the variance of error scores (<italic>e</italic>), S<sup>2</sup>obs = S<sup>2</sup>t + S<sup>2</sup>e, and then the relationship of reliability as the ratio of the variance of true scores to the variance of observed scores, calculated as the following: reliability = S<sup>2</sup>t/S<sup>2</sup>obs. The SEM is expressed in units of SD of observed scores ranging from one SD for a test with zero reliability to zero SD for a test with perfect reliability (which would be no error of measurement).</p>
