<abstract>
<p>The article discusses the nature of humanistic knowledge. Analyzing the relation between aesthetic judgment, literacy and knowledge as defined by the French seventeenth-century Jansenist school of Port-Royal, the article argues that Port-Royal’s interpretation of the enthymeme can be used to define the cognitive basis of aesthetic judgments in the various disciplines of the humanities. The article concludes with arguments that the literacy provided by the humanities explains their value as a necessary foundation for understanding the global world.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1474022212438753"><title>The problem</title>
<p><sc>A newspaper headline alerts us</sc> to the basic problem: ‘In tough times, the humanities must justify their worth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022212438753">Cohen, 2009</xref>). Summoned before the CEO of Public Opinion, the humanities are being asked to explain themselves. Why are they singled out?</p>
<p>The answer, I suggest, lies in the assumption, too easily made, that some disciplines are transitive: they appear to carry the student directly into the real world. By comparison, the humanities appear intransitive. If one studies the environment or the economy, for example, there appears to be some direct connection between the student and the real world. In these disciplines, textbooks are of course used but these appear subordinate to the discipline’s relationship to the subject at hand. In the humanities, the book looms large. The real world – whatever that might mean – appears eclipsed by Plato, Thoreau, Beethoven or Monet. Interesting, attractive, important works, one will concede: but in hard times, say some, isn’t the study of such works a luxury? It is time to disagree.</p>
<p>In this article, I introduce arguments that seek to demonstrate the essential value of the humanities. Building on our conversations in the Colgate–Emory working group, I raise three basic questions: how are we to define the humanities; what kind of knowledge do the humanities provide; do the humanities have a method of their own? The article seeks overall to promote further discussion and elaboration of these starting points.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474022212438753"><title>How are we to define the humanities?</title>
<p>I begin with a basic principle of perception. When we see an object in three-dimensional space and decide that it’s a cube, we know that it has six sides even though we can see only three of them: we fill in mentally the three missing sides, invisible to us. And we do the same thing with the objects and persons we encounter in our daily lives. From a visible portion of some thing, we form in thought a more complete idea of the thing seen.</p>
<p>From this basic fact of our ordinary, daily reasoning, I suggest a general definition of the work of the university. All disciplines take some starting point and seek to know it in a more complete way. The natural sciences start with some portion of empirical reality; the social sciences with large-scale questions concerning various aspects of our social world. From these starting points, methods are developed, interpretations constructed and larger meanings and understanding produced. Given these broad definitions, how may we define the humanities?</p>
<p>If we take the humanities as the province of literature, philosophy, art and music, we encounter a different kind of starting point. In music, it is sound; in art, the visual image; in literature and philosophy, the written word. Hence the appearance that the starting point of the humanities is at some remove from the so-called real world. Compounding this appearance is the very real affective level that exists in art, music and literature. This affective level appears more integral to these disciplines than any affect produced by the study of the natural or social sciences. To admire Van Gogh’s painting <italic>Starry Night</italic> and to call it beautiful assigns the painting an immediate, intrinsic, and sufficient value. Likewise, to consider as moving and beautiful the following lines from Tennyson’s poem ‘Locksley Hall’ – ‘Many a night I saw the Pleiades rising through the mellow shade,/Glitter like a swarm of fireflies tangled in a silver braid’ – is to proclaim their value as poetry. Similar statements in the natural or social sciences can be made, but these statements appear secondary to the knowledge that the discipline is meant to provide. An astronomer may say that ‘the constellation of the Pleiades is beautiful’, but this statement remains merely subjective from the point of view of astronomy as a discipline that seeks some further degree of knowledge about this constellation. A meteorologist may admire a beautiful sunset, but such admiration would make for an insufficient weather report. An economist may remark on the marvelous relationships that exist among various actors in the economy; but economics itself seeks to produce some intellectual product that goes beyond any such affective appreciation. To say that a historian writes well is to make a compliment; something more is required to legitimate the writing as history.</p>
<p>Compounding further the appearance of subjectivity is the fact that the humanities deal with the works of individuals, with a Borges, a Frost, an Ovid. Even with theme-based courses such as Greek Tragedy or Renaissance Literature, the humanities appear less than ready to compete with a university team that includes the likes of, for example, Environmental Studies, Pre-Medical, and Macro Economics, all of which are seconded by the hefty methodological line-up of field work, laboratory experiment, statistics and case study. In other words, there is in the natural and social sciences an immediately recognized cognitive basis and a clear intellectual process that guide study and learning in these disciplines. By subject matter, therefore, these disciplines appear to have a direct connection to the real world, and by their method, a means to validate themselves as sources of genuine knowledge.</p>
<p>I contend that such negative judgments about the humanities are themselves partial. To say ‘this poem is beautiful’ or ‘this painting is beautiful’ is to confer on the poem or painting an essential value that goes well beyond the merely affective. Just as in the natural and social sciences, professors of the humanities seek to investigate portions of this real world and to produce interpretations and analyses that create real knowledge; in the humanities, the real world is the human mind in its capacity to express and create, to reason and understand. The faults and charges of which the humanities are accused are in fact complaints and dissatisfaction with the most essential portion of a human being: the intellectual and creative realities whose meaning is unquantifiable and inaccessible through scientific analysis or social statistics. But if this is so, then just what kind of knowledge can the humanities provide?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1474022212438753"><title>What kind of knowledge do the humanities provide?</title>
<p>To discuss this question, I take my argument from works by Antoine Arnauld (1612–1694) and Pierre Nicole (1625–1695), two seventeenth-century theologians of Port-Royal, France. I choose these arguments because they belong to my own scholarly experience and because I believe them especially congenial to the question at hand, namely, recognizing the nature and legitimacy of the knowledge that the humanities provide. Known for their defense of Augustinian theology and religious apologetics, Arnauld and Nicole had a major influence on the history of ideas through their numerous writings, in particular their work of logic, known as <italic>La Logique de Port-Royal</italic>, a work ‘still used as a text in nineteenth-century Oxford and Cambridge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022212438753">Hacking, 1984</xref>: 73–4). In their <italic>Logique</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022212438753">Arnauld and Nicole (1981)</xref> develop arguments that show – to my mind convincingly – that what we commonly call ‘beauty’ involves a certain kind of intellectual judgment. It is their discussion of the cognitive basis of this aesthetic judgment that strikes me as germane to understanding the work of the humanities.</p>
<p>Their explanation involves a line, preserved by Quintilian, from Ovid’s lost tragedy <italic>Medea</italic>. Literally translated, the line says: ‘I had the ability to save him: you ask whether I could destroy him?’ Arnauld and Nicole show that the expression presents an incomplete argument which the reader completes in his mind, and then argue that the beauty of the line depends on the form of its expression. The authors of the <italic>Logique</italic> translate less literally, to bring out the unstated conclusion of the original: ‘I was able to save him: I shall therefore be able to destroy him.’ The logicians point out that presenting the complete formal argument behind the line would impair its beauty: ‘It is certain moreover that if, taking this line from Ovid’s <italic>Medea</italic> … one were to make it into a formal argument in the following manner (<italic>The one who can save can also destroy: I was able to save him; therefore, I will be able to destroy him</italic>), all the beauty of the line would be lost …’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022212438753">Arnauld and Nicole, 1981</xref>: 226–7).</p>
<p>In their interpretation of this line, Arnauld and Nicole use a traditional form of reasoning well-known to logicians and rhetoricians: the enthymeme, defined by Aristotle as ‘a sort of syllogism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022212438753">Aristotle, 1991</xref>: 186; Appendix I. F). A syllogism can be defined as a way of analyzing an argument’s logical basis and validity by an examination of its basic assumptions and the relation between these assumptions. A classic example of the syllogism is: ‘All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Socrates is therefore mortal.’ Another example is the newspaper headline: ‘In tough times, the humanities must justify their worth’. We find therein the following line of implied reasoning: ‘In times of economic want, less-essential things must justify their worth; the humanities are less essential; therefore, they must justify their worth’.</p>
<p>Of importance for our purposes is that the enthymeme is an abbreviated form of reasoning. The enthymeme can omit explicit mention of some of its assumptions since, as one of Aristotle’s commentators says: ‘Some premises can be assumed as obvious’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022212438753">Aristotle, 1991</xref>: 187 and n.157). An example of this (which I borrow from a standard textbook) is the statement: ‘John will fail his examination because he hasn’t studied.’ Without having to work out in explicit fashion the complete sequence of reasoning in this statement, one readily understands its reasoning, the basic premise being: ‘Anyone who doesn’t study for his final examination will fail’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022212438753">Corbett, 1990</xref>: 61).</p>
<p>To put things more emphatically: in our daily speech and thinking, we think and express ourselves in enthymemes. Arnauld and Nicole underscore this point in their treatise when they say: ‘Enthymemes are therefore the ordinary manner in which men express their reasoning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022212438753">Arnauld and Nicole, 1981</xref>: 227). One easily finds examples from daily life: we see a cloudy sky and decide to take an umbrella; arriving for a meeting, we see a coat on a chair and choose to sit elsewhere; we see a person walking toward us and from a particular gait and demeanor recognize someone we know. The word ‘green’ as currently applied to a host of products in advertising is more than an adjective: it is an implicit argument about both quality and moral value of the product and its producers. And I would not hesitate to compare Port-Royal’s discussion of the enthymeme to Malcolm Gladwell’s study of rapid cognition in his best-seller <italic>Blink</italic>: ‘[It] is a book about rapid cognition, about the kind of thinking that happens in the blink of an eye … I think that what goes on in those first two seconds is perfectly rational. It’s thinking – it’s just thinking that moves a little faster and operates a little more mysteriously than the kind of deliberate, conscious decision making that we usually associate with “thinking”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474022212438753">Gladwell, 2007</xref>: 2–3). Gladwell uses modern terms, but his own insights strike me as a modern working-out of the possibilities inherent in the enthymeme.</p>
<p>But a further, fundamental step is taken by Nicole. The enthymeme’s incomplete form becomes key to the understanding of literature’s aesthetic effect. Using the same example from Ovid, Nicole explains (my emphasis):
<disp-quote>
<p>The making of enthymemes is such a common thing in both internal and external discoursing, as well as in books and writings, that it is rare to make therein complete and categorical syllogisms; and it is even often the case that these enthymemes are enclosed in a single proposition created from unexpressed notions [<italic>vues</italic>]. These unexpressed notions [<italic>vues</italic>] are not conceived of distinctly and expressly. The mind sees and feels them in a confused and indistinct manner, and has of them no clear and precise idea that it can ordinarily remember.</p>
<p><italic>All books are full of these enthymemes and of these kinds of propositions. The mind yields to them because of the viewpoints that strike it; but if one were to ask it what these are, indicating this distinctly would be very difficult.</italic></p>
<p>One easily consents to this enthymematic line from Ovid’s <italic>Medea</italic> [here, Nicole quotes Ovid’s line] … However, many people would have some difficulty in indicating distinctly the major premise … One may therefore say, to follow this thought, that books being a group of thoughts, <italic>each book is in some way double, and impresses upon the mind two kinds of ideas.</italic> For the book impresses a group of thoughts that are formed, expressed and conceived of distinctly; and in addition, it impresses therein another group, composed of indistinct notions [<italic>vues</italic>] and thoughts, which one feels and which one would have difficulty expressing; and <italic>the beauty of a book or piece of writing depends ordinarily on these notions</italic> [<italic>vues</italic>] <italic>which are excited yet unexpressed.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022212438753">Nicole, 1996</xref>: 156, 158)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>While reading words and forming conceptions that are distinct, the reader’s mind conceives of a second level of thought that, if more felt than known distinctly, yet exists within the reader’s mind and is the source of the aesthetic sentiment behind the judgment that something is beautiful. When we read and appreciate a poem or novel, we are experiencing this second level of reading and thinking. The arguments of Port-Royal, I contend, recognize and legitimate the intellectual basis of what appears to be a purely subjective or aesthetic judgment. When we say: ‘This line of poetry is beautiful’, we are in fact making an intellectual judgment. The understanding for this judgment may be incomplete, yet the value of the text is recognized. The judgment one makes of the work is an individual one, yet one’s judgment is more than merely subjective: this judgment is an act of recognition and of knowing even though the recognition and knowing may remain indistinct. The work of the humanities is therefore more than the subjective study of some subjective element. Rather, the legitimate work of the humanities is intellectual in the fullest sense of the term: it is the work of developing a more complete, distinct, known understanding of an act of thought.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1474022212438753"><title>Do the humanities have a method of their own?</title>
<p>That these arguments have a direct application to literary studies is evident. In terms that I believe gain illumination from Port-Royal’s comments, Hemingway explains that through deliberate omission he improves his writing: ‘the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474022212438753">Phillips, 1999</xref>: 76). When a modern critic describes the poems of Edward Arlington Robinson as being ‘on the brink of revealing something of great moment that is never actually revealed, but always deferred, withheld, obscured’, this interpretation, and the subsequent reference to Borges’s definition of the ‘<italic>hecho estético</italic>’, could be usefully discussed within the context of Port-Royal’s discussion of the literary effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022212438753">Mezey, 1999</xref>: xxliii; the reference is to the Borges essay <italic>La muralla y los libros</italic>).</p>
<p>Port-Royal’s discussion also serves to ground other aspects of literary criticism. Form and style are essential to literary meaning, as any teacher of an introductory literature course knows. For those outside literary studies, questions of form and style appear secondary and arcane, and so the study of literature falls within the category of the ‘aesthetic’, which again risks appearing a bit too subjective to earn the distinction of what passes for real knowledge. But students of literature know that style and form can have legitimate meaning. For example, in a letter to his agent, the writer Jack Kerouac accepts his having to replace some words by others, but warns: ‘we do not dare touch the rhythm of that prose and those sentences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474022212438753">Kerouac, 1995</xref>: 558). The American poet Mary Oliver writes of the need for readers and writers of poetry to acquire ‘an engrossed and able affinity with metrical verse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474022212438753">Oliver, 1994</xref>: 15). Likewise, Robert Pinsky’s discussion of the sounds of words, and of their Romance and Germanic roots, as he analyses poems of Frost and Stevens involves a degree of literary understanding that can be compared with Port-Royal’s discussion of secondary meanings in the literary text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474022212438753">Pinsky, 1998</xref>: 81–91). Teachers of literature can easily supply other examples from their own experience.</p>
<p>That these arguments have, then, a special relevance for the study of literature seems acceptable enough. But given the nature of the enthymeme, that it is the ‘ordinary way’ in which we express our reasoning, can Port-Royal’s views on aesthetic judgment be extended to the humanities in general? Port-Royal’s arguments on the idea of abbreviated reasoning strike me as perfectly applicable, for example, to the study of art, whether it is Sir Joshua Reynolds marveling at the aesthetic power of ‘a few well-chosen strokes’ that ‘produce a complete impression of all that the mind demands in an object’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474022212438753">Reynolds, 1959</xref>: 194–5), or Saul Steinberg who in a famous definition said that drawing is ‘a way of reasoning on paper’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474022212438753">Smith, 2006</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>To take another example: I also suggest that Port-Royal’s ideas on the nature of literacy allow us to see anew the classical languages of Greece and Rome. To classify the languages spoken by Plato or Cicero as so-called ‘dead languages’ because they come to us in written form is to ignore the basic fact that the value of a language lies not only in its being a spoken language but in what it can in fact communicate. To read these classical languages is to encounter an intellectual and emotional content every bit as real and vital as that found in any modern, spoken language.</p>
<p>Could Port-Royal’s arguments point the way to a definition of a method particular to the humanities? Such a question may seem odd, given the radically different disciplines that make up the humanities curriculum and the desire in the academy for interdisciplinary study. But, for the humanities as a profession, the question of method is an especially important one. Jon Jacobs has said: ‘in the natural sciences, even if people are working on quite unrelated activities, they can all recognize each other as engaged in science, on account of their having a shared notion of fundamental features of scientific method and the evaluation of scientific claims’ (personal correspondence with author). Do the disciplines of the humanities have this shared recognition of each other, or a shared notion of method and evaluation? And if not, does such a lack hinder the recognition of the value of the humanities? In a recent essay, Joseph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474022212438753">Urgo (2008)</xref> seems to suggest that such a method may be found in the practice of ‘close reading’. If this practice can be such a method, then Port-Royal’s remarks on literacy take on a useful relevance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1474022212438753"><title>Literacy, teaching, time</title>
<p>If reading and literacy involve an abbreviated and elliptical process of reasoning and thought, then the work of the teacher and student involves the opposite process, the investigation and patient working out of the ideas and meanings implicit in the object of study. Teaching and learning become two sides of the enthymematic coin.</p>
<p>To recognize and begin to understand the fullness of these realities requires a process for working towards their understanding. When we, as teachers in a classroom, explain works of literature, we are working out the cognitive basis of this relationship, of this act of mind. Hence, the role of the teacher: to serve as a bridge between the student and the object of study. Or, in plain English: the work of teaching and learning this literacy involves the fundamental and unglamorous tasks of reading, grading and commenting on student papers; of writing essays and taking examinations – in general, work designed to assess the student’s ability to understand, recognize, and evaluate the intellectual basis of their object of study. Port-Royal’s ideas on literacy are here again useful: they help explain, for example, the obstacles encountered by students as they work to understand the larger, invisible, and real dimensions of the literary text or other object of study – but also their pleasure as they learn to articulate in words these newly discovered realities.</p>
<p>This brings us to an important fact about education in general: students do not purchase an education in the same way that they purchase other products, such as a new desk or laptop or low-energy lightbulb. When students and parents purchase an education, they are in fact purchasing an opportunity. To call entering students ‘students’ is to make a proleptic judgment: what this opportunity comes to mean, its value, depends in large measure on the student’s own participation over time.</p>
<p>This question of time is paramount in education. Our English word ‘school’ comes from the Greek <italic>scholê</italic>, which means ‘leisure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022212438753">Aristotle, 1976</xref>: xxx, n.5). This etymology, in appearance surprising, makes perfect sense. While a student is being a student, the student is engaged in non-remunerative activity: a student does not earn any money for writing papers or for going to class. In other words, one makes an exchange: one gives up one’s time in order to obtain some other good. In ordinary leisure activities, such as sports or watching television or charity, we give up our time for something of personal pleasure and value. In all of these, there is an exchange based on perceived values, with no sense of time or value lost.</p>
<p>What about the leisure time of education? For the time given up, what is received in exchange? Let us return to the reasoning behind the <italic>New York Times</italic> headline quoted at the beginning of this article. Any discipline that appears to have a more direct connection with the real world appears for this reason to have more value, and we enter a form of reasoning that goes something like this: ‘The best education is connected to the real world … Subject A is connected to the real world … Therefore, subject A provides the best education.’ Implied too in this reasoning is a further degree of argumentation: ‘The best investment for education is in a subject connected to the real world … Subject A concerns the real world … Therefore, paying for Subject A is the best investment.’</p>
<p>This assumption affects in particular the humanities. Given the growing importance of what is called ‘globalism’, the question of the ‘real world’ comes to the foreground. Port-Royal, I believe, provides arguments demonstrating the type of knowledge that the humanities do in fact provide. But what about the connection between the humanities and the ‘real world’? In giving up one’s time, one certainly derives real pleasure from studying the humanities, but isn’t such a choice in a global world less than a sure thing and more akin to speculation?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1474022212438753"><title>Laughing at Thales</title>
<p>If such questions arise, it is because we are today experiencing a version of the story of the astronomer Thales. ‘While [Thales] was studying the stars and looking upwards, he fell into a pit, and a neat, witty Thracian servant girl jeered at him, they say, because he was so eager to know the things in the sky that he could not see what was there before him at his very feet.’ Plato adds: ‘The same jest applies to all who pass their lives in philosophy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474022212438753">Plato, 1957</xref>: 121). And also, one may say, to those in the humanities who, it is assumed, neither see nor teach the things of this real world.</p>
<p>But again, it is time to disagree with these assumptions, it is time to mock those who would mock Thales – whose apparent distractedness eventually led to his subsequent good fortune (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022212438753">Aristotle, 1976</xref>: 31). If the visible and the obvious were exclusively the ‘real world’, if all of reality were defined by the existence of visible, open pits, then the mockery directed at Thales might be justified. Instead, I contend that the reality of the so-called ‘real world’ is in fact visible only in part; that much of the ‘real world’ is constituted by invisible and crucially important realities, namely human ideas and human relations and human values. In regard to the visible world, we can recognize and know the other side of material things; but how shall we recognize and know the other side of an advertising claim, an argument, a political slogan, a law, a claim to speak the truth?</p>
<p>To put this argument within the terms of the story of Thales: the real world is indeed composed of open pits, but they are invisible and can only be seen and known by thought, word and argument. We need to point out – we in the humanities and liberal arts – forcefully that the vision of reality conveyed by the Thracian girl and its more recent iterations is an impoverished one, one that no person actually holds; that in fact it would be dangerous and self-destructive to adopt the view of reality that this story provides, and especially so today, in a world of constant and global change.</p>
<p>It is here that we need to ponder more carefully and more thoroughly the nature of the humanities. In elementary school, we were told that, until Columbus proved otherwise, people believed the world was flat. Columbus himself believed the world was shaped like a pear. And today, the shape of the world is again being re-defined, its outlines and contours especially uncertain, changing, worrisome. Given such worries and fears, it is natural to reach for what appears most immediately reassuring.</p>
<p>I submit that in a changing world the humanities provide this reassurance in the highest possible degree. They are a necessary foundation for obtaining access to the real world. We have the certain knowledge that, however our world today may be defined, its realities will always exceed the realms of the empirical and the quantitative, and will always include the realities of human relations and thought. I submit that, in creating a civil society today, we cannot afford to limit ourselves to the partial realities of the natural and social sciences. Today, more than ever, we need to recognize that we live in a five-dimensional world. Beyond the three dimensions of space, we live in a fourth dimension of time and history; and we live too, especially, in a fifth dimension of word and thought. To navigate this global world today, we need, more than ever, to possess the knowledge and the literacy required for navigating these invisible dimensions of time and thought. And this literacy and this knowledge only the humanities can provide.</p>
<p>To ignore these dimensions of the real world is to make too narrow an investment. To recognize this essential value of the humanities is a first step towards their renewal in a global world. In his Commencement Address several years ago at Yale University, Tony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022212438753">Blair (2008)</xref> stated: ‘For the first time in many centuries, power is moving east.’ But he neglected to ask a more important question: in which direction is wisdom moving?</p>
<p>Where the humanities are taught is where we’ll want to live.</p>

<ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title>
<p>I thank Rebecca Chopp, former President of Colgate University; Lyle Roelofs, Dean of the Faculty; and Linck Johnson, Director, Division of the humanities, for their support of the Colgate–Emory project in the humanities. I thank those who attended the humanities Colloquium, Colgate University, 14 September 2010, in particular John R. Carter, for their comments. My colleague Alan Kim brought to my attention useful references to Thales. I thank my Colgate and Emory colleagues who participated with me in this project; in particular I am grateful to Jon Jacobs whose initiative brought about this project and who invited me to participate, and to Eliza Kent and Robert Garland, who read various versions of this article. Marshall Olds also read a draft of this article: I am grateful for his careful reading and criticism. All translations from the French are mine. My discussion of Port-Royal is based on an earlier essay of mine: ‘Equivoque et mystère: autour de Boileau et Arnauld’, in <italic>Pascal/New Trends in Port-Royal Studies</italic>, ed. David Wetsel and Frédéric Canovas, Tübingen: Gunter Narr Verlag, 2002, pp. 247–57; the conclusion contains a few lines from a paper ‘The geography of literacy’, which I read at the 16th Annual Conference of the Association for Core Texts and Conferences, 15–18 April 2010, New Brunswick, New Jersey.</p>
