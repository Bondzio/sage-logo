<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiovascular risk is increased in patients with prediabetes. A meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with prediabetes found that moderate increases in cardiovascular risk were associated with impaired fasting glucose, based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels of 110–125 mg/dL [summary estimate of relative risk, 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12–1.28] or 100–125 mg/dL (summary estimate of relative risk, 1.18; 95% CI = 1.09–1.28), and with impaired glucose tolerance (summary estimate of relative risk, 1.20; 95% CI = 1.07–1.34).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1479164112461657">1</xref></sup> In part, this is because insulin resistance is associated with dyslipidaemia, characterised by low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and elevated levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins; there may or may not be elevation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, but there is commonly an overabundance of smaller, denser LDL particles, along with larger very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and smaller HDL particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1479164112461657">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although reducing LDL-C is considered the main objective of lipid-lowering therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479164112461657">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1479164112461657">4</xref></sup> studies have demonstrated that lipoprotein subfractions may provide more information on cardiovascular risk than the standard lipid profile. Thus, increased LDL particle concentration (LDL-P) is an important predictor of cardiovascular risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1479164112461657">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479164112461657"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479164112461657"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1479164112461657"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479164112461657"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1479164112461657"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461657"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479164112461657"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479164112461657">13</xref></sup> and may be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than LDL-C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479164112461657">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479164112461657">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461657">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479164112461657">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1479164112461657">14</xref></sup> There is conflicting information regarding whether LDL particle size predicts cardiovascular risk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1479164112461657">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479164112461657"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479164112461657"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1479164112461657"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479164112461657">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479164112461657">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479164112461657">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479164112461657">16</xref></sup> and noted associations may be merely due to its relationship with LDL-P.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479164112461657">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461657">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479164112461657">16</xref></sup> Reduced HDL particle concentration (HDL-P) has also been associated with increased cardiovascular risk in multivariate models that include major risk factors and LDL-P.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1479164112461657">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1479164112461657">18</xref></sup> It has been suggested that smaller VLDL particles and their catabolic product, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) particles, could contribute substantially to atherosclerosis because of their ability to enter the subendothelial space,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479164112461657">3</xref></sup> but larger VLDL particles are usually unable to penetrate the endothelium to enter the vascular wall, so their atherogenic potential is unclear.</p>
<p>The bile acid sequestrant colesevelam hydrochloride is approved both to reduce LDL-C levels in adults with primary hyperlipidaemia and to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1479164112461657">19</xref></sup> Colesevelam reduces LDL-C levels by binding to bile acids in the intestine and preventing their reabsorption, resulting in depletion of the bile acid pool, which leads to increased conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (via upregulation of cholesterol 7-<italic>α</italic>-hydroxylase), in turn resulting in increased clearance of LDL-C from the blood. In addition to reducing LDL-C, colesevelam increases HDL-C and may slightly increase triglyceride levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1479164112461657">20</xref></sup> Furthermore, colesevelam significantly reduced LDL-P and increased LDL size in adults with primary hyperlipidaemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1479164112461657">21</xref></sup> and reduced LDL-P (mostly due to an effect on small LDL-P) when added to metformin and/or sulphonylurea therapy in adults with T2DM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1479164112461657">22</xref></sup> A clinical study evaluated the lipid- and glucose-lowering effect of colesevelam in patients with prediabetes and primary hyperlipidaemia;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1479164112461657">23</xref></sup> a separate arm of the study evaluated the combination of colesevelam with metformin in patients with T2DM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1479164112461657">24</xref></sup> Here, we report the effect of colesevelam on the concentration and size of various lipoprotein particle subclasses in patients with prediabetes and primary hyperlipidaemia from that study.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A 16-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted at 16 sites in the United States, 10 in Mexico, 7 in Colombia and 5 in India. Full details of this study, including the design, inclusion/exclusion criteria and statistical methods, have been published previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1479164112461657">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1479164112461657">25</xref></sup> Briefly, adults diagnosed with prediabetes [based on World Health Organization criteria: glucose ≥ 140 and &lt; 200 mg/dL (≥7.8 and &lt;11.1 mmol/L) 2-hour post-oral glucose tolerance test, and FPG ≥ 110 and ≤ 125 mg/dL (≥6.1 and ≤6.9 mmol/L)],<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1479164112461657">26</xref></sup> with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥2.6 mmol/L) and with triglycerides &lt; 500 mg/dL (&lt;5.6 mmol/L) were eligible. Use of lipid-altering drugs [3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), fibrates, niacin and ezetimibe] was permitted, provided a stable dose had been maintained for ≥3 months and dosage changes were not anticipated.</p>
<p>Patients were randomised to receive colesevelam 3.75 g/day or placebo for 16 weeks of double-blind treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1479164112461657">Figure 1</xref>). Colesevelam or placebo was taken either once daily (six tablets with the evening meal) or twice daily (three tablets each with the noon and evening meals), based on patient preference; however, the selected dosing schedule was to be maintained for the study duration.</p>

<p>The primary efficacy variable was the change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 16 with last (post-baseline) observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation. Secondary efficacy variables, which were also evaluated using Week 16 LOCF analyses, included change and percent change in lipids, apolipoproteins (apo) and lipoprotein particle concentration and change in lipoprotein particle size, FPG level and haemoglobin A1C value. Safety variables included adverse events. The LDL-C level was calculated using the Friedewald equation for patients with triglycerides &lt; 400 mg/dL (&lt;4.5 mmol/L) and using the Lipid Research Clinics Beta-Quantification method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1479164112461657">27</xref></sup> for patients with triglycerides of 400–500 mg/dL (4.5–5.6 mmol/L) (inclusive). The method of LDL-C level determination used at screening was maintained throughout the study, regardless of changes in triglyceride levels. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine VLDL, LDL and HDL sizes: large/chylomicron (estimated subclass diameter range &gt;60 nm), medium (35–60 nm) and small VLDL particle concentration (VLDL-P) (27–35 nm); large (21.2–23 nm) and small LDL-P (18–21.2 nm) and large (8.8–13 nm), medium (8.2–8.8 nm) and small (7.3–8.2 nm) HDL-P.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1479164112461657">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1479164112461657">29</xref></sup> The concentration of particles was then calculated.</p>

<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>Efficacy analyses were carried out with the intent-to-treat population, which included all randomised patients who had received at least one dose of the study medication and had a baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy variable measurement. An analysis of covariance model was used, which included treatment and country as fixed effects and the baseline value as a continuous covariate. The treatment difference was expressed as the difference between the least squares mean change for each treatment arm.</p>

<title>Demographic and baseline characteristics</title>
<p>In total, 216 patients were randomised to receive either colesevelam (<italic>n</italic> = 108) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 108). As previously reported, demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the treatment groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1479164112461657">23</xref></sup> The majority of patients were Hispanic (74%) and had been previously diagnosed with prediabetes (77%). At baseline, 6 patients (6%) in the colesevelam group and 10 (9%) in the placebo group were receiving statin therapy. Seven patients (7%) and three patients (3%) in the colesevelam and placebo groups, respectively, were receiving fibrate therapy at baseline. One patient assigned to colesevelam who did not take study medication or have any post-baseline efficacy measurements was excluded from the safety population. A total of five patients assigned to colesevelam and two assigned to placebo who did not have any post-baseline efficacy measurements were excluded from the intent-to-treat population; thus, the intent-to-treat population comprised 103 colesevelam and 106 placebo recipients.</p>

<p>Colesevelam treatment was well tolerated in patients with prediabetes and primary hyperlipidaemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1479164112461657">23</xref></sup> Overall, 120 patients reported an adverse event [colesevelam (<italic>n</italic> = 57); placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 63)]. Adverse events considered by the investigator to be drug-related (possibly, probably or definitely) were reported by 18 patients in the colesevelam group and 12 in the placebo group. Gastrointestinal drug-related adverse events (constipation, diarrhoea and dyspepsia) were most common, occurring in 14 colesevelam recipients and 5 placebo recipients. Serious adverse events were reported by two patients in the colesevelam group [erectile dysfunction (<italic>n</italic> = 1); polycystic ovaries (<italic>n</italic> = 1)] and two in the placebo group [cholelithiasis (<italic>n</italic> = 1); cystocele (<italic>n</italic> = 1)]; however, none of these events were considered by investigators to be study drug-related or led to study withdrawal.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, colesevelam significantly improved the LDL and HDL profiles, including reductions in LDL-P, in adults with prediabetes and primary hyperlipidaemia. Such changes are generally considered to reduce cardiovascular risk; however, the effect of colesevelam on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating significant reductions in LDL-P with colesevelam monotherapy in adults with primary hyperlipidaemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1479164112461657">21</xref></sup> and with colesevelam in combination with metformin and/or sulphonylurea therapy in adults with T2DM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1479164112461657">22</xref></sup> They further suggest that most of the LDL-P reduction is due to a change in small LDL-P, given that the magnitude of the reduction in small LDL-P and increase in large LDL-P was numerically greater in patients receiving colesevelam, compared with placebo. The reduction in small LDL-P occurred despite the fact that colesevelam increased triglycerides and VLDL-P. This study did not show a significant change in overall LDL size.</p>
<p>Despite the absence of an effect of colesevelam on HDL-C in this study, significant increases were seen in overall HDL size and the proportion of large HDL. Evidence suggests that increased HDL-P and size are associated with reduced cardiovascular risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1479164112461657">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1479164112461657">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Colesevelam increased total VLDL-P and size, mostly due to an increase in medium-sized, and to a lesser extent, large VLDL-P, but decreased small VLDL-P. Increased large VLDL-P is typical of the insulin-resistant state and is thought to drive the formation of small LDL and small HDL particles, which are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Interestingly, despite this effect of colesevelam on VLDL-P, there was no accompanying increase in either small LDL-P or small HDL-P. Thus, the effects on small LDL-P and small HDL-P were comparable to those seen in other studies with statins, fibrates and niacin, in the absence of increases in VLDL-P.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1479164112461657">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1479164112461657">32</xref></sup> Therefore, it is possible that the hypertriglyceridaemic effect of colesevelam is relatively benign. In addition, the fact that colesevelam led to a reduction in small VLDL may be a benefit, as it is known that small VLDL may gain access to the subendothelial space, which is less accessible to larger VLDL.</p>
<p>Study limitations include the following: randomisation was not stratified by sex, ethnicity or country and the study population consisted mostly of Hispanic females, which could limit the overall generalisability of these results. However, given the lack of clinical trial data in non-Caucasian populations, these data serve to expand our knowledge in patients of different ethnicity. In addition, the majority of patients were not receiving statin treatment, which is recommended to reduce the increased cardiovascular risk associated with prediabetes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, colesevelam improved the atherogenic lipoprotein profile by significantly reducing LDL-P in adults with prediabetes and primary hyperlipidaemia. In addition to reducing LDL-C levels and LDL-P, colesevelam induced favourable changes in the quality of HDL, LDL and small VLDL particles despite potentially less favourable changes in large and medium VLDL particles.</p>
