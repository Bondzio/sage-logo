<abstract>
<p>This article is a case study of how short-term missions in Peru were transformed into long-term involvement in a way that contributed to the transformation of the host community, the missioners, and their understanding of God’s mission. A complex environmental conflict in a highly polluted city in the Andes Mountains provided the context where a Christian mission network engaged more than 90 U.S. and 40 Peruvian Christians to transform short-term missions into a platform for long-term engagement and peaceful change.</p>

<body>
<p>In the last decade, short-term mission (STM) has received significant criticism from both missiologists and social scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091829612475161">Adeney, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091829612475161">Montgomery, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091829612475161">Priest et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091829612475161">Priest and Priest, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091829612475161">Ver Beek, 2009</xref>, and others), criticism which has focused on the inherent inefficiencies of STM, the pervading lack of cultural awareness, the negative impacts on local Christian witness or social services, and the superficial nature of the “personal transformation” that has emerged as a primary objective of the phenomenon in many circles. But some scholars note broader impacts of STM, such as Robert Priest’s “linking social capital” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091829612475161">Priest et al., 2006</xref>), Robert Wuthnow’s “status-bridging social capital” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091829612475161">2002</xref>), and Kersten Priest’s “globalization of empathy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091829612475161">2009</xref>). These identify how STM can transform the relationships between people across national and cultural borders in ways that transcend the intensely personal focus of much STM and potentially transform communities where STM works.</p>
<p>David Bosch opened his masterwork, <italic>Transforming Mission</italic>, by noting the transformation that mission initiates: mission transforms both the receiving community and the ones sent in mission, even as it transforms their understanding of what mission is. In this article, I will examine through these three lenses an ongoing experience of short-term mission in Peru to reflect on how short-term mission is transforming one Peruvian community, a growing number of short-term mission participants, and their shared understanding of what mission is. In lifting up this case for study, I do not pretend to suggest that the experience of short-term mission in La Oroya is normative: the extreme nature of the environmental pollution, the magnitude of the injustice experienced by the population, the complexity of the relationships between churches, NGOs, government entities, media and the community, and the clear, cause–effect linkage that leads from La Oroya’s children’s health back to a U.S.-owned smelting company, all make this case unusual. Yet globalization brings both greater economic connectedness (as evidenced in the reduction/elimination of trade barriers and the increased transnational flow of labor) and a greater awareness of that connectedness (through increasing international travel and media coverage) that will increasingly influence relationships between Christians in the Global South and Global North. This awareness and the opportunity for relationship can provide a powerful fulcrum on which to leverage significant social capital in ways that can generate substantive socioeconomic and legal change and give witness to the unity of Christ’s Body, the Church, across national borders and economic disparities. In summary, the ongoing role of short-term mission in La Oroya demonstrates one experience of framing short-term mission experience theologically and missiologically, preparing short-term missioners for the experience, and defining the roles of the short-term missioner in ways that contribute to the transforming mission Bosch describes.</p>

<title>Transforming La Oroya</title>
<p>The city of La Oroya lies 11,000 feet up in Peru’s central Andes and is home to approximately 35,000 people, including more than 8000 children. Any view of the city is dominated by the looming smokestack of the large metal smelter owned and operated by the Doe Run-Peru Company, a subsidiary of the Renco Corporation of New York. This multi-metal smelter produces lead, copper, gold, silver, and zinc and provides more than 2000 jobs, thus forming the mainstay of the local economy. Each day of operation, the Doe Run smelter releases more than one million pounds of toxic contamination into the atmosphere over the city: sulphur dioxide, lead, cadmium, arsenic, and other heavy metals. Consequently, the Blacksmith Institute<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0091829612475161">1</xref></sup> ranked La Oroya among the ten worst polluted places on the planet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worstpolluted.org">www.worstpolluted.org</ext-link>). According to a study conducted by the St. Louis University School of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA) in 2005, more than 97% of La Oroya’s children under age six suffer from lead poisoning. In numerous cases, the lead levels are so high that the child would be hospitalized immediately if she lived in the United States. One environmental health scientist noted that lead levels as high as those experienced in La Oroya can reduce a child’s intelligence by one to three I.Q. points for each year lived in La Oroya (Chernaik, personal correspondence, 2006). Because U.S. corporations are not required to meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards in their overseas operations, but are allowed to legally pollute at much higher levels in countries desperate for foreign investment and jobs, two journalists described Doe Run’s operation as “offshoring pollution” into La Oroya’s homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091829612475161">Shipley and Walker, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The Joining Hands against Poverty Network of Peru (<italic>Red Uniendo Manos contra la pobreza</italic> in Spanish) is a network of 14 Protestant churches and faith-based non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based groups organized by the Presbyterian Hunger Program<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0091829612475161">2</xref></sup> in 2001 to identify and address the root causes of poverty and injustice by creating missional linkages between U.S. Presbyterians and other faith-based partners in the Global South which result in Gospel-inspired solidarity and the possibility of leveraging social capital to change conditions of injustice. The program was developed in response to concerns expressed by global partners that Presbyterians’ mission focus was increasingly limited to short-term projects emphasizing compassion (child sponsorship, feeding programs, vacation Bible schools, etc.), which tended to ignore the deeper issues traditionally addressed by the church’s mission work (education, evangelism, health, community development, and justice ministries). The Joining Hands program links Presbyterians in 11 regions of the U.S.A. (called “presbyteries”) with Christian mission partners in eight countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0091829612475161">3</xref></sup> The author of this article was a Presbyterian mission co-worker who served for seven years under the Network’s Peruvian coordinator as a facilitator charged with linking Peruvian and U.S. Christians and organizations around the key issues identified by the Peruvian partners: economic justice, the environment and human rights. Beginning in 2002, the transnational campaign for children’s health in La Oroya became a central part of the Network’s mission.</p>
<p>The Network’s involvement in the La Oroya conflict began in 2002 with a call for help from Esther Hinostroza, a La Oroya native and national women’s leader in the Peruvian Evangelical Church (<italic>IEP</italic> in Spanish)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0091829612475161">4</xref></sup> and the director of Joining Hands member organization, Filomena Tomaira Pacsi. The Joining Hands sent a pastoral team from the capital city, Lima, to La Oroya to listen to the parents and teachers who were concerned about children’s health in the Andean city. At the time of their trip, there was little scientific information available to La Oroya’s parents. The only thing they had to go on were the headaches, learning disabilities, aggressiveness, and cognitive impairment that they observed in their children. As one member of the pastoral team began to comprehend the magnitude of the contamination and its impact on the children’s health, he watched a group of children playing and then exclaimed, “Can you imagine if these were <italic>our</italic> children?” Hinostroza responded: “But, pastor, these <italic>are</italic> your children.” Thus began a process of theological reflection that would eventually weave together many of La Oroya’s families and churches, STM teams from three U.S. states and two cities in Peru, long-term mission workers, Peruvian and U.S. environmental and human rights NGOs, and the media, leveraging social capital in ways that would result in measurable changes in public awareness, community organization, press coverage, legislation, environmental protection, and, ultimately, the health of La Oroya’s children and adults and, in doing so, transform the understanding of God’s mission of many of the participants.</p>
<p>The original request made in 2002 to the Joining Hands Network by the parents and teachers loosely organized by the local Catholic parish and three local NGOs into the Movement for Health of La Oroya (MOSAO) was twofold: (1) to provide accurate, scientific information on the level of pollution present in La Oroya and its impact on children’s health, and (2) to enable the children’s parents to share their story with the media, as it was believed that by publicizing the situation, MOSAO could generate pressure on the Government of Peru and the smelting company to lower pollution levels.</p>
<p>In response to the request, the Joining Hands Network worked closely with the other members of a “Technical Roundtable” (<italic>Mesa Técnica</italic> in Spanish), a group of Peruvian NGOs which had come together previously to support La Oroya’s population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0091829612475161">5</xref></sup> The Joining Hands Network first had to decide that the work was consistent with its understanding of mission (“to reach out to the poor in the name of Jesus Christ in the spirit of Jesus’ mission as seen in Luke 4:14–21,” according to the network’s charter). The effort seemed beyond the scope of network members’ understanding of mission: “We were accustomed to giving hungry people a fish in Christ’s name and even teaching them to fish,” said Hinostroza, “but we had never given thought to what Jesus would have done when the river which runs through their town is contaminated.” After Bible study and reflection, they accepted the challenge because they believed that Jesus would have supported La Oroya’s families in their effort. Just days after a Jesuit priest, the Rev. Pedro Barreto, was installed as the Catholic Archbishop of Huancayo, the archdiocese that encompasses La Oroya, he traveled to the city to assess the environmental situation and its impact on the community’s health. The Joining Hands Network facilitated a meeting at La Oroya’s Catholic parish between MOSAO members and the new Archbishop. After an awkward round of introductions, Network leader Esther Hinostroza asked the Archbishop a direct question that articulated the Network’s theological understanding, even as it revealed her own Protestant background: “<italic>Hermano</italic> (brother) <italic>Monseñor</italic>, if Jesus were here, He would walk with us. Will you?” The archbishop’s immediate and surprising reply—“Of course, <italic>hermana</italic> (sister), the Church will walk with you!”—began an ecumenical alliance almost unprecedented<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0091829612475161">6</xref></sup> in the Peruvian religious context that would yield important fruit for the mission of restoring health to La Oroya’s children. The Network organized an environmental justice working group, led by Hinostroza, to work on the two strategies requested by MOSAO.</p>
<p>The Network’s initial strategy was to seek to provide families and authorities at the local and national level with accurate, impartial scientific evidence of the extent of toxic pollution in La Oroya and its impacts on human health. While a preliminary blood lead study among children had been conducted in La Oroya in 1997 by the national Environmental Health Office (DIGESA), the Doe Run Peru Company had raised questions about the size of the sampling and its scope, that is, an exclusive focus on children’s blood lead levels which did not necessarily exclude other sources of lead contamination, such as automobile exhaust. But MOSAO members believed the Doe Run smelter was, in fact, emitting most of the pollution in La Oroya and they needed to identify the substances, their volume, and their impact on the community’s health.</p>
<p>In July 2002, a short-term mission team from Broad Street Presbyterian Church in Columbus, Ohio, led by pharmacist and Presbyterian elder Patti Nussle, brought a portable LeadCare analyzer unit, which could quickly measure the blood lead level in a drop of human blood. An informal sampling of 100 children was assembled: 97 of them showed excessive levels of blood lead, some of them so high the portable unit could not accurately measure them. Nussle’s initial skepticism as a scientist was replaced by shock and concern and she presented the results in the Congress of <italic>North American Toxicology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091829612475161">2003</xref>), substantiating the community’s concerns and attracting the attention of U.S. public health experts. A Joining Hands leader in St. Louis, the Rev. Elinor Stock, used the results of Nussle’s study to engage the participation of Dr. Fernando Serrano, a researcher at the St. Louis University (SLU) School of Public Health. Serrano convinced SLU and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to organize a complete environmental health study, which was conducted in September 2005. The study, valued at more than $435,000, was organized by the Catholic Archdiocese and the Joining Hands Network at no cost to the local population or organizations. A Presbyterian STM team from Ohio served as “international monitors” for the study, providing needed “eyes from abroad” (<italic>ojos del extranjero</italic>)—a level of surveillance and, thus, protection for the medical researchers in a local context of increasing hostility that many alleged was the direct result of the Doe Run Peru Company’s actions. A St. Louis television news crew was invited by the Network to cover the story and enhance the security of the medical researchers. During the two days of blood and environmental sample collection, the STM international monitors were faced with several instances of physical violence (some team members were spit upon and eggs and stones were thrown at them, allegedly by company employees who feared the loss of their jobs), but the researchers were able to complete the study with the required number of samples.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0091829612475161">7</xref></sup> The study’s lead researcher, SLU School of Public Health professor Fernando Serrano, later stated, “Had it not been for the Joining Hands Network and their partnership with St. Louis Presbyterians, the study could not have happened” (2009).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0091829612475161">8</xref></sup> The public presentation in Peru’s Congress of the results of the SLU study was widely reported in Peru and the United States and contributed to the campaign’s effort to raise awareness and political pressure to generate change in La Oroya. By leveraging powerful Peruvian and foreign actors, the Joining Hands Network lent legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091829612475161">Scurrah, Lingán, and Pizarro, 2009</xref>: 25–26), prestige, and, ultimately, power to a small community organization, MOSAO, that was presented in the Peruvian media accompanied by reputable and impartial institutions such as the Peruvian Catholic Church, U.S. medical institutions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0091829612475161">9</xref></sup> (including the CDC, the premier public health institution in the world), and a growing number of U.S. citizens (e.g., pediatricians, public health specialists, pharmacists, communication specialists, and other professionals) who traveled to Peru as short-term mission participants and whose citizenship and appearance, in a world dominated by the U.S. economy and culture, transformed them into “international experts.” The study provided clear substantiation of the community’s concerns and raised questions about the veracity of the Doe Run Company’s ongoing discourse which had denied the responsibility and minimized the potential for negative impacts on human health since it acquired the smelter in 1997. It also opened the door to a significant increase in press coverage both in Peru and the United States, especially in the St. Louis area, where Doe Run Peru’s parent company, the Doe Run Company, was headquartered. So foundational was the SLU study to the story of the conflict in La Oroya, that after the publication of the SLU study <italic>every Peruvian and U.S. newspaper, magazine, and television account of the conflict referenced the study’s results</italic>. The fact that SLU was located in the same community as the polluting company’s parent company contributed to the frequency and power of the media coverage by providing a local “hook” for the coverage.</p>
<p>Building on the success of the first initiative to provide accurate scientific information to community residents and authorities, the Joining Hands Network’s second strategy was to raise national and international awareness of the crisis for children’s health in La Oroya to generate political pressure on the government of Peru to enforce existing legislation and on the company to decrease its toxic pollution. This would require a level of international media expertise and contacts that MOSAO and its supporting NGOs, including the Peruvian component of the Joining Hands Network, were ill-equipped to support. Together, MOSAO, the Network, and the other supporting NGOs had only one person who knew English and one communication professional, Rolando Pérez of Network member <italic>Paz y Esperanza</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0091829612475161">10</xref></sup> As U.S. STM participants traveled to La Oroya and developed both personal relations with MOSAO and Network members and a knowledge of the local situation, they began to provide communication advice, and later, media consulting, which quickly expanded to include identifying and maintaining U.S. media contacts,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0091829612475161">11</xref></sup> training MOSAO and Network leaders in media relations and messaging, and providing first-person interviews and the local “hook” which justified local coverage of the otherwise distant story. U.S. short-term missioners were encouraged to contact their local media upon returning home and share the story of what they had seen and experienced in La Oroya. Between 2005–2007, the majority of the articles and letters to the editor published in the St. Louis <italic>Post-Dispatch</italic> about the health crisis in La Oroya cited or were written by Presbyterian short-term missioners who had traveled to La Oroya.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0091829612475161">12</xref></sup> Many of these missioners had never before written a letter to the editor or engaged in any act of “public witness” related to their Christian faith.</p>
<p>The concrete results of this transnational media campaign were significant, as evidenced in a 2006 study done by Oxfam-America, an NGO which collaborated with the Joining Hands Network in support of MOSAO and funded a project to increase media coverage of the La Oroya story: “Special note should be made of … Joining Hands’ accomplishments. The inclusion of the international organizations in the campaign was able to place the issue (of La Oroya) in the international press, thus pressuring the Company in its own backyard in the United States.” The Oxfam report goes on to say,<disp-quote>
<p>the initial effort had its greatest success internationally, as [Peru’s] national media were not yet interested in the environmental story of La Oroya. Nevertheless, as the issue continued to gain legitimacy and weight, the concern for La Oroya grew to the extent that, in 2005 and 2006, when the conflict was at its peak, there was not a single Peruvian media that had <italic>not</italic> reported on the situation… (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091829612475161">Scurrah et al., 2006</xref>: 38)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In 2005, the Network served as the lead institution of the MOSAO’s Technical Roundtable in the coordination of a campaign of prayers and letters to the Peruvian Minister of Energy and Mines that generated more than 18,000 letters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091829612475161">Joining Hands Network, 2005</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>Thus, the Joining Hands Network contributed to the two needs expressed by the local community in 2002, that is, accurate scientific evidence and media coverage, as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091829612475161">Table 1</xref>. But the Joining Hands Network did not accomplish all of its objectives. The battle for the “hearts and minds” of the local population in La Oroya, despite the scope of the accomplishment on the national and international levels, was never won by the Network. The Doe Run-Peru Company’s public relations campaign in La Oroya was successful in maintaining a level of fear and distrust towards MOSAO and its NGO’s allies among much of the local population. This failure sometimes meant that local families and workers would march in favor of the company. Also, at least initially, the Network struggled in its relationships with the NGO community as many of the church-related members had little experience in the world of NGOs, and these relationships took time to develop. Finally, a key battle to defeat the company’s effort to win a postponement of their commitment to clean up the smelter’s toxic emissions was lost when the government bowed to the company’s lobbying effort. This defeat set back the Network’s organizing efforts for several months. Yet, by providing scientific evidence to the local community and authorities and access for them to the international and national media, the Joining Hands Network created a space in which La Oroya Christians could leverage partners’ social capital to establish legitimacy, win allies and generate pressure on the primary decision-makers: the state and the company.</p>

<title>Transforming the Missioners</title>
<p>A limited understanding of mission focuses exclusively on its impact on the receiving community. But Bosch reminds us of the mutuality of <italic>missio dei</italic>, as it transforms both the host community and the missioner. How were the short-term missioners, both U.S. and Peruvian (Catholic youth from Huancayo and Lima), changed by their experience of mission in La Oroya? A total of approximately 90 North American Presbyterians and 40 Peruvian Catholics and Protestants traveled with the Joining Hands Network to La Oroya between 2003 and 2006. Youth from the U.S. and Peru worked with La Oroya youth in an ecumenical team, painting murals, creating and broadcasting radio talk shows, visiting schools, and designing and producing street theater, all for the purpose of witnessing to God’s intention in Creation and humanity’s responsibility in caring for it. In addition to the previously referenced teams that brought a portable LeadCare Analyzer unit to test children and the team which served as international monitors when the SLU Public Health School team traveled to La Oroya to collect blood, urine, and environmental samples in 2005, many adult, youth, and intergenerational groups spent significant time with La Oroya’s children and families, spoke with local officials, reflected theologically and prayed, and tried to understand the dynamics of a highly polluted town that depended on the very company whose pollution was making their children sick.</p>
<p>How did the experience impact the STM workers? In this account, an STM leader from Ohio describes her initial sense of inadequacy before such a daunting challenge:<disp-quote>
<p>But I was troubled by this La Oroya project. We were told there was lead poisoning going on there, and we were to help tell the story of that back here in the States. But there was no proof. And so, knowing nothing about how to do that, I started making telephone calls … to lots of people I did not know. I asked how one would measure blood lead levels in the Andes Mountains … at the end of months of asking, I was able to carry with the team to La Oroya a portable blood-lead analyzer … and the rest is history, in a way. We and the mothers found out together, in the freezing room we borrowed from the midwifery clinic, when the number popped up on the tiny screen on the hand-held device, that each and every one of their children had enough lead in their blood to cause brain damage. In the U.S., as a matter of federal guidelines, each of these children would have been immediately admitted to the hospital. We took this information back to Lima and the States, and others took it from there. To the St. Louis University School of Public Health, who did a scientifically correct study which corroborated our findings. To the Peruvian Congress and to the U.S. Company, to ask for change. To the newspapers and television, to ask for pressure on these decision-makers for change. To the church community, including our Roman Catholic brothers and sisters, to pray for solutions.</p>
<p>And so, when people ask me why I go on short-term mission trips, I try to tell them my story. It’s a story about an average pharmacist from the Midwest, who was asked to go and learn about these people in a far-away place, and tell their story. In doing so, I was asked to step out into a space that I was not familiar with and had no special interest in. And I was asked to take a risk, a small spiritual risk, really. But a risk, nonetheless. And in that stepping out and risking a bit of my spiritual comfort, I was able to see and live and learn about the most vulnerable amongst us in a whole new way … and they really are amongst us … right here, right now … as surely as those at the local food pantry are amongst us … and to live and learn the duty and the delight in working with and for them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0091829612475161">13</xref></sup></p>

<p>But when she is confronted with the scientific fact of a large number of extremely lead-poisoned children—some of whom she came to know by name—she struggled as she compared the injustice in Peru to the medical treatment children in the U.S.A. could expect to receive. The moral dissonance this produced for many STMers motivated deeper reflection and, in numerous cases, a changed direction in consumer and vocational choices.</p>
<p>Eleven of the STM workers said they decided to attend seminary as a result of their time in La Oroya.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0091829612475161">14</xref></sup> One of the STMers described it this way: “I had to travel to one of the most polluted places on earth, at 14,000 feet, to hear God whisper in my ear … and crack wide my heart to hear Jesus ask me to follow him into ministry.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0091829612475161">15</xref></sup> Congregational mission leaders reported that several of the STMers reported changing their career path to study public health, law, or social work and that approximately half of the STMers continue in correspondence with friends in La Oroya or that they have made a follow-up visit there.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0091829612475161">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the face of much negative assessment of STM as being ineffective and even self-centered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091829612475161">Adeney, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091829612475161">Montgomery, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091829612475161">Ver Beek, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091829612475161">Priest and Priest 2008</xref>, and others), how do we account for the impact on the ST missioners as evidenced by their reported vocational choices and by their own descriptions of perceived changes? In addition to the extreme situation that short-term missioners experienced in La Oroya, there were several components of the Joining Hands program’s structure and methodology that were perceived to strengthen the impact of the experience on the Christian faith of the short-term missioners. Because the Joining Hands Network was established with a binational structure which linked the Global North and Global South (with one network nexus located in Lima, Peru, and the other in St. Louis, U.S.A.) and because most of the short-term missioners traveled from and returned to congregational structures, there was a natural, supportive environment for intentional pre-trip orientation and post-trip follow-up in ways that enhanced the personal change often experienced by the short-term missioners. Communications between the U.S. congregations and the Network office in Lima were frequent and provided ongoing news, follow-up information, and a sense of continued connectedness, which helped the missioners extend their experience of a remote situation beyond a normal ST excursion. Larger congregations found that returned short-term missioners naturally formed “cell groups” within the larger congregational structure in ways that deepened the impact of the initial STM trip. For example, ten years after the original STM group traveled from the Broad Street Presbyterian Church of Columbus, Ohio, to La Oroya, the “Peru Crew,” a mission-focused fellowship group of returned short-term missioners to La Oroya, serves as an intergenerational space where members continue to socialize and to process their experience and learning from La Oroya, renew contacts with Peruvian friends, “read” their current Christian life through the lens of that shared missional experience, and continue their mission of prayer and advocacy—their global discipleship.</p>
<p>In addition, the long-term nature of the campaign and the development of a larger, ecumenical organization (the “Friends of La Oroya,” which organizes ongoing electronic updates and activities such as prayer vigils, letter-writing campaigns, and gatherings to hear reports from returning short-term missioners and visitors from La Oroya)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0091829612475161">17</xref></sup> have provided structures which serve to maintain the experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091829612475161">Ver Beek, 2009</xref>). Methodologically, as a result of the repeated experience of receiving STM groups, the Joining Hands Network office in Lima gained valuable experience in shaping effective orientation materials and in forging long-term relationships with STM groups and their leaders.</p>
<p>Programmatically, the Network intentionally planned regular daily biblical reflection and prayer to permit U.S. Presbyterians to reflect theologically about their experience in La Oroya and on how to engage their spiritual learning when they left the <italic>liminal space</italic> of the foreign STM experience and returned to their home context. In these ways, Joining Hands’ structure, methodology, and program enhanced the transformational impact the STM experience had on the missioners.</p>

<title>A Transformed Understanding of God’s Mission</title>
<p>The STM work of Joining Hands in La Oroya also impacted the U.S. and Peruvian participants’ understanding of God’s mission in several ways. In a sense, the La Oroya experience of using STM to leverage the social capital of Global North Christians is not unique in Presbyterian World Mission (PWM): Presbyterians’ support for Witness for Peace and current work through the Colombia Accompaniment Program—both faith-based programs which place U.S. citizens for short-terms in areas of conflict in Latin America—the work of the Israel/Palestine Mission Network which engages U.S. Presbyterians in the work of advocacy for justice for Palestinians, often beginning with short-term experiences, and Joining Hands work in Cameroon have all sought to serve as an entry point for U.S. Presbyterians to step into solidarity and advocacy for displaced or oppressed persons in situations of conflict or injustice. But the Joining Hands Network’s intentionally long-term focus on connecting STM groups from specific congregations in an identified network contributed to a transformed understanding of mission among participants.</p>
<p>The regular opportunity for La Oroya’s Christian families to reflect on how they understood their situation and the role of their faith in a context of injustice and suffering was suggested as a reason that the participation by members of the local congregations in MOSAO grew, despite the ongoing conflict between Catholic parish members loyal to the company and those supportive of MOSAO’s work. Local families, including children, encountered in the Network’s regular visits to La Oroya a safe space where they could share their concerns about their families’ health. Numerous local participants commented that they had never addressed a group of <italic>gringos</italic> (foreigners) before and felt that sharing their story motivated solidarity and action on the part of the foreign STMers. This space of empowerment had an impact on the U.S. and Peruvian STMers’ understanding of mission as a common space characterized by mutuality and the sharing of resources: “I believe the most important contribution of the Network was that I was able to tell my story of what the Company was doing here and foreigners actually did something about it!” (personal interview, Rosa Amaro, March 2007).</p>
<p>The Joining Hands methodology in La Oroya also invited STMers from the United States to reconsider a conceptualization of mission as an activity done “in benefit of a disadvantaged population” in the light of a more mutual understanding of mission in some specific ways. Over the years of the Joining Hands Network’s cycle of STM activity and reflection, it increasingly used a mutual model of STM engagement, pairing Peruvian Christian youth groups, both Protestant and Catholic, from Huancayo and Lima, with U.S. STMers for several days of contextual orientation, Bible study, and reflection to form a binational team before traveling to La Oroya to work with local MOSAO leaders, church workers, and families. This more mutual understanding of mission—Peruvians and U.S. Christians working together in God’s mission—differed from many other STM projects which often implicitly categorize along national and racial/ethnic lines. Christians from the Global North are often cast as the missioners and Global South Christians and populations as the recipients of mission, and the Joining Hands model offered an alternative understanding of mission as a more mutual relationship.</p>
<p>The Joining Hands experience with STM groups in La Oroya contributed to the development of a concept which would grow to become a major component in PWM’s strategic direction in 2010. The concept of “community of mission practice,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0091829612475161">18</xref></sup> which posits a mutual, collaborative space where U.S. Presbyterians, global partners, and mission workers or other cultural brokers from the wider church build relationships, pray, plan, and engage in mission together, has become an important building block of PWM’s engagement with Presbyterian congregations. The concept ensures the inclusion of the voices of global partners in their increasingly direct relationship with U.S. congregations and creates a space where issues of power can be identified and addressed in ways that enhance faithful and effective engagement in God’s mission.</p>
<p>A final aspect of participants’ understanding of mission that was transformed was that most of the Peruvian and North American STM workers had not considered the work of advocacy or accompaniment of the victims of injustice as valid mission work. Esther Hinostroza’s statement, “we had never given thought to what Jesus would have done when the river that runs through their town is contaminated. We realized then that Jesus wanted us to do something more,” provoked considerable reflection among U.S. and Peruvian STMers. That “something more” was the response of many STMers to the unjust situation that they experienced in La Oroya and was expressed through ongoing long-term relationships and commitment to change.</p>
<p>One of the first STM groups to visit La Oroya was actually detained by the local police and their passports taken while they were visiting the city in 2002. The incident happened after a brief, formal meeting with the mayor of La Oroya, when the group was invited by the mayor to share on a local radio program the Doe Run Company’s pollution mitigation efforts at its smelter in Herculaneum, Missouri. On the air, the group’s leader, the Rev. Elinor Stock, noted that the company had only reduced pollution when required to do so by the U.S. government’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and that the EPA’s actions were almost always prompted by the public pressure of organized citizens. Within 10 minutes after the Rev. Stock began her comments, local police burst into the radio studio and forcibly ended the broadcast. When the STM group was later told by local Christians that the police action came as a result of pressure from the company which was attempting to keep the La Oroya population ignorant of the company’s investments in pollution control in Herculaneum, their outrage galvanized a bond between local families and their team. The Rev. Elinor Stock was the organizer of the U.S.-based group, the “Friends of La Oroya,” which brings together 14 U.S. Catholic religious orders, Protestant denominations, and environmental and human rights NGOs to support the campaign for children’s health in La Oroya and continues her involvement to this day. The social and spiritual bonds forged in moments of shared risk and even danger allowed U.S. Christians to experience, sometimes for the first time, the vulnerability of the poor and oppressed and to empathize with their plight in ways that generated a changed lifestyle and an active response. Theologically, many U.S. STMers had to consider their response to situations where the forces of law are, in fact, opposed to justice, initially in the remote setting of a Peruvian mountain community, but eventually in the home context and nation as well.</p>
<p>According to a preliminary questionnaire given to many of the STM groups, most participants, before traveling to La Oroya, had understood mission to be something one does in a remote location to benefit a disadvantaged population. The globalized nature of the injustice of La Oroya and the methodology of accompaniment used by the Joining Hands Network altered that understanding of mission, causing many to begin to see the connections that link situations of poverty in the Global South with situations of privilege in the Global North:<disp-quote>
<p>The aspect of our short term mission project in La Oroya that changed me the most, had to have been being on the ground, seeing and experiencing firsthand the abuse and injustices that are so far removed from my daily existence—except for my culpability in them as a member of the consumer society from which they are generated in the first place. The images of the mountains that had been ravaged by pollution for generations and the courage of the young people calling for a new future, I will never forget. (Rev. Kirk Miller, personal correspondence, July 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In today’s rapidly globalizing world, the plight of La Oroya’s children forced many STMers to consider looking beyond the more superficial responses of STM work they had engaged in previously and to identify and address the structural underpinnings of unjust systems which cause such suffering among families they had come to know. While compassion is a valid, biblical response to our neighbor’s suffering, the La Oroya STM experience forced missioners to consider another dimension of mission—justice—presented in Luke 4 as integral to the mission of Jesus. The urgent question asked by German Christian martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer was used by the Joining Hands Network in the STM groups’ final-day reflection to contrast these approaches to mission: “Will the church merely gather up those whom the wheel has crushed or will it prevent the wheel from crushing them?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091829612475161">2012</xref>: 317).</p>

<sec id="section4-0091829612475161">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While recent literature on STM has often been critical of the limited nature of its impact on host communities and on STMers, the experience in La Oroya suggests that there are contexts where STM participants from the Global North can develop long-term relationships with Christians in the Global South, allowing the latter to leverage significant social capital, including media coverage, professional and political contacts and expertise, scientific information and services, as well as prestige, legitimacy, and political power in ways they could not have accessed without the relationship with STM groups from the U.S.A. This experience suggests some important strategies in the context of increasingly global connections between Christians around the world. Indeed, as a result of the experience, the 14 churches and organizations which make up the Peruvian Joining Hands Network created a motto to summarize their mission statement: “Riding the winds of globalization toward a just and sustainable world” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.manosperu.org">www.manosperu.org</ext-link> ). This evidences an emerging understanding of mission built on their experience of the potential impact—both of personal and societal change—of the transformation of the short-term mission experience into “global discipleship,” that is, the intentional effort to follow Jesus Christ in a world increasingly characterized by economic, informational, and technological disparity.</p>

<p>For Presbyterian World Mission, a “community of mission practice” is “the space where U.S. Presbyterians, global partners and World Mission come together. A community of mission practice shares an identity derived from a common passion. It commits to interact regularly to learn and grow as a community and is guided and shaped by the disciplines of prayer, Bible Study, reflection and worship. It includes diverse perspectives, working together toward a common purpose, sharing World Mission’s core values, and developing a body of shared knowledge and practice in mission in order to increase the faithfulness and effectiveness of its participation in God’s mission” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pcusa.org/media/uploads/global">www.pcusa.org/media/uploads/global</ext-link>).</p>
