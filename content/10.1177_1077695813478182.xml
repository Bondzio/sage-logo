<abstract>
<p>Enough evidence is available to support the idea that public relations professionals must possess search engine optimization (SEO) skills to assist clients in a full-service capacity; however, little research exists on how much college students know about the tactic and best practices for incorporating SEO into course curriculum. Furthermore, much of the literature on the topic is in trade publications and blogs rather than scholarly journals. To fill this void, this study has two primary objectives. First, it seeks to shed light on definitions, trends, and current practices relating to the use of SEO in public relations. Second, the study seeks to learn how much students know about SEO and where they acquired their knowledge. Educators can incorporate this information into curricula to help students remain current with the profession. Study findings are informative not only for PR professors who are considering adding SEO elements to courses but also for PR professionals who want to learn more about the topic.</p>

<body>
<p>Within the Internet world, many new media techniques have emerged; however, few have grown in importance as quickly as search engines, which are now the leading knowledge portal for web users. Search engine optimization (SEO) is designed to increase the visibility of a web page so search engines know where to place the site correctly in their results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077695813478182">1</xref></sup> The goal is to produce the most relevant results to any given search after indexing pages. Search engines consider article length, writer’s expertise, title, topic, keywords, and quality of linking sites, or inbound links.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077695813478182">2</xref></sup> The importance of incorporating SEO tactics into PR communication strategies will intensify as user-generated content continues to permeate the lives of consumers.</p>
<p>Articles on SEO often discuss ethics, marketing, and newsroom/business norms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077695813478182">3</xref></sup> Although such articles focus on the impact of social media on the media industry, there is very little scholarly research in recent communication or public relations journals about SEO. Also lacking from the literature is an examination of student knowledge of SEO and where they acquired this knowledge. This study, through open-ended and Likert-type scale survey questions, helps fill this void in the literature. Specifically, this article has two primary objectives. First, we briefly outline the definitions and uses of SEO. Second, we survey junior and senior public relations majors to assess the importance that they attach to SEO and how they might apply the tactic to the PR industry.</p>
<p>A description of SEO and implications for the PR industry is informative not only for PR professionals but also for PR professors who are considering adding elements of SEO to PR curriculum. According to previous research, there is no question that the Internet offers public relations practitioners a new communication medium; however, the impact has yet to be fully realized. They add that “capitalizing on the medium’s advantages means learning about the various Internet tools and technologies and understanding their capabilities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077695813478182">4</xref></sup> As SEO grows in importance, public relations practitioners and the professors who educate them need a solid understanding of the various definitions and techniques affiliated with the tactic. Study findings might help establish goals and objectives for course content.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077695813478182">
<title>Review of the Literature</title>
<p>Hundreds of trade articles have been written about SEO; however, few scholarly studies have been published. In our exploration of previous literature on SEO, we look to three streams of knowledge: (1) definitions of SEO, (2) the history of SEO, and (3) its application to the PR industry.</p>
<p>SEO is usually defined by the benefits it offers to users for positioning their content in engine searches. Search engines increasingly delineate users’ experiences of the Internet, a common tool for finding information, entertainment, and other content.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077695813478182">5</xref></sup> John Battelle has argued that “search has become a universally understood method of navigating our information universe.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077695813478182">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ultimately, every word on a blog or site is crawled and analyzed by search engines that gather and store information in their database. However, tags and keywords help maximize search results. WordPress, content management systems, and most social networking sites like Facebook, YouTube, and MySpace use tags for text, videos, pictures, music, and so on. Most of these outlets have built-in SEO tools that offer the ability to create static URLs called permalinks, blog-rolling, and pinging. Also worth noting is that tags are not just for search engines; they also provide extra navigation on a site, helping audiences find related content. Moreover, they identify what a blog is about and help readers determine if they are in the right place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077695813478182">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unlike paid searches in which marketers buy links through Google, Yahoo, Bing, and so on, SEO involves tapping into free listings among the more than one billion search requests that major global search engines process each day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077695813478182">8</xref></sup> Therefore, social media experts base the value of SEO on the idea that a company’s rank in a search is independent of direct payment, which fosters trust among searchers. SEO is the key to making content rank highly in natural or organic search results.</p>
<p>Methods for improving a site’s ranking have evolved. In the early days of the World Wide Web, content producers manually submitted a website to search engines and then waited for robots and spiders to analyze their content. Today, search engines have specific criteria that a website must meet to improve their rankings. While ranking procedures are different for every search engine, in general each engine focuses on the type and amount of content provided on a given website, the level of optimization done on the site, and site popularity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077695813478182">9</xref></sup> The assumption is that the more ways a site interconnects to other sites through links, revisits, and traffic, the more value it has.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077695813478182">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Klaasen adds that Google determines relevance by what the industry calls “link love,” or how many other sites link to content and the quality of those sites.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In search engines, links are like votes. Increasingly, social-media tools, such as blogs, social bookmarks and social networks, are helping drive search results-so make sure your content can be easily linked to and picked up by those sites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077695813478182">11</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Listings on a search results page are free; however, most companies pay employees trained in SEO to keep their content relevant. This shift to search marketing has generated considerable growth in salaries and search marketing position openings at agencies globally. Data from the first Search Engine Marketing Professional Organization Agency Salary Survey suggest that even those landing jobs for the first time can secure reasonable starting pay. Almost 40 percent of employees who have just started in SEO say they earn between $30,000 and $40,000 annually.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077695813478182">12</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section2-1077695813478182">
<title>SEO in the Public Relations Industry</title>
<p>Public relations tools aim to position an organization favorably in the public eye and to generate positive responses from diverse audiences. While communication channels are different from those of traditional media, the objectives are the same—to improve credibility by having good placement in third-party sources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077695813478182">13</xref></sup> Sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn offer practitioners a quick method of distributing interactive messages on products, services, and industry trends, which has had a great impact on public relations practices. SEO helps drive traffic to them.</p>
<p>SEO is also useful for crisis and issue management. PR practitioners often turn to SEO to help repair a tarnished image and to disseminate the company’s perspective. For instance, Steve Marino, the social media expert of British Petroleum (BP) during the BP oil spill crisis, states that companies must have a strong social media presence before a crisis to ensure that positive content trumps negative content. High-quality search engine optimization is a must. BP went from spending about $57,000 a month on search advertising to nearly $3.6 million in the month after the crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077695813478182">14</xref></sup> The company’s increased SEO expenditure underscores how important the tactic has become for reputation and crisis management. It also demonstrates that the time for climbing search engine rankings is before disaster strikes.</p>
<p>Because of SEO’s power to influence page rankings, industry leaders have jumped on the SEO bandwagon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077695813478182">15</xref></sup> Facebook created public search listings in 2009 to allow surfers to find listings leading to Facebook. Similarly, the <italic>New York Times</italic> removed a pay wall that prohibited search engines from accessing premium content. Google also indexes tweets so Twitter pages and individual tweets appear within search results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077695813478182">
<title>New Media Curriculum</title>
<p>Creating and maintaining a public relations curriculum that reflects industry changes and growth is a continuous task for university PR programs. As new communications technologies have emerged, so have the challenges and opportunities within public relations curriculum. A review of the literature demonstrates that those responsible for curriculum development disagree about how to best prepare today’s graduates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077695813478182">16</xref></sup> Historically, the most commonly mentioned recommendations for improving the public relations curriculum included providing students with a broad liberal arts background in research, ethics, theory, writing, and technology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077695813478182">17</xref></sup> However, PR employers’ emphasis on skills is rapidly changing. Recent results indicate employers also favor new media skills.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077695813478182">18</xref></sup> In many instances, companies hire today’s students to create a social networking presence on Twitter and Facebook and to blog about products and services, take photos, edit video footage, create websites, and conduct online research.</p>
<p>Previous studies indicate skill levels in SEO vary in the communication industry. For instance, both Dick and Killoran concluded that users vary widely in how extensively and expertly they use SEO techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077695813478182">19</xref></sup> Dick surveyed employees at three U.K. media organizations to establish how they use <bold>SEO</bold> in the newsroom, while Killoran studied business owners and their use of SEO to increase website traffic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077695813478182">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lack of new media skills is one complaint practitioners have about today’s graduates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077695813478182">21</xref></sup> PR specialists often criticize educators for not quickly updating PR curriculum by teaching students how to use new technologies that are emerging in the industry. For instance, Gower urges public relations professionals to understand the “language” of the Internet and the web, including terms such as spiders, meta tags, banners, and user groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077695813478182">22</xref></sup> Therefore, the need to integrate new media technologies into the undergraduate public relations curriculum and to encourage future PR practitioners is great.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077695813478182">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Changes to the media industry and the expansion of skills required of PR practitioners point to the need for a careful assessment of what students actually know and how they acquired their knowledge. To date, scholars have given little attention in peer-reviewed literature to issues relating to the assessment of students’ SEO knowledge. While SEO is but a small part of new media, trade journals indicate it is an important one.</p>
<p>Awareness of how actively students use SEO may give PR instructors a deeper understanding of how to develop course goals and objectives. Given these gaps in the literature, the following questions frame this study:</p>

<sec id="section4-1077695813478182">
<title>Rationale</title>
<p>In an increasingly digital world, there is a need to expand pedagogy to enable learners to become active participants and producers rather than passive consumers of content and learning processes. These research questions are particularly relevant today as many PR professionals believe the use of the newest technologies and techniques available is vital in providing effective communication.</p>
<p>A dominant feature of the digital revolution is that students often lead the way in learning environments. Professors must know where to start to cover material that will benefit students. Armed with this information, professors must be proactive, innovative, and open-minded in preparing students for the job market. This study provides a tool to assess student skills and knowledge of SEO, which in turn will provide insight into how professors may update PR courses.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1077695813478182">
<title>Participants: Characteristics and Limitations</title>
<p>Study findings are based on results from surveys of students between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three years conducted in August and September 2011. Researchers sent an email request to participate in the study to students enrolled in public relations classes (<italic>N</italic> = 273) at a university in the Southwest. All of the students had taken beginning and advanced public relations courses. We recognize that this sample is not necessarily representative of the U.S. population of PR students because it was restricted to PR majors at one university who chose to answer the online survey. However, despite this limitation, this type of data set is arguably much richer and broader than those in most literature describing SEO.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted through Qualtrics, an online survey-creation portal and was linked directly from our university. The survey consisted of five sections and took approximately twenty minutes to complete. The email told students the online survey would ask them questions about their knowledge of tools used in public relations. It also explained the potential risks and the voluntary and anonymous nature of the study. Of those who received the email request, ninety-one participated in the survey, providing a 33 percent response rate. The sample consisted of seventy-one women (78 percent) and twenty men (22 percent), with an average age of 20.77 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.55). Of the respondents, approximately 88.6 percent were white, 4.2 percent were Hispanic, 3.7 percent were African American, 0.4 percent were Asian, and 3.1 percent were “other.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077695813478182">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>To gain an understanding of common themes, we applied qualitative thematic content analysis to student responses to open-ended items to provide support and context for the quantitative section of this study. We treated the items as distinct discussions, which helped us identify underlying themes present in student responses. Questions were “What is search engine optimization (SEO)?” “How is search engine optimization changing the practice of public relations?” “How can search engine optimization contribute to a company creating a positive image?” and “How can search engine optimization be used for crisis management?”</p>
<p>We categorized data using techniques outlined by Strauss and Corbin and Ryan and Bernard, who suggest using keywords in context and word repetitions to discover themes in data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077695813478182">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077695813478182">25</xref></sup> Five or six themes emerged for each question. Both researchers examined responses independently and arrived at similar conclusions about themes. Intercoder reliability based on 10 percent of the responses indicated the two primary researchers agreed on thirty-eight out of forty questions, or approximately 95 percent.</p>
<p>To assess how SEO rated against other new media skills, we asked students on a scale of 1 to 5, “How important do you believe _______________ tools/skills are in the practice of public relations?” The list included photo sharing (Flickr, Shutterbug, etc.), podcasts, SEO, social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn), and video sharing (YouTube, etc.). Options were <italic>very unimportant, somewhat unimportant, uncertain, somewhat important</italic>, and <italic>very important</italic>. Similarly, participants indicated how prepared they felt they were to use the same knowledge and skills on a 5-point Likert-type scale (<italic>very unprepared, somewhat unprepared, uncertain, somewhat prepared, very prepared</italic>).</p>

<sec id="section8-1077695813478182" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Findings and Discussion</title>
<p>Research question 1 focused on identifying what public relations students know about SEO. Students answered four open-ended questions to demonstrate their knowledge of the topic.</p>
<sec id="section9-1077695813478182">
<title>What Is Search Engine Optimization?</title>
<p>The first open-ended question asked, “What is search engine optimization (SEO).” Most students responded with the idea that SEO uses keywords and hits or that it improves and optimizes search rankings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695813478182">Table 1</xref>). Responses in both of these categories made up more than 50 percent of overall responses (28.4 percent, respectively). Examples of student responses are “Carefully crafting a webpage to include keywords that make it easy to find through a search engine,” “Being able to get the most out of your search engine results,” and “Using meta data and strategies to increase your ranking in search results.”</p>

<p>Worth noting is that many responses to this question are not completely correct. For example, one person responded, “Paying to ensure a website, image or message of some kind shows up as a result on various search keywords,” while another respondent wrote, “When you pay Google or whatever search engine to put your item at or near the top when certain searches are entered.” Answers that include the idea that a company must pay to appear first in searches are partially incorrect. Referring back to the literature, SEO involves tapping into “free” listings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077695813478182">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Approximately 12.5 percent of students included answers that fell in the “other” theme. For example, one person responded, “I think it is the process of improving a website” or “Improving the look of a website.” In addition, demonstrating confusion surrounding the term’s definition, many respondents left the question blank or answered, “I do not know” or “not applicable.” This theme was the next most popular category, with 18.1 percent of respondents providing no answer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1077695813478182">
<title>Search Engine Optimization and the Practice of Public Relations</title>
<p>The next open-ended question asked, “How is search engine optimization changing the practice of public relations?” The most popular response to this question was the idea that SEO makes searching and accessing pages easier, at 27.3 percent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077695813478182">Table 2</xref>). Answers that were similar to definitions described in the literature included “I believe it is allowing PR professionals to help companies get their name out there by making websites more visible” and “A big focus now in PR is making their websites visible, which used to not be a big topic within the PR industry.”</p>

<p>Some answers represented SEO negatively. For example, one respondent stated, “I look at it as an easy way out, you still need to build those personal relationships, but why would you take the time to do that if with a few clicks of a button you could have people visit your site.” Similarly, another person stated, “It doesn’t replace the need for public relations, it just pushes the need to have a personal and intimate public relations plan between a company and its publics.” Such responses fell in the “other” category and made up 22 percent of total responses.</p>
<p>Conversely, 12 percent of our sample incorporated answers that described the role of SEO for audiences. An example included “It’s an online marketing strategy that is making it easier to segment audiences, and that is a huge role in PR.” Other respondents stated, “Targeting an increasingly specific set of audiences” and “SEO is providing the opportunity for organizations to increase their manifest and noticeability in the public eye.” Many respondents provided vague answers that stated the essence of SEO. For example, one responded stated, “As media change, the practice of public relations must change in effect.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077695813478182">
<title>Positive Image</title>
<p>The next question asked, “How can search engine optimization contribute to a company creating a positive image?” Three themes occurred at about an equal frequency: 15.4 percent of participants included responses with the idea that SEO improves and optimizes search rankings. Conversely, 12.1 percent responded with the idea that SEO supports easier searches and access to online content. About 10.9 percent of respondents mentioned that SEO helps companies get their name noticed, recognized, or out there. Answers included “Helps more people see them” and “If positive results are listed first, viewers will more than likely look at those, which creates a positive image.” Similarly, another person wrote, “The ability to be prominent in a search engine listing gives the impression of reliability to consumers and/or viewers.”</p>
<p>Another respondent stated, “Making their company the most predominantly found on the Internet therefore causing clients to assume it is the best” and “More SEO equals more views on the web, but not necessarily positive ones.” Many students either left the item blank or wrote “I don’t know” or “not applicable.” This theme was the most popular category, making up 28.6 percent of total responses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077695813478182">Table 3</xref>). The next theme with the most occurrences focused on the idea that SEO helps companies target key publics and audiences and enhance their image (23.1 percent).</p>

<title>SEO and Crisis Management</title>
<p>The final open-ended question asked, “How can search engine optimization be used for crisis management?” Once again, the “I don’t know” or “other” category was popular (34 percent). The next most popular theme included the idea that SEO promotes the use of positive keyword hits, queries, and ranking. About 16.5 percent of responses fell in this category. Answers included “Make sure positive responses are available when information is being searched for” and “You can make sure your site, the site with the correct information, is the number one website so people are more likely to click on it and read the facts.”</p>
<p>Another respondent stated, “If people Google the crisis that your org. is involved with, if one of the first links that pops up is your web page, you have a good chance to handle the crisis effectively and properly.”</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077695813478182">Table 4</xref>, answers focusing on ease of search or sending messages quickly were also common (composing 14.3 percent and 13.2 percent of answers, respectively). Examples included “Using SEO would be beneficial for crisis management for a public looking for quick answers and information,” “You’re able to monitor things better,” “PR can help change the image of a company in a crisis situation by providing more positive words,” and “To get an idea of what the public is thinking.” Conversely, 8.8 percent of respondents stated SEO improves search rankings, which was a general definition and not the response we desired.</p>

<p>In sum, students were more likely to provide correct answers to questions 1 and 2, which asked for the general definition of SEO, than for questions 3 and 4, which asked how it applies to crisis management and the public relations field. For the latter two questions, respondents were more likely to leave these questions blank or to write “I don’t know” or “not applicable.”</p>
<p>Respondents continued to focus on the idea that SEO promotes easier access to pages rather than the idea that companies must continually have strong, positive online content coupled with SEO at all times to ensure that pages rank higher in keyword searches after a crisis. Both findings support the idea that PR educators need to include SEO strategies in their curriculum to prepare students for jobs that require new media skills.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Our survey results indicate several implications. First, it appears that most students know the basic definition of SEO; however, they do not know how it applies to public relations and crisis management. At a minimum, we believe PR graduates should understand that good SEO has the potential to add credibility and exposure to a company’s web presence. In other words, PR specialists can improve a client’s online presence by having good placement in third-party sources. It is important to have good SEO all the time to improve the odds that good hits dominate after a crisis.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, respondents suggested they primarily learned about SEO on their own, which illustrates the importance of talking to students to determine their prior knowledge and understanding. In an advanced PR class, instructors might ask students what they know about SEO from previous courses and ask what they would like to learn. Capitalize on what students already know by implementing projects that encourage real-world experiences and collaboration with peers.</p>
<p>The third implication is that students place a great deal of importance on SEO versus other new media skills and tools; however, they do not believe they are as prepared to use SEO as they are to use other new media skills and tools such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. While businesses use all three tactics to bolster their multimedia presence, SEO is possibly the most important because it will help drive traffic to a website. This critical finding bolsters the idea that instructors must incorporate strategies to teach students about SEO. Instructors will not be able to address every aspect of SEO because tactics change frequently. However, if students know how to apply basic tactics, they will be equipped to handle SEO in any format.</p>
<p>Professors may use questionnaires, both formal and informal, to help them decide which topics to emphasize throughout the semester. In other words, if students already utilize and understand a communication tactic, there is no need to spend extra time on the topic. At a minimum, professors must teach students how to analyze the effectiveness of SEO tactics such as site demographics, predominant keywords, and other factors relating to the site’s SEO. In beginning pubic relations courses, professors might demonstrate for students how and where to insert keywords, tags, and so on. They may also use group and peer teaching by inviting classmates who have advanced skills in SEO tactics to present information on various SEO strategies. In service learning courses, students might adopt a local nonprofit agency and create blogs with posts that include tags, categories, and keywords. To judge the quality of keywords and tags, perform keyword searches to test the rankings of student blogs and websites. Built-in website analytics also allow users to collect information about interactions on a website. Students can improve PR campaigns and site content based on the most popular keywords.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Results of our survey administered to approximately one hundred students indicate students know the basic definition of SEO; however, they do not know how to apply the tactic to public relations and crisis management situations. Furthermore, study findings indicate students understand the importance of SEO; however, they do not feel prepared to use the technique. Respondents suggested they were more likely to learn about SEO on their own than in internships or classrooms. Other scholars indicate the same pattern with several new media skills deemed important to the practice of public relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077695813478182">28</xref></sup> Survey results underscore the importance of talking to students to determine their prior knowledge and understanding of PR principles.</p>
<p>This study is particularly relevant today, as many PR professionals believe it is important to utilize the newest technologies available to communicate effectively. Awareness of how actively students use SEO may give PR instructors a deeper understanding of how to develop course goals and objectives. Once instructors are aware of SEO skills students possess, they can encourage them to use keywords more consciously and to capitalize on what they already know by implementing projects that encourage real-world experiences and collaboration with peers. In addition, rather than lecturing about SEO to students who already know basic definitions, instructors might have students incorporate keywords in existing content such as blogs and online portfolios. This will give students hands-on training in creating a social media presence for themselves, which they will transfer to on-the-job assignments.</p>
<p>As with all research, this study had limitations because of the lack of resources and study participants. The primary limitation of this study is the small, purposive sample we used to reach our conclusions. Future studies might include a larger, random sampling of students from more universities. In addition, future studies might examine syllabi and course descriptions of PR courses to assess objectives and instructors’ integration of SEO tactics. Study results helped us determine what students know about SEO and where they acquired their knowledge. Using this information as a base, we believe professors might have a better idea of how to approach teaching SEO tactics in college courses.</p>
