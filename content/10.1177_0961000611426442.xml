<abstract>
<p>This study aimed to develop and pilot a questionnaire to determine the ways in which working in a UK public library system can impact the well-being of those deployed in the sector. The methodological framework was based on an approach used to evaluate the well-being of patients in a clinical setting. Based on the responses of 466 employees, the results identified eight dimensions of library worker well-being; organizational, advancement, job design aspects, physical health, psychological health, interpersonal relationships, workload and facilities. Analyses indicated that organizational aspects most impaired well-being and longer-serving employees were worst affected. The findings offer a new, evidence-based perspective on the well-being issues that public library workers perceive to be most important and challenge earlier claims regarding stress and burnout. Also considered is the relevance of employer-sponsored wellness programmes where improvement in organizational performance is the prime reason behind provision.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There are increasing numbers of academic studies that are interested in establishing a direct relationship between the well-being of employees and their attendance and performance at work (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611426442">Donald et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961000611426442">Sparks et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961000611426442">Wright and Cropanzano, 2000</xref>). The UK Government has also directed attention towards this area with the recent publication of a report on the health of Britain’s working age population <italic>Working for a Healthier Tomorrow</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000611426442">Black, 2008</xref>). While the report considers medical issues such as musculoskeletal disorders and lifestyle trends (for example, dietary habits), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000611426442">Black (2008)</xref> also notes that the nature of the work itself is important when evaluating the health and well-being of a workforce. According to a recent survey on workplace wellness programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611426442">Buck Consultants, 2009</xref>), most employers view improved productivity as the key reason for such initiatives, of which the most popular include employee health screenings, fitness club membership discounts, immunisations, health fairs and on-site health classes.</p>
<p>A report by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611426442">Office of National Statistics (ONS) (2008)</xref> estimates annual sickness absence levels for librarians and related professions at 3.2 percent and ranks this group 14th out of a total of 81 different occupations where absence ranges from 0.8 percent to 4.8 percent. The report suggests that sickness levels among library workers appear relatively high compared to other occupations such as the teaching profession (ranked 39th) and protective service occupations (ranked 74th). The options currently available to examine the well-being of library workers and identify how their work may impact absence and performance are restricted. It is this limitation that provides the justification for the present study.</p>
<p>To date, scholarly studies into the health and well-being of librarians have generally been confined to the examination of stress (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611426442">Bunge, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611426442">Schneider, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961000611426442">Topper, 2007</xref>) and burnout (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961000611426442">Haack et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961000611426442">Smith and Nielsen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611426442">Togia, 2005</xref>). Stress may be defined as ‘the adverse reaction people have to excessive pressure or other types of demand placed on them at work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961000611426442">Health and Safety Executive, 2008</xref>). This compares to burnout which refers to a syndrome involving emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961000611426442">Haack et al., 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Research papers by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611426442">Bunge (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611426442">Schneider (1991)</xref> represent the only published studies to consider library stress using empirical, research methods. Other accounts comprise the speculative views of the authors (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611426442">Bold, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000611426442">Burke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961000611426442">Topper, 2007</xref>) that lack data to validate the opinions that they share. The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611426442">Bunge (1987)</xref> involves some 850 employees working in a range of different US library settings and claims that library work can be highly stressful. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611426442">Bunge (1987)</xref> cites a number of stressors including work overload/underload, skills shortage, dealing with library users, poor recognition, inadequate management, low quality workspace and limited career opportunities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611426442">Schneider’s (1991)</xref> research on occupational stress amongst 100 Canadian public library staff concurs with many of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611426442">Bunge’s (1987)</xref> findings, noting that issues particularly to do with organizational climate (for example, management behaviour and morale levels) are the main antecedents of workplace stress in a library workplace environment.</p>
<p>Library burnout studies all use generic scales to evaluate the degree to which respondents experience the syndrome (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611426442">Affleck, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611426442">Birch et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961000611426442">Haack et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000611426442">Hamilton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961000611426442">Smith and Nielsen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611426442">Togia, 2005</xref>). These examinations therefore consider the prevalence of burnout rather than ascertain its causes. Moreover, they provide a confusing, inconsistent picture on the levels of burnout experienced.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable to surmise that scholarly assessment of health and well-being within the library sector is narrow both in the number of rigorous, empirical studies and the range of issues examined. Studies are confined to the investigation of potential stressors and levels of burnout which are considered a threat to well-being rather than its equal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611426442">Dewe and Kompier, 2008</xref>). No study that examines the wider elements of well-being across a library population exists. Research is also dominated by work carried out in North America that may not be necessarily applicable to the experiences of those deployed in library jobs in the UK.</p>
<p>These limitations echo the views of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000611426442">Fisher (1990)</xref> whose review of library-based stress and burnout studies concludes that there is a shortage of well designed, empirical investigations and an absence of findings delivering a conclusive picture. Further, he disputes the use of generic burnout scales by challenging whether the types of questions used are relevant to a library setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000611426442">Fisher, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study is designed to address these existing shortcomings. It aims to develop and pilot an instrument to evaluate the well-being of library workers and respond to some of the criticisms levelled at previous authors. It intends to purposely and specifically identify aspects of well-being that are directly relevant to library workers and consider how they may link to attendance and performance in this sector. Further, it is intended that this work will go some way to redressing the surfeit of North American studies by examining a sizeable cohort of public library workers based in the UK.</p>
<p>An approach known as Impact Analysis (IA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611426442">Guyatt et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000611426442">Juniper et al., 1996</xref>) is used to construct a well-being assessment for library staff. IA is a proven methodology employed to develop Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) questionnaires used to evaluate the well-being of patients in a clinical setting. The scales are constructed to measure the overall impact of a disease on the well-being of patients. Examples of HRQL scales include the Quality of Life in Stage II Breast Cancer Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961000611426442">Levine et al., 1988</xref>) and the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961000611426442">Juniper et al., 1992</xref>). IA invites patients to ‘score’ how they believe their own well-being has been impacted by their ill-health based on frequency and perceived importance.</p>
<p>There are parallels between the assessment of impact of disease on patient well-being and the impact of work on employee well-being that this study seeks to explore. In support of this, an earlier pilot study examined the viability of applying the HRQL methodology to the workplace with encouraging results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611426442">Juniper et al., 2009</xref>). For the purposes of this study, the definition of work-related well-being (WRWB) is adapted from HRQL practices as ‘that part of an employee’s overall well-being that they perceive to be determined primarily by their work and can be influenced by workplace interventions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611426442">Juniper et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This definition is important because it emphasizes the importance of employees’ own perceptions and only includes those variables that may be modified through intervention by an employer.</p>
<p>Criteria for the development of the Work and Well-Being Assessment for Libraries follow those described for HRQL instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611426442">Guyatt et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000611426442">Juniper et al., 1996</xref>) and are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0961000611426442" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the finalized scale should be simple and quick to complete for library staff (no more than seven minutes);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>items should have content validity, i.e. reflect those areas of well-being that are important to library workers;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>summary scores should be amenable to statistical analysis;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the scale should be reliable, i.e. repeated administrations in a stable workforce should elicit similar findings;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the questionnaire must have construct validity, i.e. results should correlate with findings from a previously validated measure.</p></list-item></list>
<p>This present study focused on criteria 1–3. A further study will consider the remaining measurement criteria.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Approval for the study was provided by the Cranfield University School of Management Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>The participant organization was the Hampshire County Council Library and Information Service (LIS) public service based in Southern England. Of the 34 English county library authorities in operation, this particular LIS was one of the largest; it managed 51 public libraries and two discovery centres – a recently developed concept to provide a wider variety of community-based services in addition to the traditional library service. The LIS also operated two prison libraries and 19 mobile facilities. As well as offering a wide selection of books, CDs and DVDs, some 570 computers with Internet access were available to library visitors. Nearly 800 employees worked for the LIS. The majority of these were deployed in front-line services in libraries and mobile functions. The remainder provided support in the shape of general support to library staff, outreach services, administration and management. Although this LIS was one of the largest county-based operations by size, in was mid-ranked in terms of book issues per 1000 population.</p>
<sec id="section3-0961000611426442">
<title>Item generation phase</title>
<p>The purpose of the item generation phase (IGP) was to develop an exhaustive pool of variables associated with the WRWB of library workers. Consistent with the construction of HRQL instruments, a list was generated through a series of semi-structured interviews with a range of library workers. Participants from the LIS were invited to contribute their views on how they perceived their library work impacted on their general well-being. Additional WRWB variables were collected from managers and other qualified professionals associated with the LIS who had experience of working with library personnel. The item pool was also augmented by a literature review and additional management information collected by the LIS.</p>
<p>All variables generated in the IGP were loaded into an online questionnaire. Demographic questions regarding role and length of service were listed. Role categories included front line jobs (such as library assistant, senior assistant/information officer, library supervisor/assistant supervisor, library officer, service development officer, library/group manager and mobile driver) and support jobs such as van driver. An ‘other’ category was added to capture management positions, jobs at the LIS headquarters and caretakers. A free text response was also incorporated in the event that respondents wished to record additional WRWB experiences not already covered by the variables presented. The questionnaire was pre-tested with a number of library staff to ensure content and instructions were clear.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0961000611426442">
<title>Item reduction phase</title>
<p>The second phase of IA was the item reduction phase (IRP). The purpose of the IRP was to reduce the number of variables yielded in the earlier phase to those that were most prevalent and important to the well-being of most library workers.</p>
<p>All employees within the LIS were invited to complete, anonymously, the online questionnaire. Respondents were asked to indicate which of the items they had experienced during the past year. A score of ‘0’ denoted that the respondent had not experienced the issue. For each item that was positively identified, they were asked to ‘score’ how important and bothersome it was to their overall well-being on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all important and 5 = extremely important). Results were expressed as ‘frequency’ (the proportion of people experiencing the issue) and ‘importance’ (the mean importance for each variable listed). The ‘impact score’ was the product of ‘frequency’ and ‘importance’.</p>
<p>Items were ranked according to their impact score. The non-parametric test, Kendall’s Tau (τ) ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961000611426442">Kendall, 1938</xref>), was used to compare item rankings between the main LIS roles to ascertain if the same set of items could be applied to all sub-groups. Probability values (<italic>p</italic>) less than .05 indicated significant correlations in the rankings between roles.</p>
<p>Items were examined using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>). Items that appeared to be measuring the same impairment, for example, fatigue and tiredness, and were highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> &gt; .7) were either combined or the item with the lowest impact score was discarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000611426442">Juniper et al., 1996</xref>). The remaining highest scoring variables were selected and categorized into domains based on methodological experience and dimensions documented in established instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611426442">Guyatt et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000611426442">Juniper et al., 1996</xref>). Where domain membership was ambiguous, correlations of items with items that clearly fell in particular domains were examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000611426442">Juniper et al., 1996</xref>). Internal reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (α) ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961000611426442">Cronbach, 1951</xref>). Internal reliability was considered adequate if α exceeded .7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961000611426442">Rick et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>To help assess the well-being levels for the LIS workforce, response data were examined further. To do this, all ‘0’ values recorded for confirmed items were replaced with a ‘1’ value since the two values denoted the same general meaning ( where 0 = ‘No, I did not experience this problem’ and 1 = ‘Yes, I did experience this problem but it was not at all important or bothersome’). Variable and domain importance scores would therefore range from 1–5 (where 1 = Did not experience/Not at all important or bothersome and 5 = Extremely important and bothersome).</p>
<p>Differences in importance scores between domains and between different roles and different lengths of service were investigated using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) where the importance scores for the selected domains were the dependant variables. Residuals were tested for normality and the significance of pair-wise comparisons was examined using Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) test to determine meaningful differences between group means in an ANOVA setting.</p>

<title>Item generation phase</title>
<p>A comprehensive list of all possible WRWB issues was generated through a series of semi-structured interviews with 70 individuals from the participant LIS. A total of 56 discussions were held across six libraries across the county. The remainder were located at the service’s head office. A wide range of roles and different size libraries were represented and the union representative was kept informed of progress. Participants included library assistants (<italic>n</italic> = 16), senior assistants/information officers (<italic>n</italic> = 15), supervisors (<italic>n</italic> = 10), library or group managers (<italic>n</italic> = 5), library officers (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and service development officers (<italic>n</italic> = 5). Five mobile library drivers and van drivers also took part in the IGP. Additionally, discussions were held with the LIS head of service, the HR and training managers, the health and safety manager and the county council’s head of occupational health. Discussion formats were a mix of focus groups and individual meetings. Choice of format depended on the LIS staff in question and what best accommodated their work commitments. Previous literature was reviewed for potential items. This included a search of peer-review journals and sector specific media. The county council’s most recent staff satisfaction survey was also reviewed.</p>
<p>The item pool resulted in a total of 71 possible variables associated with WRWB in the LIS. Approximately 95 percent of the items originated from the discussions held directly with LIS employees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0961000611426442">
<title>Item reduction phase</title>
<p>Each of the 71 items was listed in the IRP questionnaire. The draft questionnaire was pre-tested with five LIS employees. In total, the questionnaire took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Email notices containing the URL that linked to the assessment site were issued to all LIS staff from the head of service. Details were placed on the LIS intranet homepage and poster notices were displayed in library rest areas to remind people of the study and encourage response levels. Staff were given a period of three weeks to complete the assessment.</p>
<p>A total of 466 completed questionnaires were returned which represented a 58 percent response rate.

<p>Impact scores for each variable were ranked by role and Kendall Tau (τ) correlations were examined. Assessments completed by those who identified their role as ‘Other’ (<italic>n</italic> = 61) were eliminated from this analysis since their positions were unclear and could confound results. The rankings for each of the remaining eight roles (<italic>n</italic> = 405) were significantly correlated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) with each other aside from the relationship between van drivers and library and group managers (τ = .10). Given that only three van drivers completed the assessment and only a total of four van drivers worked for the LIS in total it was deemed appropriate to construct one questionnaire for all those working in the LIS.</p>
<p>Impact scores were examined closely. Typically, items with impact scores exceeding 1.00 were selected for inclusion in the final instrument. A threshold of 1.00 was selected as this signified a degree of impairment and, importantly, accommodated the need to develop a scale that would take future respondents less than seven minutes to complete (approximately 50 items).</p>
<p>A total of nine items were eliminated owing to impact scores of less than 1.00. A question relating to commuting (‘Having a regularly difficult journey to and from work’) was also deleted; with hindsight the employer reasoned that this was an issue it was unable to address and it therefore failed to fit with the stated criteria for WRWB attributes.</p>
<p>Examination of item-item correlations resulted in 19 further items being discarded (<italic>r</italic> &gt; .7). The final number of variables was therefore finalized at 42.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0961000611426442">
<title>Domain classification</title>
<p>After careful and extensive consideration, the 42 items were divided into eight domains. Choice of sub-category was informed by earlier occupational and clinical well-being research. The largest domain was Organizational (ORG) (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and described issues associated with organizational change and the wider library and council bodies. The second largest domain was linked to training and development and was therefore labelled Advancement (ADV) (<italic>n</italic> = 7). The job domain (JOB) (<italic>n</italic> = 5) captured issues relating to specific aspects of library work while the Physical Health (PHY) (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and Psychological Health (PSY) (<italic>n</italic> = 3) sub-groups were linked to how work impacted on people’s physical and mental health respectively. Issues with people’s line manager and colleagues were grouped into the Interpersonal Relationships (REL) domain (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and perceived problems with workload were categorized into the Workload (WL) (<italic>n</italic> = 5) domain. The Facilities (FAC) (<italic>n</italic> = 4) domain considered well-being issues associated with the provision of amenities such as air conditioning and rest areas.</p>
<p>The distribution of the importance score data across the eight domains was examined using probability plots and skewness and was found to be approximately normally distributed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0961000611426442">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Significant differences in mean importance scores between length of service categories were also examined. Using a repeated measures ANOVA, the findings indicated that people who had been with the service for less than one year (<italic>n</italic> = 30; 6%) reported significantly better well-being (<italic>M</italic> = 1.34) than all other colleagues. Staff who had served with LIS for over 10 years (<italic>n</italic> = 213; 45%) indicated that their levels of well-being were significantly worse (<italic>M</italic> = 2.24) than all other sub-groups apart from those who had 6–10 years of service. The findings are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961000611426442">Figure 1</xref> with the mean importance scores for each sub-group indicated in the body of the graph.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A review of the findings suggests that the WRWB of library employees comprises a wide range of elements as represented by the eight domains identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0961000611426442">Table 5</xref>). The internal reliability for the finalized sub-scales is acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961000611426442">Rick et al., 2001</xref>) and the free text comments failed to uncover substantially new areas of WRWB thereby indicating that content validity is satisfactory.</p>
<p>The types of domain are akin to those found in HRQL instruments. For example, the study to develop the Quality of Life in Stage II Breast Cancer questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961000611426442">Levine et al., 1988</xref>) identifies seven areas of health-related well-being; the consequences of hair loss, emotional dysfunction, physical symptoms, trouble and inconvenience associated with treatment, fatigue, nausea and positive well-being. HRQL scales contain questions pertaining to symptoms associated with a medical condition as well as questions regarding the consequences of those symptoms. The same is true of the findings resulting from this present study; they cover particular aspects of the job (symptoms) such as ‘Experiencing problems with your legs and feet because of your work’ and outcomes (consequences) of certain job aspects such as ‘Worrying how changes in the Library Service may impact your job’.</p>
<p>How do these findings compare with the library literature on health and wellness? Firstly, the theoretical basis for this study – Impact Analysis – represents a different approach to those used in earlier studies. The findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611426442">Bunge (1987)</xref> are founded on contributions from library workers attending stress management workshops who were asked to name aspects of their work that were stressful. These statements were then grouped into categories and then ranked by the author according to frequency of mention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611426442">Bunge, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611426442">Schneider (1991)</xref>, on the other hand, constructed a library-specific scale for the purposes of researching library stress. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611426442">Schneider (1991)</xref> uses a selection of library stressors that are based on lengthy (1–2 hours) one-to-one interviews with some 32 library staff. No explanation on the final item selection process for the 58-item questionnaire is offered by the author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611426442">Schneider, 1991</xref>). Participants are asked to respond to items using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’. Data are factor analysed into five factors; job content, organizational climate, workload, relationships with colleagues and relationships with supervisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611426442">Schneider, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The IA approach adopted for this present study contrasts sharply with these earlier methods and addresses some of the research method concerns noted earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000611426442">Fisher, 1990</xref>). It offers a systematic procedure to item selection which tests for frequency and severity and therefore helps to ensure that the finalized items are those that are perceived to be most important to the majority of library workers. Neither <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611426442">Bunge (1987)</xref> nor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611426442">Schneider (1991)</xref> adopts such a methodical process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611426442">Bunge (1987)</xref> is only able to associate rather blunt frequency readings to his list of stressors while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611426442">Schneider (1991)</xref> appears to select questionnaire items arbitrarily and her use of agree/disagree response options do not permit the researcher to evaluate quantitatively the incidence or relevance of an event.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the differences in research approach, themes arising from this present study overlap with the main empirical studies published. For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611426442">Bunge’s (1987)</xref> list of stressors for public service librarians include problems with patrons, workload, feelings of inadequacy, lack of positive feedback, physical environment and scheduling which all share agreement with some of the domains established herein. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611426442">Schneider’s (1991)</xref> stress-related factors all concur with the current findings as far as they go. However, neither study presents such an extensive range of issues indicated by the present research. For example, references to problems relating to organizational change, physical health and advancement opportunities are absent from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611426442">Bunge’s (1987)</xref> claims. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611426442">Schneider (1991)</xref> neglects questions on organizational change, advancement prospects, physical health and the physical workplace in her 58-item scale. Variables relating to organizational change appear to be a material omission by both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611426442">Bunge (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611426442">Schneider (1991)</xref> given the mean importance scores recorded for this aspect of work (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0961000611426442">Table 6</xref>). This may be explained by the fact that large-scale change within the library sector has increased significantly since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611426442">Bunge (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611426442">Schneider (1991)</xref> conducted their work and therefore supports the views of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961000611426442">Tinsley and Heesacker (1984)</xref>, who suggest that theoretical models in the field of employee experience can become outdated within 10 years because of changes in the workplace.</p>
<p>With the bulk of empirical studies in the library sector focusing on stress and burnout, more items relating to these areas might have been expected. In the event, none of the variables determined during the IGP or the free text responses collected in the IRP cited burnout. Interestingly, only one variable from the IGP referenced stress directly which generated an impact score of 2.18 and ranked 12th overall (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961000611426442">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>With an overall score of 2.06, the findings show that, overall, public library workers deem that their well-being is slightly impacted by the work that they do. For library officers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0961000611426442">Table 9</xref>) and those who have been with the service for a long time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961000611426442">Figure 1</xref>), the situation appears worse although mean score values remain below a value of three and therefore seem to suggest that, for these workers, levels of well-being are not impaired to a dramatically high degree. It is interesting to note that significant differences between the well-being of different LIS roles were only modest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0961000611426442">Table 7</xref>). This analysis may have been compromised by the choice of role category and the fact that 61 respondents who identified themselves as ‘Other’ were eliminated from this part of the study. This point is considered further in the future work section.</p>
<p>This study also supports the views of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000611426442">Black (2008)</xref> regarding the importance of the work itself when evaluating employee health and well-being. These findings show a great many of the well-being issues identified by library employees are of an organizational nature rather than a medical one. Although a direct link between the drivers of well-being and absence cannot be drawn from the current findings, it is possible that there exists a correlation between attendance and some of the variables and domains identified. If this is the case, then the types of wellness programmes referred to earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611426442">Buck Consultants, 2009</xref>) appear extraneous to the well-being concerns of those working in a public library environment. It is difficult to see how discounted membership to a gym could benefit the well-being of people who have served in the LIS for over 10 years and are worried about their job security. Instead, a concerted effort by the senior management to address some of the high-scoring domains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0961000611426442">Table 5</xref>) or items (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0961000611426442">Table 6</xref>) may reap most reward both in terms of improving the WRWB of employees, optimizing productivity and reducing sickness absence.</p>
<p>This study has primarily sought to construct a scale to evaluate the well-being of those working in a public library authority in the UK. The actual well-being levels provide an indication of how this type of instrument may be used amongst other library populations. Future work will seek to confirm the construct validity and test-retest properties of the finalized scale as stipulated in the criteria above so that differences between different sub-groups defined by factors such as age, role and gender can be examined in greater detail. Further studies that contrast different roles will list a wider choice of specific categories so that the selection of ‘Other’ is minimized and more respondent data can be entered into analyses. Potential relationships between the confirmed library domains and performance indicators such as attendance shall also be investigated.</p>
<p>A limitation of this study may be the ability to generalize the findings to other library operations. The results are based on the recorded perceptions of employees within one public library service. A re-organization had taken place six months prior to the study which had involved a large-scale redundancy programme. Additionally, a new, integrated library management system, which automated many traditional library functions, had been recently introduced. Factors such as these may have influenced the data unduly.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, these findings present an up-to-date and more comprehensive range of elements associated with health and wellness in library work than has been documented to date. They add an extra dimension to current literature by establishing the prevalence and magnitude of aspects of library work that may be associated with performance and attendance indicators. Additionally, these results put into perspective earlier claims on stress and burnout and appear to suggest that these conditions are not as widespread as some authors have suggested previously. The results also offer a response to the main criticisms of earlier studies; the study is a sizeable, evidence-based study of people working in UK public libraries which establishes and ranks variables using a methodical, quantitative approach. It is hoped that these initial findings will provide the basis for more research into the general health and performance of library personnel and any differences in well-being between them that will benefit both the employers and the workers themselves.</p>
