<abstract>
<p>A large animal (sheep) model was used to compare nerve axon regeneration and return of muscle function after a median-to-ulnar nerve end-to-side neurorrhaphy technique with conventional, clinically established, methods of nerve repair and untreated controls. Three groups of sheep were allocated to end-to-side repair (12 animals), a conventional method of nerve repair (18 animals), or a control group (eight animals). After a year nerve repairs were assessed electrophysiologically and histologically, and the muscles supplied by the repaired nerves were assessed physiologically. There were no significant differences in the outcomes of nerve repair between different conventional techniques. Half of the end-to-side nerve repairs supported nerve regeneration. The functional outcomes of the end-to-side repairs were inferior to conventional techniques which were, in turn, inferior to controls. End-to-side neurorrhaphy supported nerve regeneration, but the reliability of this technique is called into question and its use as a clinical tool can only be recommended as a salvage procedure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many injuries caused by laceration of a nerve can be repaired by direct suture. High-energy traction injuries and high-velocity missiles often cause loss of a length of nerve. Although in some circumstances flexion and immobilization of a joint in order to achieve end-to-end nerve repair rather than nerve grafting may be acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1753193412445119">Oberlin and Rantissi, 2011</xref>), such injuries usually require repair with nerve grafts or nerve transfers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1753193412445119">O’Shea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1753193412445119">Scholz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1753193412445119">Sulaiman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1753193412445119">Tung and Mackinnon, 2010</xref>). End-to-side nerve repair of peripheral nerves has been suggested to have clinical potential in situations in which the proximal segment of a severed nerve is not available or where the gap to be bridged by a nerve graft is large; it is, however, controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412445119">Battison et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412445119">Carlstedt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412445119">Divali and Myckatyn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1753193412445119">Millesi and Schmidhammer, 2007</xref>). The use of end-to-side nerve repair is best suited to situations where the nerve roots have been avulsed from the spinal cord or where there has been severe tissue loss and contusion. The technique involves suturing the distal stumps of the injured nerve side-on to an epineurial window fashioned in an appropriate, adjacent intact nerve. It is suggested that reinnervation of the distal segment by laterally emerging pioneering axons from the intact ‘donor’ nerve may occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1753193412445119">Viterbo et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>End-to-side nerve repair is not a new idea and dates back to the 1900s when, in cases of facial palsy, the distal stump of the facial nerve was implanted into the spinal accessory nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412445119">Ballance and Ballance, 1903</xref>). Some return of facial animation was demonstrated. Viterbo, who performed his first set of end-to-side experiments on a rat model revived the concept of end-to-side peripheral nerve coaptation in 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1753193412445119">Viterbo et al., 1992</xref>). He reported using electrophysiological testing, muscle morphometry, and histological examination of sections of the repaired nerve to show that axonal regeneration could be detected at the distal end of a transected facial nerve after end-to-side neurorrhaphy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1753193412445119">Viterbo et al., 1993</xref>). He went on to demonstrate in rats successful motor axonal regeneration using the same tests as above, with end-to-side neurorrhaphy of the distal end of the peroneal nerve to the side of the tibial nerve through an epineurial window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1753193412445119">Viterbo et al., 1994a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1753193412445119">b</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequently, numerous end-to-side nerve repair studies in other small animals (rats and rabbits) have been shown to support nerve regeneration to various degrees. The suggested mechanisms are either terminal sprouting from damaged donor axons injured during epineurotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412445119">Hayashi et al., 2008</xref>) or collateral sprouting from the donor nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412445119">Bontioti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753193412445119">Lundborg et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1753193412445119">Tham and Morrison, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1753193412445119">Tiangco et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1753193412445119">Viterbo et al., 1992</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1753193412445119">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1753193412445119">Zhang et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1753193412445119">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). There has been concern that, due to the relatively short distances from the nerve transection to neurorrhaphy sites in many of these studies, these mostly good results could be due to contamination of regenerating axons from the proximal stump of the severed nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412445119">Al-Qattan and Al-Thunayan 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753193412445119">McCallister et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Since Viterbo’s first experiments in the early 1990s, there has been marked interest in the field. Much research has looked at ways of refining the technique in an attempt to try and improve results.</p>
<p>Studies using the end-to-side technique for digital nerve repair have been successful in allowing return of sensation to the injured side of the digit and reducing the risk of digital neuroma. Sensory recovery has been observed at grade S3+ in a paper that collated a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412445119">Artiaco et al., 2010</xref>), whilst another showed inconsistent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753193412445119">Landwehrs 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Different ‘bridge’ techniques have been recently described where the proximal and distal stumps of the cut nerve are attached to an intact nerve or nerves using an end-to-side technique. These methods use the intact nerve as a bridging scaffold. Several variations of this technique have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412445119">Bontioti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412445119">Eren et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1753193412445119">McCallister et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1753193412445119">Tirelioglu et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Most recent studies of end-to-side neurorrhaphy have used rabbits and shown mostly satisfactory return of upper and lower limb function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1753193412445119">Zhang et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1753193412445119">2006b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1753193412445119">Stamatouhou (2006)</xref> compared end-to-side neurorrhaphy of the musculocutaneous nerve to the phrenic nerve using a standard neurotization technique in rabbits with satisfactory return of limb function.</p>
<p>Other studies have, however, demonstrated poor physiological function of reinnervated limb muscles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412445119">Jaberi et al. (2003)</xref> divided the peroneal nerve and sutured it end-to-side to the tibial nerve via an epineurial window in two groups of rabbits. In the second group, the distal stump of the peroneal nerve was allowed to degenerate before end-to-side attachment, so that Schwann cell debris might be removed to provide a clearer passage for regenerating axons. The results showed no recovery of useful limb function in either group, probably as a result of axon and fibre counts being too low. On the other hand, studies in rats have shown that using predegenerated nerve grafts may offer some advantage over fresh nerve grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193412445119">Kerns et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>End-to-side nerve repair has been used clinically in a few patients with inconsistent results. In facial paralysis the end-to-side technique has been successfully used with acceptable return of function to the facial muscles in clinical subjects. The hypoglossal nerve has been used as the donor nerve. Cross-facial end-to-side neurorrhaphy techniques have been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1753193412445119">Yoleri et al. (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412445119">Frey et al. (2006)</xref>. Some clinical trials that used peripheral nerves at a number of sites produced results that showed an acceptable return of function and sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753193412445119">May et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1753193412445119">Mennen et al., 1999</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1753193412445119">2003</xref>), while others have been less successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412445119">Bertelli and Ghizoni, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a need to perform similar studies in larger animals, as the calibre of their nerves and metabolic rate more closely resemble those of humans. Small animals can compensate more easily for a degree of loss of limb function than humans, and small animal models have short regeneration distances and small target end organs. For these reasons the animal chosen was the sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412445119">Glasby et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study we aimed to assess the physiological and morphological aspects of nerve regeneration after end-to-side repair of the median nerve to the ulnar nerve compared with conventional methods of nerve repair and controls assessing similar indices of nerve structure and function.</p>

<title>Animal model</title>
<p>Thirty-eight Scottish Blackface sheep of similar age and weight were segregated into two groups. Twelve underwent end-to-side coaptation of the median nerve to the adjacent ulnar nerve and 18 sheep underwent conventional methods of repair of the median nerve. The remaining eight sheep underwent no procedure and represented the normal or control group. Having performed a power calculation before the study, we had initially decided to allocate 12 animals to each group. However, half-way through the experiments there was an unexpected problem with supply of the animals. Therefore, the remaining animals were divided among the conventional repair and control groups, which fortunately left sufficient sheep for a statistically meaningful result.</p>

<sec id="section4-1753193412445119">
<title>Surgical technique</title>
<p>General anaesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412445119">Fullarton et al., 2002</xref>) was induced in each animal and physiological variables recorded. In an operating theatre under sterile conditions, the animals were placed supine and the right forelimb was extended and secured in a gutter-type armrest using sleek tape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412445119">Glasby, 2005</xref>). The left forelimb was left unoperated.</p>
<p>The skin was incised transversely (i.e., craniocaudally) at right angles to the lower border of pectoralis major of the right forelimb of the sheep. Median and ulnar nerves were identified using a nerve stimulator. Sharp transection of the median nerve was carried out using a Meyer neurotome. The proximal end of the nerve was buried in adjacent muscle. Using a small Meyer neurotome, an oval window was fashioned in the epineurium of the intact ulnar nerve. Care was taken not to damage the underlying perineurium. The epineurium of the cut distal end of the median nerve was then sutured without tension onto that of the donor ulnar nerve at the periphery of the window using 10-0 nylon interrupted sutures (Ethicon, UK) and a microscope to aid vision.</p>
<p>Eighteen sheep underwent conventional methods of nerve repair. Six sheep underwent direct end-to-end nerve suture of the epineurium of the divided median nerve with 10-0 nylon interrupted sutures (Ethicon). Six sheep underwent an entubulation repair with a 5 x 3 cm section of a biodegradable (controlled-release) glass fabric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412445119">Glasby, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753193412445119">Jeans et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1753193412445119">Starritt et al., 2011</xref>). The two cut ends of the nerve were placed apposed in the centre of the rectangle with the long axis of the nerve parallel to the long side of the rectangle. Glass polymer glue was placed on one of the edges of the fabric, and the other edge was then folded over the cut nerve ends and stuck down onto the edge containing the glue. The glass polymer glue is made up of the same components as the glass fabric. Finger pressure was used to hold the wrap in place for a few seconds to allow the edges of the fabric wrap to adhere together. A blob of fibrin glue (Tisseel, thrombin powder and calcium chloride solution; Immuno AG, Vienna, Austria) was placed at each end of the wrap tube to secure the ends of the nerve in place. Care was taken to ensure no polymer or fibrin glue leaked into the nerve transection/regeneration site.</p>
<p>The final six sheep underwent autologous nerve grafting. A 1 cm section the median nerve was excised and rotated 180° in the long axis to create a difference in the pattern of the fascicles and sutured back into place using 10-0 nylon sutures, as above.</p>
<p>All wounds were closed using a continuous absorbable suture, 3-0 Vicryl (Ethicon), and the animals recovered for 24 hours in separate pens, after which they were allowed back to the open field. They were checked at regular intervals, looking particularly for signs of difficulty walking and wound infection.</p>
<p>At 1 year after these surgical procedures all animals were assessed, including the normal controls. In accordance with the terms of the licence, the second operation was a terminal procedure (Home Office [HMSO] 1986). The experimental groups were compared with each other and with the normal control group by means of electrophysiological testing (maximum conduction velocity), muscle physiology (isometric twitch and tetanic tensions), and morphometric analysis.</p>

<title>Methods of assessment of muscle function</title>
<p><italic>Isometric twitch and tetanic tension:</italic> Although not used in clinical practice as these tests require direct surgical access to the reinnervated muscle or even their removal for study; in the laboratory they may be the most informative. The value of these tests to the clinician is that they allow the setting of absolute standards and to define practices that may be expected to improve outcome in the clinic.</p>
<p>The FCR in the sheep is innervated almost exclusively by the median nerve. The ulnar nerve innervates the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU). In all groups twitch tension measurements were recorded from the FCR muscles, and also from the FCU muscles in the end-to-side and control groups to assess any potential damage to the donor ulnar nerve. The electronic equipment needed to assess the contractile properties of the FCR muscle included a signal generator, stimulus isolator, force transducer, and oscilloscope.</p>
<p>The forelimb was immobilized rigidly while muscle twitch recordings were made. The FCR muscle was exposed in the forearm. Its tendon was divided and an inextensible linen thread tied to the distal end, which was attached to a force transducer (#52-9503, Harvard Instruments, Edenbridge, UK). Resting muscle length was measured. Using the extensible arm of the stand, the muscle was extended to 120% of resting length, as this has been shown to optimize isometric contraction when the nerve is stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412445119">Close 1972a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412445119">1972b</xref>). The median nerve was stimulated proximal to the site of nerve repair, and twitch and tetanic tensions were measured. After the completion of the electrophysiology recordings, the FCR and FCU muscles were removed and weighed on a scale.</p>
<p><italic>Morphometry:</italic> In the normal groups of animals, a 2 cm length of nerve was removed. In the end-to-side group, a similar section was taken from both the ulnar and median nerves distal to the neurorrhaphy site as close to the target muscle as possible. Specimens of nerve tissue were processed using a standard method similar to that described by Miko and Gschmeissner in 1994 to produce Araldite resin-embedded sections. Semi-thin (1 µm) sections were cut for light microscopy using an ultra-microtome with glass knives. Toluidine blue was used to counter-stain those tissues other than the osmicated myelin.</p>
<p>Morphometric analysis was carried out on the 1 μm nerve sections using a computerized image analysis system (Analytical Imaging Station (AIS), version 3.0; Imaging Research Inc., St. Catherines, Ontario, Canada) connected to a compound microscope and images recorded.</p>
<p>Fibre and axon diameters were measured across the minor axes of elliptical profiles to avoid bias arising from sections cut obliquely. In total, 200 nerve fibres were measured in each nerve section to give a representative sample large enough to eliminate random variation on different parts of the section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753193412445119">Mayhew et al., 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All results underwent statistical testing with the aid of a statistics software package for PC (Statistica, version 9; Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA). Outliers for each data set were identified and rejected by plotting half normal curves with 95% confidence ellipses. Normal probability plots for these corrected data sets were plotted to determine whether or not the data were normally distributed. In order to test for the presence of differences in normally distributed data, the <italic>F</italic>-test was applied in the form of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). For nonparametrically distributed data the Kruskal–Wallis test was applied.</p>
<p>In order to find where the differences lay, it was necessary to perform post-hoc tests to compare the means of these independent groups of data. ANOVA disclosed multiple differences, so to reduce the risk of type 1 error that would have occurred using the Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, the more conservative Scheffé’s test was used. For nonparametrically distributed data, the Mann–Whitney U test was used.</p>
<p>The statistical power of the post-hoc tests, where significant differences between variables had been found, was also calculated to establish whether the sample sizes used for the experimental groups were adequate.</p>

<p>For about half (5) of end-to-side repairs, no recordable measurements could be obtained during the above tests, demonstrating that no regeneration at the end-to-side repair site had occurred. However, in the remaining seven animals, recordable measurements could be obtained for the variables assessed.</p>

<title>Conventional repair groups</title>
<p>There were no significant differences in the measured variables between the end-to-end, graft and glass wrap repair groups, except for myelin thickness and fibre diameters. Due to a technical error during the fixation process in three out of the six specimens in the graft group from a faulty batch of Araldite, these diameters became impossible to measure, therefore reducing the group size for this particular variable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412445119">Table 1</xref>). The measured variables for each of these groups were all statistically inferior to those measured for the normal control group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>All experimental groups showed levels of nerve regeneration inferior to those seen in normal nerves; this is to be expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412445119">Cragg and Thomas, 1961</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412445119">1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753193412445119">Lawson and Glasby, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>There were no statistical differences in the majority of compared variables between the three conventional repair groups. We know that <italic>CV<sub>max</sub></italic> correlates with nerve function, and this variable was similar between the groups, along with wet muscle weights, and muscle twitch and tetanic tensions. Results from the glass wrap and nerve graft group compared similarly to those of the end-to-end repairs. These results compared to those found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753193412445119">Jeans (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1753193412445119">Starritt (2011)</xref> who performed similar experiments, comparing end-to-end and glass wrap repair in peripheral nerves. The nerve grafts performed similarly to the other two groups in electrophysiological and morphometric testing. Our nerve graft length was short (1 cm), and it is known that, generally, nerve grafting is inferior to direct end-to-end repair and the longer the graft, the less effective nerve regeneration becomes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the histological measurements could not be accurately compared because of loss of some of these from the graft group, which introduced statistical error. From the measurements we do have from this group, there is a general trend for these to be reduced compared with the end-to-end and glass wrap repairs, which is perhaps to be expected.</p>
<p>The end-to-side repairs in which regeneration occurred exhibited a variable degree of nerve function that was inferior to the other experimental groups. Nevertheless, in these animals the level of regeneration attained supported a level of nerve function that may be clinically acceptable after serious injury.</p>
<p>Results of the twitch and tetanic tension studies showed that there were no significant differences in the forces produced when the conventional repair groups were compared with the end-to-side group. After nerve repair it is known that motor unit remodelling takes place in target muscles and may compensate, in both cases, for the numerical loss of motor axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412445119">Gordon and Stein, 1982</xref>). This may account for the similar power achieved by these two cohorts notwithstanding the likelihood that fewer pioneering axons made distal connections in the end-to-side group.</p>
<p>Even though the masses of the muscles of the experimental groups were significantly smaller than those of the normal groups, values for the twitch and tetanic forces were no different in the experimental and normal groups. The mass of a muscle does not always correlate with force of contraction or function of that muscle. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412445119">Gilmour (1990)</xref> showed that after nerve transection and repair fast twitch muscles in rats regain only up to 65% of normal muscle mass, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193412445119">Grieve et al. (1991)</xref> showed a recovery of 85% of the contralateral control fast twitch extensor digitorum longus muscle weight in the adult rat when the transected nerve was repaired. Fast muscles such as the FCR are permanently affected by nerve injury, whereas slow muscles can make a complete recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193412445119">Jaweed et al., 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>The histological results reflected those of the neurophysiological quantities that were measured with indices of nerve function following the downward progression: controls → conventional repair → end-to-side repair.</p>
<p>During the process of making the epineurial window in the donor nerve for the end-to-side neurorrhaphy, there is potential for damage to the axons of the donor nerve. As there was no significant difference in <italic>CV<sub>max</sub></italic>, this seems unlikely to significantly affect donor nerve function.</p>
<p>The axon and fibre diameters of the donor ulnar nerves were significantly smaller when the end-to-side group was compared with normal nerves, with values occupying a wider distribution of fibre sizes. This indicates that there may have been unavoidable micro-injury to some of the axons of the donor ulnar nerves. Deliberate axotomy has been used by surgeons to induce or enhance axonal growth after nerve repair, and it is even thought that end-to-side nerve repair may not provide functioning motor axons if axotomy does not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412445119">Brenner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412445119">Hayashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1753193412445119">Tung and Mackinnon, 2010</xref>). In this study we attempted to avoid damage to the donor nerve axons.</p>
<p>Despite there being no obvious end-to-side neurorrhaphy studies that have been performed on larger animals and in only a handful of clinical cases with inconsistent results, end-to-side neurorrhaphy is currently in use in clinical practice. The present study provides some useful information on a gap in the experimental work that has been done on this controversial nerve repair technique. This study clearly shows that end-to-side neurorrhaphy of a cut nerve does not consistently give rise to useful return of contractile function of the muscles that the nerve supplies.</p>
<p>Our data support the conclusion that collateral sprouting of donor nerves may be possible after end-to-side neurorrhaphy through an epineural window. The number of nerve fibres in half of the recipient nerves was sufficient to provide some functional recovery in the target organs. It is likely that terminal sprouting from injured donor ulnar axons contributed to the nerve regeneration that occurred at the end-to-side sites. MacKinnon has stated that without axonal injury there will be no motor axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1753193412445119">Tung and Mackinnon, 2010</xref>). We know from the results here that axons from FCU muscles were likely to have been damaged but not significantly enough, it seems, to have affected the contractile properties of these muscles overall. Effectively, we may have been performing a partial nerve transfer, and failure to injure the donor axons may be why axonal regeneration in half of our end-to-side repairs did not occur. Even if end-to-side nerve repair requires some injury to the donor nerve axons, this is still a feasible technique if it enables a denervated muscle to regenerate without significantly damaging the donor muscle.</p>
<p>Exciting new developments in neurobiology are likely to continue to improve outcomes of nerve repair. The role of enhancing nerve axon regeneration at the sites of repair with the delivery of neurotropic and neurotrophic factors has been well documented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1753193412445119">Pfister et al., 2007</xref>), whilst protecting neuronal cells from degenerating after peripheral nerve injury is also important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1753193412445119">Terenghi et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Further to this, with the recent advances in gene therapy, it may soon be possible to selectively and locally express and regulate neurotrophic factors at the site of nerve repair or reconstruction using viral vectors to enhance and direct nerve axon regeneration. It may also be possible that the expression of myotrophic factors in this way may help prevent muscle atrophy in cases where the nerve regeneration distance is long, such as in proximal lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193412445119">Hoyng et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Retrograde labelling techniques (as have been used in some smaller animal studies to look for evidence of true collateral sprouting from the Nodes of Ranvier), were not available for this study; in any case, horseradish peroxidase is fatally toxic to sheep.</p>
<p>The lack of results for the histology for three specimens from the graft group of the conventional repairs effectively reduced the group size for this variable. This introduced a source of error during the statistical analysis process of comparing axon and fibre diameters for the three groups of conventional repairs. The myelin sheath thicknesses and G ratios were computed from the axon and fibre diameter values. With hindsight, the three axon and fibre counts from the graft group should perhaps have been discarded and not included in the combined conventional repair group.</p>
<p>The validity of the conventional repair group still stands, as the idea of comparing end-to-side nerve repair and regeneration to that which may be achieved from any other method of nerve repair already in clinical practice is the objective of these experiments. It should also be remembered that in every other assessment performed on the nerve repairs from the three conventional methods of nerve repair, results from each group were comparable. A further control group of neurotmesis with no repair should have been included in this study in order to look for spontaneous nerve regeneration and complete the results set. Unfortunately, resources were not available for such a group at the time of the study.</p>
<p>In the present study, end-to-side nerve repair has been used in a model of severe peripheral nerve injury and compared with conventional methods of nerve repair. In reality, the end-to-side technique would be unlikely to be considered in situations where conventional repair is possible. Hitherto, clinical use of this procedure has not been based upon a foundation of experimental investigation in a large animal model, and it was to fill that gap that the present experiments were undertaken. A level of recovery was achieved that, while significantly short of conventional methods, might be considered in extremis to offer an appropriate treatment. This, therefore, lends some weight to the philosophy of its clinical use.</p>
