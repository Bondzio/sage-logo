<abstract>
<p>Patients with advanced cancer experience multiple demands and losses that place them at risk for experiencing psychological distress. Researchers can face challenges in conducting research among this population because of their poor levels of physical and cognitive functioning. This paper aims to develop our understanding of these challenges. A systematic literature review was conducted of papers describing surveys in which a stated aim was to measure rates of psychological distress or psychiatric morbidity among patients with advanced cancer. We also included papers that focused on the development of assessment tools. Studies were identified through computerized (MEDLINE and PsycINFO) and manual searches for the years 1995–2009. Twenty-eight papers met the inclusion criteria. They describe findings in relation to a total of 3942 patients. The sample sizes ranged from 25 to 422 (median = 87). The main methodological challenge identified is the recruitment of large and representative samples. Significant portions of the advanced cancer population are excluded from distress studies or are refusing to take part. In conclusion, researchers can enhance the methodological knowledge base by presenting more detailed accounts of the participant recruitment and data collection processes. Future researchers should strive to develop more flexible methods of assessing distress among patients with advanced disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patients with advanced cancer experience multiple demands as their disease progresses. These include fatigue, pain, loss of mobility, increasing dependence on caregivers and cognitive impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311399663">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311399663">3</xref></sup> Such demands in turn place patients at risk for experiencing severe levels of psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311399663">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311399663">5</xref></sup> For example, depression rates among patients with advanced cancer have been reported to range between 23% and 58%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311399663">5</xref></sup> In view of such rates, it is widely accepted in the cancer and palliative care literature that patient psychological well-being is of major research importance. However, the very conditions that place patients at risk for emotional suffering also pose serious challenges to researchers in the recruitment of study participants and in the data collection process. In a review paper on depression in advanced disease, Hotopf et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311399663">6</xref></sup> conclude that the overall quality of the available research is poor, with small sample sizes and high rates of non-participation. Hence, a key part of improving the evidence base in this area is the development of more effective approaches to addressing methodological challenges.</p>
<p>The question of the methodological challenges in research among patients with advanced disease has attracted a considerable degree of attention in the literature, especially in the field of palliative care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311399663">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311399663">10</xref></sup> Much of the literature here is pitched at a general level in terms of research design. The only type of study design to feature prominently in the literature is the randomized controlled trial (RCT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311399663">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311399663">15</xref></sup> While some of the challenges addressed in the RCT literature do apply to mental health research (e.g. problems in defining and recruiting the study population), some of the key challenges for RCTs (e.g. randomization and participant attrition) are not relevant to cross-sectional mental health surveys or validation studies of screening tools for psychological distress. A key objective in both mental health surveys and validation studies is to provide accurate estimations of levels of the outcome of interest (e.g. psychological distress or psychiatric morbidity) in the study population. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there have been no detailed discussions or systematic reviews of the specific challenges that researchers face in conducting mental health surveys or validation studies among patients with advanced disease. The present paper aims to address this gap in the literature.</p>
<p>This paper addresses two key questions. What can we learn about research challenges from the existing body of research on psychological well-being among patients with advanced cancer? In what ways could future authors contribute more effectively to the methodological knowledge base in this area? Since the amount and quality of methodological information that can be gleaned from the literature ultimately depends on the reporting of these details, this review is guided by the relevant reporting standards. These include the American Psychological Association’s <italic>Journal Article Reporting Standards</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311399663">16</xref></sup> the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311399663">17</xref></sup> the STARD (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy) statement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311399663">18</xref></sup> and specific guidelines for survey research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311399663">19</xref></sup> These reporting guidelines provide checklists and tables that authors can use to ensure that all relevant information is reported in empirical studies. The present paper focuses on reporting in relation to the participant recruitment and data collection phases.</p>

<sec id="section2-0269216311399663" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies of psychiatric morbidity or psychological distress among patients with advanced cancer. The material included in the review was identified primarily through a combined computerized search of the PsycINFO and MEDLINE databases. The search was confined to English-language studies in the 15-year period from January 1995 to December 2009. The search terms were ‘cancer’ or ‘oncol*’ and ‘distress’ or ‘depressi*’ or ‘psychiatr*’ and ‘advanced’ or ‘terminal*’ or ‘palliati*’. Additional papers were identified through manual searches of the reference lists of relevant papers and of the following journals for the period in question: <italic>Cancer</italic>, <italic>The European Journal of Cancer Care</italic>, <italic>The Journal of Pain and Symptom Management</italic>, <italic>Palliative and Supportive Care</italic>, <italic>Palliative Medicine</italic>, <italic>Psycho-Oncology</italic>, and <italic>Supportive Care in Cancer</italic>.</p>
<p>The review includes empirical studies of psychological distress or psychiatric morbidity among adults with advanced cancer. The specific inclusion criteria were as follows.</p>
<list id="list1-0269216311399663" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Objective</italic> – the stated aim of the study must be either: (a) to determine rates of psychological distress or psychiatric morbidity among patients with advanced cancer; or (b) to examine the validity of one or more measures of psychological distress or psychiatric morbidity among this population. Studies where the main focus was on the correlates of distress or psychiatric morbidity were excluded.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Sample</italic> – the sample must comprise adults with advanced cancer. At least 90% of them must be cancer patients at a disease stage that is described as ‘advanced’, ‘terminal’ or ‘palliative’. Where it is clear that findings from samples that overlap partially or fully have been reported in more than one paper, we included either (a) the paper with the largest dataset or (b) the paper where the focus is most explicitly on prevalence rates (versus the validation of instruments).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Methods</italic> – the study must use a survey design with face-to-face data collection (through self-report instruments or interviews) from the patients themselves (not caregivers or health professionals). Studies based on data from medical records were excluded, as were studies where the samples were recruited as part of evaluation studies or RCTs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Publication type</italic> – the review is confined to journal papers reporting empirical studies. Brief reports were included as long as they had a Method section. Correspondences and reviews were excluded.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The electronic search identified 1137 records, of which 22 were duplicates. An additional 14 potentially eligible papers were identified in the manual search. Out of a total of 1129 potentially eligible papers, 28 (2.5%) met the review inclusion criteria (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269216311399663">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>All of the papers included in the review were examined in relation to the following: (a) definitions of the study population; (b) study inclusion and exclusion criteria; (c) sample recruitment methods; (d) data collection methods; and (e) the discussion of methodological issues. Details from the papers were coded where necessary and entered into an SPSS software (Version 15) data file.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 28 studies included in the review, there were 17 prevalence studies, 10 validation studies and one study that examined both prevalence rates and the validity of a screening tool. Over half (<italic>n</italic> = 16, 57%) of the studies were conducted in Europe, with the UK being the most represented country (<italic>n</italic> = 10, 36%). The remaining studies were conducted in the US (<italic>n</italic> = 4, 14%), Canada (<italic>n</italic> = 3, 11%), Japan (<italic>n</italic> = 3, 11%) and Australia (<italic>n</italic> = 2, 7%).</p>
<sec id="section4-0269216311399663">
<title>Defining the study populations</title>
<p>A broad range of terms and criteria were used to define the study populations. These related to five factors: (a) staging; (b) metastases; (c) curability; (d) treatment; and (e) prognosis. The terms ‘advanced’ (<italic>n</italic> = 7, 25%), ‘terminal’ (<italic>n</italic> = 7, 25%) and ‘palliative’ (<italic>n</italic> = 7, 25%) were the most widely used general descriptions of study samples. However, it is worth noting that 22 (79%) of the studies described their samples as ‘palliative’. Three studies (11%) defined their samples in terms of ‘incurability’ and another three in terms of ‘metastatic’ disease. One study (3.6%) described its sample as ‘late-stage’ cancer, which was defined as a prognosis of 6–12 months. Specific descriptions of staging (e.g. stages IIIA to IV in the TNM [Tumour, Node, Metastasis] staging system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311399663">20</xref></sup>) were only used in studies of single cancer sites, such as non-small cell lung cancer or breast cancer.</p>
<p>Eight studies defined their samples in terms of prognosis. The most widely used prognosis for including patients is less than six months. One study included patients with a prognosis of 6–12 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311399663">21</xref></sup> and another study included patients with a prognosis of greater than three months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311399663">22</xref></sup> Three studies (11%) explicitly excluded patients with a prognosis of less than one week (all of which had the same lead author – M Lloyd-Williams).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311399663">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311399663">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two key variables that can be used to describe populations of patients with advanced disease are performance status (a general indicator of physical well-being) and survival rates. Three different performance status scales were used in the studies reviewed: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)/Zubrod/World Health Organization (WHO) (<italic>n</italic> = 9), Karnofsky (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and the Palliative Performance Scale (<italic>n</italic> = 1), which is an extension of Karnofsky.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311399663">26</xref></sup> The ECOG or Zubrod performance scale (which has been adopted by the WHO) uses a five-point scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311399663">27</xref></sup> Scores on the Karnofsky Performance Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216311399663">28</xref></sup> range from 0 to 100, but they are comparable with the ECOG/Zubrod scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311399663">20</xref></sup> Less than half (<italic>n</italic> = 13, 46%) of the studies in the review reported details of the performance status of their study sample. In only two of these cases do the authors provide a full breakdown of performance status. In the remaining 11 cases, authors report the mean score for the full sample or collapse different levels of scores. In an additional study performance status was only reported in correlational analyses.</p>
<p>Only nine studies (32%) report some details of survival rates in their full samples. In only two of these cases are survival rates expressed in terms of mean and/or median survival in days for the full sample. Three studies report six-month survival rates and two report the number of participants who had died by the end of the study.</p>

<title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title>
<p>Whereas researchers are to some extent constrained by conventions regarding how they define their study population, they have a significant degree of freedom in specifying study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Hence, there was a considerable degree of variation in the criteria used.</p>
<p>The most common inclusion criterion was the absence of cognitive impairment (<italic>n</italic> = 18, 61%). Only eight of these 18 studies used formal cognitive screening, with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311399663">29</xref></sup> being the most widely (<italic>n</italic> = 6) used tool. However, three different MMSE cut-offs were used (17, 24 and 28). Only one study adopted a special procedure for patients who were cognitively impaired. Minagawa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311399663">30</xref></sup> used an unstructured clinical interview (as opposed to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)) in conjunction with a family interview to assess psychiatric morbidity in cognitively impaired patients.</p>
<p>The next most common criterion (<italic>n</italic> = 13, 46%) in the literature was proficiency in the majority language(s) of the study country: English (<italic>n</italic> = 11, 39%), English or Spanish (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 3.6%) and English or French (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 3.6%). For some studies the ability to communicate in a certain language implicitly excluded persons with speech or hearing difficulties. Four studies (14%) explicitly included absence of communication difficulties as a criterion and an additional two (7%) reported in their results section that patients were excluded because of communication difficulties.</p>
<p>Eleven studies (39%) excluded patients who were considered too weak or ill to complete the research procedure (in two of these studies this was reported in the results section). In six studies this criterion was described in terms of being well enough to complete a 30-minute interview, and an additional study specified the duration was 40 minutes. Surprisingly, only one study operationalized this criterion in terms of performance status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311399663">22</xref></sup> Another study specified that patients had to be ambulatory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311399663">31</xref></sup> Hence, the inclusion of patients in a significant portion of the studies (<italic>n</italic> = 10, 36%) was left to the judgement of healthcare staff.</p>
<p>Other criteria used in the literature included the following: age (<italic>n</italic> = 11, 39%), awareness of one’s diagnosis (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 18%) and the absence of brain metastases (<italic>n</italic> = 4, 14%). Four studies (14%) specified that patients had to be able to give informed consent, and two studies (7%) stated that patients had to be able to self-complete scales unaided. In both of these cases the criteria are related to cognitive impairment and physical status. One study excluded patients with a history of drug abuse or psychosis, while another study ruled out those with a history of depression.</p>

<title>The participant recruitment process</title>
<p>Details of the study populations and participant recruitment process of the studies included in the review are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311399663">Table 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311399663">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311399663">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311399663">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269216311399663">52</xref></sup> For longitudinal studies we examine the recruitment process for Time 1 only.

<p>In the De Walden-Galuszko<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216311399663">38</xref></sup> study the exclusion of patients did not relate to their eligibility but to the unavailability of the psychiatrist to conduct interviews during a vacation.</p>

<p>Just over half of the studies (<italic>n</italic> = 15, 54%) do not provide details of the exclusion of potentially eligible patients. It is of course possible that some of these 15 studies did not exclude any patients at all but, if this is the case, the authors do not make this clear. Response rates in terms of potentially eligible patients (versus completed interviews) are reported or calculable for only 16 (57%) studies. These rates ranged from 5% to 100% and had a median rate of 64.1% (<italic>M</italic> = 60.2, <italic>SD</italic> = 27.8). In six of these cases the response rates were less than 50%. The lowest rate here was for the second largest study in the review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311399663">32</xref></sup> In this study the final sample only represented 5% of the initial sampling frame. Response rates in terms of eligible patients ranged from 22% to 100%, with a median rate of 81.5% (<italic>M</italic> = 76.2, <italic>SD</italic> = 19.5). Refusal rates are reported or calculable for 23 studies (82%). In one study it was not possible to calculate the refusal rate because it was collapsed with figures for patients who were too ill to participate and those who had died.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269216311399663">33</xref></sup> Refusal rates ranged from 0% to 46.6% and had a median of 12.5% (<italic>M</italic> = 14.1, <italic>SD</italic> = 14.0). In a number of the studies the data collection process was embedded in routine clinical practice and so refusal rates here are not comparable with studies where patients had a clear choice regarding whether or not to complete scales or interviews. If we remove studies with refusal rates of zero, then the median rate for the remaining 19 studies rises to 14% (<italic>M</italic> = 17.1, <italic>SD</italic> = 13.7).</p>
<p>An additional rate that is very relevant to populations with advanced disease is the number of patients who begin the study procedure but discontinue due to declining health, difficulty concentrating, pain, lack of energy etc. It is likely that non-completion occurred in many of the studies reviewed; however, only seven studies (25%) give specific details of the number of non-completers.</p>
<p>Only three (10.7%) of the studies included in the review included a diagrammatic representation of the flow of participants through the study. An additional study refers readers to a previous paper, which includes a flow chart.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311399663">32</xref></sup></p>

<p>Details of the data collection process in the studies reviewed are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311399663">Table 2</xref>. Only nine (32%) studies give details of the persons (i.e. professional background) who recruited participants to the study, whereas all but two studies (7%) give details of the persons who collected the data. Sixteen (57%) studies report the timing of data collection. The timing of interviews ranged from the time of initial diagnosis to admission to a hospice. Only one study (3.6%) did not provide details of the setting in which interviews were conducted. Two-thirds of the studies were conducted exclusively in palliative care or hospice settings. The remaining studies were conducted in outpatient or inpatient oncology settings, in patients’ homes or in mixed settings. Of the 27 studies that give details of the number of data collection sites, six (22%) collected data in two or more sites. Thirteen (46%) of the studies collected data at two or more points in time.</p>

Four of these studies used verbal administration for one or more of the self-report tools. It is likely that verbal administration was used in more studies but that details of differential modes of administration were not recorded during data collection.</p>
<p>Only two (7%) studies report the mean length of study interviews. Two additional studies report the maximum interview length. Twenty-one studies (75%) report the length of their data collection phases. In a number of cases only years (not months) are reported, so we had to assume that data were collected throughout the full years. From the final study sample sizes and the duration of studies, we calculated an estimate of the recruitment rate (participants per month) for the 12 studies in which there was only one data collection point. The median recruitment rate here was 10.9 (<italic>M</italic> = 13.2, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.0, range = 7.9–37.3). This rate is slightly inflated by the fact that two of the studies collected data as part of their clinical practice. If we remove these two studies, the median rate for the remaining 10 studies is 10.0 (<italic>M</italic> = 10.9, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.8, range = 7.9–16.6). The highest recruitment rate in cross-sectional studies was obtained in a Canadian multi-institutional study in which data were collected at eight different sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311399663">32</xref></sup></p>

<title>The discussion of methodological issues in the literature</title>
<p>Only 17 (61%) of the studies reviewed included any discussion of methodological issues regarding the sample recruitment or data collection processes. However, in none of these cases are the issues discussed in any detail. While the authors use different terms to describe the methodological issues and challenges they encountered, three inter-related issues emerged: (a) limited representativeness; (b) small sample sizes; and (c) low response rates. Eight of the 17 studies that discuss methodological issues note that the representativeness of their samples may be limited. For example, we noted above that Wilson et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311399663">32</xref></sup> study only recruited 5% of their sampling frame. They report that they only approached patients who were ‘cognitively lucid and medically able to tolerate an extended interview’ (p.125). Other studies note that patients had to be ambulatory or that non-participants had a lower performance status than participants. However, while these methodological challenges are noted, little is offered by way of advice for future researchers to meet these challenges more effectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This literature review aimed to examine the key methodological issues and challenges involved in researching psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity in patients with advanced cancer. A key goal here was to evaluate the methodological knowledge base that is provided by research using a survey or validation study design.</p>
<p>A clear indicator of the extent of the methodological challenges that researchers face in collecting epidemiological or instrument validation data among patients with advanced disease is the very restricted sample sizes that studies have succeeded in recruiting. In terms of the quality of the epidemiological knowledge base provided by this body of literature, the samples are just too small to generalize findings to wider populations with any degree of confidence. The quality of the cumulative data from a lot of small studies is not comparable to that obtained from a small number of large-scale methodologically rigorous studies.</p>
<p>The body of literature that examines levels of distress – or the measurement thereof – in patients with advanced cancer is quite small compared to the literature on the general population of cancer patients. Only 28 studies met the review inclusion criteria and their combined total <italic>N</italic> of 3942 is actually smaller than the sample sizes in a number of individual studies of distress among general (mainly early-stage) cancer populations. Brintzenhofe-Szoc et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269216311399663">53</xref></sup> sample of 8265 cancer outpatients is more than twice the size of the total sample size in the present review. Other examples of large distress studies include Sharpe et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269216311399663">54</xref></sup> consecutive sample of 5613 patients attending an oncology clinic and Zabora et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269216311399663">55</xref></sup> study, which extracted data on 4496 patients from a database. A part of the explanation for the relatively small body of literature on distress among patients with advanced cancer lies in the fact that patients with more advanced disease pose greater challenges to researchers than those at an earlier stage. Before we discuss these challenges, we will examine the issue of defining the advanced cancer population.</p>
<sec id="section10-0269216311399663">
<title>Defining ‘advanced’ cancer</title>
<p>How can researchers define advanced cancer populations in a meaningful way? The term ‘advanced’ cancer in itself has no specific cross-site meaning, but is an umbrella term that is used to distinguish the earlier, more treatable stages of cancer from the later, less treatable ones. The value of the term is its very breadth because other terms, such as ‘incurable’, ‘terminal’, ‘metastatic’ and ‘palliative’, can conceivably exclude patients who have advanced disease.</p>
<p>Curability related terms, such as ‘terminal’, ‘incurable’ and ‘unresectable’, are widely used in the literature. Distinguishing between curable and incurable cancers is important in psychosocial research because of the stressful impact of receiving a terminal diagnosis. However, the criterion of incurability does have drawbacks in studies of patients with diverse types of cancer, as there can be wide divergences in prognoses. It is also possible that a patient could have disease that clinicians consider to be advanced (e.g. a central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma) but that is potentially curable.</p>
<p>The presence of metastases is useful in distinguishing earlier versus later stages within specific types of cancers. However, in research it automatically rules out patients who may have the same levels of disease burden and psychosocial stress but have locally advanced disease (e.g. lung, pancreatic or brain cancer), disease recurrence or a haematological malignancy. In other words, patients with metastatic disease are only a subset of patients with advanced cancer.</p>
<p>Treatment type is used as a criterion mainly in distinguishing patients receiving palliative versus curative care. One of the drawbacks of using palliative treatment as a study inclusion criterion is that patients can have very advanced disease with a poor performance status but be relatively free of pain and other symptoms that would lead to a referral to palliative care services.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only specific criterion that can be used among patients with advanced disease is prognosis. It applies to all types of cancer regardless of site or treatment type. However, as we saw, the most widely used prognosis in the literature reviewed is less than six months. Again, the problem here is that large sections of the population with advanced cancer are excluded. A more inclusive approach would be to recruit patients with a wider range of prognoses and give a full breakdown of distress rates by prognosis.</p>
<p>As we saw, in the literature specific staging systems (e.g. TNM) are used only for studies of single cancer sites. These systems can become problematic where more than one cancer site is involved. For example, a stage IIIB non-small lung cell cancer (NSCLC) will have a different prognosis from a stage IIIB ovarian cancer. In addition, there are between-site variations in stages. Taking the same two examples, ovarian cancer has a stage IIIC, whereas NSCLC does not. Moreover, the TNM system does not apply to haematological malignancies.</p>
<p>If we aim to advance the knowledge base on distress among patients with advanced cancer, the ability to make valid cross-study comparisons is of major importance. Researchers can enhance the comparability of their findings by collecting and reporting data on variables that are comparable across different stages of advanced cancer and types of treatment. Three such variables are performance status, prognosis and survival rates. These variables need to be reported in ways that are comparable. For example, performance status scores collapsed over two or more categories are not comparable, while a full breakdown or mean scores are. A mortality rate expressed as the percentage of participants who died by end of a study is not always comparable. A more useful statistic is the six-month mortality rate. Additional information in relation to specific points in the cancer journey (e.g. time since initial diagnosis or time since end of curative treatment) will also enhance comparability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269216311399663">
<title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title>
<p>In the studies reviewed we noted a significant degree of variation in the inclusion and exclusion criteria used. This variation leads to two related challenges: (a) it restricts the comparability between studies; and (b) it limits the representativeness of their samples. For example, one study could include only patients between the ages of 18 and 70 with no brain metastases, while another study could include all ages and patients with brain metastases. One study could include patients with a MMSE score ≥17, whereas another could use a cut-off of ≥28.</p>
<p>It is likely that some of the variation in study inclusion criteria is due to differing demands from gatekeepers, such as ethical review boards or medical staff and, therefore, it is to some extent beyond the control of researchers. However, if gatekeepers deem a research procedure too burdensome for a particular category of patients, it is up to researchers to devise new ways of reducing this burden or of demonstrating that patients do not experience the level of burden assumed by ethical review boards, clinicians or family members.</p>
<p>The three main groups excluded in the studies reviewed are patients with cognitive impairment, those with low levels of proficiency in the language of the majority population and those who are physically weak or very ill. All three groups pose challenges in terms of the data collection process.</p>
<p>Persons with cognitive impairment may not be able to give informed consent to participate in a study in the first place. In addition, they may have difficulty understanding study instructions, completing scales and recalling experiences in an interview. So a key issue here is the amount or questionable validity of data obtained from persons with cognitive impairment. The only study to tackle this issue at all was Minagawa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311399663">30</xref></sup> As we saw, they used an unstructured patient interview and a family interview to assess psychiatric morbidity in patients with cognitive impairment. Of course, the problem here is that the data from non-impaired patients is not fully comparable with data from impaired ones. However, some data on impaired patients is better than none at all. Future researchers need to develop our understanding of the relationship between cognitive status and the validity of distress assessment. Moreover, a key challenge for future researchers is to devise means of distress assessment that are valid for both cognitively intact and impaired patients.</p>
<p>Persons with low levels of proficiency in the language of a research study may also have difficulties in providing informed consent, understanding instructions, completing scales and responding to interview questions. Here the issue is purely a question of comprehension and the limits on one’s ability to communicate with the researcher. The main rationale for the language criterion in research seems to be in terms of costs and the lack of availability of validated versions of screening tools and interviews in multiple languages. In a culturally diverse population, a researcher may not be able to cater for the linguistic needs of all patients. However, future researchers could increase the representation of minority ethnic and linguistic groups by preparing materials and employing bilingual research assistants for the main non-majority language groups in a particular area.</p>
<p>Patients who are physically weak or very ill constitute a significant portion of the advanced cancer population. The reasons for excluding them from research relate both to the difficulty in collecting valid data from patients who may lack energy, feel drowsy and be highly medicated, and to a sense that it is unfair to burden such patients with the research procedure. Indeed, as the title of one paper on interviewing terminally ill patients puts it: ‘Is it fair to take their time?’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269216311399663">56</xref></sup> However, it is again up to researchers to devise ways of meeting this challenge. For example, research interviews could be spread over multiple short sittings. In addition, patients’ physical status often fluctuates within the same day or over days and researchers (in conjunction with medical staff) could monitor these to establish the optimal time to conduct interviews. In short, collecting data from a very ill population requires a high degree of flexibility on the part of researchers.</p>

<title>The reporting and discussion of methodological issues in the literature</title>
<p>This review found notable gaps and inconsistencies in the reporting of methodological issues in the literature. In relation to the participant recruitment process, details of the sampling frame and the reasons for exclusion of patients from studies were under-reported. These details are essential to understanding the extent to which samples represent the wider population of patients with advanced cancer and to identifying the groups who are under-represented or absent in the literature. In addition, authors should provide full details of response, refusal and non-completion rates and how they have been calculated. Detailed information is necessary because of the differing approaches to calculating such rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269216311399663">57</xref></sup> A useful way to communicate this information is in a flow chart. Reporting guidelines – such as the STROBE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311399663">17</xref></sup> guidelines and the STARD statement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311399663">18</xref></sup> – recommend the use of such charts.</p>
<p>In relation to the data collection process, key methodological details often go unreported in the literature. These details include the starting and ending dates of data collection, the professional background of the person who initially approaches prospective participants, descriptive statistics on the length of study interviews and details of the mode of administration of self-report instruments. Each of these types of information can be useful to researchers.</p>
<p>Accurate details on the length of data collection phases can provide useful information on the recruitment rates in studies. For the cross-sectional studies reviewed, we made a rough calculation of recruitment rates and found that the mean score was approximately 11 participants per month with a range of 8–17. Such information can help researchers in writing proposals, and costing and planning studies. More detailed reporting on the data collection process (e.g. the number of interviewers and the mean number of hours dedicated to interviewing per week) would allow us to provide more accurate analyses of recruitment rates, which in turn would enhance our understanding of the factors that facilitate and impede the recruitment process.</p>
<p>It is likely that response rates (and, therefore, study sample sizes) will vary according to the background of recruiters in studies. Potential participants and their gatekeepers may be more likely to feel participation in research is valuable and safe if approached by a person involved in their medical care than an unknown researcher. Again, more complete reporting here would allow us to examine this issue empirically.</p>
<p>The length of study interviews is a crucial issue in patients with advanced disease, but one that has been largely ignored in the studies reviewed. One study of patients’ views regarding research participation found that most felt that interviews should last between 30 and 45 minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269216311399663">58</xref></sup> It is likely that some of the studies that used clinical interviews lasted longer than 45 minutes, but this information is not reported. With a view to maximizing sample sizes in patients with advanced disease, more information here would allow us to examine whether there is an association between response rates or interview completion rates and their duration. One of the first questions a prospective participant will ask is ‘How long does it take?’ The answer will have an important bearing on their decision to take part or not.</p>
<p>The question of the mode of administration of self-report scales and its potential effect on responses has been largely overlooked in the wider distress literature. There are a range of situations in which patients with advanced disease will not be able to self-complete scales (e.g. weakness in limbs, having their writing hand connected to a drip, being unable to sit up or poor eyesight). In these cases researchers may be obliged to verbally administer scales – such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269216311399663">59</xref></sup> – which have been designed for self-administration. These differing modes of administration may have an impact on the data obtained (see, for example, Weinberger et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269216311399663">60</xref></sup>). Responding verbally to scales may result in a ‘white coat’ effect where patients minimize their distress. Here researchers are faced with devising strategies for facilitating self-administration or giving a full breakdown of scores by mode of administration. In relation to the former, for example, Urch et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269216311399663">61</xref></sup> enlarged the HADS to an 18-point font size.</p>

<title>Review limitations</title>
<p>The inclusion criteria in this review were quite strict in terms of the dates, language and study types. We included only more recent research (1995–2009), mainly because of the changing landscape of cancer treatment and changing editorial standards in journals. That is, in making cross-study comparisons we wanted the papers to be on a relatively even playing field. It is also possible that our English-language criterion ruled out studies that were methodologically different from those that succeeded in being published in international English-language journals. Our decision to include only prevalence and validation studies excluded a large body of literature that examines distress correlates in advanced cancer patients. Again, our reasoning here was that studies with similar aims were more comparable. If we included any study with a measure of distress, it would have been difficult to determine where we could draw the line between studies in which distress assessment was a key feature from those where it was not.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Researching psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity among patients with advanced cancer plays an important role in improving quality of life among this population. Because this research is inherently challenging, researchers need to maximize opportunities to share any methodological lessons learned through their work. Clear and comprehensive reporting around the participant recruitment and data collection phases will allow us to build up our knowledge base on research challenges. In writing up study findings, researchers should consult reporting guidelines (e.g. Simera et al.;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269216311399663">62</xref></sup> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org">http://www.equator-network.org</ext-link>). In addition, the Discussion section of empirical papers offers authors an opportunity to document methodological challenges encountered in their own work and to offer suggestions to future researchers. Because authors are often faced with restrictive word limits, they should consider complementing data-focused papers with separate methodological papers. They should also take full advantage of the supplemental online archives that some journals offer to authors to store extra material relating to printed papers.</p>
<p>Among the studies reviewed there were relatively few multi-institutional collaborations and not one single international collaboration regarding data collection. Such collaborations could help us to tackle two of the key methodological challenges that emerged in the review: the recruitment of both larger and more representative samples.</p>
<p>A key methodological resource for researchers that we have not mentioned yet is funding. Giving full details on patients excluded from a study, for example, is not only a question of reporting this information in a paper but somebody on the research team has to collect and input data for each of these patients. This is a time-consuming process, as is the development of a flexible strategy around the interviewing of patients when their physical status is optimal. Funders need to be made aware of all the extra work involved beyond the interview process in conducting research among patients with advanced cancer. Again, it is up to researchers to develop a knowledge base here that we can use as leverage in funding applications.</p>
<p>The existing body of knowledge on distress among patients with advanced cancer has been developed mainly by a small group of highly dedicated persons, many of whom are full-time clinicians. If it was not for their hard work, we would have no knowledge base at all to build upon.</p>
