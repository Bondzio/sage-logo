<abstract>
<p>This article presents the contributions of Cora Millet-Robinet to the education of women in their motherly role. Millet-Robinet, a well-noted published scientist of her period, broke many barriers when she became active in the silkworm industry and later became a champion of the education of genteel country women as well as farmers’ wives. This essay focuses on the ways Milllet-Robinet applied the scientific rigour she learned in the laboratory to her childcare manual, the <italic>Conseils aux jeunes femmes sur leur condition et leurs devoirs pendant l’allaitement</italic> (1841). She wanted mothers to be organised, efficient and self-reliant so that they could free themselves from domestic tasks and be able to have time for another kind of work. The cultural importance of Millet-Robinet’s work is begging for our attention, as she helped shape women’s role at home and in the workplace.</p>

<body>
<p>Cora-Elisabeth Millet-Robinet (1796–1892) primarily survives today as a paragraph in a book on scientific women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957155812443190">Creese, 2004</xref>: 75), a couple of lines on the official website of the Académie d’Agriculture de France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957155812443190">Mériaux, 2010</xref>) and a footnote in a feminist anthology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957155812443190">Furst, 1997</xref>). But in truth few women enjoyed the respect and fame that she knew for the better part of her life. Her research on silkworms, her writings on domestic economy, childcare, farm management and the education of women earned her multiple awards throughout six decades – the span of her career as researcher and writer. Although she never received France’s highest honour, the Légion d’Honneur, like her scientific partners, her husband François Millet (1777–1860) and her brother Stéphane Robinet (1794–1870), in 1856 she became the first woman to be elected national correspondent to the Académie Impériale et Centrale d’Agriculture de France. In 1884, another ‘first’ was bestowed upon her: at the age of 90, she became one of the first two women to receive the newly created distinction of Chevalier de l’Ordre du Mérite Agricole for her collective writings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957155812443190">Mérite Agricole, Chronologie, n.d.</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0957155812443190">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cora Millet-Robinet’s research earned her a place among nineteenth-century women scientists. This multi-talented woman made strides in developing the silkworm industry, published a dozen books, which she updated and republished regularly, and became a lifelong advocate of women’s education. She also raised her children and directed the agricultural development of several large estates. She died on 7 December 1890, at the age of 94, after a full professional and personal life. A look back on her work makes it clear that her vision of society rested on the essential role women should play, with wifehood and motherhood not merely a ‘natural’ choice for women, but rather a professional path.</p>
<p>For the past three decades, historians, cultural historians and literary critics have analysed the concept of motherhood from the 1750s to the 1850s, a time period centred on the French Revolution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957155812443190">Evelyne Sullerot (1966)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957155812443190">Yvonne Knibiehler and Catherine Fouquet (1981)</xref> have thoroughly researched and documented the definitions of motherhood and domesticity in France during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957155812443190">Madelyn Gutwright (1992)</xref> demonstrated how the enhancement of the rhetoric of motherhood had a paralysing effect on women of the Revolutionary period, who, barred from political involvement, saw their maternal qualities exalted through the official imagery of political symbols. More recently, in <italic>Rousseau’s Daughters</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957155812443190">Jennifer J. Popiel (2008)</xref> notes that during the years 1762–1833,
<disp-quote>
<p>the power of domestic rhetoric did not have to reside in … anti-feminism, but could equally exist in the world of possibilities that it offered, including full integration into civic life. Within the new ideologies, not only were women valued as unique individuals … but also both women and men were expected to exhibit the same basic qualities of rationality and self-control. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957155812443190">2008</xref>: 179)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The sense of mothers’ self-worth and the full integration of motherhood in domestic and civic life are key to understanding the work of Millet-Robinet.</p>
<p>As historians of motherhood have shown, Millet-Robinet was not alone in placing mothers at the centre of the moral rebirth of post-revolutionary France. Since 1789, various political regimes, from Napoleon to the July Monarchy, had emphasised this new responsibility for women, charging them with the task of producing moral citizens for the nation, as if motherhood were a home-based business. Millet-Robinet championed this belief: one of her favourite quotations was David Lévi-Alvares’ ‘Maternal education is destined to regenerate society’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0957155812443190">2</xref></sup> Accordingly, it is with the publication of her <italic>Conseils aux jeunes femmes sur leur condition et leurs devoirs pendant l’allaitement</italic>, her first manual, that Cora Millet-Robinet first came to the attention of a wide audience of her contemporaries in 1841. An overview of best mothering practices, the <italic>Conseils</italic> came complete with several sections devoted to the moral education of infants, ‘De l’éducation qui commence au berceau’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 161–2), and ‘Réflexions morales’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 240–4). For all the richness of the subject of education found in the <italic>Conseils</italic>, the focus of this essay will not be on the child, but rather on the vision of motherhood articulated in this work. Just as Lévi-Alvares, in Rebecca Rogers’ terms, ‘is mostly associated with developing the vision of the professional mother-educator’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957155812443190">Rogers, 2005</xref>: 93), I will argue that Cora Millet-Robinet expanded Lévi-Alvares’ vision. The <italic>Conseils</italic> delineate the silhouette of a professional mother, her professionalism not being confined to her role of educator in the home-schooling process of her daughters, as Alvarez advocated. Mothers were to approach the wide array of domestic and intellectual tasks they performed with a well-educated mind. In addition to this need for mothers to be educated in many subjects, Millet-Robinet also sought to free women of the time-consuming aspect of their work, coming up with many suggestions for efficiency, implying that motherhood and wifehood should not claim all of women’s time.</p>
<p>This analysis of the professionalism of mothers in the <italic>Conseils</italic> focuses on three dominant themes: experiential learning, science and the scientific method, and above all practical sense elevated to the level of a science. With these principles, Millet-Robinet set out to draw for other mothers what no one had designed for her: a practical and theoretical roadmap of motherhood that would give them the possibility to carve out islands of time they could claim as their own: time to perform other domestic tasks maybe, but also time to conduct experiments with silkworms, write various treatises, take up a cause or simply read.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0957155812443190">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>See one, do one, teach one</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957155812443190">Christina Hardyment (1983)</xref> noted, baby-care manuals proliferated during the nineteenth century, as ‘a new category of authors joined the predictable doctors and armchair philosophers – mothers. The emergence of mothers as writers reflected their new importance, their right to talk about their methods’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957155812443190">Hardyment, 1983</xref>: 37). In the field of infant care, women’s practical experience with children usually compensated for their lack of formal training in medicine; although they did not enjoy the budding scientific authority that physicians jealously guarded, their practical experience gave them another type of authority.</p>
<p>It is difficult to ascertain the educational training Millet-Robinet enjoyed, as nothing is known about her education per se; she never mentions any sort of formal training at school or at home. Fortunately, she had a famous scientist for a brother, so it is possible to induce that she was raised in an educated family with a keen interest in the sciences. It has been speculated that Cora Robinet’s father was the ‘artiste-vétérinaire’ Joseph Robinet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957155812443190">Creese, 2004</xref>: 75).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0957155812443190">4</xref></sup> No information about her mother or other members of the family has been found, except for her older brother, Stéphane Robinet (1796–1869), a prominent chemist and pharmacist. As is evident through both Cora’s and Stéphane’s writings, the two siblings were very close, intellectually and emotionally,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0957155812443190">5</xref></sup> and Stéphane Robinet always encouraged and supported his sister’s endeavours. Examples of such brother–sister relationships where the sister benefited from the brother’s knowledge and education are many, and it is interesting to note that the two siblings seem to have approached the conquest of knowledge in different ways. Whereas Stéphane, a boy, received a formal education in experiment-based science as a chemist, Cora never bemoaned her lack of academic training, while at the same time, her writings are infused with her devotion to the steps of the new-born scientific method – hypothesis, experiment, analysis and reproduction of results. Millet-Robinet learned through observation and experimentation, and though a fierce advocate of women’s education, not a hint of yearning for the formal type of education her brother enjoyed is to be found anywhere in her writings. Cora was a hands-on type of learner, and her writings strangely seem to be a precursor of the modern-day theories of experiential learning of John Dewey or David Kolb. In its most simplified manner, experiential learning is based on a cycle of ‘do and reflect’, rather than one of ‘read about it and reflect’, always favouring the tangible over the abstract.</p>
<p>Personal circumstances and interests drove Cora to take care of children at a young age, when she began to reflect on her experiences with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">Millet-Robinet, 1841</xref>: 5). Later, she raised her four children, gathering more practical knowledge and finding ample opportunity to imagine solutions to the daily tasks of motherhood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0957155812443190">6</xref></sup> In order to share her acquired wisdom, she wrote <italic>Conseils pendant l’allaitement</italic>, and its opening phrases seem to exemplify the theories of experiential learning: ‘Having observed a lot, reflected often, and having thus acquired a certain level of experience, I may have a few useful ideas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 4). Endowed with a ‘sort of instinct for medicine’ she was lucky enough to be surrounded by ‘physicians of remarkable talent’, and ‘listened with avidity’ to the conversations of these men of science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 7). She came to understand the limit of what she could safely transmit to her readers, and she was able to carve out a niche for her books – but it was not to practise the medical arts, in which she had no formal training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 85). When it came to the day-to-day tasks of caring for an infant, however, nothing could replace her experience: speaking about ‘nursing, feeding, dressing, etc., I say what I have done or have seen done by others successfully’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 8). These comments, taken among many other similar ones, make it easy to make a connection between Millet-Robinet’s approaches and experiential learning.</p>
<p>Given the poor state of formal education for women in the nineteenth century, the importance of experience in the works of Millet-Robinet may seem self-evident. Deprived of academic lessons, of intellectual interaction with peers and teachers, an intelligent, motivated and resourceful individual always has the possibility to acquire information through the ‘do and reflect’ process advocated by experiential learning, without any need for an articulated educational theory on the matter. At the same time, though, it is impossible not to identify the thread of the preferred status of experiential learning in Cora Millet-Robinet, long before such theories were articulated.</p>
<p>The new-found authority of mothers in the field of baby-care manuals was not without problems, as all of sudden everyone was an expert, although no mother had a formal education. Hardyment comments that by the dawn of the twentieth century, ‘plagiarists and outright lunatics’ became a main concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957155812443190">1983</xref>: 37). But as we have seen above, Millet-Robinet had been careful from the very beginning to establishing the grounds for her authority in her practical experience rather than medical authority, and she was even more careful when sorting experiences worth printing. In 1847, after the publication of her best-seller, <italic>La Maison rustique des dames</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957155812443190">1846–7</xref>), she commented in the <italic>Journal d’agriculture pratique et de jardinage</italic> that her work was ‘the fruit of her experience, rather than a compilation of what was found in books’ and she vowed to ‘communicate’ to her women readers ‘what my experience [would] teach me’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155812443190">Millet-Robinet, 1847</xref>: 371). In the following column, she remarked that she never included in her books ‘this multitude of useless recipes that are placed in these works only to augment their volume’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155812443190">Millet-Robinet, 1847</xref>: 615–16). More to the point, in the preface of the <italic>Conseils pendant l’allaitement</italic>, she openly admitted that she had relied entirely on her direct experience to write her first book, at the risk of being incomplete:
<disp-quote>
<p>This small treatise will no doubt be incomplete, but I feared exposing myself to adopt other authors’ mistakes while consulting them; I believe it is better to leave holes rather than present methods that are doubtful in my mind. One might accuse me of pride, one would be wrong … I will never agree to say what my judgment would not entirely approve; I’d rather remain silent. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">Millet-Robinet, 1841</xref>: 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Millet-Robinet’s insistence on experience should not be confused with a false modesty behind which she would hide the transgression she committed when she repeatedly published in journals where she was the only female contributor. Although she may have felt pressure to be apologetic<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0957155812443190">7</xref></sup> it is important to understand that when Millet-Robinet spoke of knowledge acquired through experience rather than on the benches of a medical school, she never thought of experiential knowledge as being of a lesser kind, just as she never lamented that her sex barred her from enrolling at university. Her theories on such knowledge are outlined clearly in her <italic>Conseils pendant l’allaitement</italic>, the book that marked the beginning of her long publishing career in the field of education.</p>
<p>First, experiential knowledge was not to be confused with usage or tradition transmitted from generation to generation. In 1884, in a rewritten edition of <italic>Conseils pendant l’allaitement</italic>, published under the new title of <italic>Livre des jeunes mères</italic>, Millet-Robinet presents usage as a negative concept. Discussing the practice of forcing birthing mothers to drink large quantities of herbal tea, she comments:
<disp-quote>
<p>One should only give her something to drink, should she request it. It is not necessary to fill [the new mother] up with herbal tea, as it is too often done, without understanding the ‘why’, but merely because it is customary. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957155812443190">Millet-Robinet and Allix, 1897 [1884]</xref>: 80)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Experience was not repeating what generations had done before unquestioningly; experience implied both observation and reflection as a path to the acquisition of knowledge. New mothers, swamped with unfounded advice, found themselves in a dilemma that Millet-Robinet understood all too well. ‘Common wet-nurses given to prejudices and ignorance’ could not be trusted, nor could ‘maids, almost equally ignorant and devoid of the common affinity between a nurse and her charge’. Millet-Robinet’s language is particularly harsh when she speaks of wet-nurses and home-nurses – older women called upon to sit with new mothers at night.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0957155812443190">8</xref></sup> When a mother had to resort to introducing an outsider into the home, she had to be careful to establish her authority over that of the outsider in no uncertain terms:
<disp-quote>
<p>From the first day the nurse enters the house, you must show her that you will direct your child’s feeding, and not her; you must break without hesitation all her habits, all her false ideas, so that she understands perfectly that it is her milk you bought, not her knowledge; if a mother understands her role properly, a live-in wet-nurse is a milk-machine. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">Millet-Robinet, 1841</xref>: 301)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this light, when a wet-nurse is introduced into the home, the only task the mother surrenders is that of giving the breast, as ‘a mother must act with her child’s wet-nurse as if she breastfed herself; her child does not seek her milk, but he expects her watchfulness, her tenderness, and even her care, which cannot be replaced’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 303). It would be wrong to think that, heiress of the egalitarian principles of the French Revolution as she was, she felt superior to the women she criticised so dreadfully. She hated ignorance and greed, but she was also very conscious of the services that the ‘milk-machines’ rendered and urged mothers to cultivate the bond established between the child and the wet-nurse:
<disp-quote>
<p>a child mustn’t forget the woman who gave him her milk, even when he is a grown man: nothing can repay this service but a lasting attachment. A mother mustn’t be jealous of such an attachment; it is an assurance of the one her child will have for herself. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 306)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Grandmothers and other older women relatives did not fare much better than the hired help, as ‘if they have more experience [than the new mother] they equally lacked knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>Many of these women had been around birthing mothers, had themselves given birth to and raised children, but they all lacked an authoritative voice born not of having merely put in the time, but rather of having gone through the never-ending cycle of doing, observing, discussing and reflecting. Motherhood, Millet-Robinet was arguing, was not part of the essence of being a woman; it was a science to be learnt, just as medicine was. Young women entering married life were doing so ‘without experience and without any preparatory study’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 2). Clearly motherhood entailed both experience and education, and she was set to give young women the fruit of her own experience in order to educate them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0957155812443190">
<title>Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s rebellious daughter</title>
<p>If throughout her book Cora Millet-Robinet was vehement on the subject of ignorance and tradition for the sake of tradition, neither was she too favourably impressed by philosophers, who were in her opinion overly abstract and lacking in any experiential knowledge. Always aware and respectful of the distinction between the responsibilities of mothers as caregivers and that of physicians, she was nonetheless keenly critical of theorisers who had obviously never changed a diaper. The best example of her reservations towards abstract thinkers is found in her analysis of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</p>
<p>With the exception maybe of Mathieu de Dombasle (1777–1843), the famed reformer of agriculture, there are few men Cora Millet-Robinet admired as much as she did Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who has a prominent place in her preface to the <italic>Conseils</italic>. Thanks to Rousseau’s ‘genius’, and to the ‘lights brought on childhood by the great man’, ‘immense ameliorations’ had been introduced in nurseries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 2–3). Unfortunately though, the changes Rousseau set in motion ‘did not penetrate all the social classes, and did not bring, in those it did touch, all the good that could have been expected, especially in <italic>the smaller details</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 2, emphasis mine). Millet-Robinet goes back to Rousseau at the opening of the second part of the <italic>Conseils</italic>, focused on the infant, devoting a whole section to her ‘Reflections on the doctrines of J.-J. Rousseau’. She sums up her assessment of the situation:
<disp-quote>
<p>Everything J.-J. Rousseau says about the education and the care required during the childhood of human beings is the admirable truth. The only difficulty rests in its application; his precepts need to be well understood, and most of the people for whom they would be useful either do not go through the trouble of reading and studying them, or do not understand them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 115)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, according to Millet-Robinet, the limited application of what should have been a revolution in the education of children had two causes: the Enlightenment did not reach the classes that needed the most transformation, and in the classes where Rousseau was read, his works remained too abstract, so their application depended on the interpretation of the reader. That Rousseau had failed to go into some of the ‘details’ was a flaw that the philosopher’s greatness could never overcome in Millet-Robinet’s eyes, and this criticism reflects powerfully the faith that she put in experiential learning:
<disp-quote>
<p>This great man, who could not experiment all that he professed, was drawn into some exaggerations, or put forth ideas that are difficult to execute. Thus, when he says that they [children] should be taught how to walk in a meadow so as to avoid the use of head-pads, he seems not to have thought … that fields to make children walk and avoid falls are not available in all seasons or everywhere. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 116)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0957155812443190">9</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It comes to no surprise that, according to Millet-Robinet, what Rousseau’s doctrines needed most was an army of intelligent and dedicated women:
<disp-quote>
<p>To women, I believe, belongs the task of explaining and disseminating a portion [of Rousseau’s works] … Let us work to draw all the benefit from [his] revolution, now that calm allows us to evaluate the causes and the effects. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 115–17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus the author had her work cut out for herself. Her mission as she saw it was to show her large readership how to understand and apply the theoretical knowledge Rousseau had so masterfully outlined. After a thorough reading of <italic>Émile</italic> and duly noting its shortcomings, she describes her method as the cycle of experiential learning invoked above:
<disp-quote>
<p>Deducing the reasons that will guide me, as much as possible, from my experience and from the enlightenment I received from reading, meditating and conversing with men who have dealt with this subject, I will never give my opinion as a precept, but rather as advice, always open to receive the observations that a superior and more experienced authority would give me.

<title>Methodology and taxonomy</title>
<p>One aspect of Millet-Robinet’s writings that retained her readers was her gift for organising and presenting vast amounts of detailed information. In a review of <italic>Guide pratique du fermier et de la fermière: la routine vaincue par le progrès, histoire agricole et morale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957155812443190">1860</xref>), Arnaud de la Ménardière compared this new work with those previously published. He marvels that this book is even clearer than the preceding ones:
<disp-quote>
<p>One finds [in this volume] … the same good practical sense, the same knowledge of all that has been done and written on the topics she addresses, the same sage and prudent control of her choice of methods, the same talent to expose and simplify those methods. Science in her hands loses its abstract formulas, and without losing its precision, becomes intelligible for the least prepared of minds. It is masterly vulgarisation.

<p>In the <italic>Conseils</italic>, her first book, Millet-Robinet openly discussed with her readers how important the qualities of organisation and clarity were, all in the hope of communicating more efficiently. She agonised over how to classify her subject matter best, and finally divided her book into two parts: pregnancy and delivery, and infancy:
<disp-quote>
<p>I will be often forced to mix things that speak of the child among those that relate to the mother; these two parts are so intimately related when a mother breastfeeds that it is almost impossible to separate them completely. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">Millet-Robinet, 1841</xref>: 31)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She appeared to have been somewhat dissatisfied with her choice though, and at the beginning of the second part, she devoted a section to speak about her constant self-questioning regarding her choice of organisation in a section called ‘Explications sur la conduite de l’ouvrage’:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had first thought to write an almanac of the sort done for gardening … [but] I feared that this way would force me to repetitions that would bring about some confusion … One of the greatest difficulties when taking the pen is to be clear; and this difficulty increases in descriptions, especially when they are related and derive from each other. I was forced, while speaking of the mother, to insert matters concerning the child. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 118)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In order to mitigate what she felt was a blemish on the clarity for which she yearned, she decided to insert ‘a detailed table placed at the end of the work’. Because she could not find a ‘positive title’ for each sub-part, she had to give up her original project: ‘I could not organise [topics] in alphabetical order, but had to follow their natural classification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 119). Thus, chapters are divided into four or five sections, loosely related. In the last chapter for example, the first two sections, ‘Bottle-feeding’ and ‘On-site wet-nurses’ are logically tied. With a slight stretch of logic, readers can also understand the placement of section 3, ‘Laundering of children’s clothes’, as Millet-Robinet recommends assigning the task of laundering to wet-nurses, since she was adamant that nurses should be occupied at all times, engaged either directly or indirectly in the care of their charge. The last section of the chapter, the general conclusion to the whole book, ‘Conclusion’, is there only because of the author’s internal logic, but does not seem in its appropriate place. It is safe to assume that the author herself was displeased with the weakness of this ‘stream-of-consciousness’ of sorts. The question of organisation of knowledge continued to be a major concern for Millet-Robinet, until she finally adopted the use of fully developed indexes at the end of her books.</p>
<p>The 1884 rewrite of the <italic>Conseils pendant l’allaitement, the Livre des jeunes mères</italic>, sheds additional light on Millet-Robinet’s devotion to organisation and clarity. She pursued the questions she had posed in 1841, and by 1884, at the ripe age of 86, she was finally able to introduce to her readers a coherent, easily searchable book. Although the <italic>Livre des jeunes mères</italic> is a supplemented version of <italic>Conseils</italic>, its organisation is clearly superior. The <italic>Livre des jeunes mères</italic> opens with a detailed six-page ‘Table des chapitres’, including chapter subdivisions clearly labelled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957155812443190">Millet-Robinet, 1897 [1884]</xref>: vii–xii). Chapter VI, for example, ‘Maladies des enfants’ contains six sub-parts (digestion, respiration, circulation, etc.), subdivided into individual diseases. In addition to this very detailed table of contents, the <italic>Livre des jeunes mères</italic> also includes a fully fledged index of over 600 entries, entitled ‘Table alphabétique des matières’. Although an alphabetical index is a feature that modern Anglo-Saxon readers have come to expect in any non-fiction book, this feature was quite innovative for Millet-Robinet to have adopted in her books. To this day, many French books contain only a table of contents, placed at the end of the book, with no index.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0957155812443190">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>These preoccupations with organisation and classification are vital to understanding the scientific background that Millet-Robinet brought to her work. The obsession that French intellectuals of the Enlightenment had with dictionaries, encyclopaedias and the dissemination of scientific knowledge helps us place Millet-Robinet’s work in the context of her period. The time and effort she invested in this organisation also speaks to the level of professionalism that she expected of both herself and her readers. Millet-Robinet assumed that her readers had no one reliable to whom to turn when they had a question, and she had to provide the most direct access to the information they needed to care intelligently for their children.</p>
<p>The preoccupation with Millet-Robinet’s professional approach to the science of motherhood is by no mean limited to taxonomy and organisation. One could also cite her systematic use of specific measurements for objects she described, always using the metric system. Although Napoleon had suspended the compulsory use of the metric system, the scientific community in France had continued to use it since the late 1790s – including Millet-Robinet, who sometimes added the equivalent in the Old Regime system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 139). In addition, she was also particularly thorough in her explanations and directions, so as to ensure that her readers would be able to replicate her result, as a replication of the experiment is one of the main tenants of the scientific method.</p>

<title>Focus on details</title>
<p>The qualities of Millet-Robinet’s work are best demonstrated through the analysis of one particular item – the protection of the child against the cold at night. Of constant concern to the medical community of the nineteenth century were the quantity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0957155812443190">11</xref></sup> and the quality of the air, cold and draughts, as well as the state of humidity that came from children soiling themselves during the night. In this context, the subject of the crib and clothing is of particular importance during a century that had declared a fierce war against infant mortality, and when the cold had been identified as an important cause of death in infants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0957155812443190">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the dozen books of the 1800 to 1880 period on children’s hygiene or health consulted for this essay, in addition to Millet-Robinet, only one author mentioned the question of the crib<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0957155812443190">13</xref></sup> – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957155812443190">Dr Eugène Bouchut’s 1862</xref> manual, <italic>Hygiène de la première enfance</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0957155812443190">14</xref></sup> Although writing as a respected medical authority, Bouchut was also well aware that non-medical, practical hands-on experience was indispensable when dealing with the newly developing field of paediatrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957155812443190">Bouchut, 1862</xref>: vi). To be sure, Bouchut’s and Millet-Robinet’s recommendations are similar and do not contradict each other in the least. After all, both of the authors subscribed to the principles of hygiene of their time and truly have the welfare of infants and mothers at heart.</p>
<p>Each author devotes a special section to the question of bedding, and both descriptions are similar. The crib is to have two pallets, filled with seaweed, oat chaff or bracken, with a pillow in the shape of a half-circle. On top of the pallets, both authors prefer the use of a felt or quilted type of cover rather than an oil-cloth, so that the child does not lie in a puddle of waste, and the humidity is absorbed through the top layer and then the pallets, which are to be changed every month. Whereas Bouchut only spends one and a half pages on the topic of bed covers, Millet-Robinet’s superior ten-page description allows her to truly educate mothers on the subject. Bouchut quickly glances at the crib and gives an accurate inventory, while Millet-Robinet gives specific, useable information. The bottom pallet is to be of about 12 or 13 cm thick, with straight corners like a mattress; its centre is to be hollowed out by hand so that the second pallet, which is smaller and not as thick, can be placed in it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">Millet-Robinet, 1841</xref>: 123–4). The small pallet can be cleaned and re-stuffed more easily and therefore more often than the large one, so mothers are to prepare two large pallets but should have four to six of the smaller ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 152).</p>
<p>Similarly, Millet-Robinet’s pillow is to be 40 cm<sup>2</sup>, ‘of white ticking, with a case made of linen rather than calico … The case will be closed with buttons … placed about every 5 cm apart’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 125).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0957155812443190">15</xref></sup> The description of the pillow is followed by that of the sheets and the bed covers, which are omitted by Bouchut altogether. The next section describes how to prepare a quilted fustian cover for the small pallet. In addition to the specifications regarding these items cursorily mentioned by Bouchut, Millet-Robinet also gives detailed, practical instructions for other important items in the fight against cold: the crib covers, padding and curtains.</p>
<p>Although Millet-Robinet is at times fastidious and provides a wealth of detail, she does not burden her readers with fashion tips for the nursery, or embroidery suggestions. Her overall recommendation is one of simplicity – not for its aesthetic value, but again for the sake of hygiene and health. Writing about <italic>Maison rustique des dames</italic>, Pierre Michel somewhat sarcastically compares Millet-Robinet’s work to the <italic>Catalogue de Manufrance</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957155812443190">Michel, 1993</xref>: 106), and the author is acutely aware of this trait:
<disp-quote>
<p>Pray forgive me for these numerous details; one could not give too many in a description. Most elementary books sin in this regard, I have felt it myself many times; I beg my readers to forgive me for some lengthy passages from which I could not cut anything. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 151)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The point to be underlined in this analysis is that when she brought such information and sewing projects to mothers, Millet-Robinet’s purpose was to perform a task of scientific significance, just as much as Bouchut did when he described the basic anatomy and physiology of infants. Both were engaged in the process of vulgarisation of scientific information in the uphill battle against infant mortality. Although immunisation played a large role in the gains that were made, hygiene and the basic care of mothers and infants were also key, and Millet-Robinet’s professional tone conveyed the importance of details such as strong buttonholes in the fight for life.</p>
<p>As we have seen, learning and teaching through experience, with a method implanted in the rigour of science and precise methodology, are the hallmarks of Cora Millet-Robinet. But no analysis of the author would be complete without paying tribute to her overwhelming creativity combined with a solidly grounded practical sense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0957155812443190">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>The art of making time</title>
<p>Examples of Millet-Robinet’s practical sense are too numerous to be reported here, but we have seen above the care with which she organised her chapters and sub-chapters so as to facilitate for her readers the process of searching for information in her book, before she developed an index. Again, a few chosen examples will make this efficiency clear. Raising four children and many crops of silkworms, writing books, enriching her mind, directing a household and a farm while her husband was often absent were the tasks that Millet-Robinet faced daily, and soon her creativity found ways to divide up those tasks and simplify them. These menial, repetitive acts were thus performed faster and more easily. When it was time to perform the delicate task of dressing an infant, the author was no stranger to innovation:
<disp-quote>
<p>You shall pass the undershirt sleeves into the shirt and the vest sleeves with care, so that you can put them on all at once. You shall continue to do this as long as the infant is very small; it is very difficult to dress him, and a great deal of time is often spent doing it. In the same manner, you shall prepare the diapers in the blanket that will serve to wrap him, and you shall baste together the front of the caps and the small bonnets that cover his head; otherwise, putting these on will be long and difficult. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 45)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Everything was to be ready for a change in the middle of the night and the importance of the topic warranted a separate section. ‘Way to change the child during the night’:
<disp-quote>
<p>At night [the mother] will have care to prepare two or three receiving blankets, that is to say to pair the diaper and the blanket that the child usually wears; she will put them at the foot of her bed, where she will find them … During rigorous winters, I used to place the blankets inside my bed, close to me, so that they were gently warmed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 211)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hardly content to merely describe how to dress a child in a more efficacious manner, Cora Millet-Robinet also found time to design clothes for mother and child that clearly simplified mothers’ daily routine and shared with her readers numerous sewing projects that she had devised: a ‘not necessarily pretty but very practical’ warm nursing vest to stay warm during night-time feeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 41); a new way to cut undershirts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 135); a technique to ban the use of pins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 143–5);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0957155812443190">17</xref></sup> bibs that could be fastened to the dress but also easily changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 149), etc. It is obvious that she cherished the time spent sewing for her unborn child. Although such displays of emotions are one of the hallmarks of such manuals of the period, the warmth of her almost sensual tone is in stark contrast to the professional voice the author uses throughout her text:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is difficult for a woman to find needlework more pleasant [than sewing a layette]. She will be thoroughly happy every time when, upon finishing a small bonnet, an undershirt, she shows them to her mother or to a friend. It will seem as if she can already see these items filled by the beloved being she carries in her breast, and who so often reminds her, through his impatient movements, that she must take care of him. She will thus anticipate pleasures that unlike all others grow in spite of possession. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 159)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Her creative abilities and practical sense were not limited to clothes, and many chapters describe contraptions that became household staples: for example, a drying rack, described with a wealth of details and measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0957155812443190">18</xref></sup> Sometimes, she describes objects for which she appears not to have a name, but that modern readers recognise immediately: ‘one can hang at the head of the crib a few small pieces of wood and material of various colours; [the child] will enjoy it greatly and will be absorbed in the sight of it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 197). The management of infants also took into account the mother’s time: night feeds were to be kept short and infrequent, so that mothers could rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 210); babies were not to be constantly held by their mothers, but rather to be put on a rug to crawl, thus creating some free time for those who usually held them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 218); weaning around the age of 15 months was encouraged, as was early potty training and independent play.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0957155812443190">19</xref></sup> In her later <italic>Livre de la jeune mère</italic>, she would be an ardent supporter of the new technologies that were slowly filtering into French homes.</p>
<p>In short, common sense was to be replaced by practical sense, usage by logic, hard labour by technology. Women were responsible for the upbringing of children, a task no one took more seriously than Millet-Robinet. But at the same time, women needed to approach their responsibilities as managers, though they were often both managers and labourers. At this point, an obvious question needs to be answered in order to conclude such a treatise on efficiency and time-saving. What were women to do with this free time?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The overwhelming success of Millet-Robinet’s writings, as readers continued to turn to her for advice regarding childrearing or household management, forces scholars of the nineteenth century to take her contributions into account. Quite simply, as this analysis has shown, the author presented her readers with an attractive, simple, yet powerful vision of a woman’s role, where duties as wife and mother could be mastered while creating some personal time. Cora Millet-Robinet taught her readers to be independent, keeping traditional influences at arm’s length. Then she reminded women of the power of their intelligence, encouraging them to analyse the daily problems they faced, be it folding a diaper or designing a garment. Finally, she showed them through example that they possessed the creativity to solve the matter in hand by devising new tools and solutions to old problems. Indeed, from her first childcare book in 1841, it is clear that one of Millet-Robinet’s main tenets was that the mother and the child were a team, and that it was essential that the mother should not become the baby’s slave. The mother needed to teach her child how to be independent, by not constantly holding it, by establishing a routine that allowed them both to rest and to undertake activities that were important to each of them. She was adamant that, contrary to French custom, a child should be put on the floor in a safe area. Although the practice generated dirty laundry, the mother would ‘advance considerably the time when she would be delivered from the fatigue and the bother of having to carry him or to make him walk’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 220–1). When discussing various childcare tasks such as laundry, feeding, etc., her ultimate goal was always to reach the most efficient balance between time and acceptable standards. The bibs she had developed for a drooling child were not the most elegant, yet they were acceptable, and, most importantly, they saved laundry time by keeping clean the underlying clothing, which was more difficult to wash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 149).</p>
<p>These new methods, many of which ran against accepted practices of childcare of the time, necessitated that women break with the tradition transmitted for the most part by the community around them – mother, grandmother, mother-in-law, sister, etc. – who might be in a position to counsel and support women in their capacity as a wife and mother. For many women, this isolation might have reflected the reality of industrialisation and urbanisation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0957155812443190">20</xref></sup> but Millet-Robinet repeatedly asked her readers to disregard other women’s advice, as their suggestions would necessarily be based in folklore rather than observation or science. Her deference to male physicians in the case of the most serious diseases meant that her books were supported by them, to the point of having the well-respected Dr Émile Allix as a second author of the <italic>Livre de la jeune mère</italic>, but in the end, the strength that she gave her readers was the belief in their own power of education: a mother who read her manual could achieve independence from what the author clearly perceives to be a negative influence on the modern mother. Motherhood, so to speak, was up for grabs, and she encouraged her readers to make decisions based on the knowledge acquired through reading and through their own experience.</p>
<p>Cora Millet-Robinet’s proclivity for challenging current practices – whether in the field of childcare, education, management, silkworms or farming – was a gift she wanted to give her women readers, encouraging them into a dialogue. Yes, she professed an unending admiration for Rousseau, but she felt she had the authority to question some of his positions and felt no need to apologise. Similarly, she wanted her readers to emulate her in challenging them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0957155812443190">21</xref></sup> Speaking of the importance of writing textbooks designed to educate farmers’ wives, she urges women to write these text themselves: ‘if one of you feels capable of writing the works or one of the works needed by the Society of Methods, let her take up the pen and from being my student become my teacher – I will gladly welcome her’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155812443190">1847</xref>: 612). It is clear that for Millet-Robinet parenting and household management were important responsibilities. Though she did not challenge a division of labour that gave women the entire responsibility of childcare, it is equally clear that she did not expect or recommend that women’s role be limited to such tasks.</p>
<p>But, in the end, what was the purpose of the efficiency she constantly sought to implement and championed?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0957155812443190">22</xref></sup> What were women to do with the time they no longer had to expend on tasks that were better planned and executed? More chores? Certainly not. For Cora Millet-Robinet, wife and mother but also scientist, researcher, farmer, political and social activist, and writer, this question only had one desirable answer: women had thus the time to be productive in fields her readers thought were the prerogative of men: education, political engagement, charitable undertakings, but also work that produced an income. In her first column, she promised her readers that she would write about her silkworm farm, an ‘industry so well adapted to women’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155812443190">1847</xref>: 612). Later, she urged women of the upper classes to become engaged in the creation of an infrastructure to help working mothers in factories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0957155812443190">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following Millet-Robinet’s advice, her readers could take charge of motherhood and become professional mothers, both because they were to approach their maternal responsibilities as professionals, and because they were to look beyond motherhood to contribute to society in a meaningful, productive manner. Cora Millet-Robinet was paving the way for a time when women would be able to enter whatever profession they wanted.</p>

<p>To understand fully the difficulty faced by authors of such manuals, see for comparison the ‘Table des chapitres’ of the <italic>Manuel complet de la maîtresse de maison</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957155812443190">1826</xref>), by the well-respected authority on the subject of domestic economy, Marie Armande Gacon-Dufour (1756–1835). See also the <italic>Manuel de la jeune mère</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957155812443190">1852</xref>) by Virginie Messager, a well-recognised authority on childbirth and ‘professeur d’accouchements’. The sub-topics for each chapter in the table of contents are not visually presented within the chapter by a sub-title, and there is no indication of page numbers within Gacon-Dufour’s chapters. Other authors had tried to publish similar material in an epistolary format: see Mme Pariset’s <italic>Nouveau Manuel complet de la maîtresse de maison ou Lettres sur l’économie domestique</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155812443190">1821</xref>). The epistolary format is a testimony to the difficulty felt by the author of presenting her material in an attractive and useful manner.</p>

<p>Studies compared mortality rates between northern regions of France and Provence, and between Catholic and Jewish children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155812443190">Beaugrand, 1855</xref>: 210). The data collected led to changes in the law: parents no longer had to present the child at the <italic>mairie</italic> to declare its birth: the father could go alone, as is still done today. In some parts, priests were instructed to perform baptisms in the home of the newborn during the winter months, rather than expose them to the cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155812443190">Beaugrand, 1855</xref>: 211). Beaugrand’s two main treatises on hygiene and health were recommended additions to the library for women mentioned in note 3.</p>

<p>Eugène Bouchut (1818–91) specialised, among other things, in paediatrics. His stated purpose was to bring ‘light to the darkness in which live so many young mothers, so many physicians … and most hospital administrators in charge of raising children!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957155812443190">1862</xref>: viii).</p>

<p>It is important to specify that practical sense and common sense are not to be used interchangeably. Common sense is a cultural construct among a group, whereas practical sense describes instances where tasks are accomplished more efficiently in a manner that would be evident to anyone, whether they are part of the same cultural group or not.</p>

<p>Millet-Robinet is not the only author to be concerned about the use of pins. Bouchut cites the case of an infant having a seizure: upon conducting a physical examination, the physician found that his back had been fastened to his shirt and his undershirt, his skin being perforated twice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957155812443190">1862</xref>: 265).</p>

<p>It interesting to note the progression: in 1841, the many details given about the drying rack seem to indicate that readers were to have a similar one built. In 1884, she mentions the rack again as being more appropriate than the back of a chair to dry diapers and such, but she provides an illustration of ‘one of the models the most often used’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957155812443190">Millet-Robinet and Allix, 1897 [1884]</xref>: 49). Clearly, the drying rack had become a familiar object, manufactured for mass consumption.</p>

<p>Millet-Robinet was conscious that women living in Paris were often isolated from the support of close relatives, and therefore had no choice but to hire the home-nurses she loathed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443190">1841</xref>: 110).</p>

<p>Although Millet-Robinet’s books on childcare were aimed at middle-class or upper-middle-class women, it is interesting to note that by the time she published the <italic>Livre des jeunes mères</italic> in 1884, she included a full chapter on crèches, their usefulness, how to open one, the type of women they would employ, etc. Clearly, these establishments were created for women who worked outside the home: the mothers who left their children there because they had to work and could not afford any other type of childcare, and also the wealthier women who ran these establishments, applying the knowledge Millet-Robinet had encouraged her readers to acquire. To run the crèches, women needed to design facilities, plan the care, supervise the paid help, keep the books, talk to the physician assigned to each crèche, submit to the inspection of government agents, etc.</p>
