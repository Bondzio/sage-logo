<abstract>
<p>Client ethnicity has been shown to affect clinicians’ diagnostic impressions. However, it is not known whether interpretation of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory–2 (MMPI-2) clinical scales is affected by ethnic bias. In this study, clinicians (82 males, 60 females) provided severity ratings for six symptoms based on three MMPI-2 profiles (representing the 27/72, 49/94, and 68/86 code-types) with the ethnicity of the client randomly assigned as either African American or Caucasian. To determine whether symptom severity ratings based on MMPI-2 profiles were affected by ethnicity, a 3 (code-type) × 2 (ethnicity) MANOVA was performed. Neither the main effect for ethnicity nor the ethnicity × code-type interaction was significant. These results indicated that the symptom severity ratings based on the MMPI-2 clinical scales were not affected by the client’s identification as African American or Caucasian. Future studies are needed to explore the interpretation of profiles from clients representing other ethnic groups and for female clients.</p>

<p>Research has shown that clinical judgment can be influenced by a client’s cultural membership, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Some studies have reported that clinicians are more likely to diagnose mental disorders in ethnic minority clients than in Caucasian clients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191112465333">Neighbors et al. (1999)</xref> found that African American and Hispanic inpatients were more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia compared with Caucasians. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191112465333">Luepnitz, Randolph, and Gutsch (1982)</xref> reported that clinicians were more likely to diagnose alcoholism in low socioeconomic status African American clients compared with middle socioeconomic status Caucasian clients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191112465333">Lewis, Croft-Jeffreys, and David (1990)</xref> found that British psychologists were more likely to diagnose case vignettes depicting Caucasian patients with schizophrenia, whereas vignettes depicting an Afro-Caribbean client were diagnosed with a substance-induced psychosis.</p>
<p>Other studies suggest that Caucasians are more likely to be given diagnoses of mental disorders, whereas ethnic minority clients are more likely to be given diagnoses of behavioral disorders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112465333">Pottick, Kirk, Hsieh, and Tian (2007)</xref> found that clinicians attributed antisocial behavior to delinquency in African American and Hispanic juveniles whereas similar behavior was attributed to a mental health disorder in Caucasian juveniles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191112465333">Cohen et al. (1990)</xref> reported that Caucasian children were more likely to be placed in an inpatient psychiatric facility whereas African American children were more likely to be placed in a juvenile corrections facility.</p>
<p>Although these studies suggest the presence of ethnic bias in diagnosis of African American and Caucasian clients, other studies have failed to find evidence for such bias in diagnostic assessments or ratings of symptom severity based on case histories or videotaped vignettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112465333">Garb, 1998</xref>). It is also not known if similar biases are present in the interpretation of objective personality tests, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI/MMPI-2).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine whether a client’s ethnicity influences clinicians’ interpretations of MMPI-2 clinical scale profiles. This study focused on two ethnic groups: Caucasians and African Americans. The aim of the study was to determine to what extent clinicians’ ratings of symptom severity were influenced by the ethnicity of the client.</p>
<sec id="section1-1073191112465333">
<title>Use of the MMPI/MMPI-2 With African Americans</title>
<p>The original version of the MMPI was standardized on an ethnically homogenous sample of Caucasian residents of Minnesota and included no members of ethnic minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191112465333">Dahlstrom, Welsh, &amp; Dahlstrom, 1972</xref>). Despite the homogeneous standardization sample, the MMPI was nevertheless used in the assessment of ethnic minority individuals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191112465333">Gynther (1972)</xref> reviewed research that compared African Americans and Caucasians on the MMPI and concluded that African Americans scored higher than Caucasians on scales <italic>F, 7</italic>, and <italic>8</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191112465333">Penk, Woodward, Robinowitz, and Hess (1978)</xref> found that Caucasian heroin users obtained higher scores on MMPI scales <italic>2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8</italic>, and <italic>0</italic> and lower scores on scales <italic>L</italic> and <italic>K</italic> when compared with African American heroin users. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191112465333">Greene (1987)</xref> observed that most of the <italic>T</italic>-score differences among ethnic groups were less than 5 points, a magnitude too small to be considered clinically significant. Thus, although there were differences among ethnic groups on the MMPI, these differences were unlikely to be large enough to have a significant impact on the interpretation of the instrument.</p>
<p>The revised version of the MMPI (MMPI-2) was normed on a sample that was larger and more diverse than the original standardization sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191112465333">Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, &amp; Kaemmer, 1989</xref>). Nevertheless, some researchers continued to report differences between African Americans and Caucasians on the test. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191112465333">Timbrook and Graham (1994)</xref> found that African American men obtained higher mean scores on scale <italic>8</italic> compared with Caucasian men and that African American women obtained higher mean scores on scales <italic>4, 5</italic>, and <italic>9</italic> compared with Caucasian women. However, none of these differences exceeded 5 <italic>T</italic>-score points and thus did not achieve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191112465333">Greene’s (1987)</xref> standard for clinical significance. Timbrook and Graham also reported that the MMPI-2 scales were equally accurate at predicting partner ratings for Caucasian and African American men and women.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191112465333">McNulty, Graham, Ben-Porath, and Stein (1997)</xref> found that African American men scored higher than Caucasian men on the <italic>L</italic> scale by more than 5 <italic>T</italic>-score points. African American women scored higher than Caucasian women on scale <italic>9</italic>, but this difference was not considered clinically significant as it was less than 5 <italic>T</italic>-score points. Moreover, the differences in MMPI-2 scores between African Americans and Caucasians were consistent with the differences observed on rating scales completed by the participants’ therapists. McNulty et al. concluded that MMPI-2 differences between African Americans and Caucasians were not due to an ethnic bias in the MMPI-2, but rather were indicative of valid personality differences, at least insofar as they are described by therapists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073191112465333">Arbisi, Ben-Porath, and McNulty (2002)</xref> reported that African American men scored higher on scales <italic>F, 4, 6, 8</italic>, and <italic>9</italic> than Caucasian men. African American women scored higher on scales <italic>6</italic> and <italic>9</italic>. However, these differences did not exceed 5 <italic>T</italic>-score points, and so were not clinically significant according to the standard advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191112465333">Greene (1987)</xref>.</p>
<p>Although these findings suggest that there are few consistent differences between Caucasian and African American populations on the MMPI-2, it is not clear whether or how interpretations of the MMPI-2 might be influenced by client ethnicity. Because a client’s ethnicity affects a clinician’s appraisal of diagnosis and prognosis, it might also affect the interpretation of self-report psychological test results. This study explored whether a client’s assigned ethnicity influences clinicians’ interpretations of MMPI-2 clinical scale profiles. The research question was the following:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study used a quantitative, quasi-experimental design to investigate the possible impact of client ethnicity on interpretation of the MMPI-2. Data were collected through the Internet. The institutional review board waived documentation of consent, as this study did not ask for any identifiable information from the participants.</p>
<sec id="section3-1073191112465333">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>There were two criteria for participating in the study: (a) participants must be involved in the field of clinical psychology as a practicing or retired clinician, a current graduate student, or a course instructor; and (b) participants must have completed an assessment course or continuing education workshop that included training in interpreting the MMPI-2, or must be teaching the MMPI-2 in a graduate program. To ensure the necessary familiarity with the MMPI-2, each participant was required to answer four out of five questions correctly on an online proficiency exam on the MMPI-2.</p>
<p>Prospective participants were recruited through a random sample of the online membership directories of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Society of Personality Assessment (SPA). The APA online membership directory was sorted to include members who had listed “assessment” as an area of interest. A random number generator was used to sample the APA and SPA directories separately without replacement. Four rounds of emails were sent including 50 emails to APA and 25 to SPA members. A total of 168 prospective participants logged onto the study website. Of these, 10 opted not to participate. A total of 16 prospective participants were eliminated for failing to meet the inclusion criteria or not passing the proficiency exam.</p>
<p>The final sample consisted of 142 raters (82 male, 60 female). The sample was homogeneous in terms of rater ethnicity (126 Caucasian, 1 Asian, 3 Hispanic, 1 African American, 6 multiethnic, and 5 declined to disclose). Raters ranged in age from 24 to 89 years (median = 55). The raters included 118 doctoral-level licensed clinicians, 5 doctoral-level unlicensed clinicians, 13 doctoral students with a master’s degree, 1 doctoral student without a master’s degree, 3 master’s-level licensed clinicians, and 2 master’s-level unlicensed clinicians. In terms of clinical experience, 19 (9.9%) had completed a minimum of one practicum, 4 (2.8%) had completed an internship, 8 (5.6%) reported less than 5 years of experience, 23 (16.2%) reported 5 to 14 years of experience, and 93 (65.5%) reported more than 15 years of experience. Regarding experience with the MMPI-2, 92 (64.8%) had more than 10 years experience, 24 (16.9%) had 5 to 10 years, 18 (12.7%) had 2 to 4 years, and 8 (5.6%) had less than 1 year of experience.</p>

<title>MMPI-2 profiles</title>
<p>We constructed three profiles representing depression/anxiety (27/72), psychosis (68/86), and antisocial personality disorder (49/94) in an attempt to cover a range of psychological disorders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191112465333">Table 1</xref>). All clients were described as male to control for gender as a potential confounding variable. Two versions of each profile were prepared, one attributed to an African American client and the other to a Caucasian client. The two profiles were otherwise identical. To control for client’s age, the 27/72 profile was attributed to a 23-year-old client, the 49/94 profile was attributed to a 25-year-old client, and the 68/86 profile was attributed to a 21-year-old client.</p>

<title>Symptom Severity Survey</title>
<p>Participants were asked to indicate the severity of six symptoms on a 6-point Likert-type scale by interpreting the MMPI-2 profile in light of the demographic information provided. The symptoms were anxiety, psychotic features, suicidality, depressed mood, substance abuse, and antisocial behavior. The participant was asked to identify if the symptom was <italic>Not Present</italic> (1), <italic>Very Mild</italic> (2), <italic>Mild</italic> (3), <italic>Moderate</italic> (4), <italic>Severe</italic> (5), or <italic>Very Severe</italic> (6).

<sec id="section7-1073191112465333">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Prospective participants received an email that included information about the study, criteria for inclusion, the webpage address of the study, an estimate of the time required to participate (10-15 minutes), and a statement indicating that a $1.00 donation per participant would be made to either APA or SPA up to a maximum of $120.00. After providing informed consent by electronic signature, participants completed a demographic survey followed by the 5-item MMPI-2 proficiency test.</p>
<p>Participants then saw an MMPI-2 profile on the following screen along with the Symptom Severity Survey. Participants were instructed to complete the Likert-type scale by interpreting the MMPI-2 profile in light of the client’s demographic information. Each participant viewed a series of three profiles with identical directions for completing the Symptom Severity Scale. Random assignment controlled the order in which the profiles were presented as well as the assigned ethnicity of each profile as determined by the Internet survey software.</p>
<p>Each participant completed three Symptom Severity Surveys. One Symptom Severity Survey was collected for each MMPI-2 profile code type (27/72, 49/94, and 68/86). Ethnicity was randomly assigned to each of these profiles. For the 27/72 profile, there were complete ratings for 61 African American and 61 Caucasian clients. For the 49/94 profile, there were complete ratings for 67 African Americans and 55 Caucasians. For the 68/86 profile, there were complete ratings for 56 African Americans and 66 Caucasians. This distribution did not differ from equal assignment to each of the six possible profile × ethnicity combinations, χ<sup>2</sup>(5) = 2.00, <italic>p</italic> = .849.</p>
<p>Data were downloaded to a password-protected hard drive and exported to SPSS for analysis after the survey had been closed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study found that the ethnicity (African American or Caucasian) assigned to a client did not affect how experienced clinicians interpreted his MMPI-2 clinical scale profile. Thus, it appears that the raters were interpreting the MMPI-2 profiles in a manner consistent with the empirical literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191112465333">Greene, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191112465333">Gynther, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191112465333">Timbrook &amp; Graham, 1994</xref>), which has found only small mean differences between African Americans and Caucasians on MMPI-2 clinical and validity scales. The finding that profile code-type yielded a significant main effect confirms that clinicians were in fact using the MMPI-2 data to arrive at their symptom ratings.</p>
<p>Previous literature has suggested that clinicians might make biased judgments regarding diagnosis based on cultural membership, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191112465333">Cohen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191112465333">Lewis et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191112465333">Luepnitz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191112465333">Neighbors et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112465333">Pottick et al., 2007</xref>). Using objective assessments such as the MMPI-2 can help clinicians formulate less biased clinical judgments. Since clinicians in this study interpreted MMPI-2 profiles from Caucasian and African American clients similarly, the use of objective assessment measures can potentially counteract the ethnic biases that affect clinical judgment and result in more accurate assessment of their client’s symptoms.</p>
<p>This study had several limitations. The size of the sample was adequate to detect a moderate to large effect size attributed to client ethnicity, but it was not adequate to detect a small effect size. The possibility remains that client ethnicity might have had a small effect on clinician ratings. However, it is important to note that a small effect size is unlikely to have clinical significance. MMPI-2 scale differences less than 5 <italic>T</italic>-score points (1/2 standard deviation) are not considered to have significant clinical implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191112465333">Greene, 1987</xref>). Therefore, even if a small effect of client ethnicity were to be present, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on profile interpretation.</p>
<p>The sample in this study was also largely homogeneous, with less than 10% of the raters representing ethnic minority groups. As it is possible that rater ethnicity might affect the degree to which client ethnicity influences MMPI-2 interpretations, future studies should include a more diverse sample of clinicians. On the other hand, the recruitment method (targeting members of APA and SPA) was not biased against selecting participants of diverse ethnic backgrounds. The skewed ethnic distribution of the sample might be a reflection of the skewed ethnic distribution in the profession rather than an inherent weakness in the study design.</p>
<p>This study was limited to two assigned ethnicities (African American and Caucasian), males, three code types, and six symptoms. Future studies should include female clients, members of other ethnic groups, and other code types. This study was limited to the MMPI-2 clinical scales and cannot be generalized to other MMPI-2 scales, such as the content scales, supplemental scales, and RC scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112465333">Tellegen et al., 2003</xref>). Future studies should investigate these scales as well as the MMPI-2-RF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191112465333">Ben-Porath &amp; Tellegen, 2008</xref>). Although the symptoms selected for the rating scale represent broad categories that are typically assessed in clinical settings, it is possible that differences attributed to assigned ethnicity might have been detected if other symptoms had been included.</p>
<p>It was assumed that each participant paid attention to the ethnicity assigned to each profile. The main effect of the code-type variable supports that each rater used the MMPI-2 clinical scale data to evaluate symptom severity of the client; however, no check was instituted to monitor the rater’s acknowledgment of the assigned ethnicity. Future studies should include a method of ensuring that the rater was attending to the provided demographic information. One way to do so might be to ask participants to verify the ethnicity, age, or gender of the client whose MMPI-2 profile they are rating.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the results of this study suggested that raters’ interpretations are based on MMPI-2 clinical scale elevations and are not affected by the client being identified as African American or Caucasian. Thus, this study supports the continued use of the MMPI-2 clinical scales with African American and Caucasian clients. Further research is necessary to study other ethnic groups and to explore whether there could be subtler ethnic biases at work in interpretation of the MMPI-2 and other psychological measures.</p>

<p>In response to a recommendation of a reviewer of this article, results were analyzed separately for each code type. Results were identical to those reported for the 3 × 2 MANOVA. For the 27/72 code type, Pillai’s Trace = .053, <italic>F</italic>(6, 115) = 1.08, p = .378. For the 49/94 code type, Pillai’s Trace = .045, <italic>F</italic>(6, 712) = 115, p = .492. For the 68/86 code type, Pillai’s Trace = .029, F(6, 115) = .57, p = .754.</p>
