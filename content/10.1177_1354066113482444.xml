<p>In January 2013 the running of EJIR passed to a new editorial team based at Sussex. We would like to thank the outgoing team for their sterling work over the past five years. Under the leadership of Colin Wight, Tim Dunne and Lene Hansen, EJIR lived up to the vision of its founders: to publish the very best research available in the field, to represent all theoretical approaches and issue areas in International Relations, and to make EJIR one of the leading journals in the field. The introduction of ‘manuscript central’ allowed them to reduce the decision time for manuscripts significantly. Moreover, Colin's team - as well as David Mainwaring and his colleagues at Sage - have successfully overseen a smooth period of transition. The contents of this and the next few issues will be made up of articles accepted by the previous team, including a special issue on ‘The End of International Relations Theory?’.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank the steering committee of the ECPR Standing Group on International Relations, especially Pinar Bilgin, Thomas Diez and Knud-Erik Jørgensen, for entrusting us with the editorship of EJIR. The establishment of the European International Studies Association brings with it exciting changes for EJIR. It will become an EISA member’s journal, significantly enhancing its distribution and readership.</p>
<p>As editors we plan to build on the winning strategy of our predecessors. We are committed to providing authors with an efficient and high quality review process and readers with innovative and excellent research in International Relations. The journal will continue to publish articles representing all theoretical and methodological approaches and issue areas. We also hope that the journal will play a part in efforts to overcome political and academic boundaries to the representation and dissemination of the highest quality research on pressing global political issues. To this end, we particularly encourage the submission of articles from scholars in the Global South and we welcome submissions from the fields of global political economy, international law, international history, political and social theory, philosophy, geography and development. Whether from within or outside the field of International Relations, however, and in order to ensure fruitful debate, all articles should speak to relevant issues in international politics and to as wide an audience as possible.</p>
