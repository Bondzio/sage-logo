<sec><title>Purpose:</title>
<p>Positive impact of weight loss on sexual function and hormones has been demonstrated, and male fertility in this scenario is to be better defined. We evaluated the impact of lifestyle modifications and gastric bypass on sperm quality.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Methods:</title>
<p>We prospectively studied 20 morbidly obese men during 24 months, randomized for intervention: lifestyle modifications (exercise and diet) for 4 months and subsequently gastric bypass (n = 10); and control: follow-up (n = 10). All patients underwent International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire, serum estradiol, prolactin (PRL), luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones (LH and FSH), free and total testosterones (FT and TT) and semen analysis at baseline (time 0), surgery 4 months later baseline (time 1) and final evaluation 24 months (time 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Results:</title>
<p>Intervention group presented significant reduction in body mass index (BMI) at times 1 and 2, compared to control. There were no significant differences among sperm parameters between groups at times 0, 1, and 2 and among times 0, 1, and 2 in each group. Increases in IIEF-5 score (<italic>P</italic> = .0469), TT (<italic>P</italic> = .0349), and FSH (<italic>P</italic> = .0025) and reduction in PRL (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) were observed in the intervention group from times 0 to 2 and 1 to 2. Comparing groups at time 2, IIEF-5, TT, and FT increased significantly in the intervention group (<italic>P</italic> = .0224, <italic>P</italic> = .0043, and <italic>P</italic> = .0149, respectively).</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Surgery-induced massive weight loss does not interfere with sperm quality, while it increased the quality of sexual function, TT, FT and FSH and reduced PRL. Lifestyle modifications impacted merely the BMI. New studies are warranted, mostly considering birth rate as primary end point and including infertile men.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Morbid obesity (MO) is defined as body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In Brazil, prevalence of MO rose 255% in the last years, starting at 0.18% in 1975 to 1976 and growing to 0.33% in 1989 and 0.64% in 2002 to 2003.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112440747">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The obesity rate among young men and women is constantly increasing, and how these weight changes will affect new generations and their future fertility remains unknown at this point. Actually, 40% of men presenting to 1 infertility clinic are overweight.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112440747">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Among men, BMI is associated with infertility with an odds ratio of 1.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.25), after correlation for female BMI, male and female age, smoking status, alcohol use, and exposure to solvents and pesticides. Body mass index seems to have its maximum negative effect on fertility at the range of 32 to 43 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and the effect plateau beyond that point.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112440747">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, much more research is necessary, mainly embracing MO, which has been understudied. Recently, pooling population-based studies with larger sample sizes and longitudinal studies, MacDonald et al was not able to show a relationship between BMI and sperm concentration or total sperm count.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112440747">4</xref>
</sup> Only 5 studies of limited quality were suitable for a meta-analysis and even currently there is no enough data regarding other semen parameters for the study expansion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112440747">4</xref>
</sup> Reports including MO are even scarcer.</p>
<p>Obesity causes a partial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism based on decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, which adversely affect Sertoli cell function, inhibin B, and sperm production as well as Leydig cell testosterone production.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112440747">5</xref>
</sup> These changes involve the aromatase enzyme present in adipose tissue and capable of converting C19 steroid precursors into C18 estrogens. Estrogen itself has a direct negative effect on spermatogenesis, as demonstrated in men taking high doses of diethylstilbestrol.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112440747">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Bariatric surgery is one of the few treatment options proven to induce substantial weight loss, increase life expectancy, and improve numerous comorbidities of MO such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112440747">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112440747">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112440747">7</xref>
</sup> Since 1999, the Brazilian Unified Health System has covered bariatric surgery. From 2000 to 2006, there was a 6-fold increase in the number of surgeries, which topped the 2500 marks in 2006.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112440747">1</xref>

</p>
<p>The effects of weight loss through lifestyle modifications and gastric bypass surgery on male fertility were evaluated through sperm quality in MO men.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1933719112440747" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was conducted with institutional review board approval. Twenty male patients selected from 117 men undergoing evaluation and follow-up for gastric bypass were asked to give informed consent and were randomized through centralized computer-generated randomization to intervention program (IT group—10 patients) or control program (C group—10 patients).</p>
<p>Rigorous exclusion criteria provided highly selected patients for less confounder as possible: comorbidities requiring regular drug usage (statin, antihypertensive, and oral antidiabetic), endocrine disease (except very mild hypogonadism) or recent hormonal manipulation (last 3 months), testicular asymmetry/impairment, varicocele, vasectomy, alcohol or tobacco abuse, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor use. Oral glucose tolerance test was performed when fasting plasma glucose was inconclusive/borderline.</p>
<p>The intervention program included weight loss plan with nutritional education for low-energy diet and intensive behavior modification for daily physical activity guided by multidisciplinary team (nutritionist, physical educator, and psychologist), and subsequent gastric bypass surgery. The patients in C group underwent general multidisciplinary team direction and were not arranged to receive intensive program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112440747">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The dietary advice was tailored to each participant on the basis of 3-day food records and the goals were a reduction in intake of saturated fatty acid to less than 15% of the energy consumed; an increase in intake of monounsaturated fatty acid to 15% or more of energy consumed; an increase in fiber intake to at least 20 g/1000 kcal; and moderate exercise for at least 30 min/d for at least 5 days/week.</p>
<p>For ethical reasons, participants in the C group were given general, oral, and written information about healthy food choices and general guidance on increasing their level of physical activity at baseline and at subsequent visits, but no specific individualized program was offered to them. In the final study, the same intervention and surgery were offered to all participants in the C group.</p>
<p>All patients presented criteria proposed by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Panel for bariatric surgery for MO.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112440747">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In IT group, surgery was performed as previously described<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112440747">9</xref>
</sup>; briefly, a distal gastrectomy involving three quarters of the stomach with a 250- to 300-mL residual stump and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The alimentary tract was about 250 cm long and the common tract, 50 cm long. A prophylactic cholecystectomy was performed.</p>
<p>The anamnesis, physical examination, BMI (calculated as body weight divided by height squared—kg/m<sup>2</sup>), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire, semen analysis (mean of 3 samples with 1 week interval), and blood test were obtained for hormonal profile once before enrollment (during the initial consultation)—time 0, once before surgery (usually between 3 and 7 days before the surgery, which were offered 4 months after enrollment)—time 1, and once after surgery (24 months follow-up)—time 2. The person administering the questionnaire was blinded to the intervention. Semen samples were collected by masturbation after a period of abstinence of &gt;48 to &lt;96 hours and were analyzed by World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112440747">10</xref>
</sup> after 30 minutes of liquefaction at 37°C.</p>
<sec id="section3-1933719112440747">
<title>Assessment of Hormonal Environment</title>
<p>Morning venous blood was drawn from the study participants after a 12-hour overnight fast. Serum-free testosterone (FT) was measured by solid-phase radioimmunoassay, using the commercial kit (DPC/Coat-A-Count, Diagnostic Products Corp, Los Angeles, California). The analytical sensitivity of this assay was 0.15 pg/mL and functional sensitivity was the assay’s concentration that could be measured with an interassay coefficient of variation of ±15%.</p>
<p>Serum total testosterone (TT), estradiol (E), prolactin (PRL), LH, and FSH were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche-Hitache; Systems Elecsys e-411; Roche-Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Illinois), using the corresponding commercial kit. The functional sensitivity was the assay’s concentration that could be measured with an interassay coefficient of variation of ±10%. The analytical sensitivities of these assays were 0.02 ng/mL, 5.0 pg/mL, 0.10 mUI/mL, 0.10 mUI/mL, and 1.0 lUI/mL, respectively. Serum samples were collected in duplicate and kept at −20°C until assay.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1933719112440747">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>For comparison of continuous measures between 2 groups and between 2 times, Mann–Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were used, respectively. For comparison of continuous measures among 3 times and between 2 groups, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures on ranks and profile tests in contrasts for time differences were used. All statistical tests were performed using SPSS version 15.0 (Chicago, Illinois), and the tests were 2-sided with significance level at .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Obesity is associated with an increased incidence of erectile dysfunction and reduced coital frequency that can contribute to infertility, however, there is controversy regarding the extent of this relationship and its mechanisms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112440747">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Although positive impact of weight loss was shown for hormonal and sexual issues,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112440747">11</xref>
</sup> and it is also expected on male reproduction capacity; bariatric surgery negative consequences on fertility was highlighted in anecdotal reports,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112440747">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112440747">13</xref>
</sup> and possible harmful effects are of concern in this scenario. Overall, the balance between positive (hormonal, psychological, and sexual improvements)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112440747">11</xref>
</sup> and negative (nutritional depletion due to selective food maldigestion and malabsorption) impacts<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112440747">14</xref>
</sup> will determine the final effect on seminal quality and fertility.</p>
<p>Several mechanisms might account for the effect of obesity in male infertility, both directly and indirectly, by inducing alterations in hormonal profiles, sleep apnea, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and increased scrotal temperatures, ultimately manifesting as impaired semen parameters.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112440747">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112440747"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112440747">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The consistency of these findings across studies and the reversibility of this pattern following weight loss suggest a causal role of increased body weight on the hormonal pattern, however, the repercussions on semen and fertility were not described enough before.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112440747">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Recently, 43 obese men (BMI 33-61 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), one third with baseline sperm concentrations below the WHO (2010) referent level of 15 million/mL, underwent 14-week weight loss program (15%; 3.5-25.4 kg loss). After subanalyses of less than 10 patients presenting the largest weight loss, an increase in total sperm count (<italic>P</italic> = .02), semen volume (<italic>P</italic> = .04), testosterone (<italic>P</italic> = .02), sex hormone binding globulin ([SHBG] <italic>P</italic> = .03), and anti-Müllerian hormone (<italic>P</italic> = .02) were found.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112440747">18</xref>
</sup> It is likely that, apart from due to chance, the differences in the semen parameters were secondary to the increase in semen volume, related to emission and accessory glands, once the sperm concentration has not changed (<italic>P</italic> = .33).</p>
<p>Our data pioneering focus on long-term (2 years) sperm profile of extremely obese men presenting very high BMI (mean 55.7 ± 7.8) who underwent bariatric surgery. We could not identify any significant improvement or deterioration in sperm parameters in this context, although hormonal and sexual functions significantly improved.</p>
<p>The unique aspect of our study is the evaluation of an initial weight loss through low-energy diet and intensive behavior modification (mean 12.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> BMI reduction) and subsequent additional massive weight loss through bariatric surgery (mean 24.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> BMI reduction) in well-selected MO men (BMI &gt;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Furthermore, the C group including MO men with unchanging high weight during follow-up represents the cumulative effect of obesity on fertility along time.</p>
<p>Confronting the presented results are 2 alarming anecdotal reports including 9 patients: 1 published in 2005, describing a series of 6 healthy, previously fertile male participants with complete spermatogenic arrest following gastric bypass<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112440747">12</xref>
</sup> and another very recent description of severe worsening of semen parameters after bariatric surgery with extreme oligoasthenoteratozoospermia in 3 patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112440747">13</xref>
</sup> The alterations were reversible after 24 months in 1 case, and successful clinical pregnancies were obtained in the other 2 after intracytoplasmic sperm injection with fresh spermatozoa.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112440747">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In this scenario, the current study is the best evidence regarding bariatric surgery repercussion on male fertility; although room for improvement, presented data point of possible unrecognized confounding aspects and/or selection bias in the previous reports.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112440747">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112440747">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Strengths of our study include the direct assessment of anthropometric measures and our ability to account for multiple potential confounders added to the prospective randomized design; neither of which has been the case in the previous studies (cross sectional). Furthermore, it has been shown that a single measure at each study period is enough to adequately represent the hormonal levels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112440747">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In line with our data is a study presenting increased levels of inhibin B among MO men, with the greatest amount of weight loss after bariatric surgery (on average 50 kg or 16.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), showing a possible benefit of massive weight loss on fertility or at least no harm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112440747">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, there are some limitations to our analysis. For technical reasons, inhibin B and DNA sperm fragmentation and leptin and SHBG levels were not measured, which could be of great value in future studies. Although the semen analysis has traditionally been the cornerstone in the evaluation of the infertile male and remains the initial test of choice, a normal spermiogram does not necessarily warrant the fertility potential, because it does not accurately assess sperm function in 100% cases.</p>
<p>The main shortcoming of the present study is the small number of patients, which must be expanded in future studies to confirm these preliminary findings. Additionally, further follow-up is needed; once in 24 months is relatively short to evaluate the fertility and also the birth rate as the ideal end point and future studies merit broaden investigation.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is that studied patients may not be a random sample of the male MO population considering the rigorous exclusion criteria and larger trials are fundamental to supplementary understanding of male fertility in this scenario (including many usual comorbidities presented by MO patients).</p>
<p>In addition to yield scientific information, such studies will also shed light on many issues of specific clinical questions of male behavior impacting fertility, warranting consideration in the discussion of per operative complications and in this regard, while definitive data are not available, reproductive impacts should be considered with caution while obtaining informed consent for bariatric surgery.</p>
<p>Additionally, given the suboptimal existing data on the possible short- and long-term effects of gastric bypass on the male reproductive system and the widespread and progressive indication of bariatric surgery to increasingly younger patients, better understanding of the indication of cryopreservation of semen samples in selected circumstances (subfertility/infertility) is considered room for future studies. A balanced judgment and a personalized case-by-case management with patient involvement in decisions are fundamental.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Surgery-induced massive weight loss did not interfere with sperm quality. However, it increased the quality of sexual function measured by IIEF-5 questionnaire, increased TT, FT, and FSH and reduced PRL levels. Lifestyle modifications impacted merely the BMI. New studies are warranted in the field, including infertile men and mostly considering birth rate as the primary end point optimally with the identification of the true biological father.</p>
