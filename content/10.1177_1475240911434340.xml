<abstract>
<p>It has been recognized that to increase the competitiveness of Finnish higher education institutions in the global education market international graduates’ employability must be enhanced. International graduates from Finnish higher education institutions are rarely employed in Finland for a number of reasons, such as the language barrier and a relatively small job market. This study aimed to understand from the employers’ perspective the possibilities of Finnish-educated international graduates finding jobs in Finnish companies in their home countries, taking Chinese graduates as an example. Using a qualitative approach mainly based on open-ended interviews at 16 Finnish companies in China, the investigation highlighted a dilemma: although the Finnish companies in China were generally inclined to recruit Finnish-educated Chinese graduates, few are employed there. This article explores the reasons behind the dilemma and discusses the implications for both students and universities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although this article is mainly about graduates’ employment prospects from the employers’ perspective, the initial ideas derive from considerations in marketing Finnish higher education, particularly how to make Finnish higher education institutions (HEIs) attractive to prospective students. Finland has a long tradition of free higher education, but recent Finnish higher education policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240911434340">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240911434340">Finnish Universities Act, 2009</xref>) have encouraged Finnish HEIs to develop a market-oriented approach to international higher education by implementing fee-based educational programmes for students from outside the European Union and the European Economic Area (hereafter referred to as international students). With respect to international students, there are two objectives to be achieved by 2015:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(1) the number of international degree students will be considerably increased, and</p>
<p>(2) international education will be developed as an export industry.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240911434340">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>: 10, 40). However, the two policy goals might be contradictory. As the majority of international students chose to study in Finland because of its free education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475240911434340">Kärki, 2005</xref>: 21), charging tuition fees may negatively affect the enrolment of international students in Finland, as evidenced by the similar experience in Denmark and Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1475240911434340">Tse, 2011</xref>). To secure successful concurrent achievement of both objectives, Finland needs to develop strategically the image of Finnish higher education, by which its attractiveness to international students will extend beyond a ‘free lunch’. It is believed that the high quality of education and research will continue to attract international students to study in Finland even after tuition fees are introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240911434340">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>: 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1475240911434340">Takkinen, 2010</xref>). However, as the quality of higher education cannot easily be measured and judged by students, in practice they are inclined to judge the quality of a higher education system or a particular institution by its international reputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240911434340">Marginson, 2006</xref>) and the career success of graduates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434340">Teichler, 2009</xref>: 15).</p>
<p>Institutional reputation is closely associated with university rankings. In this respect, most Finnish HEIs may in general be disadvantaged, owing to their relatively small size and the fact that they are less comprehensive than many other HEIs. The University of Helsinki is the only Finnish HEI in the top 100 of international university rankings. Owing to the invisibility of Finnish higher education in the ranking lists, when promoting it in international education markets it is very important to convince students of a promising employment future. However, there is little concrete data available on subsequent employment of international graduates from Finnish HEIs. One of the few studies was carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475240911434340">Majakulma (2010)</xref>, who investigated the employment of graduates with foreign backgrounds from Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences. For instance, she found that the employment rate of international graduates in English programmes was only 58%, while the rate for Finnish graduates was 81.9%. Moreover, there is a lack of in-depth analysis of international graduates’ employment prospects from the employers’ perspectives, particularly in the overseas labour markets. This article tries to fill the gap by examining how Finnish-educated international graduates satisfy the needs of Finnish employers abroad.</p>
<p>Despite the scarcity of research on the employment of Finnish-educated international graduates, a considerable amount of literature has been published on the relationship between international education attainment and labour market outcomes. Some studies indicate that when employers recruit foreigners, it is easier for them to recognize the educational credentials from their own countries than those from foreign institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475240911434340">Krahn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240911434340">Støren and Wiers-Jenssen, 2010</xref>). Therefore, it might be expected that international students’ education experience in Finland is likely to be valued by Finnish employers. However, noticing that there are many practical barriers faced by international students in the job market in Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475240911434340">Kärki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1475240911434340">Vehaskari, 2010</xref>), it may be more realistic to expect that international graduates will have better employment prospects in the Finnish companies located in their home countries.</p>
<p>This article takes Chinese graduates from Finnish HEIs as an example and investigates how they are valued by Finnish employers in China (hereafter referred to as the Finnish employers). In other words, how is the employability of Finnish-educated Chinese graduates (FECGs) perceived by Finnish employers? Employability can be understood in three aspects, namely:</p>
<list id="list1-1475240911434340" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the skills and abilities to find employment;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the skills and abilities to remain in employment; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the skills and abilities to obtain new employment when required.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475240911434340">Crossman and Clarke, 2010</xref>: 602). In this study, understanding of employability mainly emphasizes the first aspect. In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1475240911434340">Yorke (2004</xref>: 8) defines it as ‘a set of achievements – skills, understandings and personal attributes – that make graduates more likely to gain employment and be successful in their chosen occupations, which benefits themselves, the workforce, the community and the economy’.</p>
<p>Currently there are more than 2000 Chinese students studying in Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475240911434340">CIMO, 2010</xref>), and every year 300–400 graduates are estimated to leave Finland for China after completing their studies. In recent years, a growing number of Finnish companies and individuals have established businesses in China. By 2011, there were almost 300 Finnish companies in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475240911434340">Heimonen, 2011</xref>), employing around 30,000 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475240911434340">Helsinkin Sanomat, 2011</xref>). This study uses a qualitative approach based on open-ended interviews of 16 Finnish companies in Shanghai and Beijing, China, during November and December 2010. These companies represented the fields of information technology (<italic>n</italic> = 3), consulting (<italic>n</italic> = 3), production only (<italic>n</italic> = 3), production and sales (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and trading and sales (<italic>n</italic> = 3). In some companies, the chief executive officers (CEOs) agreed to talk with the author, while others arranged for their assistants, human resources (HR) directors, or sub-company manager to be interviewed instead or at the same time. In total, 18 employers were interviewed. Here, employers are defined as ‘those responsible for recruitment in employing organisations [who] effectively act as gatekeeper to the labour market’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240911434340">Maguire, 1992</xref>: 80). Their attitudes towards job-seekers are crucial in the final recruitment decisions. Among them, there were 10 CEOs (9 male and 1 female), 6 HR directors (1 male and 5 female), 1 assistant to CEO (female) and 1 subsidiary manager (male). In terms of nationality, 9 were Finns, 8 were Chinese and 1 was of another nationality.</p>

<title>Understanding relations between (international) education attainment and labour market outcomes</title>
<p>Literature on the relationship between international education attainment and labour market outcomes has shown that international education experience helps students to be employed either in the host countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240911434340">Baker and Benjamin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475240911434340">Borjas, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475240911434340">Bratsberg and Ragan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240911434340">Chiswick and Miller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475240911434340">Krahn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1475240911434340">Zeng and Xie, 2004</xref>) or in their home countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475240911434340">Blaug et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240911434340">Demetriades and Psacharopoulos, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1475240911434340">Mohajeri Norris and Gillespie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240911434340">Pang and Clark, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1475240911434340">Teichler, 2007</xref>). With respect to the relations between educational attainment and labour market outcomes, the majority of studies tend to apply human capital theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240911434340">Becker, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475240911434340">Schultz, 1961</xref>) or job market signalling (screening) theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475240911434340">Arrow, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475240911434340">Spence, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1475240911434340">Stiglitz, 1975</xref>). Although both theories imply a positive relationship between investment in education and labour market return, their explanations differ on the mechanisms concerning how education affects employment.</p>
<p>Human capital theory argues that education increases individuals’ productivity, which consequently enhances job performance. To better understand the differences between foreign and domestic education, a division between country specific and general human capital is made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475240911434340">Chiswick and Miller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240911434340">Duvander, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1475240911434340">Wiers-Jenssen, 2008</xref>). Country-specific human capital theory assumes that certain aspects of human capital such as ‘language skills, cultural skills, and professional skills adapted to national requirements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240911434340">Støren and Wiers-Jenssen, 2010</xref>: 31; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1475240911434340">Wiers-Jenssen, 2008</xref>: 106) tend to be more useful in some labour markets. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240911434340">Salisbury et al. (2009</xref>: 120) argue that a broad range of skills can be developed during the period of study abroad, such as ‘a deeper understanding and respect for global issues’, ‘more favourable attitudes toward other cultures’, ‘stronger intercultural communication skills’, ‘improved personal and professional self image’, ‘better foreign language skills’, ‘self-confidence’, ‘ability to handle ambiguity’, ‘insight into their own value systems’ and ‘overall maturity’. These authors have also indicated that such skills are normally acquired when individuals study abroad.</p>
<p>In contrast, signalling theory argues that education only serves as a tool for job-seekers to signal their inherent ability to employers. In other words, it is the innate ability and not education itself that increases productivity. Only very few studies deal with screening/signalling of international education in the labour markets. In his investigation of the early career of Norwegian graduates who had studied abroad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1475240911434340">Wiers-Jenssen (2008)</xref> discusses the signalling effects of foreign education by arguing that a foreign education experience generally signals certain country specific skills and characteristics of job seekers to employers. She asserts that foreign education’s signalling effect is weak, if it is less known by the employers.</p>
<p>Although both human capital and job-signalling theories seem to verify the intuition that education has a positive effect on individuals’ labour market outcomes, they have shortcomings too. First, it remains unclear what really matters in the recruitment process: human capital or job market signalling? There is no simple answer, as there has been a long debate among many empirical studies on what mechanisms work in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240911434340">Kjelland, 2008</xref>: 71–73). The situation can be more complicated in a cross-border context. Second, the studies applying either human capital theory or signalling theory mainly investigate the relationship between education and salary. They tend to take job start as the point of observation. It has been argued that there had been little attention paid to the processes of transition from education to employment until the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240911434340">Teichler, 2009</xref>: 15). When it comes to the transition from education to the workplace, employers’ perspectives are clearly relevant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1475240911434340">
<title>An analytical framework from employers’ perspectives</title>
<p>While either human capital theory or signalling theory considers educational output as a substance that can be identified and measured objectively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240911434340">Bailly (2008)</xref> takes a ‘non-substantialist’ approach to conceptualize educational output with a strong emphasis on employers’ points of view. One key aspect of educational output is concerned with graduates’ employability. Based on his conceptual framework, Bailly interviewed more than 20 recruiters in French companies and analysed their opinions concerning how vocational education programmes are capable of satisfying the requirements of the work place. According to this approach educational output, instead of being a substance, is susceptible to multiple interpretations. As Bailly states:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One of the consequences of emphasizing the role of beliefs is that educational output, as one element in [the] environment, no longer has the characteristics of a substance. Rather, it becomes dependent on economic agents’ beliefs and representations and on the (potentially multiple) evaluations to which they give rise. Educational output is, in this conception, what economic agents evaluate as such.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240911434340">Bailly, 2008</xref>: 963). According to both human capital theory and signalling theory, regarded as substantialist approaches by Bailly, the importance of education in labour market outcomes is that it either increases the students’ productivity-enhancement skills or signals the graduates’ innate abilities to employers. To Bailly, the validity of both human capital and signalling hypotheses depends on the employers’ belief systems. His conceptualization corroborates social and cognitive psychologists’ argument that individuals use schemas, frames, cognitive frameworks or belief systems to select and process information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240911434340">Simon, 1957</xref>). As belief systems become part of individuals’ unconscious and control them, they also govern employers’ decisions on employment.</p>
<p>Following a non-substantialist perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240911434340">Bailly (2008)</xref> reinterprets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475240911434340">Spence’s (1973)</xref> signalling model as a trial and error process in which employers develop their beliefs on educational output or the employability of graduates holding certain types of educational credentials. While Spence’s model emphasizes the signalling effects on the information transmitted, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240911434340">Bailly (2008)</xref> pays special attention to the role of employers’ beliefs in the informational feedback loop, describing the development of employers’ belief systems in three sequential stages. In the first stage, an employer has no experience of hiring job applicants with certain types of education credentials. The employer makes recruitment decisions based on his/her initial beliefs about the applicants, or ‘conditional probabilistic beliefs’, to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475240911434340">Spence’s (1973</xref>: 359) term. Specifically, the employer tends to attribute an anticipated level of productivity to these people depending on the information transmitted by job-applicants’ educational credentials, and then recruits on that basis. The second stage commences when the applicants are recruited. By observing the quality of these recruited employees, the employer’s initial beliefs are adjusted. If the employees’ performance is the same as assumed by the employer before the recruitment, the employer’s beliefs will be self-confirmed. Otherwise, the employer will correct his/her beliefs. ‘When he next comes to recruit, an employer will rely on his (new) beliefs, which he will adjust again depending on the difference in productivity observed after recruitment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240911434340">Bailly, 2008</xref>: 962). The third stage can be found when the process continues until an equilibrium is reached. That means the employer, through these successive learning processes, has accumulated enough experience to discover the candidates’ ‘true’ values. However, the final stage is more ideal than realistic.</p>
<p>In most companies interviewed, the development of employers’ beliefs was at the first stage, as they had rarely recruited any FECGs in their companies. Only six companies had Finnish-educated Chinese employees; one had three and the rest had either one or two. They were just entering into the second stage. Therefore, in general, the Finnish employers have not had much chance to evaluate the performance output of these people through the trial and error process. In other words, the employers’ perceptions of FECGs were heavily based on the information transmitted by their Finnish educational credentials. The empirical analysis as presented below focuses primarily on positive and negative images of FECGs in the eyes of Finnish employers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1475240911434340">
<title>Employers’ positive perceptions of the FECGs</title>
<p>The interviews generally showed that the Finnish educational credentials do transmit positive signals to the Finnish employers. The vast majority of the interviewees had positive perceptions of FECGs. They considered the Finnish education background a plus. For this reason, the Chinese job applicants with Finnish education backgrounds are likely to be selected for job interviews among hundreds of applicants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1475240911434340">
<title>Cross-cultural skills</title>
<p>The Finnish employers commonly believed that the FECGs have good cross-cultural skills. As native Chinese, the FECGs know the system of their home country. Since they have studied in Finland, they also understand Finnish culture and are aware of how Finns behave. First of all, the FECGs were perceived as being able to facilitate communication between Finnish managers and Chinese employees. As one interviewee noted, ‘He or she (a FECG) could transfer the message from the Finnish manager to local employees from a Chinese perspective, so that the Chinese recipients can easily understand and be committed.’ Through such ‘smooth communication’, the FECGs are expected to help the Finnish managers overcome many cultural challenges within the company.</p>
<p>Second, their cross-cultural skills help Finnish companies to operate in the Chinese market. As revealed by a Finnish CEO:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Typically for Finnish companies, it is very complicated to do business in China. Many of us are not very integrated into the Chinese market. Because in China the business goes in network, for Finnish companies it is much more difficult to get into the network than for Chinese companies. Therefore, FECGs can certainly help do better negotiations with Chinese partners and clients. Basically that’s the skill we need.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Third, cross-cultural skills may add value to technical production. The CEO of one computer software company noted that in general the FECGs had broader perspectives than those domestically trained. As he further explained:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The overseas experience provides much wider perspective and opens the eye of the people. They [FECGs] change their perspectives during studying abroad, and become aware of cultural differences as well as different approaches.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To this CEO, the computer software engineers with broader and cross-cultural perspectives can easily understand the clients and the society, and thus the products designed and coded by them are likely to be more appreciated by the clients, having a longer life-cycle in the market.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1475240911434340">
<title>Professional skills</title>
<p>Despite the importance of cross-cultural skills in the company, such skills per se will not guarantee employment. Technical or professional skills are needed as well. Finnish higher education is considered by Finnish employers as advanced in developing students’ practical skills and ability to solve problems. When it comes to the professional or technical skills of the FECGs, many employers tended to compare the differences between Finnish and Chinese education in general. Education in China is regarded as too much examination oriented, more theoretical and less practical. Comparably, those educated in Finland were perceived to have wider knowledge, better practical abilities and professional skills. Some employers also pointed out that the ability to learn new things can be one of the advantages of a Finnish education.</p>
<p>Some interviewees regarded certain academic fields in Finnish higher education as more advanced than in China. One Chinese HR director who graduated from Finland acknowledged that, in some fields such as information technology (IT), automation and machinery, Finnish higher education had an advantage compared to Chinese higher education. A Finnish CEO confirmed this point:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In Finland there are high-tech companies like Nokia. Universities can have very close cooperation with them. So they can adapt to the changes in the world, and the needs of the market. Therefore, up-to-date education can be available.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1475240911434340">
<title>Language skills</title>
<p>In Finnish companies in China, the working language is normally English and in some cases both English and Chinese. The Finnish managers expect their employees to speak good English. The vast majority of Chinese students in Finland participate in programmes taught in English, and only a very few of them could master the Finnish language at a satisfactory level. Finnish employers are aware of this. As such, they do not expect the FECGs to speak Finnish fluently. Of course, if someone has good Finnish-language skills, it would be highly appreciated. One interviewee noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I know that Finnish language is impossible to learn, but to speak Finnish language is a big plus … It opens possibilities. It’s also a social commitment to our culture. So … when you speak good Finnish language and you have the right technical skills in those technical companies, if you want to become a manager, you have a much better opportunity. … the Finnish companies will trust you much more if you speak the Finnish language.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This message points to the importance of mastering the Finnish language for those Chinese who want to become managers in Finnish companies in China. Nevertheless, only speaking the Finnish language is not enough for most work positions in Finnish companies. When I discussed with one Finnish CEO the employment prospects of graduates from the only undergraduate degree programme in Finnish language at the Beijing Foreign Studies University in China, he replied, ‘We don’t need people who only speak Finnish language; we also need technical background.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1475240911434340">
<title>Other soft skills</title>
<p>In addition, many interviewees pointed out other advantages of FECGs, such as the ability to work independently, capability of adjusting to a new environment, a straightforward way of communication, initiative, good work motivation, teamwork spirit, leadership skills and responsibility. Besides these skills, one Finnish CEO indicated that those educated in Finland tended to be more loyal to Finnish companies. As he said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Finland is really something in their heart. I know many people who have studied in Finland. If they quit from one Finnish company, they go to another Finnish company. So they like to work with our culture and they are used to our culture.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>Employer perceptions of the challenges associated with the FECG employment</title>
<p>Judging by the Finnish employers’ overall positive attitudes, a large number of employed FECGs might be expected to be seen in Finnish companies in China. As mentioned earlier, however, only a very few were employed in the interviewed companies. The employers also received only few job applications from FECGs. Why is this the case? Although positive attitudes towards FECGs are predominant, many employers have realized that the quality of FECGs depends on individuals. Some employers specifically pointed out some disadvantages of FECGs, including lack of work experience, lack of relevant cultural skills, over-qualification and low quality of applicants.</p>
<sec id="section10-1475240911434340">
<title>Lack of work experience</title>
<p>Lack of work experience is a crucial factor that prevents the FECGs from getting jobs. A general impression of most Finnish employers is that the FECGs normally do not have work experience. In a number of companies, the employers think that the FECGs could only make a contribution to their business when they had some practical experience. As the CEO of one IT company explained: ‘In our company, we don’t have anyone who doesn’t have any previous experience. … Work experience is a must.’</p>
<p>One HR director had a similar view point:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The scale of our company in China is small, only a few dozens [of employees]. Let’s first put aside the Finnish education background. When we recruit people, all the work positions require at least 3–5 years work experience, not mentioning the manager level. For ordinary service engineer and sales engineer, we need 3–5 years work experience. Therefore, we never attend any campus recruitment activities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1475240911434340">
<title>Cultural disadvantage</title>
<p>For some of the employers, a Finnish education experience is not necessarily an advantage. Several employers criticized the cultural skills of FECGs. It was noted by one HR director that the FECGs were at a disadvantage when working with local clients compared to those domestically educated people, mainly because of their lack of experience in the Chinese context. This point was further explained by one CEO:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They [FECGs] tend to forget how hard they live here [in China]. You understand it’s tough here. It’s very competitive. Maybe they come from Finland, thinking they have an advantage. Of course, when they meet local people and are working in foreign companies, suddenly they are going to be embarrassed, because their market strength is not as much as they thought.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another Finnish CEO thought that there are some elements in Chinese mentality and culture that facilitate the entrepreneurial spirit and high achievement motivation. However, his concern was whether the Chinese students would lose these ‘good’ characteristics after studying in Finland:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If Chinese people go to study in Finland, I don’t know which way it goes. Will they become more relaxed or laid-back? Can they still have the hunger and passion to grow? Here (in China) you have to work hard. Probably it depends on the people. Some people accept that you have to work very hard to proceed and make a living.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Isolation from the Chinese business environment can be a weakness of the FECGs. The worst situation occurs when the Chinese students have neither really understood Finnish culture nor developed adequate English-language skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1475240911434340">
<title>Over-qualification</title>
<p>The HR director of a production/sales company considered their company’s work in general very basic and lacking in challenges. Therefore, she assumed that the FECGs might be over-qualified to work in her company. ‘Even though they were recruited, they would hardly be retained.’ She further illustrated her point as follows.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When we recruited for administrative positions before, there were many applicants with a foreign education background. When I looked their CVs and applications, I paid more attention to their job-seeking intention. If the position could not offer them a better career development opportunity, this would cause me concern. … If the job is boring, I won’t consider those candidates. Unless the job is very challenging and innovative, I won’t consider those guys.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, she believed that those Chinese with overseas degrees had high ability. She was simply afraid that their high expectation could not be met with the work offered by her company.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1475240911434340">
<title>Low quality of applicants</title>
<p>Finally, a small number of interviewees had a negative perception of the quality of FECGs, particularly of those who graduated from Finnish universities of applied sciences (or polytechnics). One HR director had a negative perception of the quality of some overseas graduates:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There is now a flood of studying abroad, and it is not necessary that a foreign education background must be good. We all know that some students could not gain access to good universities in China, and then choose to study abroad. Of course, some of them are very aspiring. We cannot make judgements simply based on a diploma.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1475240911434340">
<title>Factors impeding recruitment</title>
<p>The interviews also suggest a number of factors that impede FECGs’ employment possibilities in Finnish companies in China. First, the FECGs ask for salaries that the employers cannot meet. Many Finnish employers will consider paying a higher salary, but definitely not a ‘Finnish salary’. Second, the attractiveness of FECGs to a Finnish company also depends on the nature of the company’s business and the nationality of the CEO. Moreover, there are information barriers between Finnish employers and the FECGs. It is difficult for the FECGs to search for Finnish companies as potential work places. They may not even be aware that there are so many Finnish companies in China. Meanwhile, similar challenges are faced by Finnish companies in finding the FECGs. Another reason for the difficulty in matching the FECGs and Finnish employers is that many competent Chinese students want to stay in Finland after graduation.</p>

<sec id="section15-1475240911434340">
<title>Lessons for Chinese students and Finnish universities</title>
<p>On the basis of these findings, both Finnish HEIs and Chinese students studying at those institutions may take note of the following conclusions.</p>
<sec id="section16-1475240911434340">
<title>Chinese students</title>
<p>One central concern of Chinese students studying in Finland is their future employment. It has been reported that Finnish-educated international graduates face many setbacks in pursuing gainful employment in Finland, because of Finnish employers’ unrealistically high expectations of Finnish-language mastery, bureaucracy in residence permit processing, lack of professional networks and the ‘ceiling effect’ for career advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1475240911434340">Vehaskari, 2010</xref>). Compared to working in Finland, the FECGs are at an advantage in the Chinese labour market. Most of these barriers will not hinder them when they work at home. Meanwhile, the merits praised by the Finnish employers are also likely to be appreciated by other employers in China. On the one hand, those Chinese who have studied abroad have been considered by the Chinese government as special human resources. On the other hand, the overseas returnees are welcomed by foreign companies in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475240911434340">Liu, 2007</xref>: 50).</p>
<p>Although FECGs in general are advantageously positioned to work in Finnish companies in China, this study has uncovered some gaps between the skills/characteristics of FECGs and the demands of Finnish employers, which have been mainly reflected by the employers’ negative perceptions. Chinese students should be aware that gaining a Finnish diploma without actually increasing their knowledge and skills will not make them successful in the labour market. According to the Finnish employers, the following skills are expected from the FECGs: good professional knowledge; ability to solve practical problems; English- (and Finnish-) language skills; cross-cultural perspectives; and work experience. Students in Finland should develop their professional knowledge and problem solving abilities, understand Finnish culture with more interaction with local society, and accumulate work experience during their study in Finland (undertaking part-time work and internships).</p>
<p>When making job applications, FECGs should be realistic in their salary expectations. There is seemingly a perception that overseas education experience leads to a higher income. Finnish employers generally acknowledge the Chinese students’ investment in their education in Finland (though the education is free of charge), and are willing to pay a higher salary compared to those domestically educated, but only at a reasonable level. Most Finnish employers in this study complained that the FECGs usually ask for too high a salary. The tendency for foreign-educated Chinese graduates to expect high incomes can be explained by human capital theory, which focuses on the economic value of education. At the individual level, education can have a direct and measurable impact on productivity, and in turn on the labour market outcomes, including incomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475240911434340">Harris and Jarrett, 1990</xref>). Although the motivations driving Chinese students to study abroad are diverse, one common expectation is that of gaining added value through studying abroad making them competitive in the job market. For this purpose, individual students are willing to invest in their human capital development, specifically developing country-specific skills. They hope the investment will be repaid by higher incomes in future work. However, the additional salary paid by the Finnish employers is not intended simply to compensate their high living expenses during studies in Finland. Rather, it is paid for their skills and productivity. As a lack of prior work experience becomes a major barrier to many FECGs’ employment, they might be well advised to consider their first job as a continuation of investment on enhancing employability through gaining work experience instead of as a turning point, where they are starting to recoup their investment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1475240911434340">
<title>Finnish universities</title>
<p>The results of the empirical analyses can be an encouragement for Finnish HEIs, as the Finnish employers have to a large extent affirmed the quality of Finnish higher education despite noting some challenges. However, currently only a very few FECGs are currently working in Finnish companies, mainly due to the lack of an information platform between education and the work place. In other words, the employers and students do not know how to find each other. Finnish HEIs need to consider what they can do to facilitate the information exchange between their graduates and the potential employers. They need to provide the employers with information about their graduates and also let the graduates know who possible employers are. Another challenge concerning information transmission is how to inform both the prospective students and the employers about the true value of Finnish higher education and the quality of its graduates in order to support both student recruitment and graduate employment.</p>
<p>It was stressed earlier in this article that to fill in the gaps between the skills of FECGs and the demands of the Finnish employers requires commitment from students. It is also the Finnish HEIs’ responsibility to equip students with skills needed in the labour market. Currently, Finnish HEIs have not paid sufficient attention to improving the international students’ employability. In a tuition-free system, Finnish HEIs mainly deal with three tasks with international students: recruiting them, educating them and graduating them. However, since the recent reform, Finnish HEIs are under pressure to re-think their strategies for international students. To succeed in the international student markets, Finnish HEIs should pay more attention to employers’ concerns. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240911434340">Bailly (2008</xref>: 963) has argued, the educational output becomes dependent on employers’ beliefs and representations. For the purposes of both strengthening the relevance of education to the labour market and promoting information exchange between students and employers, the HEIs need to partner with potential employers, especially Finnish companies, in their education and training activities. This is an aspect that has so far been underdeveloped in Finland.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has investigated how the quality of Finnish-educated Chinese graduates satisfies the needs of Finnish companies in China. Generally speaking, on the basis of this study it would appear that most employers have positive attitudes towards FECGs as they believe that the FECGs are easy to communicate with owing to their proficiency in the English language and their understanding of Finnish culture; they could help the companies to overcome cultural challenges through cross-cultural perspectives; and they have good professional knowledge and hands-on skills. Despite some negative views shared by a minority of interviewees, it can be concluded that the Finnish employers are usually satisfied with the quality and skills of most FECGs. However, it is a fact that among the interviewed companies only a very small number of FECGs are employed. Based on the interview analysis, there are two main reasons for this. One concerns employers’ negative perceptions of the graduates. The other includes a number of factors constraining recruitment, among which the most critical is the lack of information exchange between the graduates and employers.</p>
<p>While considering all the lessons suggested above, Finnish HEIs specially need to think proactively and plan how to influence employers. Finnish employers’ perceptions of FECG employability primarily stay at stage one of Bailly’s model, or only partially enter stage two. What an employer perceives with respect to graduates’ employability is thus heavily based on information transmitted by their educational credentials. However, a diploma alone does not automatically ensure acceptance. It is also the Finnish higher education stakeholders’ responsibility to promote the quality of education and its relevance to the employers in the labour market. As Bailly suggests, employers will eventually discover the true value of the graduates through successive observation of those employed. What is therefore essential for Finnish higher education is to know what skills are needed in the labour markets, and to provide their students with those skills.</p>
<p>Although this article only addresses the context of Finnish universities and Chinese students, the lessons drawn here are hopefully useful for other HEIs in similar contexts: where the country size is small and the first language is not English, and international students form part of the student body. For HEIs in countries similar to Finland, there is a desire to establish a ‘positive loop’ between attractiveness to gifted international students at the input end and career success of graduates at the output end. To achieve such a goal is by no means easy. The successful experiences of the English-speaking education-exporting countries may not always apply to Finland and other countries facing similar challenges. They need innovative ways of thinking and to develop innovative approaches. Nevertheless, the HEIs could hardly achieve this objective by themselves alone. The involvement of other sectors (such as industry) and national coordination are also needed. Among many other possible efforts, from an academic perspective the author calls for enhanced dialogue between three research areas, namely marketing international education, development of employability, and employers’ perceptions of graduates’ quality and performance at work. Studies on each dimension have so far been mainly conducted separately, but they are all interrelated and would benefit from greater understanding of the relationships between these different facets of an increasingly important area.</p>
