<title>Background</title>
<p>Obtaining surrogate consent for clinical research studies conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting is logistically challenging.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1740774512464727">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>To determine whether differences in proportions consenting to trial enrollment existed among patients eligible to consent directly versus those requiring surrogate decision makers in a minimal-risk study to evaluate the accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring in the ICU setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1740774512464727">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Low initial enrollment rates prompted a detailed tracking of the screening and consent process. We analyzed the subset of eligible patients identified during a single year to document whether they were approached about trial enrollment, whether they consented or declined, the reasons for declining, and the method of consent (self or surrogate). The proportion of participants who consented and the reasons for declining were compared for self-consenting and surrogate-consenting participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1740774512464727">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 3041 patients screened, one-third (n = 982) were eligible; 119 of the 982 were approached regarding enrollment. Absence of a surrogate accounted for the majority of eligible patients (726; 84%) not approached. The most common reasons for refusal in the self versus surrogate groups included feeling overwhelmed (13% vs 24%), fear of discomfort (22% vs 12%), and fear of risk (7% vs 4%). Of the 57 eligible patients capable of consenting directly, 11 (19%) enrolled versus 12 (19%) of the 62 who required surrogate consent. When recruitment hours were expanded to include evening time, more eligible patients or their surrogates could be approached than during the day-shift hours alone. Consent was obtained for a larger proportion of potential participants with a history of diabetes (40%) than for those without a history of diabetes (14%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1740774512464727">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The findings are from a subset of the entire study sample; data were available only for participants who could be approached, who may have differed from those who could not be approached.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1740774512464727">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Surrogate and self-consent rates were similar. Surrogate unavailability was a major barrier to enrollment; overlap of staffing with usual visiting hours should be considered when planning trials in the ICU.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Consent for clinical research participation obtained via a surrogate decision maker imposes unique logistical barriers. Personnel involved in conducting clinical research studies in the intensive care unit (ICU) that require surrogate consent need to be aware of the challenges inherent in its implementation. Effective planning may reduce potential barriers. Several reviews of the challenges experienced by investigators in this type of research have appeared in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512464727">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512464727"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512464727"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512464727"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512464727">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Strategies employed to reduce barriers include the investment of additional resources in the screening and recruitment phase of the study to engage with families during off-shift hours and weekends, sensitivity to the complexities of families in crisis, and understanding the experience of the guardian/surrogate being approached for consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774512464727">6</xref>]. In particular, the reasons why they may or may not give permission may provide insight into ways that investigators can make the process less burdensome and/or stressful for the patients’ representatives, especially in studies where the potential benefit to the individual participant may be minimal. For example, studies implementing new procedures or examining the utility of a device in a specific setting are necessary in order to advance science but may offer little benefit for the individual participant.</p>
<p>Strategies for increasing enrollment have been analyzed through a comprehensive review of factors that may affect recruitment, such as trial design, role of recruiter (i.e., physician vs research assistant), randomization, and provision of information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512464727">7</xref>]. The main factor that appeared to increase the likelihood of enrollment was prior awareness by the prospective participant of the health issue being studied. One group of researchers reported that lack of surrogate accessibility and availability to give consent was a major barrier to enrollment when patients were deemed eligible but incapable of consenting directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512464727">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The primary aim of this analysis was to compare the rates of surrogate and self-consent among eligible patients enrolled in a minimal-risk continuous glucose monitoring study in the ICU. We hypothesized that the consent rates among surrogate decision makers would be lower than among self-consenters. We also compared reasons for declining consent among surrogates and self-consenters, and examined the impact on enrollment of coverage of evening hours by study staff.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-1740774512464727">
<title>Participants and setting</title>
<p>The Continuous Glucose Monitoring during Critical Illness study was conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), a 900-bed academic medical center in Boston. The protocol was approved by the local institutional review board (IRB). The study investigated the accuracy of a continuous glucose monitoring system (Freestyle Navigator, Abbott) compared to glucose values obtained during routine monitoring in the ICU setting. Informed consent was obtained directly from the potential participant or from the legal surrogate whenever the potential participant was not able to consent.</p>
<p>Participants were recruited from the medical intensive care unit (MICU), surgical intensive care unit (SICU), and neurological intensive care unit (Neuro ICU). Eligible patients had insulin ordered and an arterial or central venous line in place. Exclusion criteria were age less than 18 years or enrollment in another clinical trial that would affect glucose management. Demographic data, length of ICU stay, diagnosis of diabetes, and laboratory data were collected from medical records for the enrolled participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1740774512464727">
<title>Screening and enrollment</title>
<p>Screening occurred on days and at times when study personnel were available. Once the study staff member (nurse, nurse practitioner, or physician) responsible for explaining the trial and obtaining consent had identified possible participants, they ascertained whether the patient was able to provide self-consent. Whenever the patient was able to consent, he or she was approached, and the study protocol was described by a study staff member. When surrogate consent was needed, the health-care proxy or family member/next of kin (if a health-care proxy had not been appointed) was approached, when available. Consent had to be obtained in person, as required by the IRB; telephone consent was not allowed.</p>
<p>Once consent was obtained, a nurse or physician from the study team proceeded with sensor placement. The sensor (5.5 mm in length) was inserted in the subcutaneous tissue of the arm or abdomen using a spring-loaded insertion device. The Freestyle Navigator system also comprises a transmitter that is attached to the sensor and a receiver that processes and stores data sent by the transmitter. The system directly measures interstitial fluid glucose. After it is calibrated with plasma glucose, it provides an estimated plasma glucose level once every minute. The patient-care nurses continued to measure the patient’s glucose levels from an arterial or central line according to the usual practice on that floor. The receiver unit was set to alarm at any value below 60 mg/dL or above 300 mg/dL in order to alert the floor nurse to perform an additional glucose-level measurement. The glucose values were not displayed on the receiver. Participants wore the sensor for up to 72 h or until discharged from the ICU.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>For this analysis, we report on a subset of all eligible patients identified from medical records between 1 January and 31 December 2010. For each trial candidate, we documented the following parameters: whether they were approached, whether they consented or declined, reasons for declining, and method of consent (self or surrogate). Reasons for refusal were categorized as follows: (1) overwhelmed, (2) fear of discomfort, (3) fear of risk, (4) no reason given, (5) declined all research, (6) other, and (7) no decision made. The earlier phase of the study informed the categories that were chosen as the most common reasons for consent refusal. Comparisons were made between groups using the Chi-square test and the one-way <italic>t</italic>-test as appropriate.</p>

<sec id="section12-1740774512464727" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 3041 medical records were prescreened for presence of an insulin order and an arterial or central venous catheter. Approximately two-thirds (n = 1857) of all prescreened cases did not meet our inclusion criteria; the eligibility status was not determined for 202 (7%) of the cases, and 982 were deemed eligible. A total of 42% (n = 410) of the 982 eligible patients were from the Neuro ICU, 30% (n = 295) were from the MICU, and 28% (n = 277) were from the SICU.</p>
<p>Of the 982 eligible patients, 119 (12%) were approached, either directly or through a surrogate. Of the remaining 863 potential participants who could not be approached, the majority (726; 84%) were not approached because they were not capable of providing informed consent and their surrogates were not available. The reasons for not approaching the remaining 16% are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774512464727">Table 1</xref>. Of the 119 potential participants approached, 57 were capable of self-consent and 62 required a surrogate; 25 of the 119 candidates approached had diabetes.</p>

<p>Adding study staff to cover evening hours increased the proportion of candidates approached; 52 (16%) of 318 eligible patients were approached when recruitment hours were extended to the evening hours versus 67 (10%) of 664 eligible patients approached when recruitment was conducted during day-shift hours alone. Of the 25 eligible patients approached who were known to have diabetes, 40% consented in contrast to only 14% of the 94 approached who did not have documented diabetes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1740774512464727" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study show no difference in consent rates between eligible patients approached for surrogate and self-consent in the ICU setting. These results were contrary to our hypothesis that it would be more difficult to obtain consent from surrogates, who might fear that their decision could harm a spouse or immediate family member. The similar consent rates suggest that surrogates, as a group, acted as the patients themselves, as a group, would have done. Consistent with our expectations and with other published reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512464727">5</xref>], we found that lack of surrogate accessibility and availability was a major barrier to enrollment. Not surprisingly, we found that adding evening hours to our recruitment schedule was effective and increased the percentage of eligible patients who could be approached.</p>
<p>Our data are consistent with higher rates of enrollment when eligible patients are aware of a relevant health issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512464727">7</xref>], as a larger proportion of patients with diabetes enrolled. A large majority of eligible patients had not had a diagnosis of diabetes; instead, they had hyperglycemia of critical illness, which may have contributed to the small proportion of this subgroup who enrolled.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1740774512464727">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This analysis focused on a subset of the entire study sample; however, this sample included all patients screened during one calendar year to reduce selection bias. Data were available only for eligible patients who could be approached; this population may have differed from those who could not be approached. It is also possible that we failed to identify a history of diabetes in some of the candidates we approached who had such a history. Although during screening we made note of whether each potential participant had diabetes recorded on the problem list, we did not perform a detailed chart review unless an eligible patient consented to participate. Underestimating the prevalence of diabetes in participants who did not consent would have exaggerated the apparent effect of having diabetes on the likelihood of consent. Finally, we were not permitted to collect detailed data regarding eligible patients who did not consent, preventing us from determining whether severity of illness was related to consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1740774512464727" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Recruiting for a study that confers minimal benefit to the participant is challenging in any setting, but it is exceptionally difficult in the milieu of an intensive care environment. Surrogate availability proved to be a major barrier to enrollment. We added evening shifts for study staff to provide additional opportunities to approach surrogates and thereby increased enrollment. Reasons for refusal of consent were largely consistent between the self-consent and surrogate consent groups; our experience may be useful to designers of future ICU-based studies.</p>
