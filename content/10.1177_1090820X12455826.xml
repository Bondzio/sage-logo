<title>Background:</title>
<p>Rhytidectomy is fundamentally an operation of tissue release and resuspension, although the manner and direction of suspension are subject to perpetual debate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090820X12455826">
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>The authors describe a method for identifying the angle of maximal rejuvenation during rhytidectomy and quantify the resulting angle and its relationship to patient age.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090820X12455826">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Patients were prospectively enrolled; demographic data, history, and operative details were recorded. Rhytidectomies were performed by the senior author (AAJ). After complete elevation, the face-lift flap was rotated in a medially-based arc (0-90°) while attention was given to the submental area, jawline, and midface. The angle of maximal rejuvenation for each hemiface was identified as described, and the flap was resuspended. During redraping, measurements of vertical and horizontal skin excess were recorded in situ. The resulting angle of lift was then calculated for each hemiface using trigonometry. Symmetry between sides was determined, and the effect of patient age on this angle was assessed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1090820X12455826">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Three hundred hemifaces were operated (147 women; 3 men). Mean age was 60 years (range, 37-80 years). Mean resulting angle for the cohort was 60° from horizontal (range, 46-77°). This was inversely correlated with patient age (<italic>r</italic> = −.3). Younger patients (&lt;50 years, 64°) had a significantly more vertical angle than older patients (≥70 years, 56°; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0002). No significant intersubject difference was found between hemifaces (<italic>P</italic> = .53).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1090820X12455826">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The authors present a method for identifying the angle of maximal rejuvenation during rhytidectomy. This angle was more superior than posterior in all cases and is intimately related to patient age. Lasting results demand a detailed anatomical understanding and strict attention to the direction and degree of laxity.</p>

<body>
<p>Age-related changes of the face and neck have become a focus of a significant body of medical literature and the target of a significant amount of medical care in our society. Although their extent and relative contributions may be debated, it is generally agreed that 3 major factors contribute to the aging face: (1) repeated exposure to ultraviolet (UV) spectrum radiation resulting in dyschromias and solar elastosis; (2) the laxity of musculocutaneous and fasciocutaneous ligaments, resulting in ptosis of the soft tissue envelope with exposure of underlying skeletal elements and augmentation of facial subunit boundaries; and (3) relative devolumization of the face related to loss of adipose tissue and resorption of the bony skeleton (specifically in the orbital, malar, and maxillary prominences).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12455826">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12455826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12455826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455826"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12455826">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rhytidectomy in all its forms is a surgical procedure for which the raison d’être is radical treatment of facial aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12455826">6</xref></sup> Over the past 50 years, significant advances have been made in our understanding of and approach to rhytidectomy. The first attempts at surgical rejuvenation of the face were limited to lateral subcutaneous dissection and resection of excess skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12455826">6</xref></sup> Beginning with Skoog,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X12455826">7</xref></sup> a more lasting approach was sought via dissection in a deeper tissue plane. This concept was bolstered by the subsequent description of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) by Mitz and Peyronie.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12455826">8</xref></sup> Treatment of this layer became an essential element of rhytidectomy, whether through SMAS-plication, SMAS-imbrication, SMAS-ectomy, elevation of an extended-SMAS flap, or a deep-plane technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455826">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X12455826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12455826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12455826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X12455826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X12455826"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X12455826">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite these advances, some controversy remains regarding the ideal vector for repositioning of the skin and facial soft tissues in rhytidectomy. In this study, we describe a method for identification of the angle of maximal rejuvenation in the aging face. Further, we present a prospective, quantitative analysis of 300 hemifaces undergoing rhytidectomy in an effort to delineate this vector and its relationship to patient age.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-1090820X12455826">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>Patients undergoing an elective rhytidectomy were prospectively enrolled in this study over an approximately 30-month period. All patients seeking rhytidectomy for aesthetic indications were evaluated, including those undergoing secondary rhytidectomy. Patients seeking surgery for functional issues, such as facial paralysis or other reconstructive indications, were excluded. In addition, patients undergoing secondary rhytidectomy within 10 years of the primary surgery were excluded to avoid difficulty in distinguishing the effects of the procedure performed by the first surgeon from those that were a result of the technique developed and employed in our study. In total, over a 30-month period, 160 consecutive rhytidectomies were performed. Of these, 150 patients (300 hemifaces) were enrolled in this prospective outcomes study, while 10 patients undergoing secondary rhytidectomy within 10 years of the primary surgery were excluded.</p>
<p>Patient demographics and medical history were recorded. Particular attention was given to previous aesthetic facial surgery, and for patients undergoing revision rhytidectomy, the time elapsed between procedures was noted. All surgical procedures were performed by the senior author (AAJ) at a private practice surgery center. Standard photographs (5 views) were taken preoperatively and at various points throughout the first postoperative year.</p>

<sec id="section8-1090820X12455826">
<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>All patients underwent an extended deep-plane rhytidectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12455826">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X12455826">17</xref></sup> The procedure was performed as originally described by Hamra,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12455826">12</xref></sup> but with modification of the incision placement and treatment of the platysma as described by the senior author (AAJ).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12455826">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12455826">16</xref></sup> A temporal hair tuft–sparing incision was used anteriorly. In addition, the posterior limb of the incision continued around the earlobe onto the concha vertically to the level of the porion. Last, the deep-plane flap was extended inferiorly into the neck along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to provide a greater degree of freedom during flap rotation and suspension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12455826">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12455826">16</xref></sup></p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1090820X12455826-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>After complete elevation of the composite skin and SMAS flap, the angle of maximal rejuvenation was determined for the hemiface. This technique can be used similarly in biplanar techniques with separate laminar redraping of skin and SMAS, both in the same direction. Three suspension sutures (3-0 nylon) were placed in the lateral shelf of the deep-plane flap; the inferior-most suture corresponded approximately to the angle of the mandible, and the remaining sutures were evenly spaced superiorly along the remainder of the flap.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12455826">16</xref></sup> Using these sutures, or 2 Brown-Adson forceps, the flap was placed under a moderate amount of tension and then rotated through a medially-based arc.</p>
<p>Rotation began from directly horizontal (0°) and moved toward the vertical axis (90°); for the left hemiface, this was counterclockwise, whereas the right was clockwise. As the flap was moved, careful attention was given to the submental area, jawline, and midface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12455826">Figure 2</xref>). The angle that resulted in the greatest reduction of submental laxity and jowling, without flattening the midface (as seen with overly horizontal flap redraping) or creating malar bunching and lateral-facial pleats (as seen with overly vertical flap redraping), was selected. (Overly horizontal tightening in the neck results in anterior submental bunching, and overly vertical tightening results in anterior neck laxity.) The position and orientation of the angle of the mouth were not affected since there was no subcutaneous dissection in this area, and the deep plane was elevated to the nasolabial fold only. Suspension of the facial portion of the deep-plane flap began from inferior to superior. Attention was then turned to the cervical portion of the flap. Two sutures (3-0 nylon) were required in most cases for suspension of the platysma. If a lateral myotomy was required, this was made approximately at the angle of the mandible; the inferior and superior leaves of the flap were suspended to the mastoid periosteum and infra-auricular deep tissue, respectively.</p>

<caption><p>Determining the angle of maximal rejuvenation, prior to face-lift flap resuspension; intraoperative photos are paired with schematic illustrations. Flap rotation begins at 0° (A, B) and progresses to 90° (C, D). The angle of maximal rejuvenation occurs where submental laxity is alleviated, the jawline is smooth, and the malar fat pad is repositioned (E, F). Note the benign mole on the patient’s left lower cheek (which was removed at the time of surgery); this lesion changes position accordingly, as different vectors are applied.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1090820X12455826-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The flap was subsequently redraped without tension and the skin was trimmed as needed. This began in the temporal region. The vertical skin excess was measured from the temporal hair-tuft incision at the root of the helix to the most distal vertical point of the redraped flap. Once this key point was established, the lateral portion of the flap was redraped pre- and postauricularly. In a small number of cases (15%), a posterior limb of the incision was created or modified at that point to eliminate bunching. The horizontal skin excess was measured from the superior extent of the incision to the most distal horizontal edge of the redraped flap. Skin to be excised was measured in situ after placement of a key tacking suture; all measurements were recorded in millimeters.</p>
<p>Standard trigonometry was used to calculate the resulting vector following suspension at the angle of maximal rejuvenation. Vertical and horizontal skin excision measurements were used to create a right triangle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090820X12455826">Figure 3</xref>). Using the tangent function measurements of skin excess, the angle of maximal rejuvenation was determined relative to the horizontal (see below).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 150 patients enrolled in the study (300 hemifaces), there were 147 women and 3 men, and the average age of the cohort was 60 years (range, 40-80 years). Primary rhytidectomy was performed in 124 cases, whereas 26 cases were revisions taking place more than 10 years after the initial surgery. Although the purpose of this study was a detailed analysis of the intraoperative technique, the average length of follow-up for the cohort was 14 months.</p>
<p>There were no major morbidities throughout the study period. No permanent facial nerve injuries occurred. Three patients had a small hematoma in the preauricular area, requiring needle drainage; 1 patient had a larger hematoma in the neck requiring reoperation. One patient developed a moderate cellulitis, which required an extended course of antibiotics. Preauricular skin slough (approximately 4 cm<sup>2</sup>) developed in a patient with a remote history of cervicofacial external beam radiation therapy for a parotid malignancy. The patient was treated with hyperbaric oxygen perioperatively, and the area of concern healed completely over an 8-week period.</p>
<p>Mean skin excision for the cohort overall was 31 mm in the vertical dimension (range, 16-49 mm) and 18 mm in the horizontal direction (range, 9-30 mm). The average angle of maximal rejuvenation was 60° from horizontal (range, 46-77°). A breakdown of skin excess and angle according to patient age is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X12455826">Table 1</xref>. It is important to note that hemifaces were analyzed and treated separately. Average difference between hemifaces was 5°, and intersubject comparison of data from each hemiface did not show a significant difference between sides (<italic>P</italic> = .54).</p>

<p>The evolution of rhytidectomy over the past 30 years has resulted in more natural-appearing and longer-lasting results for many patients, as greater emphasis has been placed on suspension of the SMAS utilizing different methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12455826">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X12455826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12455826"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12455826">12</xref></sup> There remains, however, a significant debate in the literature regarding the direction of pull or vector that provides the greatest benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455826">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X12455826">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X12455826"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X12455826">15</xref></sup> In our study, we sought to quantify this elusive entity—the angle of maximal rejuvenation—and propose a method for its identification during rhytidectomy.</p>
<p>Again, rhytidectomy is fundamentally an operation of tissue release and resuspension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455826">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12455826">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X12455826">13</xref></sup> Different opinions exist regarding how much release is necessary and in what plane of dissection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455826">9</xref></sup> In addition, many authors have advocated for a particular direction (or multiple directions) of tissue suspension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12455826">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X12455826">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X12455826">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X12455826">19</xref></sup> Unfortunately, it is often unclear how this vector is determined and, furthermore, the same operation is generally performed on all of a given surgeon’s patients without regard to patient-specific anatomical issues.</p>
<p>Today’s patients are familiar with the “pulled,” “wind-swept,” and “operated” look that is the hallmark of traditional rhytidectomy. These obvious defects result from a misunderstanding of the process of release and resuspension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X12455826">15</xref></sup> We feel that the process of flap suspension must follow a complete release of the facial retaining ligaments and must be individually determined intraoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12455826">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12455826">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090820X12455826">20</xref></sup> It is the adjustments necessitated by each patient’s unique anatomy that are the key to a natural-appearing and lasting result. We further advocate the need for volume repletion in modern facial rejuvenation with a variety of techniques (including fat transfer and alloplastic implants) due to soft tissue atrophy and bone loss.</p>
<p>In our study, 300 hemifaces were lifted. Calculation of the angles of maximal rejuvenation in each case shows that flap suspension is indeed <italic>superoposterior</italic>, not posterior, superior, or even <italic>posterosuperior.</italic> In all hemifaces, regardless of patient age, this angle was found to be greater than 45° from the horizontal. A careful review of facial and cervical anatomy will demonstrate why. First, pulling in an overly horizontal direction results in tightening of the flap directly against the hyoid and infrahyoid neck, leaving the submental area relatively loose and resulting in bunching or residual redundancy in this area. In addition, a horizontal vector flattens the midface and tightens the skin envelope over the infraorbital rim, thus accentuating the hollow in this area that is a hallmark of the aging face and contributing to the “wind-swept” look (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12455826">Figure 2A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12455826">B</xref>). Second, pulling in an overly vertical direction results in tightening of the flap directly against the suprahyoid neck and mandible; this leaves residual laxity in the anterior neck. In addition, a purely vertical vector causes midfacial bunching in the lateral canthal region and may lead to vertical pleats in the lateral neck. Changes in apparent eye shape from tissue excess at the lateral canthus may be a source of significant dissatisfaction in some patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12455826">Figure 2C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12455826">D</xref>). Finally, when the patient-specific angle of maximal rejuvenation is determined intraoperatively, the deep tissues of the face and neck, along with the overlying skin, are tightened into the concavity of the cervicomental angle along the hyoid attachments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12455826">Figure 2E</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12455826">F</xref>). The midfacial tissues are also repositioned, resulting in revolumization and rejuvenation of the malar-infraorbital complex. For 260 hemifaces, we found that this angle was 60° on average but ranged from 46 to 77°. This angle required wrapping the anterior incision around the temporal hair tuft with variable vertical extension. A tricophytic incision was used and closed with interrupted vertical mattress sutures, alleviating concerns about visible scars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1090820X12455826">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>In our protocol, a deep-plane rhytidectomy was performed as described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12455826">16</xref></sup> It is worth noting that a previous hemiface study comparing deep-plane and SMAS-lift approaches in the same patient failed to show a significant or identifiable difference in midfacial rejuvenation between sides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090820X12455826">21</xref></sup> We believe that the lack of midface improvement in this study was not related to the efficacy of a composite/deep-plane technique but rather the angle of the flap resuspension. This study preceded the advent of vertical-vector face-lifting, which was subsequently described and popularized by the minimal access cranial suspension (MACS) lift and derivative operations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X12455826">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090820X12455826">22</xref></sup> This vertical emphasis, combined with the deep-plane technique’s release of the zygomaticocutaneous ligaments, elevated the malar fat pad and diminished the nasolabial fold, whereas a horizontal-based lift tends to flatten the midface without significant elevation.</p>
<p>In our cohort, the angle of maximal rejuvenation was intimately related to patient age, with older patients typically demonstrating a somewhat lower (more horizontal) angle. In fact, examination of the results according to age decile shows a “dose-dependent” response of age on the angle of maximal rejuvenation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X12455826">Table 1</xref>). This implies that older patients, on average, had a relatively greater amount of horizontal soft tissue laxity than younger patients. We acknowledge, however, that other factors (such as devolumization and solar elastosis) can influence the angle of rotation with each age decile, but on average, the “dose-dependency” of age is statistically significant. In the elderly, with visible skin lines and thin skin, there may be transition zones when employing our technique with a biplanar rhytidectomy. Our use of the deep-plane technique circumvents this problem as all anatomic zones are elevated in a single flap.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that there were no statistically significant differences in the resulting angles between primary and revision patients, either in the cohort overall or within each age group. This implies that our surgery was different in technique and chronologically distinct from the primary rhytidectomy in all cases. A cutoff of 10 years between surgeries was chosen as this reflects a commonly stated duration or “lifetime” of rhytidectomy, and further, it afforded a clearer delineation of the effects of our procedure.</p>
<p>A final point about the data has to do with asymmetry. As all aesthetic surgeons can attest, even attractive patients display minor differences between sides, and some patients demonstrate significant asymmetries. In our cohort, each hemiface was lifted at its unique angle of maximal rejuvenation. The average difference between facial sides on the same patient was 5°. No significant difference was found overall, although we acknowledge that a larger cohort or population-based study could find such a difference. Importantly, our method for determining the angle of maximal rejuvenation is based on the specific anatomy and tissue properties of the elevated face-lift flap and underlying skeletal structure and, as such, allows for resuspension that is specific to each hemiface in a given patient—regardless of symmetry—and is customizable.</p>
<p>There are 2 potential limitations to our study. The first involves regulation of flap tension during redraping and closure. We did not use a tensionometer or other device but rather relied on the surgeon’s “feel.” All flaps were redraped without tension on the lateral skin-only portion of the composite flap, since the tension from suspension is held by the thicker deep-plane portion. In addition, this is a prospective, single-surgeon cohort; therefore, no differences between patients in the surgeon’s “feel” during redraping would have been possible. A second limitation is that we did not use a blinded, third-party reviewer to analyze postoperative photographs. Although this approach is interesting and may be the focus of future work, the present study pertains specifically to an intraoperative technique. We plan a further study with long-term postoperative evaluation.</p>
<p>The principles outlined in this study may be applied to a variety of approaches to face-lifting, from SMAS plication to SMAS-ectomy to the MACS lift.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X12455826">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X12455826">14</xref></sup> In selecting a rhytidectomy technique, however, the surgeon must consider the anatomical basis of the defects to be corrected. We prefer the deep-plane face-lift as it releases the zygomatic-cutaneous retaining ligaments, adding an improved level of midface rejuvenation. The most technically challenging, and also the most rewarding, portion of this operation lies in the midface. Indeed, elevation of the malar fat pad (after releasing the midfacial osseocutaneous ligaments) to its youthful position is what differentiates the high-lateral SMAS and deep-plane face-lifts from other techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12455826">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X12455826">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090820X12455826">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090820X12455826">24</xref></sup> Many surgeons have adopted the practice of concurrent autologous fat grafting to camouflage an otherwise underwhelming midface result. Suspension of the SMAS and skin at the angle of maximal rejuvenation allows for greater midfacial rejuvenation, thus diminishing the volume of autologous fat required, or eliminating the need entirely in some patients. In cases where additional autologous fat grafting is necessary, the same vector applies; in this circumstance, however, less lipotransfer would be necessary due to the inherent midface correction of our technique.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the efficacy of this intraoperative technique will require further long-term follow-up. However, one would not expect that the postoperative results would differ as flap orientation and design are predicated on the preoperative anatomy. Our intraoperative method modifies the vector of the flap (or flaps) redraping, to best fit each individual patient’s redundant soft tissue to his or her underlying skeletal structure. A customized approach, with intraoperative decision making, is the limitation we all have as aesthetic surgeons.</p>
<p>For those surgeons who advocate for lamellar or bidirectional suspension, we believe that both skin and SMAS flaps should be resuspended on the same vector, as determined intraoperatively during identification of the angle of maximal rejuvenation. This is different from traditional approaches that suspend the SMAS lifted vertically but redrape the skin mostly horizontally. This horizontal redraping necessitates a long posterior limb of the incision, either onto the occiput or along the occipital hairline. Bidirectional suspension contradicts our current understanding of facial aging, which results from decades of gravitational force. This vertical force affects the skin, SMAS, and ligaments in the same way and thus should be counteracted in the same direction. The skin does not exist in a horizontal gravitational field. We prefer the deep-plane flap, as it eliminates the need for redraping of 2 separate flaps and corrects all layers simultaneously.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We present a method for identifying the angle of maximal rejuvenation during rhytidectomy. This angle is not strictly vertical, although it is more superior than posterior in all cases regardless of patient age. Long-lasting and natural-appearing results demand a detailed understanding of facial and cervical anatomy and strict attention to the direction and degree of laxity in the individual patient.</p>
