<p>Housing ain’t what it used to be. Almost a century ago, planners, architects, and reformers of all kinds began fusing sets of ideas to address the poor housing conditions of workers in the increasingly dominant economy of mass industrial production. Architects generally led the charge, offering flashy, futuristic designs to replace decrepit slum neighborhoods, and the exigencies of the Great Depression eventually convinced even Americans that decent housing for all was a civic responsibility.</p>
<p>Today, however, the production of low-income housing is largely a numbers game, played more by economic engineers with spreadsheets than architects with trace paper (or CAD). Private development and financial firms have replaced public bureaucracies in leading the production process. The recent “Great Recession,” moreover, though largely driven by private housing market failure, seems to be the impetus for further dismantling the original New Deal infrastructure for providing decent homes for all.</p>
<p>While contemporary housing policy may thus be in decline, several recent books about past projects and programs indicate that historical study of this topic remains at a high level. Each of the works under review provides an in-depth examination of a particular aspect of the U.S. housing delivery system: a local public housing authority, a specific affordable housing development, or a federal policy shift. The rugged determination of the authors to uncover every relevant memo, letter, and doodle in their respective archives increases our understanding of their individual subjects, while as a group, these studies illuminate the broader shift in American housing policy in the twentieth century from initially centralized, federally controlled programs to the more flexible, multiplayer system in place today.</p>
<p>The fortuitous coincidence of two first-rate studies of sharply contrasting public housing agencies allows for a comparison of the ways in which local authorities implemented the same New Deal housing program with very different results. Brad Hunt has slogged through the cluttered records of the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) and interviewed former residents and administrators to create a broad portrait of one of America’s most notorious public housing agencies. Such material allows him to focus on how local management deficiencies contributed to the program’s failures: “fundamentally,” says Hunt, “the policies, not the tenants, caused the unsustainable environments” (p. 291).</p>
<p>Hunt’s archival spelunking has produced a marvelous view of policymaking in action by Elizabeth Wood, Robert Taylor, and a succession of other CHA leaders. He blames the agency’s difficulties on a variety of positions taken by agency leaders over time, above all a “market failure ideology” that limited public housing assistance to only those households that could not be served by private builders. Fearing that critics would object if they leased units built with public support to moderate-income households, progressives like Wood focused entirely on “rescuing poor families from slum conditions,” to the point of “aggressively, even overzealously, setting policies to assure the poor would benefit” (p. 37). In 1940, for example, the CHA lowered rents to make them more affordable to the poorest households, a move that simultaneously made many moderate-income residents—comprising approximately a quarter of all tenants—ineligible for public housing under the rent-to-income limits in place at the time. As America’s private housing delivery system—with great assistance from a completely different set of federal resources—encouraged significant numbers of white, moderate-income households to acquire decent suburban housing in the postwar years, the public housing system was left with the undereducated, low-wage minorities who had been streaming into the city center for decades.</p>
<p>Hunt stresses the impact of the unusually heavy concentration of children in the CHA’s high-rise buildings, a result of deliberate policy choices by the agency. Chicago’s high ratio of children to adults brought about “entirely new demographic different worlds,” resulting in “social disorder” that presented extreme challenges to property management; as a consequence, “high-rise projects for families like the Robert Taylor Homes and others conceived in the 1950s were doomed from the day they opened” (p. 180). The effect of youth density is one of many factors Hunt offers up to broaden the prevalent view that Chicago’s public housing failed primarily because white civic leaders barricaded African Americans inside existing black areas, creating the “second ghetto” outlined by Hirsch.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211432285">1</xref></sup> He demonstrates how integrationists like Wood and Taylor, concerned about conditions in existing black neighborhoods swollen by the Great Migration, took the lead in clearing these areas and replacing them with new public housing. In this view, “vertical ghettos” in the Black Belt like Robert Taylor Homes cannot be blamed entirely on efforts of whites to confine African Americans in their existing communities.</p>
<p>Although CHA leaders faced numerous handicaps imposed by federal regulation and local prejudice, Hunt finds that the agency’s own lack of managerial skill doomed operations; whether by incompetence, indifference, or intention (given the increasing number of minorities housed by the agency), by the 1950s the CHA had lost the handle on everyday operation of its properties. For Hunt, the lesson is that public housing should have been simply a housing program, not a wider social welfare policy focused on those most in need of government assistance. Could there have been an alternative path for public housing in Chicago and elsewhere? Hunt notes that Wood and her allies rejected proposals to renovate “slum” areas and rehouse displaced residents in low-income neighborhoods; in fact, he provides a wonderful doctored image of a potential public housing site in which CHA representatives, anxious to emphasize the need for clearance, edited out sturdy, easily repairable structures in order to draw attention to the dilapidated structures nearby. In the end, there was the possibility of a kinder, gentler housing policy that involved rehabilitation and some kind of voucher assistance: “Whether widespread slum clearance was even necessary has now become an open historical question” (p. 294).</p>
<p>Hunt’s fine-grained observations restore human action (whether willful or neglectful) to a history that is dominated by the assumption of the inevitable structural failure of modernist philosophy and architecture. Nicolas Dagen Bloom brings a similar high-resolution lens to New York City’s public housing experience, but he finds a very different, almost mythical creature in his magnifying glass: “public housing that worked,” as he puts it. Bloom suggests that the prevailing image of Public Housing Authority (PHA) dysfunction has clouded our ability to see the New York story as different; the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), suggests Bloom, demonstrates that “public housing could have been built and maintained to a decent standard; tenanted with a wider range of income groups; and policed in a systematic fashion” (p. 1).</p>
<p>Bloom has trolled the archives of the NYCHA and other municipal agencies and revisited major events through newspaper stories to provide us with an exceptional account of this history. Like Hunt in Chicago, Bloom concentrates on the operators of New York’s housing authority rather than its occupants but finds the opposite result. America’s largest city (and largest public housing agency) had fewer problems in public housing because for most of the agency’s existence, NYCHA directors adopted a more insightful and sophisticated approach to management of this type of portfolio. This was “model housing as a municipal service,” rather than the public-housing-as-public-welfare paradigm that characterized public housing in Chicago and many other major cities. Through careful tenant selection, effective social programming, and vigorous policing, the largely high-rise inventory of New York’s public housing has fared better.</p>
<p>Bloom convincingly attributes NYCHA’s operational success to the property management skill of agency leaders. Unlike their counterparts in Chicago, for example, NYCHA’s early leaders fought against federal mandates that prioritized serving the poorest residents, citing a concern that lower rents would not sustain proper maintenance and that maximizing welfare-supported households would limit the “beneficial effect” of mixing them with working people. According to an early NYCHA commissioner, “we were in the business for housing fundamentally, and not for experimentation” (p. 88). By the 1950s, the agency had developed a twenty-one–point admission system aimed at keeping out various types of tenants considered undesirable (including unwed mothers!). Bloom argues that over time, such “social engineering” has generally kept NYCHA out of the trouble common in other big-city PHAs.</p>
<p>Physical design was part of the housing authority’s operational success, as its standardized, “basic not shoddy” tower architecture proved uniform enough for easy maintenance and repair. Bloom also emphasizes the importance of well-designed site improvements for making New York’s higher density projects work, though he doesn’t explain why the work of Olmsted and European low-income housing landscape designers, to which he attributes NYCHA’s success, did not equally influence other American housing authorities. Robert Moses appears as both a protector of the agency’s administrative quality standards and as a schemer, making use of public housing projects to give the appearance of providing replacement units for those displaced by his other redevelopment schemes. The author gives Moses some unusual props by comparing the impact of his Title I projects on racial integration to the ineffectiveness of NYCHA’s efforts toward this end. Showing how little was gained by the direct approach to mix races within public housing developments, Bloom claims</p>
<disp-quote><p>The truth of the matter is that figures such as Robert Moses and Thomas Farrell—ham-handed as they were—likely did more to integrate New York than genteel, high-minded idealists such as Mayor John Lindsay. (p. 207)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Bloom demonstrates how the story of public housing is not monochromatically gray, but his story is colored by a rather unsympathetic criticism of the very poor. While Hunt goes to great lengths to avoid blaming the residents for being trapped in unsavory public housing circumstances, Bloom sounds almost Giuliani-esque in his support for the NYCHA’s efforts to focus on the working (i.e., deserving) poor.</p>
<disp-quote><p>Not only are these working-poor tenants able to cover a more reasonable proportion of the cost, but their behavior is, with some justification, considered to be superior to the welfare underclass. (p. 245)</p></disp-quote>
<p>The period from 1968 to the mid-1990s, when NYCHA accepted more welfare-level tenants, is called here the era of “welfare-state public housing” in contrast to the earlier period of “housing as municipal service,” as if public housing was not inherently a function of welfare-state policies.</p>
<p>While the evidence that the NYCHA has operated well is often compelling, even with some of the examples of crime and vandalism provided, at times Bloom sounds like a boorish Yankee fan in the way he underestimates how the unique qualities of the Big Apple have made high-rise public housing successful there. The text is scattered with Bronx cheers for New York’s “mousey sister cities in the United States” (p. 110), who can’t seem to control their properties or clientele. Bloom himself, however, notes many of the elements that make New York’s housing story different, though he does not fully emphasize these as explanatory factors. Manhattan’s unique character certainly helped high-rise public housing operate better here than elsewhere, and New York benefits from its singular status of having three public housing programs in one: federal, state, and local. Conversion of city and state public housing units to federal status amounted to a bailout of the agency worth hundreds of millions of dollars during its most difficult financial times. New York City’s political atmosphere is another distinctive factor. Though he cites Joel Schwartz’s work with admiration, Bloom might have recognized more directly how the “the New York approach”—the city’s very individual tradition of labor and religious support for working-class housing—served as an exception to the general urban experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144211432285">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>New York’s lefty tendencies serve as the starting point for Peter Eisenstadt’s engaging study of a very different approach to providing affordable homes: cooperative apartments. As a child, Eisenstadt lived with his family in Rochdale Village, a 5,860 unit co-op constructed and operated by the United Housing Foundation (UHF), the nonprofit builder headed by Abraham Kazan and affiliated with the Jewish labor movement. Completed in 1963 on the site of the former Jamaica Racetrack in Queens and named for a famous English consumer co-op of the 1840s, Rochdale Village was the largest UHF effort before its culminating project, Co-op City in the Bronx. This was not a federal undertaking: major financing came from state pension funds and from the state’s Mitchell-Lama program to encourage moderate-income housing.</p>
<p>The cooperative movement envisioned a wholly different form of “welfare state.” Kazan and his cooperators viewed Rochdale Village’s size as an opportunity to create huge internal cooperative ventures, covering all kinds of activities, as part of their vision of creating an entire cooperative economy. The development had social as well as economic goals, as the UHF valiantly proposed to house whites and blacks together in one of New York City’s largest African American enclaves. Even so, Eisenstadt reports that it is difficult to tell exactly how mixed the project was because the developer claimed not to keep track of which households were black or white. He suggests that 20 percent or less of the households were black and that around two-thirds were Jewish, mostly from the outer boroughs. Black or white, says Eisenstadt, this group of cooperators was “middle class as much by aspiration as by income level” (p. 18); the most common occupations were teachers and transit workers.</p>
<p>Eisenstadt provides many compelling stories of Rochdale Village: the fight over access to construction jobs and better schools, the reluctant decision of white families to leave the crime and hostility of Rochdale for quiet suburban lanes, and the violent contest between the Rochdale co-op board and the Teamsters Union over control of the property’s maintenance and security staff. As the book’s subtitle implies, Robert Moses played an important role in the development of Rochdale Village, in this case brokering the deal to acquire the closed racetrack and sell it to the UHF. Unlike Bloom, who polishes Moses’ legacy, Eisenstadt erects a shrine to his memory. His exegesis of Moses’ files is instructive—giving an almost daily glimpse into his process of pushing, cajoling, pleading, and punishing—but the power broker seems to have swept Eisenstadt off his feet. The author suggests that Moses so admired the spirit of the co-operative endeavor that “in many ways Moses saw Rochdale Village as the culmination of his life’s work” (p. 36). A chapter examining Moses’ racist proclivities fails to convince that Moses deserves admiration because he eventually “accommodated himself to integration” (p. 69).</p>
<p>In the end this tale, despite its subtitle, is driven not so much by an interest in Robert Moses, a cast of six thousand households, or even racial integration, but by a longing for the left-wing socialist utopia that seems ever more distant in the increasingly neoliberal present. Rochdale Village does not seem like a promising precedent when Eisenstadt brings us up to the present with an account of the ceaseless bickering of successive co-op boards (constantly rehearsing old schisms in the Jewish political left) and the multiple interventions by the state of New York to keep Rochdale Village from financial ruin. Nevertheless, though the “social democratic city” embodied in Rochdale Village was “a dream of old men,” Eisenstadt suggests “there has never been a better time than now to once again start building Abraham Kazan’s cooperative commonwealth” (p. 248). The resilience of American capitalism in its most recent crisis, however, suggests that the co-operative approach is probably as much a dead letter today as the federal production programs of the mid-twentieth century.</p>
<p>So what is a houser to do in this era of broken dreams? David Erickson’s analysis of more recent housing policy is a call for historians to pay attention to the newer approaches that have eclipsed the policies of the past. His characterization of today’s “network approach” to policy implementation suggests that housing planners and historians need to rethink the common narrative of the end of the welfare state. More low-income units have been produced in America since the establishment of the low-income housing tax credit in 1986 than were ever created under the federal public housing program, challenging us to think about what has changed in federal policy and what it means for a deficit-dominated future.</p>
<p>In exploring a federal policy rather than a specific agency or project, Erickson examines a variety of historical factors, seeking to find what led to a shift from the clunky federal provision of rental housing to the multi-player form of low-income housing production of today that he labels the “decentralized housing network.” The stars of this drama, community development corporations (CDCs) and national intermediary funders, mix and match the many-lettered programs that have largely replaced public housing and other federal production programs: LIHTC (Low-Income Housing Tax Credits), CDBG (Community Development Block Grants), HOME (Home Investment Partnerships), and others. Describing the intricate, multilayered financing involved in this network process, he argues that the complex partnerships and financial combinations that characterize today’s housing deals are a benefit, not a burden; having several parties involved in each deal makes projects more efficient because it involves multiple ideas, multiple risks, and multiple people checking each other’s work.</p>
<p>Erickson traces the change from a central federal system to a decentralized network through a parade of reports, policy studies, and programs. Of particular importance is the CDBG program launched in 1974, which trained a broad, locally based coalition of actors in the use of decentralized community development programs. By the time Reagan-era budgets reduced financial resources from the top, grassroots players had developed the capacity to step up and find new paths. A series of case studies demonstrates the ability of these actors to pursue different ideas and use various resources for many types of projects: “The decentralized program showed how it could be all things to all people” (p. 127).</p>
<p>This was no rationalist, modernist, totalizing scheme cooked up in a welfare state to force on society at large; yet, despite the incremental, trial-and-error character of the new decentralized housing network, Erickson makes clear this was no foundation-less Derridean policy moment either. Relying on New Institutionalist historians like Theda Scopol, Erickson interprets the recent scattered-agent approach as a new hybrid institution that synthesizes multiple approaches into a Hydra-headed program. Federal tax incentives and flexible grants form a “quasi-market” for low-income housing production. He speculates that such a system is a product of both our contemporary postindustrial economy with its free-market ideology (sorry, Mr. Kazan) and the technology of computation and communication that has allowed greater decentralization.</p>
<p>This is the first historical (vs. policy-oriented) analysis of the important shift away from the kinds of programs examined in the other books under review. As a foot soldier in this “revolution” during my time as a project manager at nonprofit BRIDGE Housing in the 1980s, I recognize many of the factors that Erickson has identified and expounded upon. However, Erickson’s position as a proponent of the networked solution keeps him from seeing some of the backstage problems behind the curtain of this particular show.</p>
<p>First, Erickson attempts to distinguish between the apparently rote response of earlier public housing builders dealing with a central bureaucracy and the endless ingenuity and creativity of the new breed. Wearing an economic historian’s hat, he contrasts the lack of incentives and the poor internal communication of the old federal bureaucracy with the ability of nimble, plugged-in grassroots organizations to serve as “market actors” pursuing a double-bottom line of both efficiency and social amelioration. It’s not clear, however, what “market” CDCs are in fact acting in, nor what efficiency they are driven to. Decentralizing limited resources does not necessarily create an open competition of actors. State allocation of tax credits and local control of CDBG and HOME funding can make arbitrary what Erikson imagines is simply survival of the fittest, just as federal bureaucrats could hold up a public housing application in the previous era.</p>
<p>Second, the role of actual communities in community development corporations varies wildly. Particularly as CDC staffs have grown more sophisticated in response to the ever-increasing complexity of housing finance, the organizations are often operated by middle-class outsiders, not salt-of-the-earth neighbors. Nonprofits range from tiny organizations representing a few blocks of neighborhood turf to large regional operations like BRIDGE and The Community Builders, making characterization difficult. Most important, Erickson acknowledges that more LIHTC units are built by for-profit developers than by nonprofit CDCs, but he does not address the role of these private sector actors or explain how their developments differ from those of the CDCs. All of this undercuts the neat nonprofit “network” formulation he has created.</p>
<p>Finally, for all the good that the nonprofit network does with its dispersed energy, it’s hard to see a solid impact on either the most desperate of our inner-city neighborhoods or on the paucity of opportunity for low-income people in racially and economically segregated suburban communities. The constantly recombining clusters of network actors have generally not been able to scale up to the level of the UHF at Rochdale Village, nor have they developed operational scales with the economies and standardized practices of the NYCHA. In manufacturing terms, the decentralized housing network of today consists of many batch producers in contrast to the mass production machines of the “bureaucratic” era. Neither solution is perfect, but we might still seek to balance their benefits.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his book, Erickson includes a picture of Pruitt-Igoe in midexplosion and, as we have come to expect, describes the blowup as “a loss of faith in the modernist ideal that government bureaucracies were capable of solving social problems” (p. 145). Yet the detailed studies of particular “high modern” housing programs provided by Hunt, Bloom, and Eisenstadt demonstrate the localized heterogeneity of what is often assumed to be a universal approach; Erickson’s network contraption, while certainly more effective than the old public housing single boiler engine, is no more a blow against the modernist machine than the pastiche patchwork of New Formalist (aka New Urbanist) HOPE VI schemes are against the Corbusian superblocks of a previous era. The decentralized housing network makes better use of individual ideas, but its recent collapse under the pressure of economic crisis demonstrates its reliance on corporate investment in a manner not so dissimilar to the strings attached to federal public housing funds before.</p>
<p>Each of these books, then, provides a different, detailed perspective on America’s efforts to house its less affluent citizens: how bureaucracies function, how a particular vision can drive forward a specific affordable housing project, and how a changing <italic>zeitgeist</italic> can affect the structure of federal policy. They show that much to architects’ chagrin, the design of the building matters less than its operation. They also demonstrate that a unitary vision of community might be a powerful tool for initiating a program, but in practice a singular “modernist ideal” can be implemented in different ways in different circumstances. There is still much more to learn about past housing efforts and what they might tell us about solving the problems of today and beyond; none of these works, for example, tells us much about the actual people who live in PHA towers or CDC apartments. Surely a better understanding of how affordable housing affects the social and economic health of specific lives should be part of our policy decision-tree moving forward.</p>
<p>Yes, housing ain’t what it used to be, but, fortunately, the writing of the history of this field remains strong. These books contribute much to our understanding in the shift of policies over time. More than anything, they demonstrate how the messiness of everyday life is more powerful than the strongest ideal architectural form. As Mayor Wagner of New York put it in the early 1960s:</p>
<disp-quote><p>Once upon a time, we thought that if we could just bulldoze the slums and build shiny new public housing for low-income people, all social problems involving these people would disappear. That has not turned out to be so.</p></disp-quote>
