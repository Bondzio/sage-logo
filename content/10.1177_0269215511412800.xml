<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To examine the health benefits of a bedroom window view to natural surroundings for patients undergoing a residential rehabilitation programme.</p>
<p><bold>Design</bold>: Longitudinal quasi-experiment.</p>
<p><bold>Setting</bold>: A residential rehabilitation centre.</p>
<p><bold>Subjects</bold>: Two-hundred and seventy-eight coronary and pulmonary patients provided data at all measurement points during the programme.</p>
<p><bold>Intervention</bold>: Blind, quasi-random allocation to a private bedroom with a panoramic view to natural surroundings or with a view either partially or entirely blocked by buildings.</p>
<p><bold>Main measures</bold>: Self-reported physical and mental health (SF-12), subjective well-being, emotional states, use of the private bedroom and leisure activities.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: For women, a blocked view appeared to negatively influence change in physical health (time × view × gender interaction, <italic>F</italic>(4,504) = 2.51, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04), whereas for men, a blocked view appeared to negatively influence change in mental health (time × view × gender interaction, <italic>F</italic>(4,504) = 5.67, <italic>P &lt; </italic>0.01). Pulmonary patients with a panoramic view showed greater improvement in mental health than coronary patients with such a view (time × view × diagnostic group interaction, <italic>F</italic>(4,504) = 2.76, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). Those with a panoramic view to nature more often chose to stay in their bedroom when they wanted to be alone than those with a blocked view (odds ratio (OR) = 2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08–5.01).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: An unobstructed bedroom view to natural surroundings appears to have better supported improvement in self-reported physical and mental health during a residential rehabilitation programme, although the degree of change varied with gender and diagnostic group.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Features of the physical environment can promote desirable patient outcomes in health care institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511412800">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511412800">4</xref></sup> One such feature is the connection between the indoor and outdoor environment provided by a window in a patient’s bedroom. Fresh air and sunlight have long been thought to promote patient well-being,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511412800">5</xref></sup> but until relatively recently there was little experimental evidence that what patients could see from their room also could be beneficial. In a pioneering study, however, Ulrich<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511412800">6</xref></sup> compared recovery from surgery among patients in hospital rooms with a view of trees versus a brick wall. Those with the tree view used less potent analgesics, received fewer negative comments in nurses’ notes and had shorter postoperative hospital stays.</p>
<p>To explain these benefits, Ulrich<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511412800">6</xref></sup> proposed that a view of natural elements serves as a distraction that evokes positive emotions, counteracting stress and enhancing pain management. His study has not been replicated, but several experiments have addressed components of his explanation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511412800">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511412800">12</xref></sup> Studies in clinical settings have reported beneficial effects of indoor interventions involving nature imagery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511412800">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511412800">10</xref></sup> For example, Diette et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511412800">8</xref></sup> reported better pain control among patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy while lying on a bed surrounded by a curtain with a large landscape scene, in comparison to patients without such a ‘bedscape’. Experiments with non-clinical samples have found enhanced psychophysiological stress reduction with a window view to nature versus no view<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511412800">11</xref></sup> and videotapes of natural settings versus urban and pedestrian mall settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511412800">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study extends this line of research by assessing the effects of window view contents on patients in a residential rehabilitation centre. The focus on residential centres is of interest because many of them are located in natural surroundings and offer window views onto those surroundings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511412800">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511412800">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511412800">14</xref></sup> Even with seemingly easy physical access to the natural surroundings, window views may have considerable importance, particularly if harsh weather conditions and poor health keep patients indoors.</p>
<p>In general, patients undergoing rehabilitation are a vulnerable group, with compromised health presenting a major life crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511412800">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511412800">16</xref></sup> Programmes typically last for multiple weeks and are intended to help patients restore physical function and learn about lifestyle change and how to live with their condition. Participants in a rehabilitation programme have a number of mandatory activities during the day that may be physically and mentally demanding. Thus, although the rehabilitation programme is meant to be restorative in a sense, patients may frequently experience it as stressful. Withdrawal to a private room with a view to natural surroundings can support stress recovery on such occasions. We therefore hypothesize that availability of a private room with a window view to natural surroundings will cumulatively have positive effects on rehabilitation patients’ health and well-being.</p>
<p>Given this hypothesis, it is important to measure how patients actually use their bedrooms, and in particular the extent to which they use it when they want to withdraw and be alone versus using it only for sleeping. We hypothesize that patients with a window view towards the natural surroundings will more frequently use their room as a place for contemplation and waking rest. There are many possibilities for voluntary leisure time activities at a rehabilitation centre, such as social activities, watching TV and going out for walks. We measured the performance of these activities as well, to see for example whether patients in rooms without a window view to nature would spend more of their spare time watching television whereas those with such a view would stay more in their rooms. We also assessed satisfaction with the window view and the design of the private room.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269215511412800" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted a longitudinal quasi-experiment at the rehabilitation centre in Røros, Norway. The main experimental factor comprised three types of window view from patient rooms, which varied in the openness of the view to the natural surroundings. The study was coordinated with a separate study on the effect of indoor foliage plants on patient health and well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511412800">17</xref></sup> In that study we compared the self-reported health and well-being of patients during 11 months before and 11 months after many large plants were placed in common areas around the centre in November, 2008. The present study examined the effects of the window view from the private bedrooms of the same patients, where there were no plants either before or after the plant intervention in the common areas.</p>
<p>The Røros Centre offers rehabilitation programmes for different diagnostic groups. These include patients with a coronary diagnosis (e.g. have undergone heart surgery or have a history of coronary heart disease) and patients with a pulmonary diagnosis (e.g. asthmatic diseases or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Hereinafter we will refer simply to ‘heart’ and ‘lung’ patients, in line with the terms used by centre staff.</p>
<p>Patients are referred to the centre by their regular physician and have been at home prior to the stay; they typically do not enter directly from acute care facilities. Rehabilitation programmes are run with groups of at most 20 heart or lung patients, and the length of the programme is normally four weeks. The groups are cared for by teams of staff members from different professions (physical therapy, occupational therapy, nutrition, bioengineering, nursing, medicine).</p>
<p>During 2007–2008, patients preparing for a stay at the centre were invited to participate in the study via a letter sent with an initial questionnaire by a secretary at the centre. Potential participants were informed that it was a study about the aesthetics of the centre in relation to health and well-being among patients there. They were also informed that participation was voluntary. No further information was given about the environmental factors being measured. We obtained informed consent from those patients willing to participate. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics and the privacy ombudsman for research at the Norwegian Social Science Data Service.</p>
<p>Room assignments were administered by a secretary at the centre (not the same one who mailed the invitation to participate in the study). Following standard procedure at the centre, allocation was stratified by diagnostic group, as different sets of rooms were reserved for the different groups. For each diagnostic group, incoming patients were allocated to the rooms according to the alphabetical order of their last names, starting with the lowest room number. The few rooms with a totally blocked view were among the lowest room numbers in both groups. The secretary who made the allocation to rooms, as well as the other staff members who interacted with the patients, were not aware of the window view factor being measured.</p>
<sec id="section3-0269215511412800">
<title>Study site and description of window views</title>
<p>The rehabilitation centre was built in the mountain village of Røros in 2003 for the Norwegian National Association for Heart and Lung Disease. The centre has modern architecture, with large open spaces, large windows, light colours, and extensive use of wood and stone in the interior. Window views from the common areas are dominated by grass and low trees, a parking area, and other parts of the building or neighbouring buildings. In contrast, window views from the bedrooms encompass the valley and the mountains, though in some rooms the views of the landscape beyond the centre are partially or entirely blocked by sections of the building itself or by other buildings.</p>
<p>Three view categories were created on the basis of the best possible (least obstructed) viewpoint from inside the room. In the <italic>panoramic view</italic> condition, rooms had an unobstructed view onto the valley and mountains, with no buildings blocking the view. In the <italic>partially blocked view</italic> condition, rooms had a view to the landscape that was partly blocked by parts of the centre and/or other buildings. In the <italic>blocked view</italic> condition, the view to the landscape was completely blocked by other parts of the centre. Natural elements such as grass could be seen outside, but there was no view to the landscape surrounding the centre.</p>
<p>Rooms at the centre are furnished with a bed, sofa, desk, and small table. A chair near the window can easily be oriented toward the view the patient considers best. The room interior is identical for all rooms, although the floor plan of some of the rooms mirrors that of others. The heart and lung patients used 52 rooms altogether. On a few occasions, rooms primarily used by heart patients were used by lung patients and vice versa, so that the heart patients used a total of 27 different rooms and the lung patients used a total of 29 different rooms. Five of the rooms are somewhat larger than the others and these were used by patients in both diagnostic groups. Two of them have panoramic views and three have partially blocked views.</p>

<sec id="section4-0269215511412800">
<title>Measurement procedures and outcome measures</title>
<p>The participants received questionnaires at five different time points: with the initial invitation letter two weeks before arrival at the centre (T0), at the time of arrival (T1), two weeks after arrival (T2), at the end of the four-week programme (T3), and two weeks after returning home (T4). The secretary who mailed out the invitation letter with the T0 questionnaires also maintained the coding key with participants’ names and registration codes, ensuring their anonymity. She was also responsible for mailing out the last questionnaire (T4). A member of the care team working with the given group of patients handed out the questionnaires for T1, T2 and T3 with instructions to fill them out and return them in a mailbox placed in the centre’s reception area. The staff were instructed not to inform the participants about the interest in specific environmental factors at the centre (which the staff took to mean the indoor plants). The completed forms were forwarded to the research team, and the data were entered by a research assistant blind to the window view conditions of the participants. Information about the room number for all participants who filled in at least one questionnaire was collected from the secretary holding the coding key after data collection concluded. Patient assignments to view categories were derived from knowledge about their room number. Room numbers were linked with view categories on the basis of observations made by the research team on-site.</p>
<p>Measures of health and well-being were included in the questionnaires administered at T0 through T4. The 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) measures self-perceived physical and mental health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511412800">18</xref></sup> Responses were scored according to the instructions provided in the SF-12 version 2 manual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511412800">19</xref></sup> Scores can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.86 to 0.88 across the measurement points.</p>
<p>Subjective well-being was measured with a single item: ‘When you look at your life in general, how happy would you say that you are?’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511412800">20</xref></sup>Responses were given with an 11-point scale (0 = extremely unhappy, 10 = extremely happy).</p>
<p>Current emotional well-being was measured using items from a measure of affect based on the circumplex model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511412800">21</xref></sup> We focused on activated–unpleasant (AUP) and unactivated–pleasant (UAP) affects. AUP affect was measured with the adjectives annoyed, fearful, jittery and anxious. UAP was measured with the terms relaxed, content, at rest, and calm. Instructions referred to the degree to which these emotions were experienced at the moment (1 = not at all; 5 = very much). The two measures AUP and UAP were combined after reversal of scores on the AUP measure, since analyses of each separately showed that their results mirrored each other. Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.83 to 0.87 across the measurement points.</p>
<p>The T3 questionnaire also included specific questions about the extent to which the participant was satisfied with the window view and the design of the private bedroom. Responses were given on 5-point scales (0 = not at all; 4 = very much).</p>
<p>The T4 questionnaire included questions about how many hours the participant spent in the bedroom during the day and for what purposes they used the bedroom. Responses to the latter question were recoded into two categories: only for sleeping during the night and for taking a nap during the day (coded 0), and for withdrawing and being alone as well (coded 1).</p>
<p>The T4 questionnaire also included a question about how often the participant went out for walks during the four-week period (0 = never, 1 = once or twice during the stay, 2 = once or twice every week, 3 = every second day, 4 = every day). Responses were recoded into two categories: up to twice during the stay at the centre (coded 0), and more than twice during the stay (coded 1).</p>
<p>The T4 questionnaire further included items about whether or not the participant spent time in the reception area, TV rooms, and corridor resting areas during daytime, evenings and weekends (0 = no, 1 = yes for each of the nine questions for the three areas × three periods). For each common area, a mean was calculated for each participant looking across the three different periods. The mean scores could range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates more use of that particular common area. The common area measures reflect on the degree of social activity, but the use of the TV rooms is assumed to reflect on the amount of TV watching.</p>
<p>A variety of socio-demographic variables were measured at T0. Those relevant for the present study were gender and age in years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269215511412800">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Imputations for missing data were made at the item level using the expectation maximization method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511412800">22</xref></sup> with data for other items from the same questionnaire at the same time point used for reference.</p>
<p>One-way ANOVA were used to assess the effects of the window view on satisfaction with the window view and interior room design. Repeated-measures ANOVA were used to assess the effects of the window view on change in the self-reported health, subjective well-being, and emotion outcomes from T1 to T3. For all of these analyses, gender, diagnostic group and plant intervention period (pre- and post-) were treated as additional between-subjects factors. Age and the corresponding measure from T0 were used as covariates. Greenhouse-Geisser adjusted degrees of freedom and associated probabilities are reported where appropriate for the repeated measures ANOVA. The type III sum of squares was used, given unequal cell numbers.</p>
<p>Logistic regression was used to assess the odds that the patients performed some leisure activities more often if they had a particular window view, independent of age, gender, diagnostic group, and plant intervention.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period, 250 lung and 345 heart patients (in 16 lung and 20 heart groups) completed at least three of the four weeks in one of the centre’s rehabilitation programmes and were eligible for the study. The flow of patients is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511412800">Figure 1</xref>. Four hundred and eighty-one patients consented to participate. Of these, 278 answered all three questionnaires at the centre (T1–T3) and were included in analyses of change in the health and other outcomes. The questions posed at T4 about activities at the centre were answered by 380 patients. Patients did not complete all questionnaires because of unwillingness (e.g. due to fatigue) and on a few occasions because they did not receive the questionnaire from centre staff.</p>

However, more of the heart than the lung patients had panoramic views (χ<sup>2</sup> = 10.37, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Relatively more of the participating patients had a panoramic view during the second year of the study, after initiation of the plant intervention, whereas fewer had a partially blocked view during the same period (χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.20, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). These differences further motivate the inclusion of gender and diagnostic group as factors in the experimental design.</p>

<p>Change in the emotional state and subjective well-being reports was not modified by window view. For both variables, all <italic>F</italic>-values for interactions involving window view were less than 1.07 and all <italic>P</italic>-values were larger than 0.37.</p>
<p>There were no significant interactions between window view and the plant intervention condition for any of the health and well-being measures (all <italic>P</italic>-values &gt;0.13). Nor did the window view and plant intervention together interact with either gender or diagnostic group (all <italic>P</italic>-values &gt;0.14).</p>
<p>Patients in the three window view categories spent about the same number of hours in their rooms during the daytime (blocked: <italic>M</italic> = 2.15, SD = 1.58; partially blocked: <italic>M</italic> = 2.12, SD = 1.42; panoramic: <italic>M</italic> = 2.30, SD = 1.43). However, more of those who had a panoramic window view chose to stay in the room when they wanted to withdraw and be alone in comparison to those who had a blocked view (odds ratio (OR) = 2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08–5.01). Those with a partially blocked view did not have significantly higher odds of withdrawing to their rooms for solitude than those in the fully blocked view condition (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 0.65–2.97). The other variables in the logistic regression model (age, gender, diagnostic group, plant intervention condition) did not contribute to prediction (all <italic>P</italic>-values &gt;0.05). Thus, it would appear that, while spending the same amount of time in the room during the day, patients with panoramic views were less likely to spend it in napping. There were no significant associations between window view and the measured leisure activities, including going out for walks and using the corridor seating areas, seating areas in the reception and TV rooms (all correlation coefficients &lt;0.09).</p>
<p>In keeping with the health and behavioural data, patients with a panoramic view to the surrounding landscape were quite satisfied with the view, and more so than those who had a partially blocked view, who were themselves more satisfied than those with a totally blocked view (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215511412800">Table 4</xref>). Post-hoc tests (Bonferroni) showed that ratings of each of the view conditions differed significantly from the others (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.03). Satisfaction with the design of the patient room of itself was high overall and unaffected by the window view (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215511412800">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The relationship between type of window view and satisfaction with the view showed a clear gradient. Patients with a panoramic window view to nature were most satisfied, and those with a blocked view were least satisfied. This result conforms with a large body of findings that scenes of nature and natural elements are preferred over scenes dominated by buildings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511412800">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511412800">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients with a panoramic view to nature also reported using the room as a place to withdraw to a greater extent. Patients at a rehabilitation centre are taxed by the demands of a difficult health situation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511412800">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511412800">16</xref></sup> in addition to the demands of the rehabilitation programme itself. As suggested by Ulrich,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511412800">6</xref></sup> by supporting restoration when needed, passive visual contact with the natural environment may help patients receiving care to cope better with the demands engendered by ill-health.</p>
<p>Even though patients at the centre were not in their bedrooms during the day to the same extent as in the studies by Ulrich<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511412800">6</xref></sup> and Park and Mattson,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511412800">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511412800">27</xref></sup> their self-reported health varied with the type of window view. The effects were contingent, however, on gender. A blocked view appears to have negatively affected the mental health of men but not women during their stay. On the other hand, a panoramic view had a more continuously positive effect on physical health among women. The indoor plant intervention in the Røros centre also found gender differences,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511412800">17</xref></sup> as did earlier studies involving indoor nature interventions in other contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511412800">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511412800">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The effects of the window view over time also were contingent on diagnostic group. A view to the surrounding natural landscape appeared to have a more positive effect on the mental health of lung patients than of heart patients. We can only speculate about reasons for the differences between the diagnostic groups. The lung patients generally have more constraints, given difficulty in breathing and rapid onset of fatigue; they may therefore need to relax indoors to a larger extent, and a window view to nature may therefore have a larger potential for improving their health. The results of the logistic regression analysis suggest that the different diagnostic groups did not differ in their use of the private room, but this does not mean that they benefitted similarly from the time spent in the room.</p>
<p>We did not find effects of the window view on either emotional states or subjective well-being. This may reflect on the temporal scope of the measures; the former prompts for emotional experience at the moment, while the latter asks the respondent to look back over his or her life. In contrast, the SF-12 measures place most emphasis on health as perceived during the preceding week.</p>
<p>The study has some limitations. Although we are confident that the allocation procedures disallowed self-selection, we did not have formal randomization to view conditions. The outcome measures were self-reports, and results from these may not align with objective measures indicative of the success of the rehabilitation programme. The analyses here only concern the experience of the patients while they were at the centre; long-term health effects cannot be inferred.</p>
<p>Together with similar studies, the findings have practical implications. Those designing health institutions can consider ways to site the building so that the rooms have pleasing views. Those responsible for room allocation can take care to allocate especially vulnerable persons to rooms with particularly good views.</p>
