<abstract>
<p>Current UK guidelines for the commissioning of hospital operating theatres rely on air-flow checks, identification of “short-circuits” and measurement of airborne microbiological levels under design conditions when the theatre is idle. There is currently no guideline for infection control teams to investigate theatres when an increased infection risk is suspected. This study aims to examine the use of clean-room particle counters as an infection control tool by monitoring particle profiles in air as a surrogate for infectious particles. Particle counters (three- and six-channel) were used to simultaneously measure particle concentrations at the theatre inlet area, two outlets and bed area, under design and working conditions. A significant increase in particles of all size ranges (0.3 to &gt;10 µm diameter) was observed when people were introduced. Particle distribution was uneven, with response to environmental changes different at the two outlets. Removal efficiency varied from 52–100%, due to the introduction of particles to the theatre. Within the bed area, significantly different concentrations were measured under design and working conditions; corresponding microbiological samples indicated an associated increase in airborne bacteria. We concluded that particle counters can be used in some aspects of infection control, although more studies are required to fully explore their potential.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11409467"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patient infection during surgical procedures may result from direct contact with contaminated materials, such as surgical equipment, or from the settling of airborne bacteria onto the wound surface. In 2006, it was found that approximately 8% of hospital patients have healthcare-associated infections with 14% of these being surgical site infections (SSIs). An estimated 5% of patients who have undergone a surgical procedure develop an infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11409467">1</xref>]. SSIs are associated with increased rates of morbidity, with the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11409467">1</xref>] reporting that over a one-third of postoperative deaths are in part related to SSI. If the surgical procedure maintains a high standard of asepsis, the airborne route provides the highest dose of bacterial exposure as given in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11409467">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11409467">3</xref>]. The settling of bacteria onto surgical wounds is a function of the concentration of the contaminant in the air, the settling velocity of these particles and the area of the exposed wound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11409467">4</xref>]. These airborne bacteria may already be present in the room, introduced through the air supply or infiltration, or liberated from patients and medical staff within the room during the operation. As a result, one of the primary functions of operating theatre ventilation systems is to dilute, remove and prevent the introduction of airborne bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11409467">4</xref>]. Recommendations regarding ventilation systems in operating theatres have been in place since the 1960 s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11409467">5</xref>]; with their design currently subject to Department of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11409467">6</xref>] guidelines. The three most important aspects of ventilation systems are considered to be the ventilation rate (often defined as the frequency with which the entirety of the air within the theatre is replaced per hour or air change per hour; ACH), the air flow direction controlled by differential pressure in different parts of the theatre and air distribution or flow patterns defined by the level of air turbulence.</p>
<p>Currently, it must be confirmed by a suitably qualified person that operating theatre ACH and air flow patterns meet design plans, and that airborne bacteria remain below the threshold values. These checks are only required at the commissioning and validation stage of the ventilation system set-up; there is no method available for evaluation of variables that may change ventilation performance once the theatre is in use. For example, people provide both a source of bacteria carrying particles and a disruption to designed air flow patterns through their movement and heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11409467">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11409467">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11409467">8</xref>]. Large items of theatre equipment, such as the bed and lighting, may also be moved, while staff may change their position within the theatre. Operating theatre ventilation systems are also designed to maintain performance under conditions where one or more doors within the operating theatre are open; however, as with the above variables, air flow patterns and ventilation rates are not examined under these conditions. Young and O'Regan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11409467">9</xref>] reported that on average doors within operating suites were opened 93 times per operation and concluded that current levels of theatre traffic increase the risk of SSIs; due to the disruption of air flow and introduction of contamination.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been found that hospital ventilation systems do not operate according to design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11409467">10</xref>]. This may be due to maintenance of air handling units, fans, ducts, filters and air conditioning systems, which although recommended is not always followed. Inadequate or absent maintenance, and a lack of a self-reporting system for suspected under-performance can have detrimental consequences for a theatre's air quality. Although multiple regulations are in place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11409467">6</xref>], engineering faults can still occur and remain unnoticed until patient infection rates increase and are investigated. For example, Breathnach et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11409467">11</xref>] reported an outbreak of TB in patients in a London teaching hospital; resulting from the placement of the index patient in a positive pressure, rather than negative pressure room. It is essential that infection control teams are aware and able to confirm the working performance and capabilities of the ventilation systems in place.</p>
<p>As well as the ventilation systems engineered capabilities, efficiency of the dilution and removal of particles is dependent on their properties such as aerodynamic size, surface charges and physicochemical characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11409467">8</xref>]. Airborne bacteria in operating theatres are typically adhered to larger particles, termed bacteria carrying particles. One of the most common sources of airborne particles is human skin. Around 1000–200,000 particles per second are estimated to be emitted by humans; some of which will contain bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11409467">12</xref>]. The mean particle diameter for airborne bacteria carrying particles in operating theatres and other occupied environments is 12–15 µm, relating to the typical size of skin squama [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11409467">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11409467">13</xref>]. Particles of this size have a settling velocity of around 0.3 m min<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11409467">3</xref>]. If the turbulent air flow system operates at velocities higher than this settling rate, the airborne particles closely mimic air movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11409467">8</xref>]. However, if turbulent flow is lower than this, as it may be in the operating area, sedimentation of the particles will be unaffected.</p>
<p>A small change in the theatre environment, such as ventilation efficiency, may produce a significant knock-on effect on infection rates. The interaction of different environmental parameters can magnify or reduce the effect of changes within the environment; for example, through the responses of particles of differing sizes and physicochemical properties. Rather than directly measuring infectious agents, environmental change may be detected and controlled to prevent the introduction of infectious agents and pathways of infection transmission. Environmental changes can include the build up of dusts in the ventilation system as well as changes in the outdoor environment. An increase in fine particulates, such as by-products of combustion, may impact upon theatre air quality to varying degrees, depending on the ventilation and supply air filtration systems in place.</p>
<p>This study aims to investigate whether clean-room particle counters can be used as tools within infection control systems to indicate the concentration, size, movement and removal efficiency of particles as a surrogate for infectious particles and their transmission pathways. Optical particle counting has previously been proposed as an accurate measure of bacteria carrying particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11409467">14</xref>]; with the use of particle tracers to investigate particle movement a recommended method for the evaluation of ventilation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11409467">15</xref>]. The strategic use of particle counting can offer several benefits which current air flow checks and microbial counts cannot, including rapid assessment of ventilation systems with minimal human labour, and monitoring to identify changes in the environment which may affect ventilation efficiency.</p>

<p>Sampling took place in March 2010 in a theatre utilised for orthopaedic surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, commissioned in 2005. The ventilation system operates using turbulent flow, maintaining positive pressure from the cleanest (preparation room), to the dirtiest (disposal room and anaesthetics room) parts of the theatre suite, with a designed ACH of 26.4 hr <sup>−1</sup> within the theatre itself. This airflow is maintained through a weighted shutter exhaust between the theatre and anaesthetics room, and a grille outlet between the theatre and disposal room. Inlets are positioned in the ceiling, each inlet located at opposite sides of the room, with a length of 5.6 m and width of 0.2 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11409467">Figure 1</xref>). With ceiling inlet ventilation, exhausts are typically placed at floor level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11409467">6</xref>]. However, in this case, the shutter exhaust has been placed above the anaesthetics room doorway.

</p>
<p>One significant alteration between theatre design and working conditions is that the door to the preparation room is propped open throughout operations. In addition, it was ascertained that the door to the anaesthetics room is sporadically opened during operations. In order to replicate both design and working conditions and the impact of people on particle removal efficiency and airborne bacterial concentrations, five sampling scenarios were implemented. These were:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Operating room empty, design plan (doors closed);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Operating room empty, working plan (preparation room door open);</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Operating room full, working plan, and;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Operating room full, working plan, anaesthetics room door periodically opened.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>When sampling the theatre with personnel present, efforts were made to replicate working conditions, six personnel were present, remained close to the operation bed, and wore the same attire as hospital staff. To further test the effect of staff and their activity on the particle profile in the theatre, scenario 4 was repeated with high human activity, meaning people moved around the theatre, lifting and moving equipment. For this final scenario, bacteriological samples were not taken. Therefore, five scenarios were sampled for airborne microorganisms and six scenarios tested for particle concentrations, distribution and removal efficiency:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>6. Operating room full, working plan (scenario 4) with high activity levels.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Three particle counters capable of counting particles from 0.3 (0.3–0.9), 1 (1–4.9) and &gt;5 µm in diameter (Handheld 3013 Lighthouse Worldwide Solutions, USA) were placed around the room, at the operation room inlet area, where the particle counter inlet was approximately 1 m below ventilation inlet grille; the breathing zone of the bed area, where the particle counter inlet was positioned and the patients' head would lie; and at the operation room outlet between the operation room and anaesthetics room, where the particle counter inlet was positioned approximately parallel to the lower edge of the weighted shutter flaps. A fourth counter capable of counting particles 0.5 (0.5–0.69), 0.7 (0.7–0.9), 1 (1–2.9), 3 (3–4.9), 5 (5–9.9) and &gt;10 µm in diameter (Handheld 5016, Lighthouse Worldwide Solutions, USA) was placed at the operation room outlet grille between the operation room and the disposal room, with the particle counter inlet approximately 1 cm from the outlet grille. All particle counters were calibrated by the manufacturer before use to prevent bias. A carbon dioxide meter was also placed at this location (Vaisala Oyj GMP222 carbon dioxide probe, Finland). Temperature and relative humidity were monitored at two locations within the room (HOBO® U10-003, USA). The above meters were run continuously, logging data every minute throughout the experiment. In addition, an Andersen six-stage cascade sampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) loaded with plates of Tryptic Soy Agar was used at the bed area during scenarios 1–5. Samples were taken over 10 min periods of time at a flow rate of 28.3 L m<sup>−1</sup>, calibrated and confirmed prior to use. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 24 h prior to visual enumeration, count correction according to the manufacturer's instructions and conversion to colony forming units per cubic metre (CFU·m<sup>−3</sup>). Control agar plates (taken to the sampling site and not used) were incubated alongside samples as a quality control. No CFU were counted on these controls after 24 h. In addition, measurements of air velocity (Testo 425 thermal anemometer, Germany) were taken at the inlets, outlets and in the bed area.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1420326X11409467"><title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11409467"><title>Impact of Occupancy and Working Environments on the Particle Profiles</title>
<p>General assessment of inlet flow and calculation of ACH revealed a close match to the designed ACH, at 25.6 hr <sup>−1</sup>. Temperature and relative humidity remained consistent throughout, at 20–21°C and 48–51%, respectively. One of the most important parts of the operating theatre is the bed area, where airborne bacteria may be deposited on the patient. In this area, air velocity was measured at 0.05–0.02 m·s<sup>−1</sup>, this is up to 10 times lower than one recommended maximum turbulent flow rate of 0.2 m·s<sup>−1</sup> at the centre of the theatre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11409467">16</xref>]. However, turbulent flow rates are typically selected for medical, rather than hygienic reasons, with the Department of Health's Health Technical Memorandum (HTM) only providing overall recommended ACH rates for infection control purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11409467">6</xref>]. It has been reported that most particles within operating theatres may be found in the 12–15 µm size range, with a settling velocity of 0.005 m·s<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11409467">3</xref>]. With the assumption that skin squama within the operating theatre have this settling velocity, given the measured flow rate, it is likely that the gravitational settling of these particles in the bed area is disrupted, and particles follow air flow patterns. Therefore, measured particle size classes 0.3–5 µm, shown to follow ambient air flows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11409467">17</xref>], may also represent the particles up to 15 µm in diameter found in hospital settings. The opening of the anaesthetics room doors (scenario 5) affected air velocity at the anaesthetic room outlet, where a decrease in air flow from 1.36 to 0.5 m·s<sup>−1</sup> was recorded, illustrating how the opening of the anaesthetics room doors had a measurable impact on designed air flow patterns.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11409467">Table 1</xref> directly compares mean particle counts at each location during each scenario through a two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test. Where differences in particle counts between two scenarios were significant (&#128;<italic>p</italic> = &amp;#60;0.05), <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11409467">Table 1</xref> indicates particles increased or decreased. At the bed area, an initial sampler error resulted in no results being obtained for scenarios 1 and 2, preventing their comparison to other scenarios. At the inlet area, the location of the particle counter (1 m below inlet) means this sample is likely to represent circulating, rather than purely inlet, air. At this location, particles &amp;#60;1 µm showed significant changes during scenarios 3, 4 and 5. For scenarios 3 and 4, fewer particles were found during occupation of the theatre under both design and working conditions than were found when the theatre was empty; suggesting that people may not be a source of particles of this size range, but that their presence adjusted air flow patterns impacting upon distribution of particles &amp;#60;1 µm. However, an inverse of this relationship was found for particles &gt;1 µm, indicating that people were a source of these particles. For those &amp;#60;1 µm, higher concentrations (&#128;<italic>p</italic> = &amp;#60;0.05) were found under occupied working conditions, when the anaesthetics room door was opened (scenario 5). Again, this may indicate disruption of air flow patterns, although no significant changes in concentration were measured for the other particle size classes during this scenario. Scenario 6, comparing low activity occupancy of the room to high activity, did result in some significant changes in counts of particles 1–5 µm and &gt;5 µm in circulating air (inlet area); with the former size decreasing and the latter increasing with higher activity. This further suggests people both introduce particles of these sizes, and alter their distribution through activities.

<p>At the anaesthetics room outlet, for particles of all size classes, relationships were the same as found for the inlet during scenario 4; with particles &amp;#60;1 µm showing the same relationship during scenario 5, and particles &gt;1 µm showing the same relationship during scenario 3. This confirms the impact of occupancy and change in environmental conditions on particle concentrations. There is some suggestion that the introduction of working conditions when occupied (scenario 2) altered particle concentrations or distribution, with particles &amp;#60;1 µm reducing in number (&#128;<italic>p</italic> = &amp;#60;0.05) with the introduction of working conditions at the anaesthetics room outlet, as well as the bed area, where lower counts of particles 1–5 µm in diameter were also found. Another similarity between particle responses to environmental change at the anaesthetics room outlet and bed area was found for particles 1–5 µm in diameter during scenario 6, where high activity levels led to a significant increase (&#128;<italic>p</italic> = &amp;#60;0.05) in particle count. However, it must be considered that the location of the outlet above the anaesthetics room door may have affected the response of particles to the introduction of working conditions and personnel; meaning these patterns in distribution may not be typical of other operating theatres.</p>
<p>Particles of all size classes measured behaved somewhat differently at the disposal room outlet. For particles &amp;#60;1 µm occupation of the theatre under working conditions (scenario 4) led to a significant increase in particles (&#128;<italic>p</italic> = &amp;#60;0.05), while opening of the anaesthetics room door (scenario 5) led to a significant decrease; likely due to the disruption of air flow patterns. For particles 1–5 µm and 5–10 µm, the same positive response as found at the other sampling locations was observed. In addition, for particles 1–5 µm, the introduction of working conditions while the theatre was empty (scenario 1) led to a significant decrease in concentrations as air flow patterns altered.</p>
<p>For bacteriological samples with the Andersen sampler, counts also increased when the theatre was occupied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11409467">Figure 2</xref>). In all cases, counts remained below the 180 CFU·m<sup>−3</sup> working limit suggested by the Department of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11409467">6</xref>]. Further, during the empty scenario, counts remained below 35 CFU·m<sup>−3</sup>, the suggested limit according to HTM2015, the standard to which this theatre was built. Although according to the new standards set by HTM03, concentrations should remain below 10 CFU·m<sup>−3</sup> in empty theatres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11409467">6</xref>]. This may be explained by the periodic need for personnel to enter the theatre to operate sampling equipment. Further, the data suggest that the introduction of working conditions had little effect on airborne bacterial concentrations, with the presence or absence of people being the most important determinant of concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11409467">14</xref>]. Identification of the microbial colonies was not carried out in this case. It was only possible to obtain one bacteriological sample per scenario due to the small window of time available to work within the operating theatre; preventing validation of the airborne bacterial counts obtained here.

<sec id="sec5-1420326X11409467"><title>Particle Distribution and Removal</title>
<p>As shown above, the distribution of particles within the theatre was affected by scenario and particle size. The location of particle counters at strategic positions around the operating theatre allowed the distribution and removal efficiency of the ventilation system to be tested more directly through comparison of particle counts at the inlet (circulating particles), bed area and anaesthetics outlet. Particle counts at different locations were divided against each other to calculate the percentage differences in particle counts between each location for each scenario. The operation of a ventilation system based on turbulent flow within the theatre was anticipated to result in even distribution of particles. For example, in a direct comparison, it would be anticipated that under a turbulent system 100% of the particles found at the anaesthetics room outlet would be found in circulating air (inlet area). The data (Anaesthetics/Inlet) showed removal efficiencies over 100% comparing circulating air (inlet) and anaesthetics room outlet for all particle sizes, suggesting that some particles introduced by people or re-entrained due to turbulence are directly removed from the theatre rather than entering circulating air (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11409467">Table 2</xref>). This is also the case during empty room scenarios, suggesting particles are present in the circulating air (inlet), and continue to be removed after people have left the theatre; and may be periodically introduced as personnel enter the theatre to operate sampling equipment. To further explore the sources of particles and their removal, the anaesthetics room outlet and bed area were compared. For particles &amp;#60;5 µm between 52% and 89% of particles found at the bed area were also found at the anaesthetics outlet. For particles &gt;5 µm, over 96% of those found at the bed area are found at the anaesthetics outlet, suggesting a higher rate of removal for larger particles via this pathway. This comparison further suggests that a substantial proportion of particles &amp;#60;5 µm may enter circulating air, or are removed via the disposal room outlet. Again, this removal efficiency may be affected by location of the anaesthetics room outlet, potentially creating different pathways for particle movement than may be anticipated from a more typically placed outlet at theatre floor level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11409467">6</xref>].

<fn id="table-fn4-1420326X11409467"><label>a</label><p>Removal efficiency calculated by dividing, for example, particle counts at the anaesthetics outlet by counts at the bed area, giving a percentage value of particles found at the anaesthetics outlet as compared to the bed area.</p></fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap></p>
<p>The above analysis of the response in particle counts to changes in scenario revealed people as a source of particles. As personnel were located around the bed area, this sampling location may represent a source of particles. As such, comparison between the inlet and bed area can suggest what proportions of particles emitted at the bed area circulate the room, while comparison to particles found at the anaesthetics outlet illustrates what proportion are removed. Once again, particles &amp;#60;5 µm behaved differently from those &gt;5 µm. For the smaller size classes, between 36% and 59% of particles at the bed area were found to circulate the room. For all scenarios other than occupied working with the anaesthetics room door opened, the amount of particles removed from the bed area to the anaesthetics room outlet and circulating air (inlet) approximated 100%. This highlights the impact of opening the anaesthetics room door, with disruption of air flow patterns and particle distribution. For particles &amp;#60;1 µm during all scenarios removal from the bed area was relatively evenly distributed between the anaesthetics outlet and the circulating air (inlet). For particles between 1 and 5 µm, the majority were found at the anaesthetics outlet during all scenarios. For particles &gt;5 µm, these patterns in distribution between circulating air (inlet) and anaesthetics room outlet were not found. This may be partially due to the lower counts found for these particles, potentially reducing the reliability of the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11409467">Figure 3</xref>).
<fig id="fig3-1420326X11409467" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Mean particle counts from each sampling location. Notes: A, three-channel particle counts; B, six-channel particle counts. Scenario key is as follows: (♦) empty design; (▪), empty working; (▵) occupied design; (•) occupied working; (+) occupied working with anaesthetics door opened; and (__) occupied working with high activity levels.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11409467-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As a further measure of the distribution of particles around the theatre, the comparison between circulating (inlet) particles and those found at the bed area (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11409467">Table 2</xref>) may be reversed, to analyse the contribution of circulating air to the particles found at the bed area. Over 100% of particles found at the inlet were also found at the bed area; suggesting contribution of both circulating air and personnel to the overall count at the bed area. One exception to this was for particles &gt;5 µm in diameter when the theatre was occupied with high activity, where 92% of particles found to be circulating the room (inlet) were found at the bed area; supporting the previous evidence that particles of this size class follow different dispersal pathways.</p>
<p>As well as particle distribution, particle removal efficiency data may also be used to understand the impact of the scenarios on this distribution. Comparing particles found at the anaesthetics outlet and the bed area, for those over 1 µm in diameter, removal efficiency was lowest during the occupied design scenario, suggesting potential accumulation of particles in these size ranges. The position of the personnel surrounding the bed and the location of the vent above the door, rather than at ground level, may have resulted in this relationship. For all size classes, there was an increase in removal efficiency when doors are opened, with the highest removal efficiencies from the bed area of 85%, 89% and 125% for particles 0.3, 1 and 5 µm in diameter, respectively, when the anaesthetics room door was opened. This may be due to a larger area for the movement of air from an area of positive to negative pressure being provided when the doors are open, resulting in an increase in particle removal efficiency to the anaesthetics room outlet. Alternatively, this may represent adjustment in theatre air flow patterns, diverting particles away from the bed area, rather than removal. Others have reported similar findings, with frequency of door opening found to be a negative predictor of dust levels in an operating theatre, and postulated to result from an increase in turbulent air flow from the theatre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11409467">14</xref>]. The finding that geometric mean did not significantly alter at the disposal room outlet throughout each scenario (ranging 1.10–1.28 µm) suggests particle concentration and distribution at this outlet is less affected by the opening of the anaesthetics door. Although, the three highest geometric mean values were returned from the occupied scenarios, under operating conditions; suggesting some influence of people on the particle profile of the theatre at the disposal room outlet. Across all scenarios, geometric standard deviation ranged 1.40–1.46.</p>
<p>The above data comparing locations of particle counters must be interpreted with caution. Almost all calculations of particle removal efficiency from the inlet returned values over 100%. As postulated above, this may be partially due to the introduction of particles to the theatre. However, this data may also be an artefact of the sampling methodology. In order to gain a sample representative of the ambient air, flow rates must be isokinetic. In this case, mean inlet flow rate (0.57 m<sup>3</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup>) outstrips sampling rate (0.000047 m<sup>3</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup>) by 4 orders of magnitude, and mean anaesthetic room outlet flow rate (1.36 m<sup>3</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup>) outstrips sampling rate by 5 orders of magnitude. While the greatest flow rates were measured at these locations, point measurements in the bed area (0.05–0.2 m·s<sup>−1</sup>) also revealed velocities 3–4 orders of magnitude higher than sampling rate. Sampling is therefore sub-isokinetic in all cases. This may result in oversampling, where particles that should not be part of the sampled air are carried into the sampling probe due to their own inertia and the velocity of air flowing past the probe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11409467">18</xref>]. In this case, the differences in the degree of oversampling may result in some over- or under-estimation of removal efficiency, particularly at the anaesthetics room outlet and inlet area. Specifically, the greater degree of oversampling at the anaesthetics room outlet may have led to overestimation of removal efficiency.</p>
<p>In addition, as mentioned above, counts of particles &gt;5 µm in diameter were low, typically being found below 100 min<sup>−1</sup>. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11409467">Figure 2</xref> shows how the majority of bacteria carrying particles were found on stages 1–3, namely over 3 µm in diameter. In particular, for particles within the 4.7–7 µm, 50% cut-off size range comprised between 22% and 63% of total CFU for all scenarios other than empty working (scenario 2). In contrast, particles within the 5 µm size range given by the particle counters formed less than 1% of total counts across all scenarios. The Andersen sampler and particle counter have vastly different sampling rates, at 28.3 and 2.83 L·min<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. This difference may mean the Andersen is more efficient at sampling particles of larger diameters and suggests the particle counters may underestimate bacteria carrying particles potentially.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11409467"><title>Particle Sizes</title>
<p>The application of a two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test to analyse the significance of changes in particle count across the scenarios suggests that each particle size class responds to changes in scenario in a different way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11409467">14</xref>]. For example, particles &amp;#60;1 µm in size showed a significant negative relationship with the presence of personnel in the theatre, while particles &gt;1 µm significantly increased when people entered the theatre. Further, the response of particle counts to scenarios at each location around the theatre showed some differences. For example, 0.5 µm particles counted at the disposal room outlet responded positively to the introduction of personnel under working conditions, and negatively to occupied working conditions when the anaesthetics room door was opened; the opposite of the response of 0.3 µm particles measured to be circulating the room (inlet) and at the anaesthetics room outlet. The use of a six-channel counter at the disposal room outlet also allowed analysis of geometric mean particle size, discussed above. The minimal impact that occupation of the theatre had on mean particle size further suggests particles remain in the theatre at residual concentrations when personnel are not present. Overall, the data gained through particle counting suggest that despite the turbulent air flow, mixing is incomplete and distribution variable depending upon occupancy and usage of the theatre.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11409467">Figure 3</xref> shows the distribution of particles of different sizes graphically. Over 90% of all particles counted were found in the fine size class, below 1 µm in diameter; in agreement with previously reported data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11409467">14</xref>]. This was found for all scenarios and at all sampling locations. As suggested previously through analysis of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11409467">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11409467">2</xref>, particles &gt;5 µm are found at low concentrations, potentially affecting accuracy of the comparisons made for this particle size class. Although as described above, total counts of particles in this size range may be underestimated due to the sampling limitations. At the disposal room outlet, particles between 0.5 and 3 µm in diameter dominated. At all locations other than inlet, representing circulating air, highest concentrations were returned during occupied scenarios. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11409467">Table 1</xref> illustrated how despite higher concentrations of particles &amp;#60;1 µm, the increase during occupied scenarios was not significant. This may indicate variable concentrations of particles in this size class during all scenarios, supporting the supposition that they were periodically introduced, or distribution pathways disrupted, as personnel entered the theatre.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1420326X11409467"><title>Limitations and Future Investigations</title>
<p>It is well recognised within available literature that few extensive and validated studies of the relationship between ventilation systems and infection rates in hospitals exist. This is due to the difficulties of gathering statistically significant data where infection rates are already low, thanks to good practice aseptic techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11409467">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11409467">5</xref>]. Furthermore, investigation of case-study operating theatres is challenging due to their busy operating schedules, preventing access for experimental purposes; this limitation has restricted the investigation presented here to one sampling day. The use of optical particle counting may offer an alternative method for the assessment of ventilation performance, with assessment of potentially bacteria carrying particles and the efficiency of the system at removing these particles. The real-time nature of this method also offers the potential to rapidly investigate theatres where increases in infection rates have been noted, or where ventilation systems are suspected to be faulty. Accumulation of airborne particles within the theatre is likely to be indicative of an increased risk of infection. However, one of the limitations of this study is the lack of measurement of particles 12–15 µm in diameter. Future investigations into the utility of portable particle counters able to measure particles over 10 µm in diameter are required. In addition, the data suggest that sampling limitations may lead to underestimation of particles within and over the 5 µm size range. Despite this, the data suggest that the smaller particle size diameters measured may act as a proxy for these particles, as air flow rates are such that particle settling will be disrupted and particles follow the air flow. Future studies will carry out additional bacteriological sampling in order to validate the counts found here in different scenarios, compare with other operating theatres, and identify bacteria with the aim of identifying sources, and the particle sizes these bacteria are associated with. For example, Mannitol salt or Baird-Parker agar may be used to isolate <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>.</p>
<p>Within this study, two models of particle counter, three-channel and six-channel, from the same manufacturer were used. The performance of particle counters may differ depending upon the manufacturer. For example, other manufacturers may use higher sampling rates, which may improve recovery of larger particles. To reduce potential error resulting from different sampler performance, the same brand samplers should be used. Here, the six-channel counter offers the advantage of sampling particles up to 10 µm in diameter, encompassing more potentially bacteria carrying particles than the three-channel, which can measure up to 5 µm. The six-channel also allows analysis of the size distribution of particles counted. These benefits are mitigated by the additional cost of a six-channel particle counter, which may reduce their applicability.</p>
<p>An additional operational consideration is the variation of flow rates at different sampling points, and the differences between inlet diameter and flow rate for particle counters and the Andersen sampler. These operational limitations prevent absolute value comparison between particle counts and bacterial counts; although, the relative trend and the change in particle counts in different scenarios are more important for this application.</p>
<p>Further investigations are required to continue the development of this methodology, including enumeration of particles up to 15 µm in diameter, and continued exploration of the impact of working conditions, including analysis of the effect that convective currents from lighting has on particle removal efficiency. On this occasion, the lighting system used within operations at the bed area was not in use; although, the convective effect of operative lighting and the ability of these convection currents to transport airborne particles have been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11409467">2</xref>]. Comparison to a theatre with the shutter outlet placed in a more conventional location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11409467">6</xref>] would allow the impact of the configuration used here (vent above anaesthetics room door) on particle distribution and removal efficiency to be determined. The location of particle counters within this study provided data regarding the sources, distribution and removal of particles within the theatre. However, the locations also had the disadvantages of not effectively sampling the inlet air, and preventing direct comparison between the disposal room outlet and other locations, as the six-channel instrument was used at this location. Further refinement and investigation of sampling locations may improve the data gained through this type of investigation.</p>
<p>Abnormal increases in particle concentrations, as well as changes in size distribution, movement of particles, and removal efficiency may result from the movement of people, use of new instruments and operation procedures, and alterations in infrastructure and engineering performance. Despite the above limitations, if successful particle counting enables monitoring of change in particle profiles under these working conditions.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1420326X11409467"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Within this study, particle distributions were uneven despite high designed turbulence. The presence of people within the operating theatre also had the greatest impact on both airborne bacteria and particle counts, resulting in an increase in both cases. This supports the suggestion that particle counting may act as a surrogate measure of airborne bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11409467">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Particle counts are real-time and would allow a rapid and economical diagnostic of theatre ventilation systems by infection control teams. The impact of the environment on particle profiles can be used to indicate the effect of expected and unexpected environmental changes on these particles. Moreover, a monitoring system utilising these techniques could be established and run automatically for long periods of time (from days to weeks) enabling 24-h use, including during surgery; monitoring any long-term changes in the environment with minimal human labour. The particle data can be retrieved and analysed remotely and rapidly, and in the future be integrated into other facility management systems, providing an additional barrier to nosocomial infection. In particular, particle counters could be used within routine investigations into operating theatre ventilation systems, particularly where higher rates of infection are suspected.</p>
