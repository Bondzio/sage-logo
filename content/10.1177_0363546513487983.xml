<sec id="section1-0363546513487983">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>There are conflicting reports regarding the association between isokinetic concentric quadriceps and hamstring strength deficits and ratios and risk for hamstring injuries in athletes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513487983">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To determine if isokinetic concentric Cybex data collected during the annual National Football League (NFL) Scouting Combine are predictive of hamstring injury in professional American football players during their first season.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513487983">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513487983">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>All 32 NFL teams identified players selected during the first 5 rounds of the NFL annual draft who had hamstring injuries during their first professional season. Of these, 164 players with 172 injuries also had Cybex data from the previous year’s Combine. Analyses compared injured legs with contralateral uninjured legs and also injured players with uninjured controls using a database of Cybex data from all players who participated in the NFL Scouting Combine from 2006 to 2011.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513487983">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>No Cybex strength variable differentiated the injured legs from the contralateral uninjured legs or injured players from uninjured controls, even after taking into account days lost from activity. Mean ± SD peak torque for the injured and contralateral uninjured sides was as follows: 315.7 ± 70.0 and 313.5 ± 68.3 N·m, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .773, paired <italic>t</italic> test), for quadriceps and 203.0 ± 42.4 and 205.3 ± 42.5 N·m, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .608, paired <italic>t</italic> test), for hamstrings. The sensitivity and specificity for the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio predicting hamstring injury were 0.513 (95% confidence interval, 0.419-0.607) and 0.524 (0.495-0.554), indicating that the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio was not a useful predictor of injury (calculation used the mean ± SD ratio for injured legs, 0.656 ± 0.133). Side-to-side peak torque differences were also not predictive of injury, with more than a 10% difference (plus or minus) occurring commonly in both injured and uninjured players for quadriceps (53% prevalence for both injured and uninjured) and hamstrings (injured, 41% prevalence; uninjured, 43% prevalence).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513487983">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Isokinetic strength data collected from collegiate players at the NFL Scouting Combine were not useful for predicting risk of hamstring injury in subsequent professional NFL competition. These data call into question commonly accepted assumptions about risk factors for hamstring injury, at least for elite collegiate American football players, when the temporal relationship between Cybex testing and actual injury is several months.</p>

<body>
<p>Hamstring injuries are commonplace and cause considerable morbidity and missed playing time in sports that require bursts of speed and flexibility such as soccer, track and field, and American football.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513487983">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513487983">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513487983">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513487983"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513487983">9</xref></sup> The cause of hamstring injury is likely multifactorial. Contributory factors may include muscle weakness, side-to-side strength discrepancies, inadequate flexibility, fatigue, and poor lumbar posture, among other explanations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546513487983">§</xref></sup> Once injured, a player is at elevated risk for reinjury. Considerable effort has focused on identifying risk factors, strategies to avoid injury, and rehabilitation after an injury occurs.</p>
<p>Elliot et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513487983">9</xref></sup> recently reported on the prevalence of hamstring injuries in the National Football League (NFL). More than half of the injuries (51.3%) occurred during training camp and caused an average of 213 man-games lost annually. Injuries during preseason practice accounted for 78.9% of hamstring injuries, with more than 70% happening during July, the first month of the preseason. Positions dependent most on speed and acceleration (ie, wide receiver, cornerback, special teams) proved most at risk. These authors suggested that the relative deconditioning that occurs in the offseason predisposes players to early season injury.</p>
<p>Various studies have suggested that a strength imbalance between the quadriceps and hamstrings (specifically with a hamstrings-to-quadriceps [H/Q] ratio of &lt;0.6) is predictive of risk for hamstring strain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363546513487983">‖</xref></sup> However, not all studies support a causal relationship between low H/Q and risk for injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513487983">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513487983">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513487983">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine if causal relationships could be established between isokinetic concentric quadriceps and hamstring strength data collected from collegiate players at the NFL Scouting Combine annually in February and hamstring injuries that occurred in the first subsequent professional season beginning approximately 4 months later.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0363546513487983">
<title>Cybex Cohort</title>
<p>Cybex data were available for the NFL Scouting Combine from 2006 to 2011, with a total of 1252 players having complete data sets entered into our database at the time of this report (some players had injuries or for other reasons did not have data collected for both right and left sides). Demographic data were also collected for each athlete consisting of age (most participants were completing their senior year in college), weight, playing position, and self-determined dominant lower extremity side. There were no specific inclusion or exclusion criteria. No attempt was made to judge and eliminate apparent outliers. All players signed a consent form allowing use of their data by teams for the annual draft and also for research purposes. This study was approved by the Baptist Health South Florida Institutional Review Board.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546513487983">
<title>Injury Cohort</title>
<p>The NFL maintains a mandatory injury reporting system to be followed by all clubs. All injuries, including hamstring injuries, are reportable and well documented. Trainers from all 32 NFL teams were surveyed to provide names of players who had hamstring injuries during their first professional year. Data included the side of the injury, total days lost due to injury, and total games lost to injury. Cybex data for these players were transferred from the normative database and constituted a separate “hamstring injury database.” The subsequent normative Cybex database for comparative purposes did not contain the Cybex data for the injured players.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546513487983">
<title>Strength Measurements</title>
<p>Isokinetic concentric hamstring and quadriceps measurements were made using a Cybex model HUMAC Norm (CSMI Medical Solutions, Stoughton, Massachusetts) dynamometer. After a short practice session, NFL staff tested participants at both 60 and 300 deg/s, with 3 and 15 repetitions recorded at each speed, respectively. Peak torque (best repetition) and work repetition variables were measured with isokinetic concentric/concentric testing with 3 repetitions at an angular velocity of 60/60 deg/s. Initial peak torque (mean of the first 3 repetitions of the endurance test of 15 total repetitions), fatigue index (the average peak torque of the first 3 repetitions vs that of the last 3 repetitions and stated in percent decline), and total work variables were collected after 15 repetitions at an angular velocity of 300/300 deg/s.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546513487983">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics (mean ± SD, range, and 95% confidence interval) were calculated for the injured and control cohorts, as well as the H/Q ratios. Injured- to uninjured-side comparisons were made using paired <italic>t</italic> tests, and comparisons between injured and uninjured control players were made using unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests. If data were not normally distributed, comparisons were made using nonparametric statistics as noted in the Results section. We chose <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 to represent statistical significance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Team athletic trainers identified 203 players with hamstring injuries from the 960 draft picks in the first 5 rounds of the 2006 to 2011 drafts for the 32 NFL teams for a prevalence of hamstring injury of 21.2%. Of these, 164 players (80.8%) with 172 hamstring injuries had usable Cybex data from the previous Combine in February of the same year as their first professional season (in some cases, there were missing data for various reasons, and not all draft picks participated in the previous Combine). The mean ± SD age of the injured cohort was 22.3 ± 0.8 years. More injuries occurred on the nondominant side (55%) compared with the dominant side (45%), but this side-to-side prevalence difference was not statistically significantly different (<italic>P</italic> = .098, Fisher exact test). In this group of players, 59% missed fewer than 10 days of practice, 41% missed 10 or more days, 19% missed more than 20 days, and 7% missed more than 30 days due to the injury (mean, 10.2 days).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513487983">Table 1</xref> shows the injury prevalence by playing position and also a comparison with the percentage of players at each position from the normative database of all players who participated in the NFL Scouting Combine from 2006 to 2011. The proportion of hamstring injuries in defensive backs, running backs, and wideouts (comprising 64% of all the injuries) was statistically significantly greater than what would be expected from the percent representation of those positions in the normative database (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513487983">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513487983">Table 2</xref> summarizes the descriptive statistics for isokinetic concentric quadriceps and hamstring strength for the total cohort of injured players. The only statistically significant difference comparing the injured side with the uninjured side was a small 3.7% greater quadriceps initial peak torque for the injured leg. We used the number of practice days and games missed as a surrogate for injury severity (more days missed, the worse the injury) and performed correlation analyses (days missed vs Cybex variables).

<p>Because there is a significant correlation between body mass (ie, body weight) and Cybex strength data and because standardizing Cybex strength data by body weight overcorrects the effect of mass, we could not effectively directly compare Cybex variables for the total injured cohort with that of uninjured controls (body weight was significantly greater in the uninjured controls due to the greater number of linemen compared with the injured cohort). Therefore, we compared injured players and uninjured players by position. Results of the comparisons showed no difference in Cybex variables between injured players and controls after adjusting for playing position. An example is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546513487983">Table 3</xref>, summarizing Cybex data for wideouts. Regardless of how comparisons are made—injured side to contralateral uninjured side, dominant to contralateral nondominant side, or injured side to uninjured controls—there were no statistically significant differences.</p>

A sensitivity-specificity analysis was done to determine the value of peak torque H/Q for predicting hamstring injury. However, no useful decision threshold could be identified because the receiver operating characteristics curve (sensitivity vs 1 − specificity) was basically a 45-degree line running from the intersection of the axes, indicating that H/Q ratio was no better than chance alone for predicting hamstring injury. For illustrative purposes, a calculation using the mean H/Q for the injured legs of 0.656 for the injured cohort and the normative database that includes these players is presented; results showed a sensitivity of 51% and a specificity of 52%. The positive likelihood ratio was 1.08, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.93. The false-positive rate was 90%. Finally, with respect to evaluating the role of H/Q ratios in predicting injury, we used the cutpoint of 0.60 (a commonly held threshold for injury risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513487983">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513487983">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513487983">23</xref></sup>) and compared the fraction of injured legs with H/Q &lt;0.60 to the fraction of contralateral uninjured legs and control players with H/Q &lt;0.60. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546513487983">Table 4</xref> shows three 2 × 2 comparisons of the fraction of players with H/Q &lt;0.60.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we analyzed isokinetic concentric quadriceps and hamstring Cybex data for professional NFL players who had a hamstring injury during their first season after Cybex testing. As expected, most injured players were in positions that involved frequent high-speed running. Various comparisons were made between injured legs and contralateral uninjured legs and injured players and uninjured controls in an attempt to find variables that could be used to predict risk of hamstring injury. No convincing differences among the many variables examined could be identified, including absolute strength such as peak torque, H/Q ratios, fatigue index, and side-to-side discrepancies. Although several pairwise comparisons were in fact statistically significant at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, the absolute differences in the variables were small (such as the small 3.7% greater initial quadriceps peak torque for the injured leg in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513487983">Table 2</xref>) and highly unlikely to be clinically relevant. These results call into question the concepts that low H/Q ratios or side-to-side discrepancies greater than 10% are risk factors for hamstring injury, at least for elite collegiate American football players, when the temporal relationship between Cybex testing and actual injury is several months.</p>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that a strength imbalance between quadriceps and hamstrings (specifically with an H/Q ratio less than 0.6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513487983">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513487983">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513487983">23</xref></sup>) is predictive of risk for hamstring strain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363546513487983">¶</xref></sup> However, not all studies support a causal relationship between low H/Q and risk for injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513487983">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513487983">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513487983">23</xref></sup> It has also been recognized that other factors in addition to simply muscle strength contribute to risk for hamstring injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513487983">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513487983">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513487983">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513487983">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513487983">21</xref></sup> Our analysis of H/Q ratios as a predictor of injury suggested no predictive relationship with risk for hamstring injury in our cohort. Sensitivity-specificity calculations clearly demonstrated this fact, showing poor sensitivity and specificity of H/Q ratios for identifying players with known injuries, with a positive likelihood ratio of 1.08. It remains difficult to reconcile the conflicting results in the sports medicine literature regarding the role of low H/Q ratio and side-to-side imbalance in the etiology of hamstring injury. It is likely the disparity at least in part is explained by variations in study design, lack of standardization of Cybex testing and variables used, type of sport involved, and level of play (amateur vs professional). We note that our findings are similar to those of Bennell et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513487983">3</xref></sup> who studied hamstring injury in Australian Rules footballers and found no association between preseason muscle weakness or imbalance and subsequent occurrence of hamstring muscle strain. Furthermore, they reported no significant strength differences between injured and uninjured legs in players who have injuries. Although in our study H/Q ratios were not predictive of injury per se, it remains possible that in combination with other risk factors, such as older player age, poor flexibility, or prior injury, a low H/Q ratio may be contributory to injury.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is important to note that although the concentric H/Q ratio is commonly calculated and reported, it may not actually have functional relevance. This is because during knee extension, it is the antagonistic eccentric hamstring coactivation that serves to decrease the anterior shear forces of the concentric quadriceps muscles. Thus, theoretically, it may be more relevant to calculate a “functional” H/Q ratio as the peak eccentric hamstrings torque divided by the peak concentric quadriceps torque. However, that said, we know of 2 reports in which the functional H/Q was measured, but results were not correlated with risk for hamstring injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513487983">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513487983">23</xref></sup> Unfortunately, at the NFL Scouting Combine, it is not feasible to measure the eccentric hamstring peak torque.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding H/Q ratio, it is becoming increasingly evident that measurement imprecision may confound interpretation of calculated variables such as H/Q that involve combining variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513487983">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513487983">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513487983">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513487983">18</xref></sup> This is because each variable will have its own inherent measurement error, and combining terms amplifies the error. Thus, we suggest it is unlikely that a weak association between concentric H/Q and risk for injury would be readily identified unless measurement variability during Cybex testing could be lessened.</p>
<p>We carefully scrutinized fatigue index data as a predictor for hamstring injury. Although there was a tendency for a greater fatigue index in players with more days missed and presumably more severe injuries, the strength of the correlation was weak (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.029). Nevertheless, future studies on the cause of hamstring injury may want to focus on an athlete’s fatigability and risk for injury. Also, future Cybex testing at the Combine may benefit from greater attention to the potentially confounding effect of lack of maximal effort by players during Cybex testing (eg, a player may be protecting and hiding an injured leg) and measurement error on data integrity (which may partly explain the large variability in the data).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513487983">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513487983">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>A long-held notion in the field of sports medicine is that measured muscle torque of dominant and nondominant or right and left quadriceps and hamstrings is generally assumed to be near equal or “in balance” with less than a 10% side-to-side difference.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0363546513487983">#</xref></sup> In our cohort of elite collegiate football players, more than half of the players in the normative database had dominant- to nondominant-side quadriceps differences greater than ±10%, and 43% of players had hamstring differences greater than ±10%, with 95% of values within a range of −41% to +41% for quadriceps and −30% to +30% for hamstrings. The range of side-to-side difference was also large in the players with hamstring injuries. Although some differences were identified compared with the profile of uninjured players (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546513487983">Table 4</xref>), they were small and unlikely to be clinically relevant.</p>
<p>This study had several limitations characteristic of retrospective and survey studies. First, the reports of hamstring injuries were from surveys and could not be independently confirmed. The severity of injury was not discernible other than by playing days missed, which is an imperfect surrogate estimate of injury severity (this is because a player may have had an early return-to-practice but at a reduced level of intensity). From the data received, only a small percentage (7%) had missed more than 30 days of play (by comparison, Croisier et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513487983">6</xref></sup> included only players with more than 28 days missed), and thus it is possible that overall injury severity for the cohort was minimal, masking a possible role of low H/Q in the origin of injury. It was not possible to calculate the theoretically optimal H/Q ratio as the peak eccentric hamstrings torque divided by the peak concentric quadriceps torque. It is possible that training or deconditioning after the Combine influenced the risk for injury. Thus, it is possible that hamstring weakness identified with Cybex testing may only be predictive of injury over the next several weeks and not months, as in this study (however, the objective was to determine if the Cybex data from the February Combine were predictive of injury). Finally, caution must be taken when generalizing our conclusions to include athletes in other sports because these data were taken from elite athletes over a very narrow and young age range. Finally, we acknowledge that the conditions surrounding Cybex testing at the NFL Scouting Combine are not the same as would be required in a controlled laboratory study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, isokinetic strength data collected from collegiate players at the NFL Scouting Combine were not useful for predicting risk of hamstring injury in subsequent professional NFL competition.</p>

<ack>
<p>We thank the athletic trainers in the NFL who provided their team’s hamstring injury information, which was essential in completing this research effort. We also acknowledge the contributions of Alexander Toirac, Seth MacMahon, and Yvette Hernandez for entering and maintaining the extensive database of Cybex data. Derek Papp, MD, contributed to the development of the normative database used in this study.</p>
