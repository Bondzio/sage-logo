<abstract>
<p>This article presents participatory action synthesis as a new approach to qualitative synthesis which may be used to facilitate the promotion and use of qualitative research for policy and practice. The authors begin by outlining different forms of qualitative research synthesis and then present participatory action synthesis, a collaborative approach to data analysis, synthesis, interpretation and knowledge construction, enabling individual data generation and its analysis to be offered for communal analysis. The principles and practice of participatory action synthesis are presented prior to a short case study which illustrates how it has been used to date. The final section of the article outlines the challenges and opportunities of this approach, suggesting that it can facilitate the raising of the profile of qualitative synthesis among the disciplines.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Researchers across education and practice are experiencing an escalating need to demonstrate their innovation, contribution, and perceived effectiveness in a competitive economic climate where funding available for empirical research is decreasing. As economic constraints restrict the means of conducting isolated studies, this article argues that researchers need to consider alternative means of progressing their work. Participatory action synthesis is presented here as a new methodological approach, in which researchers are able to synthesize, interpret, and construct greater meaning from qualitative <italic>data sets</italic> (for example, from accumulated data across several studies), in a participatory process, to maximize knowledge production, dissemination, relevance, and scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>The term participatory is used to include the researcher(s) who collected the data and other associated colleagues (e.g., research supervisors/mentors) who have a vested interest in the research and who can be viewed as co-researchers, who work collaboratively to take responsibility for engaging in a participatory process of analyzing, interpreting, and constructing knowledge. This does not rule out opportunity for those classed as the research participants, with whom the research is conducted, also to be involved in the participatory process, as is typical within participatory methodologies. Participatory action synthesis therefore is more than a team of researchers conducting a literature review, and is different from researchers conducting a qualitative research synthesis of qualitative studies. Instead this methodology relies upon a scholarly process of <italic>collective</italic> analysis, synthesis, and interpretation of qualitative data, with the researchers who collected the primary data sharing it with different team members who can take a broader stance and wider view. In this article we provide an overview of participatory action synthesis, including its theoretical underpinning. Detail is included on how to conduct the synthesis process with an example from practice. Finally a list of the key challenges and opportunities is provided.</p>
<sec id="section2-1077800412452854">
<title>Forms of Qualitative Research Synthesis</title>
<p>Although synthesis of quantitative studies has an established profile within the research community, it is argued here that other methods are required to combine the more personalized perspectives which are difficult to locate through quantitative methods such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and crossover studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412452854">Major &amp; Savin-Baden, 2010</xref>). The growth in approaches to synthesis is marked in part by the expansion in the use of systematic reviews as well as meta-analyses. The synthesis of qualitative studies is gaining increasing recognition, building upon the seminal work on meta-ethnography by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452854">Noblit and Hare (1988)</xref>, whose work has provided a template for methods useful when analyzing, synthesizing, and interpreting the results from qualitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077800412452854">Paterson, Thorne, Canam, &amp; Jillings, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800412452854">Sandelowski &amp; Barroso, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077800412452854">Walsh &amp; Downe, 2005</xref>). Conducting qualitative research synthesis has served to provide researcher knowledge about quality issues when conducting qualitative research methodology, because only studies of high caliber and standing are included in the synthesis. This section outlines a number of forms of qualitative synthesis to locate participatory action synthesis in the context of these other approaches. This is important as there are presently a number of forms of syntheses in use by qualitative researchers, which although they overlap, do provide different emphases in the management and analysis of qualitative data.</p>
<sec id="section3-1077800412452854">
<title>Meta-ethnography</title>
<p>In Noblit and Hare’s classic work, <italic>Meta-ethnography</italic>, the authors make a case for using an interpretive approach for integrating findings from existing interpretive studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452854">Noblit and Hare (1988)</xref> state that such an approach:
<disp-quote>
<p>Allows for substantive interpretations that can be derived from ethnographic and interpretive studies (p. 9).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This process allows the researcher to compare and analyze texts, creating new interpretations in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452854">Noblit &amp; Hare, 1988</xref>). In their text, they outline their approach to synthesizing a small number (between 2 and 5) of qualitative studies. Noblit and Hare’s work, we suggest, began the process of a revolution in approaches to synthesizing qualitative evidence. A qualitative synthesis then, uses qualitative methods to synthesize existing qualitative studies to construct greater meaning through an interpretive process. It involves focusing on a narrow research question, as well as an interpretation of previous research with similar questions, while using a rigorous and methodologically grounded approach for analysis that is filtered through an interpretive lens. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452854">Noblit and Hare (1988)</xref> define this meta-ethnographic approach as essentially about “inference,” as in what can be said about the range of studies as a whole. Here the significant themes within each study, and for the study set, are connected through noting how one study informs another (p. 62).</p>

<title>Qualitative Research Synthesis</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412452854">Major and Savin-Baden’s (2010)</xref> work on qualitative research synthesis provides detailed guidance on the complex and demanding task of moving from analysis to synthesis and on into data interpretation. Their process acknowledges the importance of transparency in the design as well as in the reporting of the synthesis. Furthermore, as their work moves beyond the synthesis of purely ethnographic studies, the importance of including qualitative methodologies of broadly the same tradition, including the identification of researcher stance, is viewed as imperative when representing the data set. The authors argue that their approach is similar to critical interpretive synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412452854">Dixon-Woods, Seale, Young, Findlay, &amp; Heney, 2003</xref>), alternately termed simply <italic>meta-synthesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800412452854">Bair &amp; Haworth, 2005</xref>), which although it tends to adopt qualitative research synthesis, or meta-ethnographic approaches, applies them to both quantitative and qualitative studies and generally draws upon a much larger sample size than qualitative research synthesis. Furthermore, they suggest the studies most frequently used in qualitative synthesis are not ethnographies, but rather are other forms of qualitative approaches; although Noblit and Hare did try to incorporate the broader meaning into their definition of meta-ethnography, the fact is that many qualitative researchers still argue about the lack of precision of the term. Qualitative research synthesis began by taking a clear interpretivist stance, but more recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800412452854">Major and Savin-Baden (2011)</xref> have shifted toward a social-constructionist position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077800412452854">
<title>Reciprocal Translational Analysis</title>
<p>A reciprocal translation as synthesis is the comparative translation of one study into another. This process occurs through the use of iterative cycles, and the consideration of how interpreted themes, referred to as “metaphors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452854">Noblit &amp; Hare, 1988</xref>) identified within one study, can be compared and translated to synthesize themes across a (diverse) range of studies (p. 34). If it is not feasible to adequately express the full set of data through such criteria then new themes (metaphors) are necessary to complete the synthesis. This type of synthesis relies on the assumption that themes, categories, and relationships within data sets can be collapsed or translated into one another. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800412452854">Sandelowski and Barroso (2007)</xref> refer to an amended use of reciprocal translational analysis (RTA) in their work on qualitative meta-synthesis. As an interpretive integration of qualitative findings, qualitative meta-synthesis seeks to offer new interpretations of the findings of the included studies, while maintaining data integrity; a reading into and between the lines to develop “an interpretive logic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800412452854">Sandelowski &amp; Barroso, 2007</xref>, p. 18). Rather than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452854">Noblit and Hare’s (1988)</xref> synthesis of purely ethnographical research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800412452854">Sandelowski and Barroso’s (2007)</xref> approach to reciprocal translation offers use of a broader combination of qualitative studies with both a wide range of methodologies and set parameters for exclusion. For example, their methodological parameters in the Metasynthesis Project excluded mixed methods, mixed samples, and studies with no extractable data. Their adaptation of RTA was to <italic>integrate</italic> the study findings interpretively, as opposed to <italic>comparing</italic> findings interpretively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452854">Noblit &amp; Hare, 1988</xref>). In addition, this may include comparison of concepts from out-with the data sets, for example, from other data, or the wider literature. However, limited guidance is offered to guide the synthesist through this adapted method, including how to make the distinction between the two techniques. Furthermore, as the next section goes on to consider, it is not always reasonable to assume studies can be compared or integrated and translated in this way, and at times other methods are required.</p>

<sec id="section6-1077800412452854">
<title>Refutational Analysis</title>
<p>As a form of interpretation, a refutation is one that does not compare with another; rather, perspectives compete on a particular theme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452854">Noblit &amp; Hare, 1988</xref>). Thus a refutational analysis involves analyzing the relationship between the opposing explanations, variations, and contradictions and presenting these (themes) as distinct accounts within the synthesis. The value of refutational synthesis is that it enables the reader to see how the researcher has approached their study, including how issues of positionality and researcher stance can influence the interpretation of data.</p>

<sec id="section7-1077800412452854">
<title>The Move to Participatory Action Synthesis</title>
<p>Interpretive research approaches have been criticized within the literature due to the attempts of researchers to develop, using what are often considered as tentative findings of qualitative research, a comprehensive understanding of a particular theme or practice. Indeed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077800412452854">Sandelowski, Docherty &amp; Emden (1997)</xref> contend that in attempting to combine projects in this way the “vitality, viscerality, and vicariism of the human experiences represented in the original studies is lost” (p. 366). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077800412452854">Statham (1988)</xref> uses the term <italic>analytic interruptus</italic> to criticize qualitative researchers for not going far enough in interrogating their data and analyzing their work. What participatory action synthesis offers then, is a means of constructing greater meaning through a communal approach focused on a wider, deeper interrogation of the data and its analyses. This approach, when focused on a particular theme or area of study enables the nuances, assumptions, and textured milieu of varying accounts to be exposed, described and explained in ways that bring fresh insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077800412452854">Walsh &amp; Downe, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>What is apparent when examining the methodological approach within participatory action synthesis is the considerable role of the synthesist as an interpreter of primary research data, translating, re-presenting, making judgments and envisioning relationships among concepts and research decisions. Related to the notion of “deep authentic understanding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412452854">Denzin, 1989</xref>), the synthesist becomes immersed in the data alongside his/her own informed assumptions, knowledge, and experience about the phenomenon under study (p. 33).</p>
<p>However, it is then important to acknowledge, both consciously and explicitly, each individual team members’ methodological and reflexive stance, without unnecessary self-preoccupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800412452854">Finlay, 2003</xref>), enabling the reader to be better equipped to critically analyze the thought processes involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800412452854">Conneeley, 2002</xref>) and interpretations reached.</p>
<p>In what now follows, we build upon both Noblit and Hare’s approaches for conducting a meta-synthesis, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412452854">Major and Savin-Baden’s (2010)</xref> suggestions of how to manage the complexity of qualitative research synthesis. We present participatory action synthesis as a methodology for synthesizing primary research data from associated studies to develop higher level constructs. We believe participatory action synthesis is a methodological approach qualitative researchers may find to be worthy of consideration when approaching the analysis of data sets, not least by its explicit participatory element. We begin this overview by discussing where we believe participatory action synthesis might be methodologically located.</p>

<sec id="section8-1077800412452854">
<title>Situating Participatory Action Synthesis</title>
<p>Constructivism is a cognitive theory developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077800412452854">Piaget (1951)</xref>. Based on work with children, Piaget asserted that the learner constructs knowledge in education. Constructivists doing research seek to understand the way meanings are constructed and to apprehend how such meanings are presented and used though language and action. Those who adopt this stance seek understanding of what everyday meanings <italic>mean</italic> for individuals in their own homes, groups, and lives. Constructivists argue that truth is a result of perspective and therefore knowledge and truth are created rather than discovered. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452854">Gergen and Gergen (1991)</xref> suggested a move away from the cognitive stance of constructivism arguing instead for <italic>social</italic> constructionism. Social constructionists argue that instead of focusing on the mind (the cognitive approach) it is important to recognize that the world is shared. Their argument is that the world is produced and understood through interchanges between people and shared objects and activities. Constructionists believe that hidden or private phenomena such as emotions gain their meaning through social settings and practice, and are therefore socially constructed.</p>
<p>Participatory action synthesis, we argue, is situated within a social-constructionist paradigm in that its focus is on the co-creation of knowledge, as the research team share their understandings and experiences of the issues under investigation Within this relativist ontology, the theoretical, practical, and experiential knowledge of team members has a bearing upon the construction of the findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800412452854">Heron, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077800412452854">Reason, 1988</xref>). Thus individual team members’ response to the participatory synthesis process is unlikely to be accounted for purely as ‘meaning-making activity of the individual mind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800412452854">Crotty, 1998</xref>, p.58). Thus although constructivism may well serve to embrace many of the principles respected within a participatory process as an approach, it provides less opportunity to account for the influence of social context and the political sphere.</p>
<p>Yet, we also suggest that participatory action synthesis may also move beyond social constructionism into a different space. This is due to the opportunity offered within the synthesis process, not only to examine multiple data sets examining participants’ experiences in relation to others, and political process around a shared theme, but also the process of critical self-reflection and action required among team members in the joint consideration of the data. Thus a more emancipatory stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800412452854">Fals-Borda, 1991</xref>) may also be feasible as team members strive to move beyond interpretation to knowledge construction. This may be achieved through development of higher order constructs, while maintaining data integrity, which, although always contestable, reveal new meaning in the context of mutual participation. For example, in terms of social theory, the synthesis process requires team members to communicate issues such as: what is comprehensible to them; what is acceptable in the light of knowledge, and what joint commitment to understanding may offer, which in turn prompts an emancipatory interest in knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800412452854">Alvesson &amp; Skoldberg, 2000</xref>, p.110). Thus instead of an overarching tendency to cleave toward particularity, an emancipatory approach would enable and allow for the valuing of differences while synthesis occurs. Such an approach would be the kind of research which is reflected in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077800412452854">Malesevic (2006)</xref>, who has argued:
<disp-quote>
<p>If the social actors in their everyday life operate with the terms such as “identity,”, “ethnic identity” or “national identity” as something self-evident and unproblematic, this does not mean that a researcher should treat these categories in the same manner. (p. 20).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participatory action synthesis therefore provides opportunity for those involved in the research synthesis process to consider questions of mutual understandings regarding practices and the influence of the wider-practice context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077800412452854">McTaggart, 1997</xref>). Such ideas link with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800412452854">Habermas’s (1996)</xref> work around “communicative action,” in which he identifies the importance of people finding a communicative space in which they might find solidarity as their understandings and experiences of a situation are jointly considered. Furthermore, in this space the research team might be able to reach decisions regarding knowledge construction with “legitimacy.” By this approach, and adopting perspectives from Habermas’ we suggest research participants, in the context of mutual participation, are able to consider such issues within the data such as: what is comprehensible; what is acceptable in the light of knowledge construction; what joint commitment to understanding may offer and; what can be judged prudent and appropriate to do considering the multiple perspectives which can be brought to bear on the analysis process.</p>
<p>In essence, participatory action synthesis is a collaborative approach to data analysis, synthesis, interpretation, and knowledge construction, which enables data generation and its analysis to be used for <italic>communal analysis</italic>. More than purely combining qualitative data sets (from across a range of studies), participatory action synthesis provides a means of <italic>integrating</italic> forms of knowledge and a means of making <italic>(meta)</italic>interpretations between existing data sets, focused around a unifying theme. As such the methodology provides a way to advance professional knowledge through data examination from multiple perspectives. This is undertaken through a team process of analysis, synthesis, and interpretation, whereby themes and subthemes are reexamined and renegotiated, which in turn leads to a considered translation of concepts into a new whole.</p>
<p>What makes participatory action synthesis different from other approaches to qualitative synthesis includes the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1077800412452854" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A focus on synthesis of primary data from several discrete studies which involves;

<list-item><p>Researchers who collect the initial primary data pass it to different team members who can take a broader stance and wider view.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Furthermore, participatory action synthesis complements the aims of qualitative research synthesis in its pursuit to elevate the profile of qualitative research evidence being amassed, due to its ability to provide depth <italic>and</italic> consensus of information about a particular phenomenon.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077800412452854">
<title>The Practice of Participatory Action Synthesis</title>
<p>The task of moving from analysis to the interpretation of qualitative data can seem to be the most complex of all the phases of a qualitative synthesis project. As Denzin has suggested:
<disp-quote>
<p>Thick interpretation attempts to unravel and record these multiple meaning structures that flow away from interactional experience. It assumes that multiple meanings will always be present in any situation. No experience has the same meaning for two individuals. This is so because meaning is emotional and biographical. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412452854">Denzin, 1989</xref>, p. 102).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We contend that the participatory action synthesis process, although not set on achieving consensus, does enable opportunity for negotiation of perspectives around a shared theme, rather than producing such evidence from a single viewpoint/source.</p>
<p>The synthesis process is methodical, scholarly, and intellectually rigorous, although still artful and reflexive. The process of participatory action synthesis presented here considers a four-stage process:</p>
<list id="list3-1077800412452854" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Devising the overall research plan</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consideration of participant roles</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The synthesis process: cycles of action and reflection</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Writing up and dissemination</p></list-item></list>
<sec id="section10-1077800412452854">
<title>Devising the Overall Research Plan</title>
<p>Designing a participatory action synthesis will require the research team to address a number of initial questions including:</p>
<sec id="section11-1077800412452854">
<title>What data are available, who collected them and why, are they worthy of synthesis?</title>
<p>First, the research question and its potential contribution to knowledge needs identifying. Wherever possible those involved in the data collection should be part of the synthesis team, as the data is already a product of the primary researcher’s interpretations. Issues here relate to the currency of the data, and deciding what data are to be included in the synthesis (for example, transcripts, participant observations, audio/digital recordings).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077800412452854">
<title>Has the research data been situated in terms of a guiding theoretical paradigm?</title>
<p>Taking into account the range of methodologies used within qualitative inquiry, for example, ethnography, phenomenology, action research, discourse analysis, and grounded theory, it is important that the data sets to be compared can be located within an identified research tradition, (for example, narrative inquiry and ethnography data whose methodologies sit within an interpretivist paradigm). In addition, appraising whether there is congruity between the research question and data collection techniques is equally important. Ultimately the quality of the data affects the composition of the synthesis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1077800412452854">
<title>How will individual team members’ methodological and reflexive stance be acknowledged?</title>
<p>The researcher is an integral part of the data analysis process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800412452854">Finlay &amp; Gough, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077800412452854">Smith &amp; Deemer, 2000</xref>). Therefore, when considering team synthesis, the influence of each researcher will be part of any understandings of what counts as knowledge, as individuals will privilege some sources and discard others. As such it is vital that individual researcher “positionality” among team members is made explicit and a system of evaluation to maintain integrity, authenticity, and trustworthiness will be required, not least through researcher reflexivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800412452854">Gergen, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1077800412452854">
<title>How will individual and team iterative processes be documented and managed?</title>
<p>The team needs to think carefully about the need to identify a principal investigator, and in writing up the synthesis, which individual will be named as first author. Negotiation of who is doing what, where, and when, including the timing of the iterative cycles necessary to conduct the synthesis, require clear time-tabling upfront with constant review. Issues relating to participant roles and team relationships also require careful consideration, as we now move on to discuss.</p>

<title>Who Are Considered to Be Participants?</title>
<p>As mentioned coresearchers may include those responsible for collecting and generating the data, as well as research supervisors and other colleagues deemed to have a vested interest in the research.</p>
<p>The nature of participation proposed in this article is intended to be used to refer to good practices applied through the participatory processes. It is argued here that participatory action synthesis is not unstructured; it involves rigorous iteration between action in the world and reflection: the challenge is that people will come with different hopes and ideas. It is important to note the advice of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077800412452854">Park (2001)</xref> in that participatory research begins with what individuals bring to the enterprise; their familiarity with their working environment, their knowledge of each other, and their commitment to the team effort. Participatory action synthesis in particular requires cognitive and emotional ability to confront the synthesis with a scholarly attitude. In addition, openness, discovery, reflection, and awareness of the influence of one another’s individual world-view are necessary, to discern and reframe knowledge about a particular theme/phenomena.</p>
<p>A participatory action synthesis process should strive to be collaborative in nature to develop meaningful dialogue around the synthesis process, with transparency regarding research team members’ contributions and vested interest in the collaboration. Working to create such an effective research environment, encouraging “participatory decision-making” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800412452854">Heron &amp; Reason, 2001</xref>) whereby openness is expressed and trust can be expected, is not to be underestimated, and needs time and commitment (p. 186). Individuals within the synthesis team need to have a level of confidence in their own researcher stance to express their opinion as the synthesis progresses, and not feel obliged to respond to the dominant discourse (taking into account any managerial and/or supervisory relations among team members).</p>
<p>Difference of opinion is likely; opposing cliques or subgroupings may emerge. In short, participatory action synthesis is not a comfortable or tidy process and it will require persistence and effort from all to see it through. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077800412452854">Figure 1</xref> highlights, the <italic>participatory action</italic> synthesis relies upon a dynamic set of interrelationships between research team members.</p>

<p>The participatory process highlights the complexities and possibilities of raising new insights into first, second and third order themes. This is demonstrated by presenting how steps both build upon one another as well as overlap, and how cross fertilization points are likely to emerge as team members share reflexive accounts, enabling an expanding awareness of what the data set is saying to each researcher, including how that becomes reconstructed when considered in relation to the whole. What remains important to the process is that all team members have access to the data sets and engage in both individual and team iterative practices of analysis, synthesis, and interpretation while maintaining data integrity throughout. This includes integration of individual reflexive accounts and contextualization with the wider literature.</p>

<sec id="section17-1077800412452854">
<title>The Synthesis Process: Cycles of Reflection and Action</title>
<p>The synthesis process itself takes place within cycles of focused action and reflection. Although a structure is important to guide the scholarly process, there also needs to be room for flexibility and creativity. Steps should include focus on the following;</p>
<list id="list4-1077800412452854" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Primary data (sets) need to be read by the research team within an agreed time frame, with accompanying contextual information regarding the circumstances around why, how and when the data (sets) were gathered.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A summary of the data will be recorded by each researcher to enable data sets to be compared, including accompanying reflexive field notes identifying researcher positionality/stance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The findings of each set of data will be identified in relation to their ability to address the initial research question.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Analysis will then move beyond comparing to examining the relationships between data sets, including listing and organizing themes to develop first order themes. This will require the direct comparing and contrasting of narratives within the data to reveal what unifies or separates views or perspectives (adopting participatory principles to both reciprocal translational analysis and refutational analysis strategies). Analysis then requires the development of first order themes, identified from across the studies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>First order themes to be located across the studies by the research team.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Negotiation of the next phase of synthesis with the negotiated set of team first order themes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Team members return to the data for individual development of second order constructs, for example, the first order themes may be combined and/or subsumed, involving deeper insights and consideration of the subtext of narratives. This mapping out of such insights across the data sets aims to reveal second order themes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Joint identification of second order themes across the data sets.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The synthesis process moves beyond comparison to examining the relationships between themes and team members’ perspectives, toward integration of themes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interpreting the negotiated integration of themes though iterative cycles aims to develop third order interpretations. At this stage of the process the research team identify what can be said about the data sets as a whole.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although participatory action synthesis should avoid making more of the data than is realistic, the process should nonetheless take <italic>worthy</italic> risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077800412452854">Stake, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800412452854">Wolcott, 1994</xref>), to engage in meta-interpretation and the construction of (new) knowledge. What we mean by this is that although intellectual leaps are required, the reader should be able to locate and follow their emergence from the data clearly.</p>
<p>It is important throughout not to miss opportunities to use the data optimally, and within the process of analysis, synthesis and interpretation the research team needs to demonstrate;</p>
<list id="list5-1077800412452854" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A balance between description/presentation and explanation/interpretation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A process which is transparent and plausible.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Furthermore, data analysis requires mutual engagement with both the theoretical literature and the researchers’ reflections. Indeed participatory action synthesis is not a process which occurs as an isolated event, but requires consideration of the broader perspectives in terms of considering the original research question and its aims, including recognition of the local contextual and political issues involved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1077800412452854">
<title>Issues of Rigor</title>
<p>Ensuring rigor in participatory action syntheses involves using peers throughout the process. In particular, experts and colleagues should examine codes and coding and review findings. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412452854">Major and Savin-Baden (2010)</xref> suggest:
<disp-quote>
<p>Attention should also be given to what was not said, and to the prominence given to those aspects that were shared (p. 86).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list6-1077800412452854" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What expressed realities seem to be accepted without any scrutiny?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Which experiences/opinions initially seem improbable; what conditions might show these to be real?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What contradictions are revealed? Under what conditions might these be reconciled?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A model of evaluation can also be adopted, such as that presented below, which builds on evaluative criteria as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800412452854">Guba and Lincoln (1989)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1077800412452854">
<title>Writing Up and Dissemination</title>
<p>It follows that participatory inquiry should lead to participatory writing, and efforts to disseminate the research findings need to maintain <italic>a participatory focus</italic>. Although providing a supportive function, especially for new researchers, joint writing can nonetheless be a demanding process. However, agreeing on what will be presented and how such writing is shared among those involved should be aided by having undertaken the synthesis process together.</p>
<p>In terms of its findings, participatory action synthesis offers opportunities to make recommendations which can be taken forward in terms of providing evidence to support development of policy and practice and the commissioning of services. This can be achieved through a transparent process, a clearly synthesized report, and the development of solid recommendations. However, as noted earlier, participatory action synthesis is a complex and iterative approach. Below we provide an example of a recently undertaken study that adopted this approach.</p>

<title>An Example of Participatory Action Synthesis</title>
<p>Three distinct but interrelated funded studies, each using different methodologies which remain soundly qualitative, have been subjected to a participatory action synthesis process, in which we were both involved. The overarching study explored the sociopolitical impact of virtual world learning on higher education, and the three studies were part of this. The range of methodologies included case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077800412452854">Simons, 2009</xref>), narrative inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800412452854">Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000</xref>), and modified grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412452854">Charmaz, 2006</xref>). Data were gathered by three PhD students, through individual and group interviews with students, tutors and known experts over an 18 month period, from diverse research sites across a variety of disciplines subject areas, including the arts and humanities, computing, professional education, and employability. This enabled the research themes to be explored not only across different virtual worlds but also disciplinary boundaries.</p>
<p>The participatory action synthesis process involved simultaneous phases of data collection and inductive approaches to analysis. This work was carried out initially at the individual level, by the three PhD students as they acquired the data, and then at the group level, with involvement of ourselves (and another colleague) as supervisory team members, to examine and share the data sets and to compare and then integrate the findings interpretively. Engaging in team processes of analysis, synthesis, and interpretation enabled emerging themes and subthemes to be examined and agreed upon including the translation of concepts into a new whole. This process involved locating knowledge gaps by making connections between findings and themes, and moving beyond breaking down, reassembling and describing the findings to offering new forms of representation, contextualized by the literature, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800412452854">Major and Savin-Baden (2011)</xref>. A team paper (presently under review) was written as a consequence, and presented at a European conference, which involved contribution from all the research synthesis team members.</p>
<p>The experience of conducting the synthesis process served to unearth a considerable range of issues and perspectives (around the use of virtual worlds for teaching and learning), which required teasing out. This participatory action synthesis process therefore not only required the presentation, analysis, synthesis and interpretation of the data as a team effort, but also prompted critical self-reflection, challenging individual team members to review their ideological influences, which give rise to beliefs and understandings. Although the synthesis process proved fruitful at many levels of learning, our experience was not devoid of tension and disagreement. Although testing work, there was mutual respect, and to aid facilitation of the synthesis process a team member was nominated early on who would take responsibility for coordinating meetings and keeping notes, including version control on the redrafting of our writing.</p>
<p>Having considered the principles and practices of participatory action synthesis, including how this process was exemplified in practice, in this final section of the article we move on to list the key challenges and opportunities of the methodology, which may be of value to those considering its use.</p>

<sec id="section22-1077800412452854">
<title>Challenges</title>
<list id="list7-1077800412452854" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The recognition that different perspectives are likely to be held among team members
<disp-quote>
<p>participatory action synthesis requires negotiating a consensus, or presenting disparate interpretations.</p>
</disp-quote></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The shared experience of having been in the field
<disp-quote>
<p>What remains important within the process is maintaining data integrity, including acknowledgement that all team members may not have gathered data for themselves and are relying on the work of others. However, we also view the bringing together of different team members alongside those who collected the primary data to be a key strength of the synthesis process, enabling a thorough examination of process and perspectives, including the influence of broader stance and wider view.</p>
</disp-quote></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The challenge of managing different but related research approaches
<disp-quote>
<p>It is important that within the team there is expertise regarding qualitative research traditions to ensure appropriate inclusion of research methodologies. Ultimately the combination of methodologies and methods affects the composition of the synthesis.</p>
</disp-quote></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The complexity of managing team dynamics and power relations among colleagues
<disp-quote>
<p>This is not straightforward (for example, agreeing upon the principle investigator (PI) role, having managers, supervisors and students within the synthesis team). What is required is the acknowledgement of power imbalance, and the leveling of research relationships wherever possible. This requires a particular approach within the synthesis process which includes the following.</p>
</disp-quote></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The need to ensure all voices are heard
<disp-quote>
<p>It is important to pay attention to the “position” of those who are participating and what this means in terms of what they wish to present. It is possible that the participants’ stated position presents as the dominant discourse which serves to blot out more subtle differences of opinion that also exist.</p>
</disp-quote></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The requirement to share the workload appropriately
<disp-quote>
<p>Working to promote shared commitment from team members, this involves perseverance and investment of time and energy.</p>
</disp-quote></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The necessity of nurturing a communicative space
<disp-quote>
<p>This is likely to develop over time as the synthesis process progresses wherein team members feel adequately respected and valued for their views. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077800412452854">Reason (1994)</xref> states that raising emotion is an essential part of cooperative inquiry, as the very business of collaboration with others resists and distorts perspectives. As such, development of a sound dialectic is viewed as both a challenge and opportunity to the participatory synthesis process where commitment to understanding is jointly considered.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has presented participatory action synthesis as a new methodology in which a group of researchers can combine, synthesize and construct new insights from qualitative data on a particular theme. The principles and practice of this approach have been considered. Alongside the task of developing a communicative space, we suggest the benefits of having researchers join together to conduct participatory action synthesis are many, not least to ensure that the rich understandings revealed in individual data sets can be synthesized to support knowledge development and its application into practice. Furthermore, the methodology supports researcher development through providing a challenging, yet exciting opportunity to engage in dialogue with a committed group of researchers to develop reciprocated understandings. Finally, and of particular importance, is the way in which participatory action synthesis seeks to raise the profile of qualitative synthesis among the disciplines. We propose that this methodology is a worthy and valuable approach which other qualitative researchers should consider.</p>
