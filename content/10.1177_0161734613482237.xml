<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>This is my last issue of <italic>Ultrasonic Imaging</italic> as Editor-in-Chief. Starting with the July, 2013 issue, I am turning over the reins to my long-time Associate Editor and esteemed friend and colleague, Ernest (Ernie) Feleppa. Ernie is a distinguished researcher in ultrasound, heads a major group at Riverside Research, has received the prestigious Pioneer Award of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine and chairs the annual Ultrasonic Imaging and Tissue Characterization Symposia. Having founded the journal 35 years ago, I have had the pleasure of bringing to publication some of the most exciting research in ultrasonic imaging. As part of my editing duties, I also have had the satisfaction of mentoring young researchers and seeing them become leading investigators in the field. The success of the journal is due, in large part, to the members of the editorial board, to the authors who have submitted some of their most important work to the journal, to the reviewers who have contributed their valuable time and expertise, and to you, our readers who have supported the journal for more than three decades. In my new position as Founding Editor and Editor Emeritus, I will continue to enjoy the excitement of <italic>Ultrasonic Imaging</italic> and to support Ernie’s efforts.</p>
<p>Beginning with the July issue of 2012, Sage Publications (SAGE) has taken over the responsibility of publishing the journal. Ernie will be working with SAGE to deliver research in a redesigned, enhanced and thoroughly modernized journal. <italic>Ultrasonic Imaging</italic> has new, user-friendly electronic features on the SAGE platform, offering abstracts and full-text articles, free inter-document linking among references in more than 1,000 journals, access to the complete archives of <italic>Ultrasonic Imaging</italic> published since Volume 1, Issue 1 (1979), citation-management features, advanced search capabilities, free journal email alerts and more.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support of <italic>Ultrasonic Imaging</italic> during my rewarding and fulfilling tenure as Editor-in-Chief, and please provide a warm welcome and helping hand to Ernie as he takes on the responsibility—and pleasures—of carrying <italic>Ultrasonic Imaging</italic> forward into the future.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
