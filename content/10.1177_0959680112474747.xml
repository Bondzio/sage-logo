<p>In 1990 Swedish employers ended peak-level bargaining, while in 2007 the Finnish employers’ confederation withdrew from the tripartite bargaining system. This article compares the two events, examining the underlying dynamics of class struggle and in particular the shift in structural power resulting from the transnational organization of production. We argue that the far lower degree of transnationalization in Finland explains why the attack on the established class compromise happened much later than in Sweden and has been less successful.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Much literature has debated whether the Nordic model of capitalism remains viable or faces inevitable erosion, with specific emphasis on the Swedish case. Here we examine the less familiar case of Finland, since a comparison with Sweden can help our understanding of the current development of Nordic political economies. We consider the decision by the Confederation of Finnish Industries (<italic>Elinkeinoelämän keskusliitto</italic>, EK) in 2007 to abandon the tripartite industrial relations model (<italic>tulopoliittinen kokonaisratkaisu</italic> or TUPO). Have employers rejected the class compromise underlying the Finnish model of capitalism?</p>
<p>A rich research literature examines how institutions, organizations, policies and practices underlie class compromises between capital and labour, mediated by the state. Path dependency is strong because all three parties have made long-term commitments and investments in future cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959680112474747">Crouch, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959680112474747">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959680112474747">Pizzorno, 1978</xref>). Strategic choices by employers and their organizations had a crucial impact on the making of national industrial relations systems, but were never just a defensive response to trade unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959680112474747">Köykkä, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959680112474747">Sisson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959680112474747">Swenson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959680112474747">Tolliday and Zeitlin, 1991</xref>). The varieties of capitalism literature does not however take into account the underlying capitalist social relations of production and the way they shape the balance of power between capital and labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959680112474747">Bruff, 2011</xref>: 481–486). Institutions have emerged as the result of class struggle in the past, and a change in the social relations of production may alter the balance of power and undermine existing institutional configurations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959680112474747">Bieler, 2006</xref>: 25–27).</p>
<p>Since the early 1970s, with the increasing organization of production processes across borders, transnational social forces of capital and labour have emerged as new collective actors. Countries differ in the extent to which production has been transnationalized and the interests of transnational capital have become internalized within the state. Political parties, trade unions, employers’ associations and state institutions are institutions within which and through which different transnational, internationally oriented and nationally oriented class fractions of capital and labour pursue their particular interests. This has important implications for comparative research. Rather than comparing policies in different countries or institutional change as institutionalist approaches do, our comparative focus is on the underlying dynamics of class struggle. Hence the focus in this article is on the role of capital and labour against the background of the social relations of production in the two countries and the relative structural power for capital.</p>
<p>The empirical argument rests predominantly on 23 semi-structured elite interviews in April and May 2010 with representatives of trade unions, employers’ associations, political parties and state institutions. These included EK and representatives of two nationally oriented sectors, <italic>Rakennusteollisuus</italic> (construction) and <italic>Kauppa</italic> (commerce), and <italic>Teknologiateollisuus</italic> (technology industries) covering the internationally oriented production sectors, as well as <italic>Kuntatyönantajat</italic> (local government employers) and <italic>Maa- ja metsätaloustuottajain Keskusliitto</italic> (farmers’ and forest owners). Interviews on the trade union side covered all three confederations, SAK (<italic>Suomen Ammattiliittojen Keskusjärjestö</italic>), organising manual workers, STTK (<italic>Toimihenkilökeskusjärjestö</italic>) for white-collar workers and AKAVA for professionals with university degrees. These were complemented by three interviews in domestically oriented unions and two in export-oriented unions. Other interviews were with representatives of <italic>Sosialidemokraattinen Puolue</italic> (social democrats), <italic>Kansallinen Kokoomus</italic> (conservatives) and <italic>Vasemmistoliitto</italic> (left alliance); and with three government officials and the Bank of Finland.</p>
<p>The next section briefly discusses the erosion of the Swedish model of capitalism and asks whether the action by EK in 2007 implied a similar development in Finland. Then we analyse developments in Finland against the background of the factors relevant in Sweden, including an assessment of the structural dynamics of the Finnish economy as well as the strategies of various social class forces. In conclusion, we sum up our findings and speculate on future developments in the Finnish model of capitalism.</p>

<sec id="section2-0959680112474747">
<title>The erosion of the Swedish model</title>
<p>Swedish capital is often identified as the crucial driver of changes to the Swedish model of capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959680112474747">Swenson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959680112474747">Wilks, 1996</xref>: 94). At the start of the 1990s the employers’ association SAF (now <italic>Svenskt Näringsliv</italic>) withdrew from peak-level wage bargaining and tripartite institutions, but the process began earlier. In the 1970s the blue-collar confederation LO pressed the governing <italic>Sveriges socialdemokratiska arbetareparti</italic> (SAP) to introduce legislation which broke the long tradition of minimal labour law and preference of agreements between labour market parties. The 1974 employment protection act (<italic>lag om anställninsskydd</italic>, LAS) created conflicts which became deeper with the 1976 codetermination law (<italic>lag om medbestämmande i arbetslivet</italic>). The wage-earner funds initiative was even more ideologically explosive. In response, SAF started transforming itself from a wage-bargaining institution into an ideologically motivated think tank, which offered the platform to spread the neoliberal message and start a broad campaign against the ‘perils of creeping socialism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959680112474747">Johansson and Magnusson, 1998</xref>: 173–210; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959680112474747">Nycander, 2002</xref>: 218–253, 302–373; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959680112474747">Stråth, 1998</xref>: 137).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, capital should not simply be understood as an interest group: the underlying power structures as reflected in capital’s location in the social relations of production also have to be taken into account. Sweden had long been characterized by large multinationals such as Volvo, Ericsson and Electrolux with considerable structural power, a resource which was heavily used from the mid-1980s onwards. When the SAP government initially rejected EU membership, Swedish multinationals shifted production units abroad: outward FDI increased almost tenfold between 1985 and 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959680112474747">Luif, 1996</xref>: 208). In 1965, Swedish multinationals employed 33.9 percent of their workforce abroad, producing 25.9 percent of turnover; by 1990, the proportions had risen to 60.6 and 51.4 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959680112474747">Braunerhjelm et al., 1996</xref>: 10). This increasing structural power of transnational Swedish capital not only allowed greater assertiveness towards trade unions but also enabled transnational capital, which now rejected cross-sector collective bargaining, to override domestic-oriented industry within SAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959680112474747">Ahlén, 1989</xref>: 335).</p>
<p>It would, however, be incorrect to attribute the erosion of the Swedish model to employers alone. Any restructuring is contested, and the SAP and the trade unions also contributed. In 1982, the SAP government adopted its so-called ‘Third Way’ (<italic>Den tredje vej</italic>), an alternative to both traditional Keynesianism and Thatcherite neoliberalism. The government devalued the krona by 16 percent to encourage export-led growth, but this devaluation was the start of a new monetary policy with a commitment to fixed exchange rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959680112474747">Moses, 1995</xref>: 313), and financial markets were deregulated and liberalized. The liquidity ratio requirements for banks were abolished in 1983 and the ceiling on lending removed in 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959680112474747">Jonung, 1986</xref>: 111). In 1986, foreign banks were allowed to open branches in Sweden; three years later the government abolished foreign exchange controls. This deprived the government of most of its monetary and economic policy autonomy. To some extent this reflected outside pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959680112474747">Jonung, 1986</xref>: 116; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959680112474747">Olsen, 1991</xref>: 128), but it was also a response to the adoption of a hard currency policy. Liberalization of financial markets increased the costs of pursuing flexible exchange rates, thereby giving more credibility to the new exchange rate policy. Although initially successful, the third way ended in a dramatic recession. Deregulation had not only allowed multinationals to shift investment and production abroad, it had also led to a financial and real estate investment bubble, which burst in the late 1980s. In response, the government announced that price stability now took priority over full employment, and then applied for EU membership. The latter was the logical consequence of accepting key neoliberal understandings of how the economy worked, and signified the decline in SAP confidence that it could handle the economy differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959680112474747">Bieler, 2005</xref>: 277–278).</p>
<p>Trade unions also contributed to the erosion of the Swedish model. From the early 1980s, the large public sector unions, both blue-collar (members of LO) and white-collar (members of TCO), became more assertive in representing their members’ particular interests: they ‘coordinated wage negotiations and seized the initiative. Their high wage demands forced LO to raise its own demands’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959680112474747">Kjellberg, 1998</xref>: 83). Increasing fragmentation of the labour movement encouraged particularistic demands, thereby undermining multi-sector bargaining based on solidarity and a compressed wage structure. In 1983, <italic>Metall</italic> (the dominant LO affiliate in the export-oriented sector) had accepted a separate deal with the engineering employers, receiving a pay increase above average. Peak-level collective bargaining was restored in the following years, but after one breach it was easier for the employers to abandon it completely in 1990. The internal divisions within the labour movement were deepened over EU and EMU membership: unions in the transnational production sectors supported EU membership, arguing that this was essential for their employers and thus the workers they organized, but those organizing in domestic sectors (<italic>Transport</italic> and <italic>Handels</italic>, for example) opposed membership as a restraint on the capacity to develop and maintain the Swedish public sector and welfare state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959680112474747">Bieler, 2000</xref>: 102–107). In the referendum over EMU membership a decade later, there were similar divisions. This time the transnational sector unions, and LO itself, had begun to accept core neoliberal principles including low inflation policy and the need for wage moderation to maintain economic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959680112474747">Bieler, 2006</xref>: 143–145). Transnational production sector unions in Sweden have focused on close cooperation with employers, increasingly sharing their neoliberal positions focused on competitiveness at the expense of solidarity with other trade unions at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Neoliberal restructuring did not eliminate the institutions of the traditional Swedish model. Decentralization of collective bargaining was gradual. ‘First, the three-tier system was replaced by a two-tier system by the removal of the top level’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959680112474747">Kjellberg, 1998</xref>: 85). Second, company agreements acquired increasing importance, with the introduction of new wage systems at the workplace. The Industrial Agreement of 1997 between employers and unions in manufacturing reinforced continuing sectoral bargaining, complemented by internal LO and SAF coordination across sectors. Nevertheless, solidaristic economy-wide bargaining had come to an end. Neoliberal restructuring has continued incrementally ever since, first under SAP-led government from 1994 until 2006. As a result of financial market deregulation, the stock market increased drastically in importance leading to ‘a long-term shift from a bank-oriented to a market-oriented economic system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959680112474747">Reiter, 2003</xref>: 119). With the right in power since 2006, restructuring has deepened, including an attack on the Ghent model of unemployment funds linked to the trade unions. By raising considerably the fees for unemployment insurance, trade union membership became more expensive and density fell sharply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959680112474747">Kjellberg, 2009</xref>). In sum, the traditional Swedish model has clearly been eroded.</p>

<title>The changing Finnish political economy</title>
<p>In this section, we examine the decision by the Finnish employers in 2007 to end the TUPO system and compare this with the Swedish case. We consider the same three key dynamics: the role and structural power of transnational capital, the division between national and transnational social class forces of labour and the changing policies of social democracy.</p>
<sec id="section4-0959680112474747">
<title>The post-war Finnish model of capitalism</title>
<p>The TUPO system of centralized tripartite incomes policy agreements was an essential part of the Finnish political economy before 2007. These agreements included economy-wide wage bargaining covering both private and public sectors, but also wider issues such as job security, hours of work, maternity and paternity leave, unemployment benefits and pensions. The start of corporatism in Finland is often dated to the first TUPO agreement in 1968; but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959680112474747">Bergholm (2009</xref>: 29, 41) makes clear that close cooperation between employers and trade unions started earlier, with an agreement on unemployment support and a two-year wage agreement in 1960 followed by a reform of the pension system in 1961. Both sides were willing to negotiate, partly because a left-wing majority in parliament pushed the employers to cooperate and partly because an internal split weakened the SAK.</p>
<p>Successful corporatism did not, however, imply that there were no tensions over incomes policy. Despite cooperative relations between central organizations and the state, collective bargaining at local and sectoral levels was highly conflictual. Especially in the metal and construction industries, employer organizations were unable to control local bargaining and strikes, which delivered substantial wage increases to workers. During the 1970s and 1980s, trade union demands backed by industrial action often resulted in wage drift. After the severe recession from 1991 to 1993, employers in turn became more aggressive, and against the background of high unemployment unions adopted a defensive stance in tripartite negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959680112474747">Bergholm, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959680112474747">Lilja, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680112474747">Mansner, 2005</xref>). The consequence was a decline in strike action. Tripartite institutions survived the recession of the early 1990s, however, and from the second half of the decade played a particularly important role in the revival of the Finnish economy around high-technology products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959680112474747">Ornston, 2006</xref>: 796).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959680112474747">
<title>Globalization and restructuring in Finland: The employers’ position</title>
<p>When EK withdrew from the TUPO system in 2007 it came as a surprise to researchers and central actors in tripartite bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959680112474747">Sippola, 2012</xref>). Traditionally TUPO ensured that the requirements of the Finnish export sector determined wage bargaining. The general increase in wages was set at a level which did not undermine the competitiveness of Finnish exports on global markets. As this was applied across the whole economy, domestic producers and the public sector were also kept in line. Additionally, public sector productivity growth was always calculated as zero, which resulted in low wage increases across the economy and allowed the export sector to reap super-profits.</p>
<p>Today there are still many tripartite working groups (including employers’ representatives) dealing with issues such as tax level and social benefits at the central level, but wage bargaining has been devolved to sectoral level; this has undermined the traditionally leading position of the export sectors in setting wage increases. In 2007, the export sectors negotiated first a rate that both the employers (<italic>Teknologiateollisuus</italic>) and <italic>Metalli</italic> (the blue-collar union) considered appropriate to guarantee competitiveness. Subsequent negotiations in the public and domestic service sectors, however, led to higher increases. In 2009, when collective bargaining took place against the background of the global financial crisis, the wage increase of 0.5 percent generally agreed in the export sectors was to a large extent accepted in the public and service sectors, but was exceeded for some cleaning occupations, with increases of up to 2.5 percent. A further result of the break-up of TUPO has been an increase in strikes, since there are now some 300 collective bargaining rounds across the economy.</p>
<p>It is clear first that the sectoral employers’ federations in EK were not unanimous in withdrawing from TUPO. Some (for example, <italic>Rakennusteollisuus</italic> in construction) still argue that the centralized bargaining model would be preferable, without, however, contesting the decision of 2007 to outsiders. The official EK position is that controlling public sector pay is indeed difficult within the new system, but that the economic situation differs so much from sector to sector that decentralization had been absolutely essential. A return to TUPO was thus not on the agenda. At the same time, EK insists that the decision in 2007 was taken by the member federations and not EK itself. And here it was especially <italic>Teknologiateollisuus</italic>, generally acknowledged as the most important affiliate, which was behind the withdrawal. While the forestry industry dominated Finnish exports during the 1960s and 1970s, it is now mechanical engineering, shipyards, technology industries, ICT and related service providers, all organized within the <italic>Teknologiateollisuus</italic>, which are the cornerstone of the economy: they produce 60 percent of Finnish exports, accounting for about a third of the overall GDP. The majority of companies organized by <italic>Teknologiateollisuus</italic> are either Finnish international companies or foreign-owned. In short, this federation organizes internationally oriented and transnational social class forces of capital, which are most closely integrated into the global economy: the same forces which had been behind the SAF withdrawal from corporatism and multi-sector collective bargaining in Sweden. When the federation announced in spring 2007 that it was no longer willing to participate in TUPO negotiations, it was clear that the system could no longer be maintained. For <italic>Teknologiateollisuus</italic>, however, the goal was decentralization to not sectoral, but to company level. There had always been some bargaining at company level, but the federation wanted to establish the company as the exclusive bargaining level: the different competitive conditions between companies were too great for sectoral agreements. Companies also needed more flexibility in determining the salary of individuals, in order to attract and retain highly qualified workers. EK itself stated that it viewed sectoral, company and even individual bargaining as the negotiation model for the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959680112474747">Bergholm, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959680112474747">Jokivuori, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, the employers did not achieve such extreme decentralization. How can we understand this lack of success by the Finnish employers?</p>
<p>As indicated above, it is not enough to understand employers’ associations as an interest group: they must also be analysed in relation to their position in the social relations of production and the related structural power levels. In Sweden, it had been the increased structural power of capital resulting from transnational production which underpinned the employers’ successful move against the traditional model. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959680112474747">Table 1</xref> we compare the transnationalization of Finnish and Swedish production with Austria, the Netherlands and Norway, also small European economies. FDI does not demonstrate the exact degree of transnationalization but is still a useful way of understanding the way production in a particular country is organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959680112474747">Bieler, 2006</xref>: 59–60). In order to take into account the different size of these countries’ economies and the degree of the transnationalization of their production structures, a comparison of the ratio of inward and outward FDI stock to GDP is a good basis. GDP reflects the size of economies, while FDI stock is the result of FDI levels over time.</p>

<p>The data make clear that while the production structures of the Netherlands and Sweden have always been more transnationalized, Finland initially was at a rather low level, like Austria and Norway. This changed from the mid-1990s onwards. Since then, the transnationalization of the Finnish production structure has increased steadily, taking up a middle position between Austria and Norway on the one hand and the Netherlands and Sweden on the other, especially as far as outward FDI stock as a percentage of GDP is concerned. In other words, there has been an increase in the transnationalization of Finnish production, but this is still rather moderate in comparison with the Netherlands and Sweden.</p>
<p>In more concrete terms, the Finnish metalworking sector has an increasingly transnational production structure, as one interviewee pointed out. All the larger companies in this sector employ many of their workers abroad. For example, only 5 percent of Kone employees are located in Finland. During the last two decades, smaller companies too have become transnational. At the same time, the metalworking sector also increased employment levels in Finland; hence <italic>Metalli</italic> was not too concerned about this development. Moreover, Finnish employers have not often used the threat of shifting production abroad during wage negotiations, which also indicates that the structural power of capital is not (yet) overwhelming. To date, employers still argue that investment abroad, necessary to be closer to the market, also makes it easier for companies to retain production in Finland itself. Finland is most closely integrated into the global economy through its dependence on exports, which account for 40 percent of GNP. Unsurprisingly, the Finnish economy has been most affected during the global crisis since 2008 through the loss of 35 percent of its exports. In sum, the increasing transnationalization of Finnish production in the metalworking and technology sectors well illustrates why <italic>Teknologiateollisuus</italic> is the most important member federation in EK. At the same time, the structural power of transnational and internationally oriented Finnish capital has not been enough to pressure trade unions into accepting even further decentralization of collective bargaining. The main focus is still on exports, and this requires trade union cooperation in the organization of the national political economy.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the structural power of Finnish employers has not (yet) increased dramatically, trade unions remain comparatively powerful. With a trade union density of about 70 percent, Finland is one of the most unionized countries in the world and collective bargaining coverage is 70 percent according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959680112474747">Ahtiainen (2011)</xref> and 90 percent according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959680112474747">Jokivuori (2009)</xref>. Pension reform is a clear example of trade union strength. According to one interviewee, the 2007–2011 centre-right government suffered a humiliating defeat when it first announced that it would unilaterally raise the retirement age but then backed down in the face of trade union opposition and established a tripartite working party on pension reform. Trade unions had to accept the decentralization of collective bargaining to the sectoral level – as we indicate, some even welcomed it – but did not accept any further decentralization. In short, the still comparatively limited structural power of capital and the continuing strength of labour explain to some extent why the employers, and especially transnational and internationally oriented forces of capital, have not yet been able to decentralize collective bargaining to the company and potentially even individual level or to abolish tripartite working groups. It has to be remembered that the employers’ confederation STK, the predecessor of EK, had already demanded decentralization of collective bargaining in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959680112474747">Bergholm, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959680112474747">Kahri, 2001</xref>: 317–325; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680112474747">Mansner, 2005</xref>: 448–452). This had been supported by centre-right Prime Minister Esko Aho, who proposed replacing the tripartite system with a model in which the Bank of Finland would be responsible for monetary policy, the government for fiscal policy and the employers’ associations and trade unions for wages and employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680112474747">Mansner, 2005</xref>: 483–484). In the end, however, changes were only temporary. Aho’s coalition government lost the 1995 elections and STK withdrew its proposal when employers realized that they needed support from the trade unions to secure a majority in favour of accession to the EU in 1995 and to EMU in 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959680112474747">Bergholm, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959680112474747">Kahri, 2001</xref>: 392–400).</p>
<p>EK’s withdrawal from TUPO coincided with a change in government towards a centre-right coalition in 2007. Both main coalition parties were relatively close to the employers and therefore, tend to represent the interests of Finnish capital. Nevertheless, the new government did agree on establishing new tripartite bodies and was not prepared to support a full attack on the Finnish model. This requires a closer focus on developments at the political party and societal level.</p>

<title>Political parties and the focus on consensus</title>
<p>Throughout Finnish post-war history, the Social Democratic Party (<italic>Sosialidemokraattinen Puolue</italic>, SDP) has been among the leading parliamentary parties, and at times the largest. But its vote has never exceeded 30 percent: ‘unlike its sister parties in Scandinavia, the SDP has never occupied a dominant position in the party system, and hence it is accustomed to sharing power with both centre-right and other left-wing parties’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959680112474747">Raunio, 2010</xref>: 190). Electoral defeat in 1991 and the severe economic recession of the early 1990s led to a shift in SDP economic policies, very similar to the Swedish Social Democrats. ‘With unemployment reaching at worst nearly 20 percent of the workforce, and with SDP voters particularly afflicted by the bad times, the SDP and the trade unions closely attached to it began to emphasize the virtues of budgetary discipline and monetary stability alongside traditional social democratic goals such as universal social policies and job creation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959680112474747">Raunio, 2010</xref>: 195). The SDP strongly supported Finnish EU and EMU membership, arguing that this would bring economic growth and monetary stability which would ensure that the expansive welfare system could be paid for in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959680112474747">Raunio, 2010</xref>: 201). Clearly, while traditional social-democratic objectives of universal welfare provisions were not abandoned, the SDP had started to accept neoliberal principles in its strategy to achieve these objectives. Especially the ‘rainbow’ coalition governments from 1995 onwards, formed by the SDP together with the Left Alliance, the Greens, the Swedish People’s Party and also the conservative National Coalition Party, are credited with some of the most severe restructuring in the Finnish political economy. Since electoral defeat in 2007, the SDP has again adopted a more leftist discourse, portraying itself as the defender of the Finnish welfare state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959680112474747">Raunio, 2010</xref>: 207). Nevertheless, it is currently unsure how far to move to the left. At the time of the interviews in April 2010, there was an understanding that a coalition government with the centre-right National Coalition Party amongst others might well be the outcome of the 2011 elections, and the SDP did not want to endanger this possibility through too radical a policy course.</p>
<p>It is this more general culture of consensus which makes the situation in Finland rather different from that in Sweden, where the Social Democrats, either alone or together with the Left Party and the Green Party, were always confronted by a bloc of centre-right parties. Like the SDP, the Left Alliance is more representative of the social class interests of labour, while the Centre Party and the National Coalition Party are closer to the interests of capital. In general, however, every party is prepared to form a coalition government with anybody else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959680112474747">Arter, 2007</xref>: 1151). This culture of consensus ensures two things. First, radical change is much less likely. The centre-right parties are also aware of the possibility of a coalition government with the SDP after the next elections. Although they won the elections in 2007 and the SDP was in opposition until 2011, the government – to the disappointment of at least some employers – did not attack the Finnish model outright after the employers’ withdrawal from the TUPO system. Government deficit spending during the most recent economic recession has been extensive, and the government also supported the creation of new tripartite commissions, dealing, for example, with a reform of the pension system.</p> <p>The National Coalition Party is aware that many of its members and supporters are also members of trade unions, even if mainly the more moderate AKAVA unions. Unsurprisingly, before the 2007 elections the National Coalition Party ‘pursued a catchall approach, emphasizing the need for social solidarity in the workplace in order better to meet the challenges posed by globalization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959680112474747">Arter, 2007</xref>: 1151). In sum, in April 2010 the party considered a coalition with the SDP feasible, should the electoral results point this way. At the same time, this culture of consensus facilitates incremental restructuring, as it makes principled rejection impossible. Every decision is a compromise slowly hollowing out the traditional model. With a lack of conflict over ideas and clear alternatives, policies are regularly put forward as a pragmatic necessity. Nevertheless, the policies introduced as pragmatic are often a reflection of the political right’s agenda.</p>
<p>In particular, the creeping privatization of public services is a case in point. Full-scale privatization is currently not on the agenda, and the government approach is rather tentative. Within the Prime Minister’s office, more private sector provision is deemed to be the way forward, but this involves dangers which need to be watched carefully. The government has introduced a voucher system which allows citizens to obtain certain ‘public’ services from private companies, arguing that this will lead to efficiency savings as a result of competition. The dividing line between public and private sector would not therefore be so important. Privatization of public service provision is often related to the need to increase productivity in the public sector and to change the way work is organized. At the same time, privatization is not contemplated for the health sector, and other ways of reorganizing work within the public sector are also discussed. In short, the centre-right government from 2007 to 2011 pursued privatization only to a limited extent despite pressure by employers’ associations. The <italic>Teknologiateollisuus</italic> is the most outspoken supporter of private sector involvement in public service provision. Competition in public services, it argued, would lead to the emergence of new producers resulting in better quality services and more employment. Similarly to the employers’ attack on collective bargaining, the centre-right government of 2007 to 2011 was not fully supportive of this line. The National Coalition Party argues that it is not ideologically committed to private service provision: it does not matter much whether services are provided by the public, private or third sectors as long as this is done as efficiently as possible. In April 2010, this reflected the position on a potential future coalition with the SDP, which had again developed an emphasis on social services and equality and thus moved away from the ‘third way’ it had pursued when in government from the mid-1990s to early 2000s. Nevertheless, the position of the National Coalition Party also provides the ground for incremental neoliberal restructuring, which might ultimately be as drastic as a direct, large-scale one-off privatization of the public sector. Its presentation of privatization as a pragmatic issue, not an ideological position, furthers incremental change.</p>
<p>In the April 2011 elections, the National Coalition Party emerged as the largest party with 20.4 percent of the votes, followed by the SDP with 19.1 percent, while the Centre Party with only 15.8 percent was the clear loser. The real surprise, however, were the 19 percent for the True Finns, a populist, anti-EU, right-wing party, which came third. The new government, formed after more than two months of negotiations, includes the National Coalition Party, the SDP, the Left Alliance, the Green League, the Swedish People’s Party and the Christian Democrats. In short, this broad based coalition reflects yet again the general consensual nature of Finnish party politics. It further confirms those in the SDP, who opposed a clearer shift to the left, and those in the National Coalition Party, who rejected a closer alliance with the interests of the right. Hence, while a frontal neoliberal assault is unlikely in this constellation, incremental neoliberal restructuring pressures are very real. Will trade unions, unlike in Sweden, be able to maintain a united position in the face of these pressures?</p>

<title>Finnish trade unions: Between continuity of strength and gradual decline</title>
<p>Finnish trade unions are organized along similar lines to their Swedish counterparts. SAK (<italic>Suomen Ammattiliittojen Keskusjärjestö</italic>) is the confederation of blue-collar workers’ unions; STTK (<italic>Toimihenkilökeskusjärjestö</italic>) comprises sectoral unions of white-collar workers; while AKAVA is the confederation of unions which organize employees with an academic education and who often hold managerial positions in private companies or the public sector. SAK affiliates, and many STTK unions, are more closely related to the SDP; but AKAVA unions are closer to the National Coalition Party and the Centre Party. Union density has gradually declined from its peak of nearly 80 percent in the mid-1990s to below 70 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959680112474747">Ahtiainen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959680112474747">Bergholm, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The end of the TUPO system has come at a cost for trade unions, despite their continuing strength within the Finnish political economy. There are still tripartite bodies where key social policies such as the pension system are discussed. Nevertheless, in the past the link to wage bargaining within the TUPO system meant that it was possible for unions to gain concessions in the area of social policy from the employers and the state in exchange for wage restraint. This is no longer possible and leaves the unions in a much weaker position in these tripartite working groups. Furthermore, as we have shown there has clearly been an increase in the structural power of capital. Should this trend continue, Finnish employers may eventually decide they need no longer pay attention to the wishes of the unions. The situation is further complicated by large production sites such as the nuclear power plant Olkiluoto 3, where unions have found it difficult to engage with the employers of a pan-European labour force and enforce the rules of the Finnish industrial relations system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959680112474747">Lillie and Sippola, 2011</xref>). Moreover, before the April 2010 elections there was concern that if the centre-right coalition was returned to power it might attack trade union rights. There were discussions of restrictions on the right to strike; a second centre-right government, in the view of several trade unions, could have led to concrete legislative proposals. The general question then is whether trade unions have been able to maintain unity in the face of adversity? As noted above, disunity between national and transnational production sector unions had been one of the key dynamics behind the erosion of the Swedish model.</p>
<p>Not all trade unions are concerned about the end of the TUPO system. While <italic>Metalli</italic> is opposed, since the new system of sectoral collective bargaining no longer ensures that the concerns of the export-oriented sectors determine bargaining outcomes across the whole economy, several unions even welcomed the break-up of the TUPO system. For example PAM (<italic>Palvelualojen ammattiliitto</italic>), which organizes blue-collar workers in the private, predominantly domestic services, including security companies, the commerce and retail sector, hotels and restaurants, argued that TUPO had been too inflexible and had not allowed the union to close the pay gap between the mainly female workers in their sector and the predominantly male workers in the export sector. In order to close the gender gap, the service sector would require above average wage increases. Likewise, <italic>Tehy</italic>, the STTK affiliate which organizes workers in the care sector, welcomed the end of multi-sector collective bargaining since without a general multi-sector agreement it would be easier to address the gender pay gap successfully. In other words, trade unions organizing predominantly female workers in the domestic service sectors considered sectoral bargaining an opportunity for them to improve the results for their specific members. AKAVA also objects to centralized collective bargaining, but for different reasons. Together with its affiliates it argues that ‘solidarity’ wage increases are no longer relevant: their members, often in better paid positions, pay too much tax already, while the solidaristic wage policy had implied that workers in the public sector received a ‘rent’ above their proper entitlement. Clearly, solidarity across different groups of workers, across the dividing line between blue- and white-collar workers, is not automatically assured. Finally, while some trade unions such as PAM totally oppose any further decentralization of bargaining below the sectoral level, others such as <italic>Metalli</italic> have already accepted a two-part agreement in which the central agreement is complemented by local negotiations at the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959680112474747">Sippola, 2012</xref>). The traditional ‘common sense’ - the norms and ideas sustaining the accumulation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959680112474747">Bruff, 2008</xref>: 47–71) around the priority of wage increases in line with export competitiveness and a solidaristic wage policy within multi-sector collective bargaining - which cemented the compromise between capital and labour, but also ensured unity inside the labour movement across different industrial sectors, has been eroded.</p>
<p>Divisions within the labour movement are also visible in relation to the issue of privatization. The main SAK affiliate in the public sector, JHL (<italic>Julkisten ja hyvinvointialojen liitto</italic>), accepts the need for efficiency and the potential helpful role of new technology and new ways of organizing work, but it points to the dangers of outsourcing, public–private partnerships, the development of a market for services and a widening of the voucher system. This would merely entail that the costs and responsibility for services were outsourced from municipalities to the individual citizen. Savings from outsourcing would mainly be obtained by cutting workers’ wages, since public employees would be shifted to bargaining areas with lower collective agreements. This position is supported by <italic>Metalli</italic>, which regards demands for outsourcing and privatization as ideologically motivated. The largest private sector STTK affiliate, TU (<italic>Toimihenkilöunioni</italic>), which organizes white-collar workers in the export sectors, does not regard privatization and outsourcing as a way to improve the public sector, but equally does not have a strong objection to private sector participation in providing public services. Similarly, while STTK itself acknowledges that the idea that the private provision of services would in itself lead to higher quality and lower costs as a result of competition is clearly a right-wing argument that advances the interests of the employers, it does not oppose private service providers as such. AKAVA, moreover, even supports competition through private providers of public services, though also insisting that individual private providers should not be given long-term contracts since this would undermine competition. In short, in view of the pressures to restructure the public sector and incorporate more the private sector in service delivery, there is no united, firm opposition by Finnish trade unions. While some are opposed, others are less concerned and AKAVA even endorses the process. Together these divisions and tensions within the Finnish labour movement over collective bargaining issues and the potential restructuring of the public sector remind one uncomfortably of the divisions which contributed to the erosion of the Swedish model. These divisions could undermine union resistance to future attacks by Finnish capital, and also to incremental restructuring driven by broad based coalition governments.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we have evaluated the implications of the decision by EK to abandon the Finnish TUPO system, by comparing the underlying dynamics of class struggle with the situation in Sweden in the early 1990s when SAF carried out a similar initiative. Given the participation of the SDP in the current coalition government, Finnish employers are unlikely to receive governmental support for a further attack on sectoral collective bargaining and the Finnish model more widely. Clearly, they have not achieved their objective of decentralizing wage bargaining to the company or even individual level with their withdrawal from the TUPO system in 2007, nor have they managed to put an end to high-level tripartite working groups. This is partly due to continuing trade union strength, based on a density of about 70 percent. In comparison with Sweden with similarly high unionization levels, however, it is clear that it is mainly the difference in the structural power of capital which explains the difficulties of Finnish employers. In Sweden, production is much more transnationalized, giving employers stronger structural power. While they did not push for complete decentralization of collective bargaining to the company level, collective bargaining was decentralized much earlier and much more radically than in Finland, with more and more issues decided at company level. Tripartite institutions were abandoned in the early 1990s, after the employers had withdrawn, and large areas of the Swedish political economy have been restructured along neoliberal lines, whether the SAP or centre-right coalition governments were in power. Finnish capital simply does not have the same kind of structural power resources to draw on. As a result, although bargaining has been decentralized to sectoral level, trade unions are still very much involved in key decision-making, especially including high-level tripartite working groups. The employers cannot simply impose changes to existing social and economic policies.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the structural power of capital has increased, and continues to increase, in tandem with the increasing transnationalization of Finnish production. Employers have not given up on their objective of further decentralization, and issues such as Finland’s ‘generous’ right to strike are also on their agenda. As we have noticed in the case of Sweden, the erosion of the Swedish model was not only due to an offensive by transnational capital. Strategies by the SAP and divisions within the labour movement, especially between national and transnational, forces of labour, were additional dynamics within the underlying class struggle. Thus the strategy of the SDP, even though it focuses again more strongly on defending social equality, is an issue of concern for Finnish unions, since it has not completely abandoned its Third Way policies of the 1990s; and considering the most recent elections it is clearly prepared to make compromises in exchange for participation in power. It resembles in this respect to some extent the Swedish SAP, which initiated a significant process of incremental neoliberal restructuring during the 1980s until 1991 and then again from 1994 to 2006.</p>
<p>In this situation, tensions and divisions within the labour movement are dangerous, as the Swedish example has shown. There is no clear unanimous position on the best level of bargaining, the purpose of bargaining or the dangers of public sector restructuring. As in Sweden, a division is opening up between transnational and internationally oriented labour on the one hand, concerned to sustain the export competitiveness of Finnish production, and nationally oriented forces of labour on the other, which are more focused on closing the gender pay gap between the public sector and domestic services as against the male-dominated workforce of the export sectors. An outright attack on trade union rights is unlikely, given the composition of the new coalition government. However, incremental change in the areas of collective bargaining and public sector restructuring are a clear possibility, and internal union divisions could prove dangerous in view of these pressures.</p>
<p>In October 2011, EK and the trade unions, with the strong support of the government, reached a national, multi-sector framework agreement on pay and conditions and several social reforms in areas including unemployment insurance and parental leave. The implications of what appears at first sight a complete reversal of developments in recent years, however, are not clear. At the time of completing this article, the situation in Finnish industrial relations is still very tense and confused. A major reason for change of strategy by the employers was that <italic>Metalli</italic> and <italic>TU</italic> joined forces to push through wage increases and an extra week’s holidays. A short strike put pressure on <italic>Teknologiateollisuus</italic> to cooperate with EK for an encompassing wage settlement. Even though this framework agreement has delivered predictability, industrial peace and good economic growth in European terms, deepening troubles in the export sectors have brought the hawks of EK back into the driving seat. It was of symbolic importance that the director of EK, Mikko Pukkinen, who had negotiated the framework agreement, was sacked in autumn 2012. EK and trade union confederations have been at loggerheads for several months over how to implement (or not) the right to three days’ education leave for every employee per year, which for several unions was an essential part of the agreement.</p>
<p>This raises the question whether the framework agreement was only a temporary halt to further erosion, as the comparison with Sweden implies. In 1990, in the context of a severe economic recession, the Rehnberg Commission in Sweden established a central, multi-sector ‘stabilization agreement’ with the support of the employers and trade unions as well as direct intervention by the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959680112474747">Kjellberg, 1998</xref>: 89–90). This did not, however, prevent a continued process of decentralization, albeit within the framework of sectoral agreements. Trade union unity, therefore, remains important in Finland in order to resist neoliberal restructuring.</p>
