<p>As we announced in Volume 16, Number 1, this year, 2012, marked the inauguration of the annual <italic>Theoretical Criminology</italic> Best Article Prize. We stated that the winning article would be deemed to advance critical inquiry in the field of theoretical criminology. Qualities sought included clarity of writing, breadth of ambition and original inquiry. Particular weight was to be given to work from emerging scholars. After consultation with the journal’s Associate Editors, we are pleased to announce that the 2012 <italic>Theoretical Criminology</italic> Best Article Prize has been awarded to Dr Ana Aliverti, Howard League Fellow in the Centre for Criminology at the University of Oxford, for her article ‘Making people criminal: The role of the criminal law in immigration enforcement’. In the selection process, the Editors expressed enthusiasm for a number of excellent articles that appeared in <italic>Theoretical Criminology</italic> over the past year. The Editors selected this article over a number of others because it opens up a new area of criminological inquiry into migration control, skillfully combining theoretical analysis with empirical detail. Aliverti demonstrates the complexity of current policies that emphasize familiar punitive rhetoric and practice towards foreign nationals, while generally opting for easier, less scrutinized administrative remedies to remove them.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Associate Editors, we congratulate Dr Aliverti for her achievement. In recognition of this prize, she will receive £100 worth of SAGE books of her choice.</p>
<p>We would also like to take this occasion to thank Richard Jones, of the University of Edinburgh, for his service as UK/Europe Book Review Editor and to welcome to the journal Bethan Loftus, of the University of Manchester, who will be replacing him. We also welcome Sharon Pickering of Monash University, Australia to the group of Associate Editors, and thank Dario Melossi for his many years of service in this role. Dr Melossi will continue to serve on <italic>Theoretical Criminology</italic>’s International Advisory Board.</p>
