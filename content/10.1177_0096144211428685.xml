<abstract>
<p>Is it reasonable for officials to decide that a public, municipally sponsored monument no longer deserves to be permanent municipal property? Frederick MacMonnies’s <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> offers insight into this question. The 1922 monument invoked a higher common life, but its statue portion was widely interpreted as misogynous. That reputation has continued to this day, and the work is now in disrepair. This article, a biography of <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> from its conception in the 1890s to its tumultuous afterlife beginning in 1922, reveals how sex and the city were the heart of the problem and argues that the work should be stabilized as a unique historical embodiment of those controversies.</p>

<p>This article addresses the matter of what is public art. It explores the question—so familiar in the wake of the so-called “culture wars” of the early 90s—of whether artistic self-expression should be constrained if a work is deemed offensive. Who decides what is offensive? Does the public, or officials ostensibly acting on its behalf, have the right to determine that a work of permanent municipal public sculpture no longer deserves to be designated as permanent and no longer deserves maintenance and protection as municipal property? What if the community and its elected officials do not see eye to eye on such matters? What is the municipality’s obligation to work that it has accepted into its permanent collection?</p>
<p>Exploring the monument <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>, this essay examines how New Yorkers in two of its boroughs dealt with these questions. Unlike the cases of the 1990s, however, this tale does not deal with charges of pornography, race, or religion, or even with modernist art, but rather with the art historically disreputable: academic, allegorical, public art. <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144211428685">Figure 1</xref>), a statue, fountain, and basin carved in marble and measuring almost twenty-three feet in height, depicts a male, Virtue, standing resolutely astride two prone female siren “vices,” who, pace Homer, writhe amid netting and sea creatures at Virtue’s feet, along with carved dolphin heads. First conceived in 1909, the monument took thirteen years to be completed. It was controversial from the outset, for though rendered as a Progressive Era political allegory about the hazards of urban vice and corruption, it was interpreted by many women as demeaning to their sex. The sculptor’s allegory was quite straightforward—too much so, apparently.</p>

<p>The case of <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> has a psycho-biographical as well as a social aspect that I wish to discuss, if only briefly, revealing the excitement that could arise when a prominent early-twentieth-century male sculptor evoked a torrid love life unwittingly candidly. The story also shows how citizens negotiated the lines between the personal and the political, the metaphorical and the literal, and appropriateness and inappropriateness when it came to the representation of gender relations. To throw out a tease, when a municipal work about civic virtue is perceived as a work about sex and the city, does the city have reason and the right to disown it? What are the lessons from this monument’s life cycle?</p>
<p>The seeds for this monument were inseminated in 1891, when a Mrs. Angelina Crane left $53,000 as a bequest to the city of New York to erect a drinking fountain in her memory—a gesture common across America at the time. Crane’s heirs challenged the will, and it was not probated until 1908.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211428685">1</xref></sup> New York City’s Democratic mayor George B. McClellan, Jr. procured the money and took charge of the commission in 1909. He hired directly the prominent sculptor Frederick William MacMonnies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0096144211428685">Figure 2</xref>), famed for his massive Columbian Fountain for the 1893 World’s Fair.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144211428685">2</xref></sup> New York statues were typically sponsored by a private group and donated to the city. <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>, a mayoral commission, was a notable exception. Replacing a Victorian fountain in City Hall Park, the MacMonnies fountain, from McClellan’s likely point of view, would serve as a symbol of an enlightened modern government (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0096144211428685">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144211428685">3</xref></sup></p>

<p>MacMonnies delayed getting started, batting about several possible subjects before making his choice. “I had plenty of time and all kinds of ideas,” MacMonnies recalled. “I thought at first I would make a city of New York, a female figure, a creature who was enthroned, and waters and rivers at the side, etc., and then that did not seem to appeal to me, and then I finally thought as I got nearer and nearer, of this idea of local dignity, the genie of the spot—so I thought I would make <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144211428685">4</xref></sup> He encountered personal and design obstacles, and World War I created further delays. The statue was finally ready thirteen years later, in 1922.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144211428685">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Before <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> had even been put into place, however, the sitting mayor, Tammany Democrat John F. (“Red Mike”) Hylan, had begun to receive protests from women who had seen (or heard tell of) photographs of <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> and deemed it inappropriate, with its rendering of a brutish nude male seemingly trampling two females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0096144211428685">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0096144211428685">Figures 4</xref>). (In fact Virtue steps on a rock, not a neck.) That these womanly figures represented vice made matters only worse for those in the know. Overlooking the abstract concept, and reading the image literally, these observers interpreted <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> as an expression of the battle between the sexes and as degrading to women. Debate raged over whether the city should even accept the monument. My previous discussions of <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> underplayed the significance of the women’s point of view, but seeing how those earlier attitudes have continued to resonate in the present day, I now wish to draw out this aspect of the story and its implications.</p>

<p>MacMonnies could not comprehend how detractors could interpret his work as an affront, but in hindsight neither citizen responses nor his choices are surprising. There was a history of strong reactions to MacMonnies’s depictions of women. And there was also a probable biographical connection to the way in which those women were shown. With respect to <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>, what has bridged the generations is the reaction to MacMonnies’s evocation, presentation, and denial of <italic>sex</italic>. The monument represented Progressive Era ideals of good government. But it was also about the power of erotic attraction in urban public space. Irrepressible desire was a reality with which many observers could identify but would not. MacMonnies’s unintentional conflation of the public (municipal) and the personal (psychological) disturbed many people.</p>
<p>The sculptor should not have been entirely perplexed that some took offense. Such disturbance had occurred with his 1893 <italic>Bacchante with Infant Faun</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0096144211428685">Figure 5</xref>), a controversial work with sex far more notably at the forefront. When its owner architect Charles McKim sought to install it in the courtyard at the newly opened Boston Public Library, which he had designed, a number of prominent Boston Brahmins objected vigorously, contending that the nymph looked like a drunken strumpet, corrupting youthful morals. The library’s trustees supported the gift, but after continued outcry and petitions, McKim withdrew his offer and donated the sculpture to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144211428685">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>MacMonnies had designed the <italic>Bacchante with Infant Faun</italic> in 1893 and exhibited it to great acclaim in the Paris Salon of 1894. He offered the work as a gift to architect Charles F. McKim. McKim decided to use it to adorn the courtyard at the newly opened Boston Public Library, which he had designed as a memorial to his late wife, Julia. The Brahmins who disapproved included Charles Eliot of Harvard, Charles Eliot Norton, and Barrett Wendell. Responding to the criticism, the Boston Art Commission initially rejected the <italic>Bacchant</italic>e but subsequently agreed to reconsider the gift, which the library’s trustees had always supported. The library put the sculpture out for a two-week trial period in mid-November 1896, but after continued outcry and petitions, the library trustees importuned McKim for advice. McKim, fed up with the matter, which he thought had been resolved, withdrew his offer, an action the trustees accepted.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p><italic>Bacchante with Infant Faun</italic> had been a daringly lifelike taunt on MacMonnies’s part. The realism of the work was underscored by the picturesque modeling of the French beaux arts style and by the very unclassical toothy grin, perked up nipples, and unladylike prance, the “joyous hippity skippity pose,” as one critic put it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144211428685">7</xref></sup> As art historian Julia Rosenbaum has demonstrated, there were definitely class dimensions to the Brahmins’ opposition, who evoked the specter of vulgar drunken Irish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144211428685">8</xref></sup> But there was more to the situation than just that. For many, <italic>Bacchante with Infant Faun</italic>, reveling in her nakedness, was no better than a common streetwalker, “low and sensual and degrading,” a “debasing exhibition of the human body on the public stage for the amusement of sensualists,” as the president of the Ladies’ Physiological Institute put it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144211428685">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such a revelation of pleasure was no accident. For MacMonnies, like many of his artistic era, artistic success seemed to be predicated on maintaining a good, bourgeois marriage in public and fulfilling desire in secret—whether it be through participation in rowdy male parties with “pie girls” and models or, as was the case with Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848–1907), Stanford White (1853–1906), Will Low (1853–1933), Arthur B. Davies (1863–1928)—as well as MacMonnies—through leading a double life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144211428685">10</xref></sup> MacMonnies had delved into such a life on meeting the sculptor Helen Glenn in 1890, three years after his marriage to Mary Fairchild in 1887.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144211428685">11</xref></sup> The relationship between Glenn and MacMonnies became an ardent one, in which both of them reveled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144211428685">12</xref></sup> The affair coincided with MacMonnies’s work on the <italic>Bacchante</italic>, producing a sense of delight that he transferred to his work. Corresponding with Glenn during a period in which he was finishing the <italic>Bacchante</italic>, MacMonnies wrote, of creating sculpture in general, “After all, it is not so much ambition as the delicious recklessness into which one plunges that fascinates me . . . the sheer delight of investigation and choice and bringing together of vagrant beauty in the most commonplace things.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144211428685">13</xref></sup> That statement could just as readily characterize the sculptor’s romance with Glenn.</p>
<p>With the <italic>Bacchante and Infant Faun</italic>, then, the exhilaration MacMonnies derived from private passion was transferred to his work in public. Bostonians clearly detected these sensations and deemed them unacceptable. The library, after all, was meant to advance modern civic values and the life of the mind. It was a place for study, not sex, alcohol, or revelry. The <italic>Bacchante</italic>, appealing to “base” emotions was adjudged an improper distraction. “[T]he vices which fill our prisons should not be exulted in our library,” snuffed the <italic>Boston Globe</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144211428685">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the time MacMonnies had embarked on <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>, that proclivity to succumb to personal ardor had grown problematic for the artist as well, with wife Mary and mistress Glenn delivering MacMonnies offspring within days of each other in October 1897. MacMonnies and Glenn eventually separated, but not before hatching an intricate plot that enabled the latter to return home from Giverny, France, in the masquerade of a virtuous mother and widow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144211428685">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The complexities of this experience did not put MacMonnies off romance. In 1909 the now-divorced sculptor had taken up with former student Alice Jones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0096144211428685">Figure 6</xref>), the wealthy daughter of a five-term U.S. senator, who, from the standpoint of MacMonnies’s sister Maggie Courant, was aggressively trying to nab him. Writing her cousin Jessie Hugham of her displeasure with the situation, Maggie denounced Jones as a manipulative temptress. “I have never seen a more pushing, forward woman,” griped Courant. “She has made up her mind if she goes through fire and water she will get Willie. . . . If any woman ever laid a trap and worked her cards to get a man, she has. . . . She had a will like iron, and a maneuvering brain, and it is hard to stand up against her.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144211428685">16</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>All of this was transpiring at the moment that MacMonnies was modeling <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>, while his daughters Betty and Marjorie were fetching him seashells, seaweed, and fish netting as props for the sculpture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144211428685">17</xref></sup> Alice ultimately snared her man, and the couple married in March 1910. But the relationship was a troubled one, and by 1916, in the midst of an affair with yet another woman, Rita Lydig, MacMonnies attempted to divorce Alice. Alice convinced MacMonnies to stay in the marriage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144211428685">18</xref></sup> The power of women to lure and entrap was likely on the sculptor’s mind.</p>
<p>Such preoccupations, conjoined with Progressive Era fears about political corruption and prostitution, came together in <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>—an image about the fear of feminine enticement and the manly resolve to resist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144211428685">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0096144211428685">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0096144211428685">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0096144211428685">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0096144211428685">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0096144211428685">9</xref>). Discussing his quest for a motif, appropriate for the City Hall site, MacMonnies remarked on the need to suggest that “those who govern the city’s destinies are strong to uphold the law of right; that they are straightforward and upright and so intent on their great business that the lure of pleasure and luxury cannot turn them aside from the straight path, into devious ways.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144211428685">19</xref></sup></p>

<p>From an iconographic standpoint, <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> counterbalanced the cruder image to which MacMonnies alluded when he stated that the allegory had “nothing to do with intelligence.” The siren vices, for example, conjured up those of Homer’s epic poem <italic>The Odyssey</italic> (XII): the bird-women whose enchanting song lured sailors into shipwreck. The connection endowed <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> with a requisite and irrefutable classical pedigree. MacMonnies undoubtedly was also inspired by Michelangelo’s <italic>David</italic> (1501–1504) and the Palazzo Vecchio <italic>Victory</italic> (1527), as well as the <italic>Farnese Hercules</italic>. These masterpieces were clearly the iconographic sources for the pose (<italic>David</italic>) and rippling musculature (<italic>Victory</italic> and <italic>Farnese Hercules</italic>) of <italic>Virtue</italic>, and for the expressions of threatened manhood, resolve, and strength that they together exhibited. Historian of early modern art Joseph Monteyne observed that <italic>Virtue</italic>’s bent and turned-in legs are also reminiscent of Caravaggio’s 1602 <italic>Amor Vincit Omnia</italic> (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin). The latter image, together with the evocations of Michelangelean depictions of nude male bodies on display, suggest as well a repressed homoerotic dimension to <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>.</p>

</fig>
<p>MacMonnies’s method for conveying this idea was to represent a man of the people, an ideal of integrity conceived, romantically, in terms of both antique/Michelangelean precedent and class. “I did not above all want it to be college youth or a senator nor a man above the people,” he stated. “I wanted a giant, the giant of strength that is in the simple-minded. I wanted to make a study of candor . . . an express man can have more civic virtue than a senator, and an elevator boy may pay more attention to the demands of decency than the millionaire on Fifth Avenue. <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> has nothing to do with intelligence.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144211428685">20</xref></sup> On this latter point, the press was in agreement but ascribed names that ranged from “Cave Man,” “Fat Boy,” and “Rough Guy” to a “ruthless Babe Ruth” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0096144211428685">Figure 7</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144211428685">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Certain women were equally disenchanted. If the sculptor wanted to represent civic virtue as a brawny athletic type, stated Elizabeth Smith Edwards, he would have done better to depict an actual hero, not some false ideal. Show men like baseball stars Christy Mathewson or Babe Ruth, “anything except that thing, which belittles women,” she argued. Mrs. Philip Ochsenreiter, Jr., a head of the League of Women Voters from the 16th Assembly District of Brooklyn (southern Brooklyn), echoed that sentiment—as did other women—testifying that “it was very degrading to set before young people the idea of women tempting a man from the path of virtue.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144211428685">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mayor John F. Hylan was at one with the press on this matter. No fan of the monument, he attacked the city’s Art Commission for having approved it. Ostensibly responding to constituent objections, he arranged a hearing on whether <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> demeaned women and whether it should be installed on municipal property. “[E]ven the unaesthetic Bronx and rural Staten Island sent delegates,” noted the <italic>New York Sun</italic>, and “they loosed . . . a storm of feminine wrath, sarcasm, and invective against the statue.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144211428685">23</xref></sup> The press came out in force; reporters and headline writers had a field day. Some women asserted that the work was outdated and pagan; the cave man rubric reigned. Others, reacting to MacMonnies’s assertions that the sirens were mermaids, sea creatures, not actual women, contended that it made no sense to depict <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> stepping on fish. “When is a lady not a lady?” quipped the <italic>Herald</italic>. “When half of her is a striped bass.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144211428685">24</xref></sup> A number of women insisted that it made no difference whether the figures were women or sirens, for the very resemblance to women “cast a slur upon the sex’s present status of moral and political equality” (the latter recently won through the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment giving women the right to vote).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144211428685">25</xref></sup> A few people said that it would be more appropriate to depict women as virtue and the tempter as a man.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144211428685">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>On one level, clearly <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> addressed Progressive Era preoccupations with cleaning up government. But <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> went beyond the concerns about graft and Tammany Hall and good government. In light of the sex scandals involving former public officials of the present day (e.g., President Bill Clinton, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Senators John Ensign and John Edwards, and Governors James McGreevey, Eliot Spitzer, and John Sanford), it is easy to envision exactly how the turn from the straight to the devious could have sexual as well as political undertones.</p>
<p>Was <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> a transcendent public statement or an inappropriate psychic one, articulating MacMonnies’s fears about desire? Was it inappropriate for the sculptor to assert that man had to struggle to submit to higher ideals even as the vices of allure, attraction, and seduction were constantly rearing their heads?</p>
<p>MacMonnies did not think so. Describing <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>, MacMonnies stated,</p>
<disp-quote><p>He looks out into the distance so concentrated on his great ideal that he does not even see the temptation. To suggest this temptation: its dual nature which dazzles while it ensnares its charm and insinuating danger, one thinks of the beauty and laughter of women; the treachery of the serpent coils of a sea creature wrapped about its prey. These lovely sea women coil themselves about their victim. Their scale, sinuous tails entwine him. With one hand, each one draws him about the net disguised in tangled seaweed, on her lips, one holds half hidden, a skull, sinister suggestion of disillusionment and death.</p>
<p>The other hides her face, as we hide all dark designs. They entirely surround him, but he steps out triumphantly and places his foot on a firm rock. Below him lies the wreck of a ship which he sped gayly, it [<italic>sic</italic>] proud figurehead of victory overturned—torn shreds of hopes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144211428685">27</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>MacMonnies certainly did not believe that <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> literally represented the mundane or that he the artist should be censored. From his perspective, expressed in ways that were both public and personal, sexual desire was simply part of modern life. But the idea that people could misinterpret his intentions confounded him. “‘Hell’s bells!’” he exclaimed in exasperation,</p>
<disp-quote><p>What do I care if all the ignoramuses and quack politicians in New York, together with all the dam-fool women get together to talk about my statue? Let ’em cackle. Let ’em babble. You can’t change the eternal verities that way. From Paris to Patagonia—universal allegory pictures sirens, temptresses, as woman. If you suppress allegory you suppress all intellectual effort. I gather that allegory has long been extinct in City Hall.</p>
<p>How in hell do you suppose they expect me to shoulder the responsibility for making temptation feminine? Bish-bosh, I say!</p></disp-quote>
<p>“For a lifetime I have adored womankind,” he continued, revealingly. “I have spent my life at their feet.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144211428685">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>MacMonnies insisted on the allegorical intent of <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>, then, but his own assertions suggest that the less respectable matter of sexual temptation in the modern public realm was a potent reality to be expressed, even if he himself was not fully aware of how the personal dimensions of this were being formally articulated. Newly enfranchised women, with consciousness raised about power, felt that they saw things more clearly—hence more literally; their opinion of the monument was grounded in pragmatism, and they refused to be swayed by idealistic assertions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144211428685">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>In spite of the protests, the monument remained in City Hall Park for that moment when it was decided that the cost of moving it would be exorbitant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144211428685">30</xref></sup> And, as often happens with permanent features of the cityscape, people stopped paying attention to it (or so asserted the <italic>New York Times</italic> in 1932).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144211428685">31</xref></sup> Two officials who continued to notice, however—Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and his commissioner of parks Robert Moses—still wanted <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> out of the park.</p>
<p>Responding to a protest letter about the proposed removal of <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>, written to him by MacMonnies, La Guardia retorted, “I really cannot understand why you should be peeved at me. I am one of your most ardent admirers. As for <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> . . . why talk about it? Every great artist is entitled to just a few sins.” Noting MacMonnies’s concern that a proposed Foley Square site would detract from the “predominating” frontal emphasis of the work, which was created with that view in mind, La Guardia continued, “You speak of a predominating face and that if it goes to Foley Square it should have at least four sides. Every morning and every evening as I enter and leave City Hall, it is not exactly the face of the statue that I am compelled to face,” but rather, La Guardia insinuated, Virtue’s monumental backside.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144211428685">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses, too, was anxious to dispose of it. “I don’t care where it goes,” Moses was quoted as saying, “but that statue is going out of that park.” “Let’s put it in a bosky grove, a bosky grove way out in Queens where trees are thick.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144211428685">33</xref></sup> The opportunity finally presented itself in 1929, when, after protracted negotiations, the city and federal government came to a long-anticipated agreement to demolish a massive Tweed-era post office at the park’s southern end. With its original footprint restored, the City Hall Park would undergo renovation. The redesign would provide an excuse for moving out <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> and garner Moses the credit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144211428685">34</xref></sup> Paradoxically, officials from the other boroughs began vying for the fountain. Possible new locations bandied about included Randalls Island and Coney Island, as well as the nearby Foley Square civic center.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144211428685">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Queens borough president George Upton Harvey, who had offered to take <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> as early as 1929, lobbied especially hard; the New York City Board of Estimate ultimately decided to grant him his wish and move the monument to Borough Hall, in Kew Gardens district of Queens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144211428685">36</xref></sup> In the wake of corruption scandals that had forced the resignation of his predecessor, Harvey embraced <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> on its allegorical merits—as a symbol of a new era in Queens, and as a symbol of the borough’s underdog status. The monument also had a personal resonance. “‘I have been kicked around for years, just as that statue has,’” Harvey divulged. “‘I felt that he and I had so much in common that if he were over here, near my office, I could come out here sometimes and we could tell each other our troubles.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144211428685">37</xref></sup> For five years, until his death, he had that chance. After a municipal budget shortfall caused a delay in action, <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> was finally moved from City Hall Park to Queens Boulevard at Union Turnpike, Kew Gardens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0096144211428685">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0096144211428685">11</xref>), in May 1941.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144211428685">38</xref></sup></p>

<p>Once relocated, the monument fell under the metropolitan radar until 1972, the height of the women’s liberation movement. A group of National Organization of Women members picketed the monument on its fifty-year anniversary, objecting again to its depiction of women and calling for removal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144211428685">39</xref></sup> Nothing came of the effort, and the press dropped the issue, but every decade or so since, a lone woman with influence—and with values born of that seventies generation of second-wave feminism—has spoken out against <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>. First it was Claire Shulman, the first female Queens borough president, who in 1987 dismissed <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> for insulting women and proposed that it be “banished . . . perhaps to a park.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144211428685">40</xref></sup> In 1996, <italic>New York Times</italic> metro columnist Joyce Purnick wrote with satisfaction about the fact that <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> was falling apart.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144211428685">41</xref></sup> In February 2007 the subsequent borough president Helen Marshall contemptuously dismissed pleas from the local community board to restore the monument, stating for the record that “its depiction is one that is viewed as sexist.” She has remained intransigent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144211428685">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>If a work stays in place long enough, it acquires new meanings. One may interpret these meanings in anthropomorphic terms, as did cultural historian Neil Harris in his book <italic>Building Lives</italic>, as corresponding to the stages of the life cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144211428685">43</xref></sup> <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>’s presence has inspired attitudes and actions that relate to this life cycle idea.</p>
<p><italic>Civic Virtue</italic> clearly had an extended and painful labor and delivery. Its infancy was brief—in fact, its youth was more like a stormy adolescence, complete with tantrums and cries of “you just don’t understand!” With time and a new home, it passed into adulthood and a period of stability. But because of bad genes (marble) and poor health care, it is aging unnecessarily rapidly. The same budget deficits that have kept <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> on Queens Boulevard have contributed to its disrepair.</p>
<p>The city of New York and the Kew Gardens neighborhood are now confronted with the question of whether and how to deal with the monument’s deterioration. Several possibilities present themselves. In this age of surgical malleability, it is perhaps no surprise that some of the statue’s supporters have embraced an ideal of the fountain of youth—like plastic surgery—that would restore the statue to its original appearance and the fountain to an operational state. The commissioner of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation asserted that rejuvenation would be simply too expensive. Few would dispute this, but few as well realistically expect a Joan Rivers–style makeover.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144211428685">45</xref></sup> Nevertheless, modern technologies do provide some feasible means of slowing down the aging process: stabilization, like a bit of Botox, could reduce the pace of deterioration and offer cosmetic improvement while not attempting to hide the age of the client. Alternatively, an even more minimal form of stabilization could forestall the worst deterioration, like the sugaring of the marble. Queens Borough President Marshall has chosen a fourth approach to the life crisis—malign neglect. She would allow <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> to die a slow and painful death, like an elderly castoff. A fifth option would be to kill the monument off all at once: to move or disassemble it. These last three approaches would prompt a deathwatch and commemorative services.</p>
<p>Since 1987, I have lobbied for the stabilization solution and maintained a deathwatch. I have written letters and continued to explore <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>’s history, anticipating the need for a eulogy. It has been clear for a while that individual action would not be enough—that more forceful advocacy was needed. An opportunity arose through the Fine Arts Federation of New York (FAF), a civic cultural alliance representing over twenty different arts and architectural organizations, which since 1895 has taken stands on issues of urban design. As the group’s vice president in Spring 2007, I initiated a campaign to try to save <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>, writing to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other officials. FAF took a two-pronged approach, insisting on the city’s charter-mandated obligation to maintain its art collection and emphasizing the importance of history and informed dialogue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144211428685">46</xref></sup> The organization’s public art committee, led by art historian Harriet Senie, initiated conversations with the Queens Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, proposing to collaborate on a panel, a celebrity “roast,” perhaps, or, in the worst case, a memorial. These endeavors did not pan out. Given the downturn in the city’s economy from summer 2008 into and the attitude of the current Queens borough president (Marshall), FAF resolved to put his efforts on hold 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144211428685">47</xref></sup> The stabilization campaign was reignited, however, when on 26 February 2011, Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner, representing the 9th District that includes Kew Gardens, held a news conference in front of the monumental fountain. Repeating the now-familiar refrain that <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> was “sexist,” the Congressman insisted that the Civic Virtue image was “offensive,” and that the City of New York should sell the monument off on Craigslist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144211428685">48</xref></sup> Weiner’s outburst drew ridicule and media attention to the deteriorating statue. The president of Brooklyn’s Green-Wood Cemetery Richard Moylan offered to take it, and the local Community Board and some Kew Gardens residents again called for conservation. As of July 2011 there has been no action. In a paradoxical turn of events, however, on 6 June 2011 Congressman Weiner admitted to having sent sexually explicit photographs and text messages to a bevy of women; his actions had occurred over the course of three years, and thus also coincided with the period in which he was attacking Civic Virtue’s “offensive” imagery. Conceding that he initially lied about his “sexting,” Weiner was pressured to resign from office ten days later.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144211428685">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Let me conclude with one additional perspective on <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>, one that takes account of both its history and its reception in the present. I have argued here that for MacMonnies, the siren vices in <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> were not merely those of cynicism and corruption but also those aroused by his own erotic desires. In the eyes of the sculptor and some peers, these passions were the specters raised by ideals of female empowerment, convictions of the sort that produced “pushy” women like Alice Jones and that motivated women of the suffrage movement and beyond. Feminine empowerment, equated by MacMonnies with the very desirability and attraction of women, was—at least in part—conceived of as the menace, the temptation from which <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>’s “Rough Guy” sought to remain aloof.</p>
<p>The distracting presence of women in public space posed a threat to MacMonnies. New Yorkers who recoiled at the ostensible misogyny of his sculptural statement and its particular mode of macho expression (that chunky “Rough Guy”) succeeded in publicizing their objections via the press, thanks no doubt to the mayor’s engagement with the case. The press responded prolifically, covering the backlash to <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> through rhetorics of irony and caricature.</p>
<p>It is in the <italic>nature</italic> of caricature, of course, to oversimplify. Meanings become articulated as platitudes and clichés, endlessly reiterated and difficult to surmount. We need to dispute such simplifications, like calling <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> “sexist,” as did Borough President Marshall. I have long argued that we are better off enriching ourselves by seeing <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> as a historical representation, by understanding how it was a product of its Progressive Era moment and of the particular biography of the artist who created it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144211428685">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>I would like to propose one other way of complicating our reading of <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>. In addition to viewing it as an artifact of a New York past, we might also interpret it in a contemporary light, starting by taking MacMonnies at his word. As mentioned previously, one theme of <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> was the struggle to resist the irresistible: the allure and menace of sex as part of life. Good government—the realization of civic virtue—would seek to repress and stamp out the threatening presence of desire in the public domain. As the case of Congressman Weiner revealed, however (to cite just the most pertinent example), such repressive efforts may be futile.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144211428685">51</xref></sup> The monument, with its arched-back, orgasmic, slithering prone Vice and its twin, intertwined with the tension-charged and erect but cerebral <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0096144211428685">Figures 9</xref>, 10), embodies this dilemma.</p>
<p>The binaried lines of thought that undergirded both MacMonnies’s monument and the disagreements—good government versus corruption, male versus female, reason versus desire, mind versus body—remain pervasive in American society. Reaction to MacMonnies’s academic composition, inflecting allegorical personification with gender identity, transformed the sculpture into a site of ongoing political conflict. In allowing <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> to decay, its present-day adversaries assert, like their Jazz Age predecessors, that they object to femininity portrayed as a menace. They strive not merely to undermine the authority of MacMonnies’s terms of representation, but to destroy all physical traces.</p>
<p>But would these same detractors wish to repudiate female sexuality? Many contemporary American women would probably not want to buy into this alternative. Gender discourse about women has expanded beyond the triadic model of the virgin, mother, or whore, highlighted by Bram Djikstra and others. Feminist thought has also evolved considerably since the second wave of the 1970s (when feminists like <italic>New York Times</italic> columnist Purnick and Borough Presidents Schulman and Marshall cut their teeth). Some intellectuals, reacting to what they see as an ideological heavy-handedness and even “puritanism” among second-wave feminists, do not feel compelled to deny a relationship among personal identity, gender identity, fashion, sexuality, and authority. Some in fact regard sexual allure as an instrument of achieving power and self-realization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144211428685">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Instead of destroying MacMonnies’s monument, then, could we not in the present day just reinterpret <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> in a way that upends the MacMonnies point of view? Poststructuralist theorists have demonstrated that signification extends beyond the intentions of the artist. By taking the artist at his word—by privileging his interpretation and those of his contemporaries over those more recent and, for some, potentially more liberating views about female sexuality, i.e., that it is out there and acceptable—are we in the present day not merely deluding ourselves, undercutting the advances that women have made? As an alternative, might twentieth-first century viewing publics instead regard the vices of <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>, in presentist fashion, as an affirmation of just how far women have come?</p>
<p>Many contemporary viewers, as well, might choose to see beyond even these kinds of gendered divisions. It should be noted, for example (as Julia Rosenbaum has done), that Virtue has not fully triumphed over the siren Vices: he has not slain them, but rather has merely restrained them. The physical monument itself is irrevocably locked into the grip of insurmountable struggle. <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> thus signifies the ongoing challenge of recuperating a “less bifurcated view of physicality, and mind and matter” and eschewing the blinkered politics that are its by-products.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144211428685">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>These intellectual abstractions have real-world consequences. As of mid-2011, an important embodiment of New York’s history is falling apart. City politicians are allowing that to happen. So are board representatives of visual arts professionals, who have opined that public art in the 21st century is about process: that a non-response is a suitable strategy when benighted yet powerful politicians take action against public art.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144211428685">54</xref></sup> The city of New York commissioned <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> and accepted the work as part of its permanent art collection. The city has a responsibility try to find a means to maintain it, regardless of fiscal or political climate. Officials within Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration acknowledge this fact: that it is crucial to retain the material cultural traces of notable urban experiences, whether or not the object is politically savory or aesthetically appealing. Urban, urban historians can and should support that enterprise by elucidating the force and significance of complicated, embattled monuments—like <italic>Civic Virtue</italic>—and advocating for their protection.</p>

<p><italic>Civic Virtue</italic> was not the first New York outdoor statue to stimulate concerns about inappropriate depictions of women. <italic>Diana of the Tower</italic>, a graceful, if blandly rendered, weathervane figure by former MacMonnies mentor Augustus Saint-Gaudens generated comment when first placed into position atop Madison Square Garden in 1893. <italic>Diana</italic>’s nudity became the object of nervous discussion and satire. As art historian Jennifer Hardin has observed, however, as an expression of modern feminine self-possession and insouciance, the <italic>Diana</italic>, for all of its ostensible classicism, was very much of its times. Refashioned through caricature and advertising, <italic>Diana</italic>’s image was disseminated and popularized; the threat posed by its nudity was defused. Moreover, the evidence of the statue’s nudity was likely not even all that visible. The statue was a weathervane, an object silhouetted against the sky. Whatever controversy had arisen initially was not sustained. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the model for <italic>Diana</italic> was Saint-Gaudens’s mistress Davida Clark, who bore him a child, just as Helen Glenn would with MacMonnies. Jennifer Hardin, “Augustus Saint-Gaudens’s Diana of 1891–93: Critical and Public Response to a Singular American Nude” (lecture, “Augustus Saint-Gaudens: Master of American Sculpture” symposium, July 13, 2007), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hoodmuseum.dartmouth.edu/av/americanartatdartmouth/diana.html">http://hoodmuseum.dartmouth.edu/av/americanartatdartmouth/diana.html</ext-link> (accessed July 29, 2008).</p>

<p>Architect and Kew Gardens resident Glen Urbanas initiated his own preservation campaign in summer 2008, proposing to form a private fund-raising group, the “Angelina Crane Memorial Conservancy.” The title, highlighting the role of the patroness, was intended to avoid raising the hackles of politicians, their knee-jerk responses, when the title <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> was mentioned.

<p>I have argued that the Congressman’s subsequent listing of <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> under “Free Stuff” on Craigslist was irresponsible (the ad was deleted): since 1898 the City has had a Charter-mandated process for the acquisition, maintenance, and relocation of works of art. That process requires the approval of the City’s Public Design Commission.</p>
<p>Weiner’s attack on <italic>Civic Virtue</italic> was intended in part to draw attention to his contention that Republicans were waging a “war on women” by seeking to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

<p>Panicking after sending out to his entire Twitter following a crotch shot meant for only one follower, the Ninth District Democratic Congressman contended that he had been hacked, but that he could not say for certain whether the photograph was of him. A conservative blogger who had been tracking exchanges of a sexual nature between Weiner and young female followers, made public additional photographs of Weiner’s pectoral muscles and his lower extremities. These photographs were released, along with sexual text messages exchanged with female political fans (who included an exotic dancer), amidst revelations that his wife of one year was pregnant with their first child. Abandoned by infuriated Democrats who had been alienated by Weiner’s abrasive personality, a humiliated and politically paralyzed Weiner resigned from the House on June 16, 2011.</p>
<p>In hindsight, Weiner’s vehement disapproval of Civic Virtue, with its bulging male pecs, can be viewed in psychoanalytic terms as a reaction-formation, a defense against forbidden sexual urges that must have provoked intense anxiety in him. Viewed in Jungian analytical terms, the statue was a symbol or representation of his own shadow, embodying unacceptable sexual drives and impulses that had to be repressed to uphold and sustain his persona, his public image. The repressed and unacknowledged shadow often provokes hatred, annoyance, or disapproval toward those who represent those unaccepted parts of the self, here resulting in Weiner’s insistence on the statue’s unacceptable misogyny. Yet privately he sent Twitter photographs of himself posing, like Civic Virtue’s depiction of Virtue, with bulging pectoral muscles. With his Congressional district office just across the street from Civic Virtue, Weiner had no choice but to confront its anxiety-provoking presence on a daily basis. Repression was necessary.

<p>Non-response, or “laissez-faire” is my characterization of the position taken by the Board of Directors of the College Art Association of America, as relayed to me in phone conversation with by CAA President Barbara Nesin, 14 April 2011. In the wake of both Weiner’s news conference and the removal of a 2007 mural of laborers by Governor of Maine Paul LePage (R), art historian Cassandra Langer and I urged the CAA to comment. The board chose not to in part, ostensibly, because the board did not wish to challenge the will of the community, and in part, most likely, because some on the board did not believed that the work merited being saved. On the Maine murals, see Jennifer Epstein, “Maine Governor Removes Labor Mural,” <italic>Politico</italic>, 28 March 2011, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/52050.html">http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/52050.html</ext-link> (accessed June 22, 2011).</p>
