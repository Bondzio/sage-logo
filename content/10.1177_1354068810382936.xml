<abstract>
<p>Common concepts for the classification of parties into families (origins, transnational links, ideology, name) suggest that the radical right should be less homogeneous than most other party families in Western Europe: their comparatively diverse origins, disputed ideological core features, as well as the lack of stable transnational cooperation and the absence of an agreed-upon label support this reasoning. The article uses expert survey data on six policy dimensions to assess the homogeneity of the radical right in comparison with the green, social democratic, liberal and conservative/Christian democratic party families. Analysing a set of 94 parties from 17 West European countries it is found (1) that party families on the left are more homogeneous than those on the right, and (2) that the party family of the radical right exhibits a degree of policy homogeneity similar to the conservatives and Christian democrats, while being considerably more homogeneous than the liberal party family.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The emergence of right-wing radical parties constitutes one of the most significant developments in West European political systems during the past decades. But not only have these new parties impacted strongly on the dynamics of national party competition, their rise also sparked intense debates within the field of comparative politics.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons why these debates are still ongoing. Among the most prominent is the unsettled question of how to properly define, classify and label these parties.</p>
<p>Instead of further adding to the ‘[c]onceptual inflation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068810382936">Eatwell, 2000</xref>: 410) by forming hard-to-test conjectures about the nature of the radical right, this article approaches the problem at hand from a more empirical and comparative perspective. As the concept of a party family implies a certain degree of shared political viewpoints among party family members, this analysis seeks to examine whether the parties commonly labelled right-wing radical are more or less diverse than those of other party families (Greens, social democrats, liberals and conservative/Christian democrats). The main question to be answered in this article is therefore: How homogeneous are West European party families in comparative perspective?</p>
<p>Following the structure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068810382936">Mair and Mudde’s (1998)</xref> account, four arguments are put forward stating that the radical right party family can be assumed to be less homogeneous than the other party families under scrutiny here.</p>
<p>In order to test this hypothesis, the empirical part of the article first outlines the procedure of case and data selection. Since arbitrary choices especially in the former would unduly bias the results of the analysis, a case for a most inclusive research design is made. On the basis of the most recent literature, a set of 16 radical right-wing parties is selected. Together with the cases from the four other party families, this amounts to a total of 94 parties from 17 European countries. The fourth section of the article then sets out to examine the homogeneity of party families. First, some simple indicators of policy homogeneity are employed. Subsequently, the 94 cases are fed into a cluster analysis in order to test (1) whether parties can be classified according to their policy positions and (2) how homogeneous West European party families are in a comparative perspective. After a discussion of the findings, the conclusion considers some of the implications for the study of the radical right party family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1354068810382936">
<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>Party families are commonly identified by their (1) origins and sociology, (2) transnational links, (3) policy and ideology, and (4) party name (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068810382936">Mair and Mudde, 1998</xref>). In what follows, I present four arguments claiming that each of these approaches could lead us to expect greater heterogeneity in the party family of the radical right than in (most) other party families.</p>
<sec id="section3-1354068810382936">
<title>The diversity of the radical rights’ origins and social roots</title>
<p>Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810382936">Lipset and Rokkan’s (1967)</xref> cleavage theory, the origins/sociology approach focuses on the demand side of the political process and categorizes parties according to their roots in social conflicts. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the major lines of division in European societies became manifest in the birth of parties that represented social groups at either side of the respective cleavage. The national revolutions fuelled the emergence of liberal parties advocating constitutionalism, secularization and the abandonment of the <italic>ancien régime</italic>. The state–church cleavage, on the contrary, was reflected in the split between Christian and (mostly liberal) secular parties. Following the Industrial Revolution, the class cleavage impacted most profoundly on the national party systems in Europe and established a division between socialist and non-socialist parties.</p>
<p>More recently, the rise of green parties has been portrayed as the consequence of a new line of conflict becoming salient in European societies due to changes in the value orientations of younger and well-educated parts of the population: the postmaterialist–materialist cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068810382936">Inglehart, 1977</xref>). In their account of the emergence of the radical right, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068810382936">Ignazi (1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810382936">2003</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068810382936">McGann and Kitschelt (1995)</xref> rely on a similar argument: Changes in the demand side of the political process induce the origination of new parties on either side of the political spectrum. Hence, the mobilization of the electorate along the ‘libertarian–authoritarian’ cleavage would account for the rise of both the green and the radical right parties.</p>
<p>When examining the electorate more specifically, however, it turns out that the attributes of the radical right supporters are far from uniform: While mobilization on immigration issues is a commonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068810382936">Ivarsflaten, 2008</xref>), analyses of European electorates have found ‘considerable variations in who voted for the radical right’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810382936">Norris, 2005</xref>: 148) across countries. Even though some convergence happened ‘as a consequence of proletarianization […], important variations remain between parties and countries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde, 2007</xref>: 225). Firm divergence between radical right parties was also found with respect to the role of protest and ideological voting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354068810382936">Van der Brug and Fennema, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>An even more diverse picture emerges when looking at the organizational origins of parties conventionally assembled under the label ‘radical right’. The historical roots of these parties are by all means manifold. While, for instance, ‘most green parties have similar historical background’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068810382936">Müller-Rommel, 1985</xref>: 491) in their emergence from the new social movements between the late 1970s and late 1980s, we find well-established traditional parties among the radical right, such as the SVP, FPÖ or MSI/AN, as well as much younger and extremely short-lived ‘flash parties’; for example, the LPF or the Swedish New Democracy, both of which have already ceased to exist (for full party names and abbreviations see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1354068810382936">appendix</xref>).</p>
<p>Other party families, such as the social democrats, have their roots in the major social divide between workers and owners and originated from mass movements within the European working class. The social democrats are therefore considered an ‘exceptionally homogeneous’ party family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354068810382936">Marks and Wilson, 2000</xref>: 442). Similarly, conflicts over the relationship between the state and the church turned Christian parties into ‘broad mass movements after the introduction of manhood suffrage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810382936">Lipset and Rokkan, 1967</xref>: 15). In contrast, there is hardly a uniform account of the social and organizational emergence of the radical right: Some parties, for example the Danish Progress Party or the DVU in Germany, were distinct foundations, others – most notably the FPÖ and the SVP – transformed themselves into this party type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068810382936">Helms, 1997</xref>: 39; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354068810382936">McGann and Kitschelt, 2005</xref>: 150; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068810382936">Ladner, 2001</xref>: 130). Some radical right parties originated from party splits from other radical right or even conservative parties (e.g. the DFP and the Austrian BZÖ, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354068810382936">Rydgren, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068810382936">Luther, 2007</xref>; respectively REP, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354068810382936">Betz, 1990</xref>), whereas others are the result of party mergers (e.g. VB or LN, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810382936">Ignazi, 2003</xref>: 131; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810382936">Norris, 2005</xref>: 64–5). Also, the wider ideological backgrounds of the parties in question are far from similar: The SVP, for instance, was (and in some cantons still is) a national-conservative party with an agrarian background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354068810382936">Skenderovic, 2001</xref>). The Austrian FPÖ moved ‘away from liberalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810382936">Ignazi, 2003</xref>: 107) into the radical right spectrum, thus shifting its voter base from anti-clerical and German-nationalist civil servants and professionals to young blue-collar workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354068810382936">McGann and Kitschelt, 2005</xref>). In Italy, the MSI (later AN) had its roots in the country’s fascist heritage, while the Northern League started out as a regionalist movement and only later adopted radical right-wing stances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde, 2007</xref>: 56).</p>
<p>Taking the variety of the radical rights’ organizational origins into account does not equal rejecting McGann and Kitschelt’s (1995) or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068810382936">Ignazi’s (1992)</xref> cleavage-based approaches. It suggests, however, that the impact of the new cleavage portrayed by these authors was not as uniform across countries on the right-authoritarian pole of the social conflict as it was on the left-libertarian one. It is hardly surprising that parties with strong nationalist or ‘nativist’ ideologies (see below) are more specifically shaped by their national contexts than most of their competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068810382936">Kessler and Freeman, 2005</xref>: 264–5). Therefore, it can be assumed that the radical right party family may be less homogeneous than others.</p>

<title>Transnational federations: Weak links and failed attempts at cooperation</title>
<p>Transnational links can provide a useful first indication of which parties can be regarded as belonging together. Particularly in the European context, the role of European parties and party groups in the European Parliament has been stressed as increasingly important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068810382936">Bardi, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068810382936">Mair and Mudde (1998</xref>: 216) consider one of the strong points of this approach that it ‘follows the party’s own choices’. However, while there is without doubt good value in the theoretical notion of classifying parties according to the transnational federations that they themselves choose to join, the empirical reality proves far more disturbing. Transnational federations are neither fully distinct concerning their member parties (e.g. the International Democrat Union and the Centrist Democrat International) nor stable over time.</p>
<p>Still, comparing the transnational federations across European party families, the numerous failed attempts at cooperation among the radical right clearly stand out in contrast to the relatively durable organizations that have thus far been established by other party families. While the social democrats, liberals and conservatives/Christian democrats – and eventually the Greens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354068810382936">Dietz, 2000</xref>) – created both party groups in the European Parliament and so-called Europarties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354068810382936">Ladrech, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354068810382936">2002</xref>), there are no comparable transnational organizations of radical right parties. Some authors have ascribed this to the conflicting logic inherent in the notion of a ‘Nationalist International’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde, 2007</xref>: 182).</p>
<p>The European Parliament (EP) has seen several efforts to set up radical right party cooperation, ranging from technical groups in the 1980s and early 1990s to <italic>Identity, Sovereignty and Tradition</italic>, which came into existence in early 2007 but was dissolved only 10 months later after disrespectful remarks by Andrea Mussolini of the Italian Social Alternative about Romanian immigrants in Italy had led to the abandonment of the group by the Greater Romanian Party. The current EP – also as a consequence of more restrictive formation rules – features no distinct radical right party group, as some parties (e.g. DFP, LN, AN) are members of the group <italic>Europe of Freedom and Democracy</italic> – a partial successor of the now-defunct <italic>Union for a Europe of Nations</italic>, while most radical right MEPs represented in the EP are unaffiliated.</p>
<p>Outside the EP, the radical right has been similarly unsuccessful in creating a European party. The most visible attempt to date is <italic>Euronat</italic>, a federation initiated by Jean Marie Le Pen. Still, Euronat failed to attract many of the most relevant radical right parties in Europe, and has therefore ‘led a rather shadowy existence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde, 2007</xref>: 176). In early 2010, the members of Euronat included, inter alia, the British National Party, FN, the Swedish National Democrats and MS-FT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.euronat.org">www.euronat.org</ext-link>). Several parties from Eastern Europe are or were members of Euronat, too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068810382936">Dočekalová, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068810382936">Mareš, 2009</xref>: 100). Most recently, transnational movements against muslim immigrants (e.g. <italic>Cities against Islamisation</italic>) have served as platforms of cooperation – or at least communication – between radical right parties. However, none of these attempts at coordination have reached the degree of institutionalization, comprehensiveness and stability displayed by other Europarties.</p>

<sec id="section5-1354068810382936">
<title>Defining the radical right ideology: The lack of scholarly consensus</title>
<p>There is hardly a way around ideology (and party policy as its everyday manifestation) as a criterion for the classification of parties. All serious attempts at defining or classifying parties take into account the centrality of ideology. However, the multitude of – at best partly overlapping – definitions present in the scientific literature implies that the parties of the radical right ‘can be regarded as highly diverse in their ideological appeals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810382936">Norris, 2005</xref>: 43).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068810382936">Ignazi (1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810382936">2003</xref>), for instance, suggests classification in three steps: by (1) a spatial criterion, that is, placement on the far right, (2) anti-system stances, and (3) a reference to fascist ideology. While the first two criteria are understood as necessary features of what Ignazi terms ‘extreme right’ parties, the latter serves as an indicator for distinguishing ‘old’ from ‘new’ right-wing extremism. The limitations of this definition clearly lie in its exclusiveness: If the anti-system criterion is applied too rigidly, some parties that are commonly perceived to be among the ‘usual suspects’ may be left out.</p>
<p>More recently, Ignazi’s classification scheme has been modified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354068810382936">Carter (2005)</xref>, who defines ‘right-wing extremism’ (Carter’s terminology) as encompassing a rejection of (1) democratic principles and norms, and (2) human equality. While arguably improving on Ignazi’s spatial criterion by specifying right-wing as rejecting human equality, the anti-system criterion appears even more uncompromising now.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068810382936">Betz (1998</xref>, 3; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354068810382936">1994</xref>), on the contrary, argues that ‘what unites these parties and movements is programmatic radicalism and populist appeal’. While the first feature seems to be compatible with Ignazi’s anti-system criterion, the notion of populism hinders reconciliation between the two approaches. However, in synthesizing the reasoning of Ignazi and Betz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354068810382936">Taggart (1995)</xref> considers a party’s location on the right, its anti-systemness <italic>and</italic> populism central to the conceptualization of the radical right party family.</p>
<p>One of the most technical and pragmatic approaches is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810382936">Norris’s (2005)</xref> method of relying on two 11-point scales (left–right and immigration) drawn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068810382936">Lubbers’s (2000)</xref> expert survey. All parties averaging above 8 on these scales are considered right-wing radical. Thus, Norris combines a spatial and a policy-related criterion while omitting the anti-system criterion.</p>
<p>Introducing another concept, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068810382936">Eatwell (2000</xref>: 412) suggests that ‘the extreme right family of parties have a common core doctrine […]. This is nationalism’. Yet, while it is true that radical right-wing parties tend to exhibit nationalist attitudes, this is neither a defining feature (considering regionalist parties such as the Northern League) nor one that necessarily distinguishes these parties from others on the centre–right. In response to the latter problem, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde (2007</xref>: 19) has recently made a case for the term <italic>nativism</italic> as an alternative to nationalism. In a nutshell, nativism argues for a homogeneous nation-state inhabited only by members of the nation.</p>
<p>In what may be the most well-founded attempt at defining the radical right (populist) ideology to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde, 2007</xref>: 15–31), he complements this core concept with those of authoritarianism (‘the belief in a strictly ordered society’) and populism (an ideology of ‘“the pure people” versus “the corrupt elite”’). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde (2007</xref>: 24) also offers a meaningful distinction between the terms ‘extremist’ and ‘radical’, of which the former is a specification of the latter: the extreme right encompasses all features of the radical right plus anti-democratic features as a defining element.</p>
<p>Certainly, the ideologies of other party families are far from uniform. Liberal parties, for instance, have been split between conservative liberalism and radicalism since the nineteenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354068810382936">von Beyme, 1985</xref>), with agrarian parties possibly constituting a third distinct group within the liberal family. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068810382936">Smith (1988</xref>: 16) holds, ‘the major families – conservative, Christian democrats, social democrats, and communist – all have a greater ideological coherence’ than the liberals (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354068810382936">Marks and Wilson, 2000</xref>: 448). We can therefore expect to find these divisions reflected in the empirical analysis.</p>
<p>In recent days, the ideological coherence of party families has been studied as a consequence of <italic>Europeanization</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354068810382936">Ladrech, 2002</xref>). Evidence has been found, inter alia, for the ideological convergence of regionalist parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068810382936">De Winter and Gomez-Reino Cachafeiro, 2002</xref>), green parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068810382936">Bomberg, 2002</xref>) and Christian democrats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354068810382936">Hanley, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>From the manifold accounts of defining the ideology of the radical right, it can be hypothesized that the difficulties of conceptualizing the radical right party family stem from a lack of programmatic homogeneity among these parties. Hence, different definitions result in different sets of parties being chosen as the objects of analysis. While there is a set of largely undisputed cases (e.g. FN, VB, FPÖ), there is a fair number of borderline cases that are included in the party family by some authors but left out by others (e.g. LN, AN, SVP, LPF; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde, 2007</xref>: 55–8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1354068810382936">
<title>Party name: The difficulty of labelling the radical right</title>
<p>Names and labels are either endogenous (self-given) or exogenous (applied to the respective object by others). I argue here that for no party family is there (1) less (scholarly) consensus as to the exogenous labelling, and (2) greater discordance between exogenous and endogenous labels, than for the radical right.</p>
<p>The absence of an agreed-upon label is an implication of the academic dissent concerning the very nature of these parties. In other words, it is hardly possible to agree upon a label when there is no definition of the objects to be classified under that label. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810382936">Norris (2005</xref>: 43) even argues that – in contrast to parties on the left – it can be doubted whether there is a ‘single phenomenon’ called the radical right at all.</p>
<p>Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde (2007</xref>: 11–12) lists an astonishing 23 different names that have been given to what here is termed the party family of the radical right. Whereas this terminological plethora may not seem to be a problem of substance, it reflects that the parties themselves generally object to the exogenous labels applied to them – although, for instance, the term ‘populist’ was approved by some radical right leaders. In contrast, names such as ‘liberal’, ‘Christian democratic’ or ‘conservative’ would hardly be rejected by the parties considered to belong to the respective party families.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the problem is not only one of finding a name for the party family. The radical right’s anti-partyism – while being, in fact, more directed at their established competitors than the institution of the party as such (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068810382936">Mudde, 1996</xref>) – leads to an avoidance of the label ‘party’. Instead, radical right parties refer to themselves as ‘front’, ‘movement’, ‘league’, ‘alliance’, ‘bloc’, ‘union’ or simply ‘list’. Admittedly, such cases can be detected among conservative and liberal parties, too. Also, anti-party sentiment is not unfamiliar among the Greens. Yet, when added to the academic disagreement about a proper party family name and the broad rejection of such exogenously applied labels, it can be concluded that the radical right is the party family hardest to assemble under a common name. Even if this is more a consequence than a cause of internal heterogeneity, it adds to the general argument that the radical right party family can be assumed to be less homogeneous than other party families – a conjecture to be tested in the remainder of this article.</p>

<title>Choosing parties and party families</title>
<p>The initial task now is to select parties of the radical right. To that end, I rely on the taxonomic accounts provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354068810382936">Carter (2005</xref>: 30) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde (2007</xref>: 305–8), and complement the resulting set of parties based on consultation of other cross-national studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810382936">Ignazi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810382936">Norris, 2005</xref>). From these sources, all parties that are included in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068810382936">Benoit and Laver’s (2006)</xref> expert survey are selected. The cases not covered by Benoit and Laver are mostly marginal extremist groups or flash parties of limited relevance, and of course parties that originated after the expert survey was conducted (2002–2003).</p>
<p>The chosen set of 16 parties consists of groups whose radical right-wing character is largely undisputed (FPÖ, FNB, VB, DFP, FN, REP, DVU, NPD, MS-FT, SD), and other parties (FPn, FPd, AN, LN, LPF, SVP) that may represent borderline cases and therefore deserve more in-depth discussion.</p>
<p>The Scandinavian Progress Parties and LPF are sometimes considered ‘neoliberal populists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde, 2007</xref>: 47), whereby their radical nature is doubted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354068810382936">Rydgren (2004</xref>: 474), for instance, considers the FPd a ‘tax-populist, anti-bureaucracy, protest party’. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810382936">Ignazi (2003</xref>: 150) finds that the FPd should be considered a radical right-wing party due to ‘its anti-partyism, and political cynicism, its irresponsible opposition and politics of over-promising, its latent xenophobia and advocacy of more authoritarian and repressive norms’.</p>
<p>Its Norwegian equivalent is, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810382936">Ignazi (2003</xref>: 157), ‘at the fringe of the extreme right political family’. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068810382936">Eatwell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068810382936">Ivarsflaten, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810382936">Norris, 2005</xref>) consider it a member of the radical right party family while others do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As to the classification of the LPF, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068810382936">Pennings and Keman (2003</xref>: 62) argue that ‘the ideas of Fortuyn [...] are quite compatible with the mainstream conservatism in Europe and by and large different from the “new” right-wing parties across Europe’. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354068810382936">Pellikaan et al. (2007</xref>: 292) hold that, with his anti-multiculturalist stance, ‘Fortuyn was associated with extreme right parties that also campaign on cultural issues and advocate for a monocultural society’, albeit that the LPF exhibited a more liberal perspective on civil liberties. Thus, the LPF assumed the position of a ‘functional equivalent to the classical RRP [Radical Right Populist] parties’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068810382936">Rydgren and van Holsteyn, 2005</xref>: 42).</p>
<p>The case of the Swiss People’s Party (SVP) is similarly controversial, mostly because of the party’s long-lived tradition as a core component of the Swiss party system. Yet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354068810382936">McGann and Kitschelt (2005</xref>: 150) find ‘that the SVP has evolved into a party that fits the new radical-right concept well’. Likewise, other sources suggest a gradual shift of the SVP towards positions of the radical right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde, 2007</xref>: 58). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068810382936">Ladner (2001</xref>: 130) explains the party’s success with a ‘profound transformation [...] because of the shrinking of its traditional membership base’. The notion that the SVP – with regional variation – transformed itself from a conservative–agrarian party into a radical right-wing group is further supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068810382936">Marquis and Sciarini (1999</xref>: 460), who find that, on a variety of issues, ‘the Swiss People’s Party has drifted towards the radical right in the 1980s and 1990s’.</p>
<p>Also, the two Italian cases (LN and AN) have changed their ideological profile over the past decades. Some scholars have applied the term ‘regionalist populism’ to the Northern League (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810382936">Ignazi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068810382936">McDonnell, 2006</xref>) due to its separatist ambitions. Yet, the 1990s saw a radicalization of the League’s ideology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810382936">Mudde (2007</xref>: 56) therefore concludes that LN ‘is too similar to be excluded from the [radical right] party family’. Quite to the contrary, the National Alliance – the successor of the post-fascist Italian Social Movement – has, in recent years, moved toward a more moderate position and is therefore considered ‘no longer a neofascist, extreme right or populist radical-right party’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068810382936">Tarchi (2003</xref>: 135). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810382936">Ignazi (2003</xref>: 52) concludes that ‘the AN is on the fringe of the contemporary extreme right, on the threshold of its exit’.</p>
<p>Despite the concerns that have been raised by numerous scholars regarding the classification of these borderline cases, all parties discussed above will be included in the analysis. The crucial argument here is that it is exactly these ambiguous cases that are of interest for this study. Omitting the parties ‘on the fringe’ of the radical right party family would very likely lead to a selection bias resulting in greater observed homogeneity and hence a considerably less conclusive analysis.</p>
<p>The radical right parties will be compared to four other party families: Greens, social democrats, liberals and conservatives/Christian democrats. From these groups, all parties in the 17 West European democracies (former EU-15 plus Norway and Switzerland) are selected. Most of these parties are easily identified as belonging to a certain party family, most notably the Greens and social democrats. However, on the right, there are some ambiguities: Fianna Fáil, for instance, is sometimes included in the liberal party family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068810382936">Hix, 1998</xref>) but more often considered a conservative party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068810382936">De Winter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354068810382936">Marks and Wilson, 2000</xref>) – a choice I concur with. Also, the (former) agrarian parties of Scandinavia included in the liberal family here are sometimes considered a separate party family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354068810382936">von Beyme, 1985</xref>). Again, the argument for inclusion is not to bias the case selection towards a more homogeneous sample. The same goes for the small evangelical parties found in the Nordic countries, Switzerland and The Netherlands. While these groups are typically much younger – and more orthodox – than the established Christian democrats in Central Europe, their religious agenda and transnational affiliations suggest that they are members of the conservative/Christian democrat party family. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354068810382936">Table 1</xref> summarizes the 94 selected parties.</p>

<title>Implications of using expert survey data</title>
<p>No means of estimating the policy positions of parties is perfect and expert surveys clearly have their limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354068810382936">Budge, 2002</xref>). For the purpose of this article, the most relevant reservation about expert survey data is that they produce an overly systematic assessment of the party space: ‘What expert surveys of a population of country specialists do […], is to summarize their accumulated knowledge in a systematic way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068810382936">Benoit and Laver, 2006</xref>: 75). While systematically structured knowledge about party positions is without doubt a valuable good, there are severe implications for the present research task. Since experts tend to view the political world in an organized manner, they may be skewed to exhibiting an overly coherent and homogeneous perception of the party space. The homogeneity of party families possibly observed in expert surveys may then not be much more than a result of the systematic perspective that is typical of the view of political scientists. Admittedly, this argument points to a limitation of the expert survey approach that is particularly relevant for the present purpose. However, it appears safe to assume that the 690 country experts consulted to obtain the policy positions of the 94 parties in this study hardly share a streamlined set of characteristics by which to evaluate the policy positions of national parties. Still, the criticism of a systematization bias cannot be fully dismissed.</p>

<title>Parties’ positions on six policy dimensions</title>
<p>The data used here are taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068810382936">Benoit and Laver’s (2006)</xref> expert survey. They determined a priori the most salient policy dimensions in each country (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068810382936">Benoit and Laver, 2006</xref>: 83–7). For the present purpose, however, only those policy dimensions can be considered that have been covered in all 17 countries relevant for this study. Country experts (usually academics or other researchers) were asked to locate each party on each policy dimension represented by a scale running from 1 to 20. The exact wordings of the six scales are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810382936">Table 2</xref>
. While data on five policy dimensions are available for each case, the EU authority-item was not surveyed in all countries. Other EU-related scales were therefore used in the cases of France, Ireland and Norway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068810382936">Benoit and Laver, 2006</xref>: 119).</p>

<p>The radical right is comparatively homogeneous on the immigration, the EU authority and the environment dimensions, but rather diverse when it comes to economic and decentralization policies. The fact that, on the latter dimension, the radical right party family is clearly more heterogeneous than all other party families is hardly surprising given that there are nationalist as well as ethno-regionalist parties included in this party family. Still, the radical right parties score lower standard deviations than both, liberals and conservatives/Christian democrats, on no less than three dimensions. When averaging standard deviations across policy dimensions, the radical right parties turn out to be about as heterogeneous as the centre–right parties, but substantially more homogeneous than the liberals. However, party families on the left (Greens and social democrats) are generally much more uniform than those on the right.</p>
<p>A different way of looking at policy homogeneity within party families is to conceive of each party as being located in a six-dimensional policy space defined by the expert survey scales. The larger the average distance between each pair of parties within a family, the greater the heterogeneity. However, there are several methods of calculating distances in a space with more than one dimension. In order not to bias the results by arbitrarily choosing one type of measure, four of the most common distance metrics are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1354068810382936">Table 4</xref>

<p>The figures confirm the results yielded from the standard deviations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1354068810382936">Table 3</xref>. On the left, we find very homogeneous party families as compared to the right, with the social democrats being the most homogeneous by three out of four applied measures. The radical right parties are, again, comparable in their degree of homogeneity to the conservatives and Christian democrats, but less heterogeneous than the liberal family which comes out as the most diverse according to all four metrics. Interestingly, the variations between the metrics yield insight into the homogeneity structure of the party families. All measures except for the city block metric rank party families identically from the most to the least homogeneous: S-G-C-R-L. The city block metric yields a different ordering: G-S-R-C-L. Since this metric is less sensitive to outliers within a group, we can assume that the heterogeneity within the social democrats and conservatives/Christian democrats is due to general variation among the parties, whereas heterogeneity in the green and radical right party families stems from a number of outliers. Looking at the raw data this is confirmed when considering, for instance, the Swedish Greens’ anti-EU stance (17.5) vis-à-vis the other green parties’ moderately pro-European position (7.9). Likewise, there are obvious outliers in the radical right party family on social policy (LPF: 8.8) and on European Integration (FPn: 10.0). We can therefore conclude that there is a clear distinction between left-wing and right-wing party families in that the former are more homogeneous than the latter. Additionally, the younger party families (greens, radical right) exhibit a different – more asymmetric – type of heterogeneity.</p>

<title>Cluster analysis: grouping parties</title>
<p>In what follows, groups of similar parties are identified by means of a cluster analysis. From a comparison of the resulting sets of clusters with the a priori case selection, the homogeneity of party families can be assessed. In order to put more weight on larger divergences between parties, the clustering procedure applied here employs squared Euclidean distances as a distance metric. Using the Ward algorithm, parties are then aggregated into clusters (for a demonstration of the Ward algorithm’s superiority over other aggregation methods, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810382936">Blashfield (1976)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068810382936">Mojena (1977)</xref>). The dendrogram resulting from this procedure is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810382936">Figure 1</xref>
. It should be noted that the applied routine (R’s <italic>hclust</italic>) places more homogeneous clusters at the top of the dendrogram.</p>

</fig>
<p>The most basic interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810382936">Figure 1</xref> is that there are two broad categories of parties, basically conforming to a left–right division. The top half of the tree structure comprises the vast majority of left-wing parties (G, S), while the bottom half contains most right-wing parties (C, R). The liberals are split between these two groups. We find that social liberal parties such as the Danish <italic>Radikale Venstre</italic>, the Dutch <italic>Democraten 66</italic> or the Italian <italic>Lista Pannella</italic> end up in a subgroup that is largely dominated by social democratic parties. On the other hand, most conservative liberals (e.g. the German FDP or the <italic>Progressive Democrats</italic> of Ireland) are merged together with conservatives and Christian democrats. Thus, the anticipated divide between radical and conservative liberalism becomes visible in the dendrogram and can be taken as an indicator of a substantial amount of heterogeneity within the liberal party family.</p>
<p>Leaving the liberals aside for a moment, only two parties end up on the ‘wrong’ side of the left–right division apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810382936">Figure 1</xref>: The Flemish Christian democrats display rather moderate views when it comes to economic issues and immigration and hence join the upper half of the tree. The Swedish Greens end up in a subgroup of the right-wing ‘branch’, mostly due to their fierce anti-EU stance. Nearby we find a group of liberal and centre parties from the Nordic countries and a section of Protestant Christian democratic parties.</p>
<p>In order to assess the homogeneity of the radical right party family in comparison to other party families, we have to look at the subgroups of the basic left–right clustering pattern. It turns out that all radical right-wing parties except one are allocated into the upper branch of the ‘right-wing’ cluster. Only the Norwegian <italic>Fremskrittspartiet</italic> ends up in a lower branch, together with mostly secular conservative parties. Thus, the radical right form a distinct sub-cluster of the lower branch of the tree structure. The placement of this sub-cluster above the remaining centre–right parties signals that the radical right represents, in fact, a more homogeneous group than the centre–right (this holds up even when removing the liberal party family from the analysis).</p>
<p>However, the unforeseen company of five conservative parties finishing up in the radical right sub-cluster has to be taken into account. The Swiss EDU, the British Tories and three conservative parties from Southern Europe (FI, PP and PSD) display a more right-wing stance than the conservative/Christian democratic average on practically all issues. Yet, most notably, these parties are strongly Eurosceptic, while exhibiting firm anti-immigration stances and socially conservative policies – hence their inclusion within the same sub-cluster as the radical right. While it can therefore be held that the boundaries between the radical right and some conservative parties appear difficult to delineate, it is the heterogeneity of the latter rather than that of the former group that leads to this outcome.</p>
<p>When looking at the sub-clusters on the ‘left’ side of the tree structure, it becomes evident that the green parties form a very homogeneous and distinct group, whereas the social democrats – while mostly ending up in the same sub-branch – find amid themselves a number of strange bedfellows from the (social) liberal party family. Only the Swiss social democrats (who are in the ‘green’ sub-cluster) and the aforementioned Flemish Christian democrats deviate from this pattern.</p>
<p>The most conclusive way to look at the dendrogram is to divide both, the ‘left’ and the ‘right’ cluster, into two sub-clusters each. In so doing, we obtain a green cluster at the top followed by a social democratic/social liberal cluster in the upper half of the tree, and a radical-right cluster (with some conservative ‘flavour’) followed by a cluster of conservative-liberal and conservative/Christian democratic parties. The clustering heights displayed by the vertical lines in the dendrogram indicate, however, that these four sub-clusters are of very different homogeneity: the green parties, for instance, merge at a height of 237, the social democrats/social liberals at 442, the radical right at 610 and the liberals/conservatives/Christian democrats at 2026. The last-mentioned sub-cluster is even more heterogeneous than all parties in the top half of the dendrogram (clustering height: 1452). Hence, the cluster analysis corroborates the previous findings of greater homogeneity on the left of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the liberals constitute the most heterogeneous party family in this study. While conservative (and agrarian) liberals are most similar to conservative/Christian democratic parties on the right, the social liberals team up with the left. Given this diversity, it is surprising that the boundaries between liberals and the radical right seem to be drawn very clearly. Yet, this is because even conservative liberal parties are moderate when it comes to immigration and social issues.</p>
<p>The conservative/Christian democratic parties are a rather heterogeneous group as well, albeit that – with a single exception – all of these parties were located on the right wing. It is especially remarkable that the boundaries of this party family are blurred on the liberal <italic>and</italic> the radical right edge. For the purpose of this article, it is most interesting that five centre–right parties were classified with the radical right in the cluster analysis. Combining rigid social conservatism with pro-market policies, the Spanish and Portuguese conservatives neighbour the National Fronts of Belgium and France in the dendrogram. The Swiss EDU’s more moderate economic position and clear pro-decentralization stance put it in a subgroup with parties like the SVP or the FPÖ. Finally, <italic>Forza Italia</italic> and the British conservatives display more moderate social but strong pro-market policies and hence join a sub-cluster with FPd and LPF – parties that are borderline cases within the radical right.</p>
<p>The radical right party family ends up neatly in one sub-cluster – except for the relatively pro-European Norwegian Progress Party. Contrary to the assumptions made in the theoretical part of this article, the policy profile of the radical right parties not only distinguishes them clearly from other party families but also characterizes them as a party family of noticeable homogeneity. Examining the diversity within the radical right, some interesting subgroups can be identified in the dendrogram. At the top, we find a group containing, inter alia, those parties that display references to fascist heritage (AN, MS-FT, DVU, NPD) – most clearly distinguished by very moderate economic policies. Next, a group of modern populist radical right prototypes can be found, including some of the most successful radical right parties, like the FPÖ, SVP, LN and VB. In contrast to their peers, these parties are strong advocates of decentralization. Finally, in overlap with the centre–right, two subgroups of socially conservative and socially moderate parties emerge. In those subgroups, the boundaries to the conservatives and Christian democrats are most difficult to delineate.</p>
<p>As expected, the social democratic parties form a very homogeneous party family with only one outlier. The Swiss social democrats who score highest among social democrats on decentralization and lowest on all other scales are put into the green cluster. The dendrogram shows a split between more moderate and more left-wing social democratic parties (most of which actually call themselves ‘socialist’). Interestingly, it is the latter group that intermingles with the social liberal parties. Comparing social democrats with the radical right, the distinctiveness between two party families is astounding, given the strong electoral competition between the two party families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068810382936">Bale et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the green parties constitute the most homogeneous party family according to the cluster analysis. With the exception of the Eurosceptic <italic>Miljöpartiet</italic>, all parties are joined together by the clustering algorithm, with one outlier from another party family – the Swiss social democrats – included. While the Greens are the party family most different from the radical right, there seems to be an interesting reciprocal relationship: In countries where there is a significant radical right party with a strong decentralization agenda (e.g. Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, Austria), green parties seem to have moderated their respective policies. Likewise, the most Eurosceptic Greens are found in countries lacking a relevant radical right party (Sweden, Portugal).</p>
<p>Summarizing the cluster analysis it can be held that party families on the left are more homogeneous than those on the right, with the liberal party family displaying the highest level of internal diversity. The radical right constitutes a subgroup of the right with a degree of heterogeneity similar to, if not lower than, that of the conservative/Christian democratic party family.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1354068810382936">Table 5</xref>
 presents an overview of the allocation of parties into two (left – right) respectively four (green – social democratic/social liberal – radical right – conservative/liberal/Christian democratic) clusters. With only 9 out of 94 parties (9.6 percent) allocated incorrectly, it can be argued that the classification of parties according to expert survey data is not only a parsimonious but also a reasonably valid approach.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>It was argued at the outset of this article that the radical right should be more heterogeneous than other party families in Western Europe. However, the analysis above shows that this is only the case when comparing the radical right to party families on the left. Liberal parties are clearly a more diverse group than the radical right, and the conservative/Christian democratic party family displays a degree of heterogeneity similar to that of the radical right. An in-depth discussion of possible explanations for these counter-intuitive findings is beyond the scope of this article. Still, some considerations can be put forward.</p>
<p>First, despite diverse social and organizational origins, radical right parties appear to have adopted a distinct and specific policy profile with a clear focus on anti-immigration views. Indeed, removing the immigration issue from the analysis leads to notably greater heterogeneity within the radical right. This finding is in line with demand-oriented accounts that have stressed the importance of immigration in explaining radical right success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068810382936">Ivarsflaten, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the radical right appear homogeneous exactly because other party families on the centre–right are so diverse. The vast scholarly attention paid to the difficulties in defining and classifying radical right parties possibly distracts from the fact that these problems exist for other party families, too. Based on the analysis conducted here it could be especially rewarding to ask to what extent there is a common ideological core in the liberal party family.</p>
<p>Third, the lack of stable transnational links among the radical right is presumably less attributable to conflict over policy than to strategic incentives hindering cooperation: Given the threat of ostracism encountered by many radical right parties, it is rational for them to try to avoid being closely related to other ‘pariah’ parties in order to preclude accusations of extremism in their domestic political arena.</p>
