<abstract>
<p>This article examines the influence on organizational outcomes of CEOs’ political ideology, specifically political conservatism vs. liberalism. We propose that CEOs’ political ideologies will influence their firms’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices, hypothesizing that (1) liberal CEOs will emphasize CSR more than will conservative CEOs; (2) the association between a CEO’s political ideology and CSR will be amplified by a CEO’s relative power; and (3) liberal CEOs will emphasize CSR even when recent financial performance is low, whereas conservative CEOs will pursue CSR initiatives only as performance allows. We test our ideas with a sample of 249 CEOs, measuring their ideologies by coding their political donations over the ten years prior to their becoming CEOs. Results indicate that the political ideologies of CEOs are manifested in their firms’ CSR profiles. Compared with conservative CEOs, liberal CEOs exhibit greater advances in CSR; the influence of CEOs’ political liberalism on CSR is amplified when they have more power; and liberal CEOs’ CSR initiatives are less contingent on recent performance than are those of conservative CEOs. In a corroborative exploration, we find that CEOs’ political ideologies are significantly related to their corporate political action committee (PAC) allocations, indicating that this largely unexplored executive attribute might be more widely consequential.</p>

<p>To what extent do chief executive officers (CEOs) of publicly traded firms inject their personal values into their decisions? This question is of great practical significance, as it brings into focus—for corporate boards and overall society—the potential importance of executives’ preferences in shaping the actions and outcomes of our large economic enterprises. Additionally, this question helps to frame some incompatibilities, or at least tensions, between major theoretical frameworks. Under the logic of neoclassical economics, for example, firms act on the basis of contextual conditions (e.g., markets, competition, technologies), with managers playing little or no role (as summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0001839213486984">Teece and Winter, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001839213486984">Augier and Teece, 2009</xref>). Similarly, according to new institutional theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001839213486984">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983</xref>) and some renditions of population ecology theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0001839213486984">Hannan and Freeman, 1977</xref>), managers are so constrained by isomorphic and inertial forces as to have only a minor influence over organizational outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0001839213486984">Lieberson and O’Connor, 1972</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, agency theory is centered on a two-part premise: managers <italic>can</italic> significantly inject their personal preferences into corporate policies; the challenge for owners is to prevent this from occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0001839213486984">Jensen and Meckling, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0001839213486984">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>). According to the theory, managers are inclined toward some common, essentially universal tendencies—including empire-building, nest-feathering, risk-aversion, and shirking—which serve their own but not owners’ interests. Owners can ameliorate this “agency problem” by installing appropriate monitoring and incentive schemes. Any heterogeneity observed in company practices or performance can thus be traced to differences in governance arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0001839213486984">Rediker and Seth, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet another perspective, often set forth under the rubric of upper echelons theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0001839213486984">Hambrick and Mason, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0001839213486984">Hambrick, 2007</xref>), similarly allows for substantial executive influence but proposes that executives vary in the personal orientations they bring to their decisions. According to the theory, strategic decision making is not so much a technical endeavor as an interpretive one, and executives perceive their situations and alternatives through highly personalized lenses, which are formed by their experiences, personalities, and values. In turn, these individualized construals shape executives’ choices. In contrast to agency theory, then, upper echelons theory posits that heterogeneity in companies’ actions or outcomes is due to differences among company leaders.</p>
<p>Among the many empirical tests of upper echelons theory (summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0001839213486984">Finkelstein, Hambrick, and Cannella, 2009</xref>), the vast majority have examined the effects of CEOs’ experiences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0001839213486984">Miller and Shamsie, 2001</xref>); a few have explored the effects of CEOs’ personalities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0001839213486984">Peterson et al., 2003</xref>); and even fewer have considered the role of CEOs’ values in decision making (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001839213486984">Agle, Mitchell, and Sonnenfeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0001839213486984">Simsek et al., 2005</xref>). On the one hand, the paucity of attention to executives’ values is striking, given that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0001839213486984">Hambrick and Mason’s (1984)</xref> original presentation of upper echelons theory clearly emphasized the role of values; moreover, earlier treatises on executive leadership prominently proposed that values enter into managerial actions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001839213486984">Barnard, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0001839213486984">Selznick, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001839213486984">Andrews, 1971</xref>). But perhaps the limited empirical attention to executives’ values can be understood if we consider this point expressed by economists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0001839213486984">Brickley, Smith, and Zimmerman (1997</xref>: 27): “The usefulness of focusing on personal preferences is often limited. Preferences are generally not observable, and virtually anything can be explained as a matter of tastes.” Namely, from a scholarly standpoint, certain challenges arise: a potentially limitless array of tastes, or preferences, could be considered, and it is exceedingly difficult to develop a priori gauges of executives’ personal tastes. Executives’ values might indeed influence corporate actions, but theory and research in support of this premise will be stymied until—and unless—some robust, centrally important values dimensions can be identified and valid ex ante measures of such constructs can be developed, which we do in this paper.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that there has been very little research on executives’ values is not a reason, in and of itself, to undertake such inquiry. Instead, there are more fundamental reasons. First, executives of public companies are supposed to do what owners prefer, not what they themselves prefer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0001839213486984">Jensen and Meckling, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0001839213486984">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0001839213486984">Waldman and Siegel, 2008</xref>). To the extent that CEOs’ values, defined as “a broad tendency to prefer certain states of affairs over others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0001839213486984">Hofstede, 1980</xref>: 19), steer them toward actions that their companies’ owners would not have taken, an agency misalignment exists. Moreover, to the extent that CEOs’ values vary, the potential for (mis-)alignment between owner and managers is far more complex than typically envisioned by agency theorists. Second, compared with the other types of executives’ attributes examined by upper echelons researchers, particularly executives’ experiences and personalities, values are often not readily observable in the hiring process for CEOs. Even if values were transparent, there is little evidence that CEOs are selected because of their personal values. Thus CEOs’ values can give rise to unexpected, or at least unplanned initiatives. Third, values are likely to enter into executives’ actions both consciously and subconsciously, through declared and undeclared intentions and “creep” or “seep” into their organizations’ profiles, without fanfare or even much on-going awareness by observers.</p>
<p>Values can be expected to enter into executives’ choices through two conduits. Even though we are not able to empirically observe these two mechanisms, it is useful to explicate them, as presented in an article on executive values by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0001839213486984">England (1967)</xref> and as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0001839213486984">Finkelstein, Hambrick, and Cannella (2009)</xref>. First, an executive’s values may have a direct influence on his or her choices. After weighing available alternatives, facts, probabilities, and eventualities, the executive selects a course of action that suits his or her values. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0001839213486984">England (1967)</xref> referred to this direct influence of values on action as “behavior channeling.” This is the process that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001839213486984">Andrews (1971)</xref> described in one of the chapters of his treatise on strategy, “The Company and Its Strategists: Relating Economic Strategy and Personal Values.”</p>
<p>The second mechanism, which we envision as far more prevalent, occurs when values affect choices indirectly, through “perceptual filtering” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0001839213486984">England, 1967</xref>). Under this process, the executive selectively searches for information that suits his or her values and then perceives and interprets information in a values-congruent way. Through the interpretive process that psychologists refer to as “motivated cognition” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0001839213486984">Higgins and Molden, 2003</xref>, for a review), executives see what they want to see and hear what they want to hear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0001839213486984">Weick, 1979</xref>). Just as motivated cognition causes long-tenured executives to see great instrumental merit in the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0001839213486984">Hambrick, Geletkanycz, and Fredrickson, 1993</xref>), so too will CEOs’ values shape their assessments of the potential efficacy of various corporate actions, including CSR initiatives.</p>
<p>We do not presume that CEOs make all decisions single-handedly. Although CEOs may develop some initiatives on their own, they more typically react to others’ proposals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001839213486984">Bower, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0001839213486984">Burgelman, 1983</xref>). CEOs influence others by establishing the context in which they develop or endorse others’ proposals. They create this context through hiring, promotion, and firing of others; their communications with others; the incentives they put in place; and other administrative arrangements they adopt. CEOs’ values will enter into these initiatives as well, thus influencing organizational policies in multiple ways, well beyond executives’ direct decisions.</p>
<p>We propose that executives’ political ideologies, specifically their stance on the conservatism-liberalism dimension, will enter into their managerial actions. Values theorists have concluded that the conservatism-liberalism dimension is among the most centrally important constructs for considering individuals’ core beliefs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0001839213486984">Feather, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0001839213486984">Schwartz, 1996</xref>). Moreover, evidence from political psychologists suggests that business elites, including senior executives, vary in their political philosophies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0001839213486984">Tetlock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001839213486984">Francia et al., 2005</xref>), and that these ideologies constitute a central part of some executives’ personal convictions and identities. Thus CEOs’ political ideologies would seem to be broadly consequential.</p>
<p>As an initial demonstration of the significance of CEOs’ political ideology, we develop and test the idea that CEOs’ personal values, as borne in their political conservatism vs. liberalism, will influence their firms’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. The concept of CSR is central in the important debate about the purpose of business organizations, particularly about the primacy of shareholders versus other stakeholders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001839213486984">Bowen, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0001839213486984">Friedman, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0001839213486984">Margolis and Walsh, 2003</xref>). If we can demonstrate that CEOs’ political ideologies influence their companies’ approaches to CSR, we will have contributed to comprehension of a critical business phenomenon. Even though researchers have considered various determinants of CSR, this is a domain in which enhanced understanding carries high stakes, both for organizations and for society, because companies vary widely in their CSR profiles. To test our ideas, we develop a donation-based index to measure the political ideologies of 249 CEOs of major U.S. companies. We examine the association between this measure of CEO ideology and the firm’s CSR during each CEO’s tenure.</p>

<title>The Influence of CEOs’ Political Ideology on CSR</title>
<p>Although executives operate under constraints (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0001839213486984">Lieberson and O’Connor, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0001839213486984">Hannan and Freeman, 1977</xref>), they often have considerable discretion in their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0001839213486984">Hambrick and Finkelstein, 1987</xref>). Building on the concept of bounded rationality (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0001839213486984">Cyert and March, 1963</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0001839213486984">Hambrick and Mason (1984)</xref> set forth their upper echelons perspective, proposing that executives make choices through highly individualized lenses that are formed by the managers’ experiences, personalities, and values. Especially in decision domains that are complex and have considerable ambiguity about means and ends, which typifies many strategic choices, organizational outcomes thus become reflections of executives themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0001839213486984">Mischel, 1977</xref>). Executives’ values, including their political ideologies, can therefore be expected to shape organizational outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section2-0001839213486984">
<title>Political Ideologies as Values: The Conservatism-Liberalism Dimension</title>
<p>The political science and political psychology literatures provide substantial support for the premise that executives’ political ideologies reflect their values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0001839213486984">Rosenberg, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0001839213486984">Layman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0001839213486984">Barnea and Schwartz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0001839213486984">Goren, Federico, and Kittilson, 2009</xref>). In fact, political ideology is sometimes defined in terms of values: “the term ‘political ideology’ is normally defined as an interrelated set of attitudes and values about the proper goals of society and how they should be achieved . . .” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0001839213486984">Tedin, 1987</xref>: 65). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0001839213486984">Jost (2006</xref>: 653) noted, “. . . ideology helps to explain why people do what they do; it organizes their values and beliefs.”</p>
<p>Researchers have long been interested in the relationship between values and political ideology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0001839213486984">Rosenberg (1956)</xref> initially demonstrated the association between individuals’ values and their political ideologies. Decades later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0001839213486984">Layman (1997)</xref> showed that individuals’ values are reflected in their political behaviors, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0001839213486984">Barnea and Schwartz (1998)</xref> found strong support for the relationship between individuals’ values and their political views. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0001839213486984">Feldman (2003</xref>: 477) noted the “substantial amount of evidence . . . that values are a major source of structure for political attitudes.” Thus it seems clear that individuals’ values are manifested in their political ideologies.</p>
<p>The question is how political ideology should be characterized. Among a large set of possible political spectrums (e.g., egalitarianism, communism, fascism, classical liberalism, left-ism, right-ism, communitarianism, and others) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0001839213486984">Slomp, 2000</xref>), the liberal-conservative spectrum has been identified as especially important for understanding individuals’ central values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0001839213486984">Poole and Rosenthal, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0001839213486984">Schwartz, 1996</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0001839213486984">Jost (2006</xref>: 654), the left-right or liberal-conservative distinction “has been the single most useful and parsimonious way to classify political attitudes for more than 200 years.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0001839213486984">Schwartz (1996)</xref>, a prominent values scholar, also noted that the liberal-conservative spectrum is one of the most meaningful for understanding individuals’ core beliefs. Based on his extensive research, he argued that classical liberalism is concerned with civil rights and that people who are more liberal in political ideology are likely to be sensitive to social issues in general and to such specific issues as diversity, social change, human rights, and the environment. Jost and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0001839213486984">Jost et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0001839213486984">Jost, 2006</xref>) similarly have characterized liberals as those who seek to advance social justice, economic equality, planned social change, and controls over markets. Conservatives, by contrast, value individualism, property rights, and free markets, and they believe that resources should flow to their most effective and efficient users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0001839213486984">Murtha and Lenway, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0001839213486984">Roe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0001839213486984">Detomasi, 2008</xref>). Conservatives also place more emphasis on order, stability, respect for authority, the status quo, and business needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0001839213486984">McClosky and Zaller, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0001839213486984">Erikson, Luttbeg, and Tedin, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0001839213486984">Jost et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In the field of political science, there has long been an interest in the political activities of corporations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0001839213486984">Keim and Zardkoohi, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0001839213486984">Grier, Munger, and Roberts, 1994</xref>). Recently, however, researchers have become interested in the political orientations of managers and business leaders as individuals, distinct from the political agendas of the firms they head (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0001839213486984">Tetlock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0001839213486984">Burris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001839213486984">Francia et al., 2005</xref>). The central conclusion from these works is that, whereas corporations engage in political activities for overwhelmingly pragmatic reasons, individuals, including those in senior positions in firms, engage in political activities primarily as manifestations of their personal belief systems. The majority of business executives are conservative-leaning, but the range of their ideologies is considerable, from extremely liberal to extremely conservative (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0001839213486984">Burris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001839213486984">Francia et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, these ideologies are relatively ingrained and enduring. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0001839213486984">Burris (2001</xref>: 378) concluded from his study of business elites, “Political ideologies . . . tend to be formed early in life, often through transmission from parents to children,” and “they are relatively stable over the life course,” leading to the formation of “stable political identities.” In his comprehensive review of relevant research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0001839213486984">Jost (2006</xref>: 665) concluded that adult political ideology has its roots in stable personality differences that have a significant heritable component, reflecting “basic cognitive and motivational predispositions.” Accordingly, we view CEOs’ political ideologies as relatively stable and enduring personal inclinations that will influence their firms’ CSR initiatives.</p>

<title>Background on CSR</title>
<p>The concept of CSR has been central in the expansive debate about the purpose of business organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0001839213486984">Kaysen, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0001839213486984">Friedman, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0001839213486984">Margolis and Walsh, 2003</xref>). Defined as “actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0001839213486984">McWilliams and Siegel, 2001</xref>: 117), CSR is an umbrella rubric for a variety of organizational practices that are intended to serve stakeholders beyond the firm’s owners, including employees, customers, communities, and society at large. Scholars generally emphasize that managerial actions must be voluntary in order to be thought of as CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0001839213486984">Waddock, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001839213486984">Aguilera et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0001839213486984">Mackey, Mackey, and Barney, 2007</xref>). A lofty view is that CSR contributes to societal well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0001839213486984">Margolis and Walsh, 2003</xref>). A pragmatic view is that CSR amounts to “a calculated purchase of advertising services or goodwill” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0001839213486984">Knauer, 1994</xref>: 11). And a negative view is that CSR is a misappropriation or misallocation of a firm’s resources and equivalent to “theft” from the firm’s owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0001839213486984">Friedman, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p>In the vast literature on CSR, two types of writings have prevailed: a large body of theoretical and philosophical statements on the merits or, conversely, the misguidedness of CSR (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0001839213486984">Friedman, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0001839213486984">Jones, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0001839213486984">McWilliams and Siegel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0001839213486984">Mackey, Mackey, and Barney, 2007</xref>), and empirical research on the association between CSR and corporate financial performance. Although reviews and meta-analyses have reported a positive relationship between CSR and financial performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0001839213486984">Margolis and Walsh, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0001839213486984">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0001839213486984">Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes, 2003</xref>), and a negative relationship between corporate irresponsibility (misdeeds) and financial performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0001839213486984">Heugens et al., 2011</xref>), they also have pointed out major methodological problems in prior studies, as well as a number of potential moderators (e.g., country-level institutional factors, type of stakeholder). When one further considers that CSR may have delayed and diffuse effects on firm performance—for instance, providing insurance-like protection in the event of future missteps by the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0001839213486984">Kacperczyk, 2009</xref>) or making the company more attractive to prospective employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0001839213486984">Turban and Greening, 1997</xref>) —the link between CSR and financial success becomes all the more complex.</p>
<p>Although some scholars have pleaded for greater managerial emphasis on CSR (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0001839213486984">Margolis and Walsh, 2003</xref>), others have argued that managers often over-emphasize CSR in efforts to secure their personal reputations in their communities, enhance their personal status with stakeholders, and leave legacies that extend beyond shareholder wealth (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0001839213486984">Hemingway and Maclagan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0001839213486984">Cespa and Cestone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0001839213486984">Barnea and Rubin, 2010</xref>). According to this view, the pressures on CEOs to focus on corporate financial performance are countervailed, and even outweighed, by normative pressures on CEOs to appear to be good business statesmen. As a result, these theorists say, many CSR initiatives are badly conceived or badly executed ceremonial acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0001839213486984">Surroca and Tribó, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>CEOs' Political Ideology and CSR</title>
<p>Adopting the logic of upper echelons theory, we anticipate that differences in CEOs’ political ideologies, which are manifestations of underlying values, will be concretely reflected in their companies’ CSR initiatives. As discussed earlier, CEOs’ political orientations will influence their perceptions of the business case for CSR (perceptual filtering), as well as their preferences for the outcomes of CSR (behavior channeling). That is, politically liberal CEOs (relative to conservative CEOs) will, in some (unobservable) combination, envision that CSR is beneficial for the firm’s owners <italic>and</italic> believe that CSR is intrinsically desirable. In positions of direct and indirect influence over company policies and practices, liberal CEOs will advance CSR—adding to their firms’ CSR strengths and eliminating concerns about CSR—more than will conservative CEOs.</p>
<p>Such an argument also follows from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0001839213486984">Tetlock’s (2000)</xref> survey of middle managers, in which he found differences between political conservatives and liberals (or egalitarians) in terms of their attitudes toward alternative corporate governance models. He concluded that because conservatives consider property rights to be more important than other claims and believe that a focus on shareholder wealth uses resources most efficiently, they tend to favor the shareholder model of governance over the stakeholder model. In contrast, liberals believe that firms should care more about societal needs; in turn, they are more likely to endorse the firm’s social engagement and its pluralistic responsibility to multiple stakeholders. Thus if Tetlock’s sampled managers were to become CEOs and achieve influence over corporate outcomes, we could expect their ideologies to be reflected in their companies’ CSR:</p>

<title>The Moderating Role of CEO Power Relative to the Board</title>
<p>So far, we have portrayed CEOs as relatively unconstrained in exercising their personal ideologies in their business decisions. But it is widely recognized that CEOs vary in how much power they possess (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0001839213486984">Finkelstein, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0001839213486984">Bebchuk and Cohen, 2005</xref>). Although CEOs can derive power from their own qualities, for instance, by being charismatic or possessing distinctive expertise (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0001839213486984">Finkelstein, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0001839213486984">Flynn and Staw, 2004</xref>), as well as from having widely dispersed shareholders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0001839213486984">McEachern, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0001839213486984">Galaskiewicz, 1997</xref>), especially recognized are the differences in CEOs’ power relative to that of their boards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0001839213486984">Gilson and Kraakman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0001839213486984">Finkelstein, Hambrick, and Cannella, 2009</xref>). CEOs differ in their amounts of financial ownership of their firms relative to outside directors, which confers formal voting power as well as legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0001839213486984">Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1988</xref>); they differ in their structural power, as some serve as their companies’ board chairs but others do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0001839213486984">Finkelstein and D’Aveni, 1994</xref>); and they differ in the degree to which their boards are vigilant and independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0001839213486984">Westphal and Fredrickson, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Such differences in CEOs’ power have been found to influence CEO-specific outcomes, such as compensation and dismissal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001839213486984">Boeker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0001839213486984">Main, O’Reilly, and Wade, 1993</xref>). CEOs’ power also has been found to be an important moderator of relationships between CEOs’ inclinations and strategic outcomes. For instance, CEOs’ power has been shown to moderate the association between various indicators of CEOs’ hubris and the size of premiums paid for large acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0001839213486984">Hayward and Hambrick, 1997</xref>), as well as the tendency for founder CEOs to successfully resist takeover bids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0001839213486984">Gao and Jain, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>This stream of literature suggests that CEOs’ power will influence the degree to which their inclinations are reflected in a firm’s decisions. Accordingly, we expect that CEOs will manifest their personal political ideologies in proportion to how much power they possess relative to their boards. When CEOs hold little power, their ideologies might be only faintly reflected, if at all, in their companies’ CSR profiles; but when CEOs have substantial power, holding greater sway over decision-making logics and outcomes, their personal values will be more vividly reflected in CSR initiatives. Thus we hypothesize:</p>

<title>The Moderating Role of Recent Financial Performance</title>
<p>Prior research has reported a positive relationship between a company’s recent financial performance and subsequent CSR initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0001839213486984">Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes, 2003</xref>), suggesting that companies tend to emphasize CSR to the extent they can financially afford to do so. We can expect, however, that the association between recent performance and CSR activities will depend on the CEO’s political ideology, with relatively liberal CEOs being much less influenced by recent performance than more conservative CEOs will be.</p>
<p>If politically liberal CEOs believe that CSR helps the bottom line, beyond seeing CSR as inherently worthy, they can be expected to be relatively insensitive to recent financial performance when promoting CSR. When their companies are performing well, they will promote CSR, and when their companies are not performing well, they will still tend to emphasize CSR because they will see it as an ingredient for business improvement. Through the process of motivated cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0001839213486984">Higgins and Molden, 2003</xref>), liberal CEOs will tend to see CSR as a pathway to increased stakeholder allegiance, which they will expect to translate into improved operating results. In their eyes, CSR is not simply a “good” thing to do but is an ingredient for successful business turnaround. Just as a technology-minded CEO might see R&amp;D spending as an instrument for business improvement, or an internationally minded CEO might see foreign expansion as a key to better performance, a liberal CEO will see CSR as a tool for advancing financial performance. Granted, when performance is poor, liberal CEOs may lack the resources to increase their commitments to CSR, but they will be loath to cut any current commitments.</p>
<p>In contrast, politically conservative CEOs, who tend to be more agnostic, if not skeptical about the business case for CSR, and whose personal values do not necessarily support the outcomes of CSR, will be more likely to promote CSR only when they believe they can “afford” to do so. On the contemporary business scene, executives face institutional pressures—from the press, government agencies, pension funds, and others—to engage in socially responsible practices aimed at their various stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001839213486984">Chiu and Sharfman, 2011</xref>). Moreover, as noted earlier, CEOs are tempted to engage in CSR to enhance their stature as business statesmen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0001839213486984">Jensen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0001839213486984">Surroca and Tribó, 2008</xref>). Politically conservative CEOs are not immune to these pressures. As such, conservative CEOs can be expected to engage in CSR as optional acts of corporate citizenship, but only as permitted by conditions of abundance. Politically conservative CEOs can be expected to reconcile their personal skepticism, on the one hand, with the various voices calling them to engage in CSR, on the other hand, by promoting such initiatives only when their firms’ financial performance allows them the leeway to do so. Thus we hypothesize:</p>
<list id="list3-0001839213486984" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><bold>Hypothesis 3 (H3):</bold> The interaction between a CEO’s political liberalism and a company’s recent performance will be negatively related to advances in CSR: the more liberal the CEO, the less the influence of recent performance on advances in CSR; the more conservative the CEO, the greater the influence of recent performance on advances in CSR.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section9-0001839213486984">
<title>Sample and Overview of Research Design</title>
<p>Based on multiple considerations, our sample consisted of CEOs of Standard &amp; Poor’s 1500 firms who were appointed between 2004 and 2006. We sampled newly appointed CEOs so we could observe their firms’ CSR profiles from the outset of their tenures. The year 2004 was the first year after the CSR data (described below) were available for a wide set of companies rather than the previous, much smaller pool of firms. The year 2006 was the close for identifying new CEOs, because CSR data were only available through 2009, and we sought at least three years of observations for each CEO.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0001839213486984">1</xref></sup> We applied three additional sampling filters. First, we only included CEOs of firms in industries (based on 2-digit SICs) that had at least five other firms in the CSR database, so that we could reliably control for industry-level CSR. Second, we excluded CEOs who previously had been CEOs in other companies, as our measure of political ideology was based on each executive’s “pre-CEO” behaviors. Third, we only included CEOs who served at least two years, to at least minimally observe their CSR tendencies. These criteria yielded a sample of 249 CEOs.</p>
<p>As described below, our independent variable, CEO political liberalism, was measured by examining the executives’ political donations for the ten years before they became CEOs (from year t–10 to t–1, where t is the first year of their tenures). For example, the time frame for examining donation records of CEOs appointed in 2004 was from 1994 to 2003. Our measure of CSR came from the Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini (KLD) database, which annually measures CSR profiles of individual firms (described below). We used annual KLD scores for each year a CEO was in office (excluding the year of appointment), designated as t+n, up to 2009. Thus if a CEO was appointed in 2004 and remained in office through 2009, we would have five years of CSR observations for that firm (2005–2009). After missing data, this framework yielded a pooled time-series of 748 firm-years for our various tests.</p>
<p>Each CEO’s political liberalism score was invariant during his or her tenure, reflecting the assumption that political ideology is relatively stable. With our lagged design, political ideology temporally preceded the measurement of CSR and performance outcomes, thereby eliminating any recursive relationship between the ideology measure and the dependent variables. Moreover, by focusing only on donations made before CEOs began their tenures, and by omitting CEOs who had previously been CEOs, we reduced the possibility that CEOs’ donation patterns might be reflections of their interests on behalf of their firms rather than of their personal values.</p>

<title>Measurement of Political Ideology</title>
<p>In the U.S., the liberalism/conservatism distinction has been associated with the two major political parties, the Democratic Party (more liberal) and the Republican Party (more conservative). According to Goren and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0001839213486984">Goren, Federico, and Kittilson, 2009</xref>: 805), “party identification represents the most stable and influential political predisposition in the belief system of ordinary citizens.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0001839213486984">Poole and Rosenthal (1984)</xref> argued that most political conflicts in the U.S. Congress can be expressed in liberal-conservative terms, with Democrats staking out generally liberal positions and Republicans supporting conservative ones, a pattern observed by other researchers as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0001839213486984">Dunlap and Allen, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0001839213486984">Diaz-Veizades et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0001839213486984">McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal (2006)</xref> verified that this distinction remains strong, arguing that the disparity between parties’ positions on the liberal-conservative dimension has only increased in recent years. This was echoed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0001839213486984">Hetherington (2009)</xref>, who found that partisan polarization has increased among U.S. Congress members, with congressional Republicans becoming increasingly conservative and Democrats more liberal. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0001839213486984">Jost (2006)</xref> noted that public opinion polls reflect these sharp ideological distinctions.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we measured each CEO’s political liberalism by examining the degree to which he or she supported the Democratic Party, as opposed to the Republican Party, using data on individual political contributions. Although some political giving is motivated by a desire for influence, political scientists have concluded that donations from individuals, those we examine, are overwhelmingly motivated by personal ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0001839213486984">Francia et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001839213486984">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0001839213486984">Ensley, 2009</xref>). Based on a comprehensive review of prior studies, one set of authors concluded that individual contributions “should not be viewed as an investment, but rather as a form of consumption—or, in the language of politics, participation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0001839213486984">Ansolabehere, de Figueiredo, and Snyder, 2003</xref>: 117). Thus we believe our use of political donation data, especially when examined over an extended period, yields a valid, albeit imprecise indicator of one’s political ideology.</p>
<p>Political contributions data originate from the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC), the independent regulatory agency established to monitor and disclose campaign finance information. The FEC records all individual contributions of more than $200 to individual candidates; to campaign committees for federal office; to national, state, and local parties; and to political action committees (PACs). It publicly provides information on every donation made by every individual, including the contributor’s name, state, city, street address, zip code, occupation, employer, amount of gift, date of gift, and name of recipient. Since 1993, such data have been accessible directly from the FEC website, as well as from non-partisan research institutes such as the Center for Responsive Politics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.opensecrets.org">www.opensecrets.org</ext-link>). These institutes modify the format of the data, but they report the exact data provided by the FEC.</p>
<p>Using data from the Center for Responsive Politics, we coded executives’ contribution records for the 10 years prior to their becoming CEOs. This window was wide enough, encompassing five congressional election cycles and two presidential elections, to allow meaningful interpretation of an executive’s donation pattern. We went to great lengths to carefully verify the contributions of each CEO—checking middle names, shortened names, address information, occupation, and employer information, all in an effort to exclude individuals whose names were similar to those of our CEOs. We used Notable Names Database, MergentOnline, Hoovers’ Online, executive biographies on company websites, and other online sources to help confirm each donor’s identity.</p>
<p>Using the information on CEOs’ contributions, we calculated four indicators, each of which taps a distinct facet of political giving, which together became our political liberalism index: (1) the <italic>number of donations</italic> to Democrats divided by the number of donations to recipients of both parties (to handle zero values, we added .1 to all numerators and .2 to all denominators), (2) the <italic>dollar amount of donations</italic> to Democrats divided by the amount of donations to both parties, (3) the <italic>number of years</italic> (over the 10-year time frame) the executive made donations to Democrats divided by the number of years donations were made to either party, and (4) the number of distinct Democratic <italic>recipients</italic> to which the executive made donations divided by the total number of distinct recipients of both parties. These four indicators, respectively, indicate one’s behavioral commitment, financial commitment, persistence of commitment, and scope of commitment to a political orientation. The inclusion of all four indicators, measured over a ten-year period, minimizes the risk of assigning ideology scores on the basis of incidental or token behaviors.</p>
<p>For these calculations, we included contributions to individual candidates, party committees, and any PACs identified as either Democratic or Republican supporters; other PACs (whose orientations were typically unclear) were excluded from the calculations. The inclusion of donations to parties and PACs increases the likelihood that scores reflect genuine political orientations rather than personal ties.</p>
<p>Because the indicators had similar means and variances, and all ranged from zero to one, we calculated our political liberalism index scores as the simple average of the four (Cronbach’s alpha = .92). Index scores ranged from zero to one, with scores above .50 representing degrees of liberalism, and scores below .50 indicating degrees of conservatism. For example, consider an executive who (over the 10-year period), gave six gifts to Democrats and two to Republicans; gave $2000 to Democrats and $450 to Republicans; made gifts to Democrats in three calendar years and gifts to Republicans in two years; and gave to five distinct Democratic recipients and only one Republican recipient. This executive’s scores for each of the four indicators are as follows:</p>

<p>Averaging the four components, this executive’s overall political liberalism score is .74, or relatively liberal.</p>
<p>The CEOs in our sample, on average, tended toward conservatism, with a mean political liberalism score of .39. This skew is reflected in the frequency distribution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0001839213486984">figure 1</xref>. With about 47 percent at the mid-point of the scale (including non-donors), about 38 percent were on the conservative side of the distribution, and about 15 percent were on the liberal side.</p>

<p>One might reasonably ask whether donation patterns were stable over time, as suggested by prior research on political ideologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0001839213486984">Burris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0001839213486984">Jost, 2006</xref>) and as presumed by our use of a ten-year window. To explore this, we calculated the executives’ scores for the first five years and the second five years of their respective ten-year panels. Treating executives with scores above .6 as liberal and those below .4 as conservative, only nine out of 249 executives switched between these two categories. When we treated the categories more restrictively, liberals above .8 and conservatives below .2, none of the executives switched categories. Thus the executives’ scores were relatively stable.</p>
<p>We address possible endogeneity of CEOs’ ideologies below, but at this point it is useful to note that ideology scores did not differ systematically by industry; for instance, CEOs of oil companies, often stereotyped as conservative, were widely distributed on our scale; CEOs of technology companies, often pictured as relatively liberal, were widely represented; and so on. Moreover, in keeping with the premise that political ideologies are relatively stable, there was no correlation between CEOs’ age and ideology scores. Additionally, there was no association between CEOs’ education levels (measured in various ways) and ideology scores.</p>
<sec id="section11-0001839213486984">
<title>Validation test</title>
<p>As with any proxy measure of a psychological attribute, one can reasonably ask whether our donation-based index is a valid indicator of political ideology. Accordingly, we conducted a survey-based validation test. Using the alumni database of a large public university, we sent surveys to 246 alumni who had updated their records within the prior three years and whose self-reported titles were among the following: vice president, senior vice president, executive vice president, chief financial officer, or chief operating officer—but not CEO. Our aim was to roughly approximate the profile of our focal sample during the period when we observed their donation patterns: senior business executives but not (yet) CEOs. The sampled alumni had graduated from various curriculums (not just the business school). We made no attempt to select or stratify according to executives’ age, geography, industry, or size of company. In contrast to our focal sample, we can assume that very few of the survey recipients will become CEOs, and we can assume that their employing companies are, on average, far smaller than the S&amp;P 1500 companies represented in our main sample. There is no apparent reason to believe, however, that these factors would bias the validation test.</p>
<p>Among the several items in our short survey was the following question: How would you categorize your political beliefs? Respondents were asked to circle one of the following: Very Conservative, Moderately Conservative, Slightly Conservative, Middle of Political Spectrum, Slightly Liberal, Moderately Liberal, Very Liberal. After a follow-up mailing, we received a total of 106 useful responses, a response rate of 43percent.</p>
<p>For every respondent, we turned to the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opensecrets.org">opensecrets.org</ext-link> database to obtain political donation data, which we coded for the prior ten years, exactly as we did for our main sample of CEOs. Treating the self-reported ideologies as a 7-point interval scale (1 = very conservative; 7 = very liberal), the Pearson correlation between these scores and the donation-based index was .51 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). According to the literature on corrected item-total correlations in psychometrics, a correlation above .40 between a single item (our single-item survey) and a composite index (our political liberalism index) indicates statistical coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0001839213486984">Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994</xref>). Thus, while recognizing that our donation-based index is an imprecise proxy, it appears to be a moderately valid indicator of political ideology.</p>

<sec id="section12-0001839213486984">
<title>Dependent Variable: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)</title>
<p>We used KLD ratings to measure each company’s annual CSR profile. The KLD data, available from financial advisory firm Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini, and Company, have been widely used and are generally considered the best available data for comprehensively measuring CSR (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001839213486984">Agle, Mitchell, and Sonnenfeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0001839213486984">Coombs and Gilley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0001839213486984">Choi and Wang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0001839213486984">Kacperczyk, 2009</xref>). KLD hires independent analysts who use various sources—including annual surveys, annual reports, proxy statements, and articles in the business press—to rate firms’ annual CSR profiles in multiple categories (e.g., environment, human rights). Under each of these categories, KLD annually rates each company for the presence (or absence, hence a binary indicator) of several specific “strengths” (exemplary qualities) and for the presence (or absence) of specific “concerns” (problematic issues). For example, under the “community” category, one of the strength items deals with charitable giving, and one of the concern items deals with negative economic impact on communities.</p>
<p>Despite its wide and sustained use by scholars, the KLD database has limitations. Concerns have been raised about subjectivity, about omission of difficult-to-measure confounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0001839213486984">Entine, 2003</xref>), and about the masking of industry effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0001839213486984">Rowley and Berman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001839213486984">Chiu and Sharfman, 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, the KLD data are less problematic and less subjective than other available metrics, such as <italic>Fortune</italic> reputation ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0001839213486984">Wong, Ormiston, and Tetlock, 2011</xref>), and empirical tests of their reliability and validity have been generally supportive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0001839213486984">Sharfman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0001839213486984">Szwajkowski and Figlewicz, 1999</xref>; summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0001839213486984">Walls, Berrone, and Phan, 2012</xref>). Moreover, KLD ratings are used extensively by institutional and individual social investors, further attesting to their perceived meaningfulness (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.msci.com">www.msci.com</ext-link>).</p>
<p>To measure each firm’s annual CSR profile, we included the six KLD categories that gauge a firm’s commitments to stakeholders beyond the firm’s owners: product quality, employee relations, diversity, community relations, environment, and human rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0001839213486984">2</xref></sup> Under these categories, KLD annually rates companies on a total of 40 strengths and 34 concerns (all items are available from the authors). For the dependent variable, we calculated the net CSR score for each year: the sum of all the company’s strengths minus all concerns. For instance, if a company in a given year had 8 strengths and 10 concerns, its CSR profile would be −2.</p>
<p>Our use of CSR “net scores”—KLD annual strengths minus concerns—is consistent with our theoretical argument that more liberal CEOs are oriented toward a combination of doing societal good <italic>and</italic> minimizing societal harm. We envision that CEOs, consciously or subconsciously, think jointly about both sides of the CSR ledger, contemplating a total of four broad possibilities: Should we invest to add more CSR strengths? Are we at risk of losing any of our existing CSR strengths? Should we commit to eliminating some of our CSR weaknesses (concerns)? and Are we at risk of incurring new weaknesses? Our use of KLD net scores also follows a significant tradition, including recent works that have adopted the same approach (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0001839213486984">Deckop, Merriman, and Gupta, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0001839213486984">David, Bloom, and Hillman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0001839213486984">Choi and Wang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0001839213486984">Wong, Ormiston, and Tetlock, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0001839213486984">
<title>Control and Moderator Variables</title>
<p>We controlled for an array of potentially confounding factors. Following prior research on CSR (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0001839213486984">Matten and Moon, 2008</xref>), we included a measure of <italic>industry-average CSR</italic>. This was calculated the same way as our dependent variable (for each focal year t+n) but based on data for all the firms in the same 2-digit industry as the focal firm (excluding the focal firm).</p>
<p>We controlled for each company’s CSR profile upon the arrival of each CEO. We calculated this variable, <italic>pre-CEO CSR</italic>, as the company’s CSR rating (sum of all strengths minus all concerns) averaged for the year the CEO was hired and the year before that (i.e., t and t–1). We included the CEO’s year of appointment in this calculation because CSR scores in that year cannot be meaningfully attributed to the new CEO. As an additional control for each company’s pre-CEO political orientation, we included a variable reflecting the firm’s PAC spending. Using corporate PAC contribution records (drawn from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opensecrets.org">opensecrets.org</ext-link>), we created an index, <italic>PAC Democratic orientation</italic>, scored similarly to our political liberalism index (details are discussed below), for the two years prior to each CEO’s start. The index ranged from zero to one; we assigned a score of .50 to those companies that had no records of PAC contributions; and we included a dummy marker, <italic>PAC dummy</italic>, coded to one if the firm was assigned that neutral score.</p>
<p>We also controlled for several company factors that have been widely used in prior CSR studies, all measured in the year prior to each focal year (t+n-1): firm size, measured as <italic>sales</italic> (logged); firm slack, measured as the <italic>long-term deb-to-equity ratio</italic> (logged); and performance, measured as the market-to-book value of common equity (MTB) minus the mean MTB for the industry, which we call <italic>industry-adjusted MTB</italic> (logged). This latter measure also served as the moderator for testing H3, regarding the interaction of CEO political ideology and recent performance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0001839213486984">3</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>We also controlled for corporate governance conditions, including an indicator of CEO power relative to the board and blockholder ownership (updated for every focal year t+n). Reflecting the premise that managerial power accrues from multiple sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0001839213486984">Finkelstien, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001839213486984">Adams, Almeida, and Ferreira, 2005</xref>), we calculated a formative index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0001839213486984">Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0001839213486984">McDonald, Westphal, and Graebner, 2008</xref>), consisting of three variables that have been widely used in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0001839213486984">Finkelstein, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0001839213486984">Pollock, Fischer, and Wade, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0001839213486984">Haynes and Hillman, 2010</xref>): a dummy variable for CEO duality, coded as one if the CEO was also board chair; the CEO’s relative ownership, measured as the difference between the percentage of stock owned by the CEO and the percentage owned by outside directors; and the proportion of outside directors appointed after the CEO. These variables were standardized and then averaged to create the <italic>CEO power index</italic> (logged). This index also served as the moderator for testing H2, on the interaction of CEO political liberalism and CEO power. Based on prior studies showing that ownership profiles can influence executives’ behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0001839213486984">McEachern, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0001839213486984">Galaskiewicz, 1997</xref>), we included <italic>blockholder ownership</italic>, measured as the total percentage of shares owned by external (non-management) shareholders who individually owned at least 5 percent of company shares. We also experimented with a simple dummy for the presence of any blockholders, as well as with several indicators for institutional shareholdings, with no substantial changes from the results we report. Power and ownership data were collected from Riskmetrics, Execucomp, Factset, and proxy statements.</p>
<p>At the CEO level, we controlled for the CEO’s overall degree of political activism by including the <italic>CEO’s total number of donations</italic> (over the 10 years prior to appointment). Finally, we included a simple count variable to indicate the <italic>CEO’s tenure</italic> in each focal year t+n.</p>

<sec id="section14-0001839213486984">
<title>Addressing Possible Endogeneity</title>
<p>It is possible that liberal (or conservative) CEOs might be sought for (or drawn to) certain kinds of CEO assignments; thus we conducted two tests to address such endogeneity. The first followed from the possibility that a board might particularly gravitate to a more liberal CEO if the firm has recently been involved in an apparent scandal or misdeed that calls for major image repair. In the face of a scandal—relating to the environment, discrimination, human rights, fraud, safety, sexual misconduct, or other types—the board may be especially eager to hire a CEO who projects an image of empathy and concern for all stakeholders. Such a CEO might tend to be liberal (even if not selected explicitly for that credential) and might then emphasize CSR—not volitionally, but as part of a program to repair the social stature of the firm.</p>
<p>To explore this possibility, we conducted a media analysis to identify companies that were associated with scandals or misdeeds of various types in the year prior to the start of the sampled CEOs’ tenures. Starting with a list of search terms generated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0001839213486984">Mishina et al. (2010)</xref>, we developed a comprehensive dictionary of 35 “scandal-related” terms, listed in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0001839213486984">Appendix</xref> (e.g., catastrophe, fraud, illegal, misconduct), and then conducted an automated search for these terms, in conjunction with sample firms, in the <italic>New York Times</italic> and the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic>, for the twelve months prior to our CEOs’ taking office. We then inspected every such passage to confirm that it genuinely referred to a blemish or misdeed on the part of the company. For instance, we excluded such passages as “[Company X] has not been tainted by any major environmental disasters in recent years.” We found articles containing scandal-related passages for 49 companies in our sample. Using alternative scoring schemes—a binary indicator for presence vs. absence of any such articles; a binary indicator for presence of three or more, or five or more, such passages (compared with none); and a continuous count of the number of such articles (which ranged from zero to 61)—we found no association between any of these indicators of scandals and our measure of CEO political ideology. For instance, among firms with five or more scandal-related articles, the mean CEO liberalism score was .47; for those without any such articles, the average score was .39, not a significant difference.</p>
<p>As a second test, we examined a broader set of conditions that might bring about the appointment of liberal (or conservative) CEOs. We first regressed our measure of CEO political liberalism against a set of potential antecedent factors: the location of the company’s headquarters, pre-CEO CSR conditions, industry sectors, our (various) scandal indicators as described above, and calendar year dummies. On the assumption that companies in heavily Democratic states might appoint liberal CEOs, we coded a dummy variable one if the headquarters was located in any of the ten most Democratically oriented states, as rated by Gallup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0001839213486984">Jones, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0001839213486984">4</xref></sup> We also surmised that a liberal CEO might be sought if the company had CSR deficiencies (or conversely, if it was very CSR-prone); therefore we included the company’s pre-CEO CSR score as a predictor variable. To test the possibility that certain industries might favor liberal or conservative CEOs, we included dummy variables for the following sectors: high tech, natural resources, consumer products, utilities, financial, and other services. Finally, to check whether the political orientations of new CEOs varied systematically over time, we included calendar year dummies in this endogeneity analysis. Among all these various factors, only the location of companies’ headquarters was significant in the regression. As our next step, then, we included an endogeneity instrument, the predicted value of the CEO’s political liberalism, in our main analyses. The inclusion of this endogeneity control did not alter any of our results; therefore, to save degrees of freedom, we omitted it from our reported models.</p>
<p>These endogeneity analyses suggest that CEOs are not selected because of their political ideologies. There was no indication that liberal CEOs tend to be appointed when companies are embroiled in scandals or have CSR deficiencies, nor that they are selected disproportionately into strong-CSR companies. Just as one essentially never reads,either in the business press or the academic literature on CEO succession,about CEOs’ political orientations being relevant to their hiring, our analysis suggests that political inclinations are relatively incidental in CEOs’ appointments and not a seriously endogenous attribute.</p>

<sec id="section15-0001839213486984">
<title>Estimation Methods</title>
<p>We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to deal with multiple observations for our dependent variables. GEE, which derives maximum likelihood estimates and accommodates non-independent observations, is suitable when using cross-sectional time series data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0001839213486984">Liang and Zeger, 1986</xref>). We did not use a fixed-effects model because it is not appropriate when models include time-invariant variables (such as political liberalism). More specifically, we used the xtgee command in Stata 11.0, which fits general linear models and allows us to specify the within-group correlation structure for the panels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0001839213486984">StataCorp, 2009</xref>). Because our dependent variable ranged from negative to positive and was normally distributed, we specified a Gaussian (normal) distribution with an identity link function and an exchangeable correlation structure for all models. Robust variance estimators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0001839213486984">White, 1980</xref>) were used for all regressions in our models.</p>

<p>Model 3 tests hypothesis 2, which predicted that the effect of CEOs’ political liberalism on CSR is amplified by CEOs’ power. The results show a significant positive effect for the interaction of CEO political liberalism and CEO power (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), providing preliminary support for hypothesis 2.</p>
<p>Model 4 tests hypothesis 3, which predicted that recent performance will negatively moderate the relationship between CEOs’ liberalism and advances in CSR—or that the CSR initiatives of liberal CEOs are less contingent on recent performance than are those of conservative CEOs. The results show a significant negative interaction of CEO political liberalism and last year’s industry-adjusted MTB (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), providing preliminary support for hypothesis 3. When this interaction effect is graphed, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0001839213486984">figure 2</xref>, the resulting picture provides vivid support of both hypotheses 1 and 3: relatively liberal CEOs exhibit higher levels of CSR (after all controls) than do their conservative peers; and liberals are appreciably less responsive to recent performance than are conservative CEOs. More precisely, relatively liberal CEOs delivered annual CSR scores of about 1.10, on average, regardless of whether the company’s industry-adjusted MTB was high or low in the prior year. By comparison, conservative CEOs delivered annual CSR scores of .30 when recent performance was high, and –.20 when recent performance was poor.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0001839213486984-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Finally, model 5 includes all variables and yields support for all three hypotheses: CEO political liberalism is positively associated with CSR (H1); the interaction of CEO political liberalism and CEO power is positively associated with CSR (H2); and the interaction of CEO liberalism and recent performance is negatively associated with CSR, indicating that the CSR initiatives of liberal CEOs are less contingent on recent performance than are the CSR initiatives of more conservative CEOs (H3).</p>
<p>As a sensitivity test, we sought to examine the possibility that our measure of CEO political ideology was a more reliable indicator for those executives who made many gifts than for those who made few or none. For our initial test, we re-ran the analyses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001839213486984">table 2</xref> but excluded those CEOs who had made no gifts (who in our scoring system would have ideology scores of .5). None of the hypothesized results changed, indicating that it is appropriate to treat non-donors as moderates. As a second test, we experimented with weighting each CEO’s political ideology score by the number of gifts he or she had made; the logic was that an ideology score of .2, for instance, might carry far more meaning if it is based on many gifts than if it is based on only a few. When this weighted term (political ideology times the number of gifts plus one, to handle zeros) was added to models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001839213486984">table 2</xref>, the unadjusted ideology score continued to be highly significant, but the interaction term was not significant, again indicating that our chosen measure is a reliable gauge of CEO political ideology, at least as it pertains to explaining CSR initiatives. Our main expectation of a link between CEO values and CSR practices therefore received robust support.</p>
<p>We also tested our hypothesis about CEO power with each component separately: CEO duality, CEO’s relative ownership, and the proportion of outside directors appointed after the CEO. We found a significant positive interaction of CEO political liberalism and two CEO power variables: CEO’s relative ownership and the portion of outside directors hired after the CEO (both at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), whereas CEO duality was not a significant moderator of the effects of political liberalism on CSR. Thus the results with separate power variables partly supported hypothesis 2.</p>
<sec id="section17-0001839213486984">
<title>Analysis of Corporate PAC Contributions</title>
<p>To maintain a coherent focus, we have so far addressed the implications of CEOs’ political ideology for a specific organizational domain, CSR, but if executives’ ideologies are broadly consequential, as we have proposed, they should be reflected in other outcomes as well. To demonstrate these wider implications, we conducted a supplementary test of whether CEOs’ political ideologies are manifested in the contribution patterns of their companies’ PACs. Evidence of such an association would not only add support for our contention that CEOs’ ideologies are widely consequential but would also indirectly support our argument that CEOs’ ideologies show up in CSR because of CEOs’ volitional inclinations, rather than because liberal CEOs are hired with an explicit or implicit charge to improve CSR. If CEOs are freely acting on their ideologies, tilting organizational practices in directions that suit their values, this should show up both in CSR initiatives <italic>and</italic> PAC contributions. If, however, appointment of liberal CEOs and increased CSR are symptomatic of social remediation campaigns, or “greenwashing,” then one might expect to see CSR initiatives increase but PAC contributions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Corporate PACs solicit contributions from individuals, including company employees and executives, and then donate money to candidates and parties. Although corporate PACs are perceived as ubiquitous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0001839213486984">Milyo, Primo, and Groseclose, 2000</xref>), not all companies have PACs. For instance, about two-thirds of S&amp;P 500 companies have PACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0001839213486984">Coates, 2012</xref>), and only 35 percent of our sample, which consists of S&amp;P 1500 companies, made PAC donations between 2004 and 2010. Although corporate PAC funds do not come directly from company resources, researchers have found that CEOs have considerable influence over corporate political donations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0001839213486984">Milyo, Primo, and Groseclose, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0001839213486984">Aggarwal, Meschke, and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0001839213486984">Coates, 2012</xref>). To our knowledge, however, no previous studies have investigated relationships between specific CEO characteristics and corporate PAC contribution patterns.</p>
<p>To examine this relationship, we created a <italic>PAC Democratic orientation</italic> index, measured in each year (except the first year) of a CEO’s observed tenure. This index was the annual average of three indicators, drawn from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opensecrets.org">opensecrets.org</ext-link> (FEC) data: (1) the <italic>number</italic> of company PAC donations to Democrats divided by the number of donations to recipients in both parties; (2) the <italic>dollar</italic> amount of company PAC donations to Democrats divided by the dollars given to both parties; and (3) the number of distinct Democratic <italic>recipients</italic> divided by the number of recipients in both parties. The mean score of this index was .44, indicating that companies tended to slightly skew their PAC contributions toward Republicans; however, the standard deviation was .20, and the range was .08 to .99, suggesting considerable heterogeneity in corporate PAC orientations.</p>
<p>Using this PAC Democratic orientation index as the dependent variable, and CEO political liberalism as the independent variable, we conducted GEE analysis on our full panel of CEO-years. We used all the same control variables as in our CSR analyses, including pre-CEO CSR, but made two notable changes. We included pre-CEO PAC Democratic orientation, which was constructed identically to the dependent variable but measured as the average of the two years prior to the CEO’s start. This variable controls for the company’s PAC donation pattern prior to the CEO. In place of industry-average CSR, we included a set of calendar year dummy variables (for each focal year t+n) to capture time-specific factors.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001839213486984">Table 3</xref> reports results from this test. As shown, CEO political liberalism was significantly positively associated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) with PAC Democratic orientation. After controlling for a company’s prior donation pattern, as well as other relevant factors, the more liberal a company’s CEO, the more the company’s PAC contributions went to Democratic causes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study of 249 CEOs supports the prediction that CEOs’ political ideologies are manifested in companies’ actions and priorities. In this initial demonstration of the theoretical and practical significance of executive political ideology, we have examined its links to CSR practices and, secondarily, corporate PAC allocations. As we discuss below, however, one can readily envision additional organizational domains in which this largely unexplored executive attribute might be consequential, including effects on company performance.</p>
<p>Our project serves to reintroduce the importance of executive values to upper echelons research, and it contributes to the broader discussion about the extent to which corporate executives inject their personal values into corporate decisions. Our results suggest that CEOs are not merely technical optimizers, as neoclassical economics might envision; nor are CEOs uniform in the ways they try to bend their companies to suit themselves, as agency theory generally suggests. Instead, CEOs vary in their preferences, or values, and these differences give rise to heterogeneous firm outcomes.</p>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0001839213486984">Hambrick and Mason (1984)</xref> initially emphasized the role of executive values, almost all subsequent upper echelons studies have examined the effects of other executive attributes, especially executives’ experiences and personality, on organizational outcomes. By contrast, executives’ values have received very little attention in empirical research (exceptions include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001839213486984">Agle, Mitchell, and Sonnenfeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0001839213486984">Simsek et al., 2005</xref>). Our study begins to fill this gap by introducing the construct of political ideology (political conservatism vs. liberalism) as a reflection of CEOs’ values and by demonstrating its influence on executive decision making in an arena (CSR) in which CEOs’ values can be expected to matter greatly. Our findings serve to reinforce the main tenet of upper echelons theory: executives inject their personal biases into their strategic decisions and leadership behaviors. When faced with a given set of contextual conditions, CEOs of differing stripes, including differing values orientations, tend to pursue pathways that suit their personal inclinations.</p>
<p>Notably, we introduce a novel measure of political ideology as an indicator of executives’ values. Theorists have commented, at least for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001839213486984">Andrews, 1971</xref>), on the importance of executives’ values, but empirical research has been exceedingly sparse, no doubt because of the great challenges in developing generalizable, ex ante indicators of executives’ tastes. Our donation-based measure of political ideology is based on concrete, transparent behaviors, a feature that is especially noteworthy because executives’ values are typically thought of as relatively opaque and out of view (compared with their other executive attributes). We hope that others will use this measure to further advance research on the role of executives’ values.</p>
<p>Our study additionally provides new insights into the antecedents of CSR practices. In demonstrating that a CEO’s political ideology is manifested in a company’s CSR profiles and that a CEO’s power amplifies this relationship, the study highlights the broader importance of focusing on within-firm, especially managerial explanations of CSR. The preponderance of research has examined contextual and institutional drivers of CSR, yielding substantial but incomplete insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0001839213486984">Bansal and Roth, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0001839213486984">Sen, Gürhan-Canli, and Morwitz, 2001</xref>). Only recently have scholars begun to consider that CSR is a volitional managerial choice that some organizations pursue, while others—even those facing the same contextual conditions—do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0001839213486984">Deckop, Merriman, and Gupta, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0001839213486984">Waldman, Siegel, and Javidan, 2006</xref>). Scholars could consider a host of managerial and firm attributes as explanations for CSR practices, including ownership, board, workforce, and, as we have emphasized, executives’ characteristics.</p>
<p>Not only did we find that CEOs’ ideology has a main effect on CSR (which, again, is amplified by CEO power), but we also hypothesized and found that politically liberal CEOs, relative to conservative peers, tend to be relatively unresponsive to their firms’ performance levels when advancing CSR; in line with their personal values, they emphasized CSR even when company performance was poor. This is intriguing evidence of executives’ values prevailing over contextual conditions in corporate decision making. Conservative CEOs, by contrast, were more sensitive to current performance levels, especially curtailing CSR initiatives when times were poor. This latter result suggests that conservative CEOs view CSR initiatives as optional acts of corporate citizenship that can be selectively undertaken as financial conditions permit. Liberal CEOs appear to be more unconditional supporters of CSR, whereas conservative CEOs are “fair weather supporters,” who advance CSR when they believe they can spare the resources to do so.</p>
<p>In line with our theorizing and our use of net KLD scores, we expected liberal CEOs to focus on both sides of the CSR ledger—increasing strengths and decreasing concerns—but in a supplementary analysis, we decomposed the KLD scores to explore whether liberal CEOs might be more attentive to one side of the ledger than the other. The results indicated that CEOs’ political ideology was significantly associated with CSR concerns, but not significantly associated with CSR strengths (although the latter result was in the expected direction). This stronger result for CSR concerns suggests that liberal and conservative CEOs diverge more in their attention to “doing no harm” than in their emphasis on “doing good.” It is beyond our scope to consider such asymmetries at length, but it appears that liberal CEOs are particularly steadfast about minimizing or eliminating corporate misdeeds.</p>
<p>Our corroborative analysis on corporate PAC contributions offers insights for multiple disciplines, including management and political science. Corporate PAC contributions, along with lobbying, are among the most important political activities companies can engage in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0001839213486984">Hillman, Keim, and Schuler, 2004</xref>). Previous literature, however, has focused primarily on whether corporate PAC contributions are beneficial or harmful to companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0001839213486984">Dean, Vryza, and Fryxell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0001839213486984">Aggarwal, Meschke, and Wang, 2012</xref>), with far less attention to the antecedents of such behaviors. By investigating the determinants of PAC contributions, especially from an executive decision perspective, our corroborative study suggests a new lens for the study of corporate political activities.</p>
<sec id="section19-0001839213486984">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>As with any empirical project, ours has limitations, which in turn suggest various refinements and extensions. First, our measure of CEO political ideology is inevitably an imprecise gauge of a complex psychological construct. We believe our index, based on political donation records, yields a generally meaningful indicator of executives’ values orientations, and our validation effort was supportive, but further work might improve on our index or use additional data sources, possibly including CEOs’ speeches or interviews, surveys, or media accounts.</p>
<p>One possible way to refine the index would be to add precision about how liberal or conservative donation recipients are. For a subsample of 30 of our CEOs, we conducted an experiment based on the NOMINATE scores developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0001839213486984">Poole and Rosenthal (1984)</xref>, which gauge the ideology of incumbent politicians. Although intuitively promising, these scores are available only for incumbent congressional candidates, not party committees, party-affiliated PACS, or non-incumbent candidates (all of which were included in our index). Thus these scores could only be applied to a small subset of recipients (under 30 percent); as such, the refined measures were extremely highly correlated (&gt; .92) with our original ideology index. In future work, however, we strongly believe that any measure of political ideology should include donations to parties and PACS, as these are less likely to be driven by personal ties than are donations to candidates.</p>
<p>Our focus strictly on CEOs can also be considered a limitation. Corporate decision making is a shared activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0001839213486984">Hambrick and Mason, 1984</xref>), so future research might fruitfully consider how the political ideologies of entire top management teams (TMTs), as well as those of boards of directors, influence CSR practices and other organizational outcomes. It might be especially interesting to examine how the homogeneity of political orientations among corporate elites—say, when an entire TMT is highly liberal—amplifies the findings we have presented here.</p>
<p>As an archival study, our project does not shed light on the actual psychological processes by which CEOs’ ideologies are converted into concrete business decisions. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0001839213486984">England’s (1967)</xref> framework, we have surmised that some combination of behavior channeling and perceptual filtering is at work, but we have not been able to distinguish these two mechanisms empirically. Further research might use different methodologies, perhaps including controlled laboratory experiments or content analysis of CEOs’ speeches, to tease apart the distinct conduits through which individuals’ values affect complex choices.</p>
<p>We also acknowledge that undetected endogeneity may exist in the relationship between CEOs’ political ideology and CSR practices. It is possible that CEOs do not volitionally act on their ideologies, as we have argued, but instead are selected because their ideologies, explicitly or implicitly, somehow fit the task at hand. We have gone to lengths to address this alternative possibility: showing that the link between CEO ideology and CSR is amplified by a CEO’s relative power; showing that CEO ideology is also manifested in a distinctly different organizational outcome, corporate PAC allocations; showing that scandal-plagued companies do not disproportionately appoint liberal (or conservative) CEOs; and showing that a multivariable endogeneity control does not alter our results. Still, future research might improve on our tests for endogeneity; at a minimum, researchers need to bear in mind that executives’ attributes are not randomly distributed across firms or situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0001839213486984">
<title>Future Research on Executives’ Political Ideologies</title>
<p>By highlighting the concept of executives’ political ideology, our project suggests a host of additional research avenues. Under the rubric of upper echelons theory, we expect that executives’ political ideologies might be manifested in an array of organizational attributes, well beyond CSR practices and PAC spending. For example, CEOs’ political orientations might show up in organizational structures and systems. As an outgrowth of their belief in egalitarianism, perhaps highly liberal CEOs (relative to conservative CEOs) install flatter organizational structures, welcome more bottom-up communication, extend stock options and profit-sharing to more employees, and minimize the pay-gap between themselves and their TMT members and other employees.</p>
<p>It also would be interesting to study how the political liberalism of CEOs, or of entire TMTs, influences team dynamics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0001839213486984">Simsek et al., 2005</xref>). For instance, ideological homogeneity among TMT members might engender cognitive homogeneity and/or social integration. Moreover, interactions between CEOs and their boards could be considered. Will CEOs receive more support if they share the same political views as powerful members of their boards?</p>
<p>By showing that CEOs inject their values into their decisions, our study also raises questions of interest to agency theorists. According to agency theory, CEOs should be monitored and/or given incentives to induce them to make decisions on behalf of shareholders; without proper governance mechanisms, CEOs will pursue their personal interests at the expense of owners’ wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0001839213486984">Rediker and Seth, 1995</xref>). Our research finds that CEOs make CSR decisions based in part on their values and, more specifically, based on their political ideologies. So should boards be concerned? Should they be looking for governance mechanisms (e.g., compensation arrangements) to offset these effects? When a CEO injects his or her values into decisions about CSR, is that good or bad? On one hand, boards may view liberal CEOs unfavorably for injecting their personal beliefs into their decisions about CSR (especially boards composed of conservatives who are skeptical about the benefits of CSR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0001839213486984">Jensen, 2002</xref>). On the other hand, given the empirical evidence of a positive association between CSR and corporate financial performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0001839213486984">Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes, 2003</xref>), perhaps it is conservative CEOs who should be scrutinized for <italic>not</italic> advancing CSR, as failure to do so may harm the company’s performance.</p>
<p>Future research might fruitfully examine the interactive effects of CEOs’ political ideology and CSR initiatives on performance. Which is more helpful (or harmful) to company performance, heavy emphasis on CSR by liberal CEOs or heavy emphasis on CSR by conservative CEOs? On the one hand, when liberal CEOs emphasize CSR, they may do so in a way that serves non-owners, at the expense of owners; and when conservative CEOs emphasize CSR, they do so in a way designed to jointly serve both owners and other stakeholders. But a contrary scenario also can be envisioned: when liberal CEOs emphasize CSR, they do so as a central, deliberate aspect of their business strategy, with economic payoffs following; when conservative CEOs emphasize CSR, it is for cosmetic or ceremonial reasons, perhaps as a way to enhance their stature as corporate citizens, with little or no economic payoff accruing to the firm (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0001839213486984">Surroca and Tribó, 2008</xref>). In short, a host of questions about the effects of CEOs’ ideology, CSR, and their interactions, on performance could be explored.</p>
<p>At the more macro level, one can envision that CEOs’ political ideologies and other values might greatly influence extra-firm associations and affiliations. To the extent that CEOs have strong political ideologies, and strongly identify with those convictions, such beliefs will steer them to like-minded others, influencing their choices of external board seats, civic and philanthropic activities, and participation in business organizations, as well as their recruitment of outside directors. Political ideology might be an important unexplored dimension for considering homophily among corporate elites.</p>
<p>At the most macro level, the political ideologies of business leaders can be expected to influence public policies. Given that corporate CEOs can claim to be responsible for substantial economic resources, including jobs, and given that they can readily form networks and assemble microphones for getting their voices heard, their personal ideologies might affect public policies in multiple domains, including defense, health, education, immigration, and economics. Moreover, to the extent that CEOs exert political influence in support of their personal beliefs, rather than strictly adhering to their corporate agendas, one can envision that CEOs’ ideologies might—at the margin, at least—affect public policies that are of only tangential relevance or even orthogonal to their companies’ particular priorities.</p>
