<abstract>
<p>Although there has been much speculation about the relationship between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization, little research on the subject is available. The authors conducted secondary analyses on existing data sets to further examine the degree of association between various measures of cognitive distortions and denial/minimization among child molesters (Sample 1, <italic>n</italic> = 73; Sample 2, <italic>n</italic> = 42; Sample 3, <italic>n</italic> = 38) and rapists (Sample 1, <italic>n</italic> = 41; Sample 3, <italic>n</italic> = 14). Meta-analysis of the findings from Samples 1, 2, and 3 indicated that greater endorsement of cognitive distortions about sex offending in general was significantly associated with greater denial/minimization of one’s own guilt and deviance (<italic>r</italic> = .24), harm to one’s own victims (<italic>r</italic> = .32), one’s need for treatment (<italic>r</italic> = .21), and responsibility for one’s sex offenses (<italic>r</italic> = .16). Although correlated, cognitive distortions and denial/minimization, at least as typically measured, are distinct constructs.</p>

<p>In the sex offender literature, cognitive distortions have been conceptualized as beliefs that condone, justify, excuse, minimize, rationalize, or otherwise support sexual offending. Some theorists have speculated that cognitive distortions play a causal role in the initiation and maintenance of sexual offending (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1079063212453941">Abel, Becker, &amp; Cunningham-Rathner, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063212453941">Gannon, Ward, &amp; Collie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063212453941">Hall &amp; Hirschman, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1079063212453941">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1079063212453941">Malamuth, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1079063212453941">Marshall &amp; Barbaree, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1079063212453941">Ward &amp; Siegert, 2002</xref>). Cognitive distortions are considered in sex offender risk assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1079063212453941">Olver, Wong, Nicholaichuk, &amp; Gordon, 2007</xref>) and addressed in most treatment programs in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1079063212453941">McGrath, Cumming, Burchard, Zeoli, &amp; Ellerby, 2010</xref>). A variety of self-report measures have been created to assess cognitive distortions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1079063212453941">Abel et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063212453941">Bumby, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063212453941">Hanson, Gizzarelli, &amp; Scott, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1079063212453941">Mann, Hanson, &amp; Thornton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1079063212453941">McGrath et al., 2010</xref>). With few exceptions, the items on these scales focus on sex offending in general rather than on the respondent’s own sex offenses. As noted by others, a broad range of beliefs have been identified as cognitive distortions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063212453941">Gannon &amp; Polaschek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063212453941">Gannon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1079063212453941">Mann &amp; Beech, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1079063212453941">Maruna &amp; Mann, 2006</xref>). For example, some scales contain items that seem to focus primarily on perceived harm to victims, attribution of interest in sexual victimization, and attribution of responsibility, whereas others include items that seem to reflect sexual entitlement and deviant sexual interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1079063212453941">Abel et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063212453941">Gannon &amp; Polaschek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063212453941">Hanson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1079063212453941">Ward, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1079063212453941">Ward, Gannon, &amp; Keown, 2006</xref>). Accordingly, the correlations between different cognitive distortion measures can vary considerably (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063212453941">Bumby, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1079063212453941">Mann, Webster, Wakeling, &amp; Marshall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1079063212453941">Schneider &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1079063212453941">Tierney &amp; McCabe, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Denial and minimization have also been conceptualized in various ways in the sex offender literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1079063212453941">Yates, 2009</xref>). More restrictive definitions conceptualize denial and minimization as distinct, with denial defined as claims of innocence and minimization defined as attempts to downplay one’s responsibility, harm to victims, or offense (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1079063212453941">Langton, Barbaree, &amp; McNamee, 2003</xref>). Broader definitions do not make clear distinctions between denial and minimization, instead conceptualizing them along a continuum from complete denial to complete acceptance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1079063212453941">Maruna &amp; Mann, 2006</xref>). In addition to denial/minimization of guilt, responsibility, and harm, measures often also address denial/minimization of offense planning, sexual deviance, risk of future offending, and need for treatment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063212453941">Jung, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1079063212453941">Langton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1079063212453941">Peacock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1079063212453941">Schneider &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>). Denial and minimization are also considered in sex offender risk assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1079063212453941">Boer, Hart, Kropp, &amp; Webster, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1079063212453941">Boer, Wilson, Gauthier, &amp; Hart, 1997</xref>) and addressed in many treatment programs in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1079063212453941">McGrath et al., 2010</xref>). With few exceptions, the items on measures of denial/minimization focus on the respondent’s own sex offenses rather than on sex offending in general.</p>

<title>Theory: Relationship Between Cognitive Distortions and Denial/Minimization</title>
<p>Although measures of cognitive distortions and denial/minimization differ on whether they focus on generic sex offenses or the respondent’s own sex offenses, the line between them is blurry (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1079063212453941">Langton et al., 2008</xref>). To illustrate the similarities and differences between these constructs, some hypothetical themes and corresponding items from a few measures of cognitive distortions and denial/minimization are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063212453941">Table 1</xref>. Some of the themes and items we have identified in the table were informed by theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1079063212453941">Barbaree, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063212453941">Gannon &amp; Polaschek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1079063212453941">Langton, Barbaree, &amp; McNamee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1079063212453941">Ward, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1079063212453941">Ward et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1079063212453941">Yates, 2009</xref>), whereas others reflect our own speculation. Perusal of the items in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063212453941">Table 1</xref> suggests substantial overlap between measures of cognitive distortions and denial/minimization.</p>

<p>Cognitive distortions were initially conceptualized as manifestations of offenders’ beliefs about their own offenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1079063212453941">Abel et al., 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1079063212453941">1989</xref>) and they continue to be viewed by some as synonymous with denial/minimization in theory and practice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1079063212453941">Marshall, Marshall, &amp; Kingston, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1079063212453941">Yates, 2009</xref>). However, others have suggested that cognitive distortion measures may not reflect offenders’ beliefs about their own offending (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063212453941">Blumenthal, Gudjonsson, &amp; Burns, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063212453941">Gannon &amp; Polaschek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1079063212453941">Mann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1079063212453941">Schneider &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>). It is possible that even on the same set of items, offenders may view their own sex offense differently from sex offenses in general. For example, there is some evidence that sex offenders rate their own victims as suffering less than general sex offense victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1079063212453941">Fernandez &amp; Marshall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063212453941">Fernandez, Marshall, Lightbody, &amp; O’Sullivan, 1999</xref>). Thus, some conceptualizations of cognitive distortions imply that they should be highly related to offenders’ perceptions of their own offenses, whereas others have raised the possibility that this may not be the case.</p>

<title>Evidence: Relationship Between Cognitive Distortions and Denial/Minimization</title>
<p>Although there has been much speculation about the relationship between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization, little research on the subject is available. We were able to find four published studies examining the relationship between sex offenders’ perceptions of their own offenses and sex offenses in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063212453941">Blumenthal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1079063212453941">Gudjonsson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1079063212453941">Mann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1079063212453941">Schneider &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>). In a sample of 25 intrafamilial child molesters who admitted their offenses, Gudjonsson examined the relationship between cognitive distortions, as measured by the Abel Becker Cognition Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1079063212453941">Abel et al., 1989</xref>), and attribution of blame for one’s own sex offenses to external elements (e.g., “I am entirely to blame for my crime” [reverse scored]) and mental elements (e.g., “I would not have committed the crime if I had not lost control of myself”), as measured by the Revised Gudjonsson Blame Attribution Inventory (RGBAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063212453941">Gudjonsson &amp; Singh, 1989</xref>). Although the RGBAI was not explicitly identified as a measure of denial/minimization, its items, constructs, and focus clearly converge with existing denial/minimization measures (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063212453941">Table 1</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063212453941">Jung, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1079063212453941">Langton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1079063212453941">Peacock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1079063212453941">Schneider &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>). Gudjonsson found greater endorsement of cognitive distortions was associated with greater attribution of blame for one’s own sex offense to external elements (<italic>r</italic> = .62) and mental elements (<italic>r</italic> = .21, nonsignificant).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063212453941">Blumenthal et al. (1999)</xref> conducted a similar study with a sample of 36 child molesters and 30 rapists. The proportion of admitters versus deniers was not reported. Cognitive distortions were measured with the MOLEST and RAPE Scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063212453941">Bumby, 1996</xref>) and attribution of blame for their own offenses was again measured with the RGBAI. The results were only partially consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1079063212453941">Gudjonsson’s (1990)</xref> findings. As in the previous study, greater endorsement of cognitive distortions was associated with greater attribution of blame for one’s own sex offenses to external elements (child molesters, <italic>r</italic> = .20, nonsignificant; rapists, <italic>r</italic> = .66). However, greater endorsement of cognitive distortions was associated with <italic>less</italic> attribution of blame to mental elements (child molesters, <italic>r</italic> = –.32, nonsignificant; rapists <italic>r</italic> = –.43).</p>
<p>In the third study on the subject, Schneider and Wright examined the relationship between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization with a sample of 179 child molesters. Cognitive distortions were measured with the following self-report measures: MOLEST Scale, Sexual Entitlement and Sexy Children scales of the Hanson Sex Attitudes Questionnaire (HSAQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063212453941">Hanson et al., 1994</xref>), and Cognitive Distortions and Immaturity scale of the Multiphasic Sex Inventory (MSI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1079063212453941">Nichols &amp; Molinder, 1984</xref>). Denial/minimization was assessed with a self-report measure called the Facets of Sexual Offender Denial (FoSOD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1079063212453941">Schneider &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>), which consists of six subscales: Denial of Sexual Offense (e.g., “I have never committed a sex offense”; “There was nothing really harmful about what I did to the victim”), Denial of Extent (e.g., “I did touch the victim, but I did not go as far as people think”), Denial of Intent (e.g., “The offense happened because I was under stress or was feeling depressed”), Denial Due to Perceived Victim Desire (e.g., “The victim made the first sexual advances and I just went along with it”), Denial of Planning (e.g., “I purposely arranged things so I could have sexual contact with the victim” [reverse scored]), and Denial of Risk of Relapse (e.g., “I am confident I will not commit a sexual offense in the future”).</p>
<p>For the MOLEST Scale, greater endorsement of cognitive distortions was associated with greater denial/minimization on most of the FoSOD subscales: Denial of Sexual Offense (<italic>r</italic> = .46), Denial of Extent (<italic>r</italic> = .35), Denial of Intent (<italic>r</italic> = .59), and Denial Due to Perceived Victim Desire (<italic>r</italic> = .42); the correlation with Denial of Risk of Relapse was smaller than ±.31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1079063212453941">Schneider &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>, reported exact correlation coefficients only for values greater than or equal to ±.31). For the Sexy Children scale of the HSAQ, greater endorsement of cognitive distortions was associated with greater denial/minimization on most of the FoSOD subscales: Denial of Sexual Offense (<italic>r</italic> = .42), Denial of Intent (<italic>r</italic> = .53), and Denial Due to Perceived Victim Desire (<italic>r</italic> = .38); correlations with the remaining FoSOD subscales were smaller than ±.31. For the Sexual Entitlement scale of the HSAQ, greater endorsement of cognitive distortions was associated with <italic>less</italic> denial of risk of relapse (<italic>r</italic> = –.34); correlations with the remaining FoSOD subscales were smaller than ±.31. For the MSI Cognitive Distortion and Immaturity scale, all the correlations with the FoSOD subscales were smaller than ±.31.</p>
<p>In the final and most recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1079063212453941">Mann et al. (2007)</xref> examined the relationship between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization with a large sample of sex offenders. Cognitive distortions were measured with the Sex With Children (SWCH) Scale and denial/minimization was measured with subscales of the Sex Offence Attitudes Questionnaire (SOAQ): Denial of Harm (e.g., “She/he enjoyed themselves at the time of the offence”), Denial of Offence (e.g., “I [do not] accept that I committed a sexual offence”), Denial of Responsibility (e.g., “We have to share some of the blame because my victim knew how to seduce me”), Denial of Repetition (e.g., “This was a one-off”), Denial of Premeditation (e.g., “This offence happened out of the blue”), and Denial of Control (e.g., “I could not control myself at the time of the offence”). Strong correlations were found for two of the SOAQ subscales, with higher SWCH scores significantly associated with greater Denial of Harm (<italic>r</italic> = .48) and Denial of Responsibility (<italic>r</italic> = .47). A moderate significant correlation was found between the SWCH and the SOAQ Minimization total score (<italic>r</italic> = .39). Small correlations were found with the SWCH and the remaining SOAQ subscales: Denial of Repetition (<italic>r</italic> = –.02), Denial of Premeditation (<italic>r</italic> = .10), Denial of Offence (<italic>r</italic> = .16), and Denial of Control (<italic>r</italic> = .08).</p>
<p>Taken together these findings suggest that cognitive distortions are associated with many aspects of denial/minimization, but that the constructs, at least as typically measured, are far from synonymous. Furthermore, the observed relationship between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization seems to vary considerably depending on the operational definition and measurement of these variables. However, it is not possible to draw any clear conclusions based on the few available studies and their sometimes contradictory results. In the current study, we conducted secondary analyses on three existing data sets to further examine the degree of association between various denial/minimization measures and cognitive distortions measures among child molesters and rapists. We then conducted a meta-analysis to synthesize the findings from these three samples.</p>

<title>Sample 2: Northern Alberta Forensic Psychiatry Services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1079063212453941">Jung &amp; Gulayets, 2011</xref>)</title>
<p>Participants in the second sample were 42 adult male sex offenders who offended against victims 12 years old or younger. These participants were drawn from a larger data set of a treatment effectiveness study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1079063212453941">Jung &amp; Gulayets, 2011</xref>).

Given the possible change in their responses on the measures due to treatment effects, we only included offenders in our sample if they had completed both the denial and cognitive distortions measures at the same time (i.e., both were completed before treatment began, or both were completed after treatment began).

<title>Sex Offender Acceptance of Responsibility Scales (SOARS)</title>
<p>The SOARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1079063212453941">Peacock, 2000</xref>) is a self-report measure designed to assess the degree to which offenders accept responsibility for their sexual offenses. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (<italic>do not agree at all</italic>) to 4 (<italic>agree strongly</italic>). The SOARS consists of six subscales: Acceptance of Sexual Offense (sample item: “I have to face the fact that I committed a sex offense”) consists of eight items (four of which are reverse scored), scores can range from 0 to 32, and higher scores indicate greater admission of guilt. Acceptance of Offense Planning (sample item: “I set things up to make my sexual offending possible”) consists of eight items (four of which are reverse scored), scores can range from 0 to 32, and higher scores indicate greater admission of offense planning. Acceptance of Victim Harm (sample item: “My sexual offending really messed up my victim[s]”) consists of 8 items; however, we excluded one item (Item 18) because it does not focus specifically on the respondent’s own offense: “Victims of sexual offenses usually lie about how they were harmed to make things worse for the offender.” For the 7-item subscale, scores can range from 0 to 28, and higher scores indicate greater acknowledgment that one’s sex offenses caused harm to one’s victims. Motivation to Change (sample item: “I want to learn more about controlling my sexual behavior”) consists of eight items (four of which are reverse scored), scores can range from 0 to 32, and higher scores indicate greater acknowledgment that change is required to reduce one’s risk for committing future sex offenses. Justifications for Sexual Offending (sample item: “My sexual offending happened because I was using alcohol or drugs at the time”) consists of six items, scores can range from 0 to 24, and higher scores indicate greater minimization of responsibility for one’s sex offenses. Finally, Acceptance of Sexual Interests (sample item: “Sometimes I find myself thinking about sex”) consists of eight items, scores can range from 0 to 32, and higher scores indicate greater acknowledgment of normal sexual arousal and interests. Cronbach’s alphas for the subscales range from .69 to .92 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1079063212453941">Peacock, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Comprehensive Inventory of Denial—Sex Offender Version (CID-SO)</title>
<p>The CID-SO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1079063212453941">Jung &amp; Daniels, 2012</xref>) is an inventory with 18 items that are scored on a 3-point scale. Four forms of denial were conceptually clustered in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063212453941">Jung, 2004</xref>). Cluster A, Denying Sexually Deviant Behaviors and Arousal, includes 5 items (sample item: “deny current specific offense”), and scores may range from 0 to 10 with increasing values indicating greater denial of guilt for current and/or past sexual offenses. Cluster B, Denying Need for Treatment/Management of Sexual Offending, includes 4 items (sample item: “no desire or no expressed need for help”), and scores may range from 0 to 8 with increasing values indicating more denial of needing treatment and of viewing oneself at risk of sexually offending. Cluster C, Denying Responsibility, includes 5 items (sample item: “blaming the victim”), and scores may range from 0 to 10 with increasing values indicating greater minimization of responsibility through endorsement of excuses. Cluster D, Minimizing Harm, includes 4 items (sample item: “minimization of harm to victim”), and scores may range from 0 to 8 with higher scores indicating more minimization of harm.</p>
<p>Denial is assessed by both an interview and a thorough review of collateral information, such as the police report narrative of the offense and a criminal record. The CID-SO subscales examined in this study have shown excellent interrater reliability (<italic>r</italic>s = .91 to .95) and internal consistency (α = .82 to .92; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1079063212453941">Jung &amp; Daniels, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>MOLEST Scale</title>
<p>The MOLEST Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063212453941">Bumby, 1996</xref>) was designed to measure beliefs supportive of child molestation. Thirty-eight items are scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 4 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Total scores can range from 38 to 152, with higher scores reflecting stronger and/or more frequent endorsement of beliefs supportive of child sexual abuse. The scale has excellent internal consistency (α = .95; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1079063212453941">Arkowitz &amp; Vess, 2003</xref>; α = .97; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063212453941">Bumby, 1996</xref>) and 2-week test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .84; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063212453941">Bumby, 1996</xref>) with samples of sex offenders. There is also some evidence for the construct validity of the MOLEST Scale scores. For example, it is correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .34 to .54) with other established measures of beliefs supportive of child molestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1079063212453941">Arkowitz &amp; Vess, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063212453941">Bumby, 1996</xref>). In addition, a recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1079063212453941">Sewell &amp; Nunes, 2009</xref>) found medium to large differences on the MOLEST Scale in comparisons of child molesters and rapists, nonsex offenders, and nonoffenders.</p>

The Sexy Children scale has 12 items concerning offenders’ perceptions of children as sexually motivated and sexually attractive (sample item: “Children are often able to understand an adult’s needs better than other adults can”), and scores range from 12 to 60. All items are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>completely disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>completely agree</italic>). Higher scores on either scale indicate more cognitive distortions. These scale scores are internally consistent with reliability coefficients of .81 and .92, respectively, and child molesters scored significantly higher than nonsex offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063212453941">Hanson et al., 1994</xref>).</p>

<p>The pattern of correlations was generally similar for rapists. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1079063212453941">Table 4</xref>, medium-size correlations were found between the Bumby RAPE Scale and four of the six SOARS subscales: Acceptance of Sexual Offense, Acceptance of Victim Harm, Motivation to Change, and Justifications for Sexual Offending. Thus, greater endorsement of cognitive distortions regarding rape was associated with less Acceptance of Sexual Offense, Acceptance of Victim Harm, Motivation to Change, and more Justifications for Sexual Offending. However, due to the smaller sample and consequent reduction in statistical power, only the correlation with Acceptance of Victim Harm reached statistical significance. Power to reach significance (α = .05, two-tailed) with a medium correlation (.30) was .74 for the child molesters and .49 for the rapists (G*Power 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063212453941">Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>The SOARS, Sexual Entitlement scale, and Sexy Children scale were examined in Sample 2. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1079063212453941">Table 5</xref>, medium-size correlations were found between the Sexual Entitlement scale and three of the six SOARS subscales. Specifically, greater endorsement of cognitive distortions regarding sexual entitlement was associated with less Acceptance of Sexual Offense, Acceptance of Offense Planning, and Acceptance of Victim Harm. The Sexy Children scale was moderately correlated with only the SOARS Justifications for Sexual Offending subscale, with greater endorsement of cognitive distortions regarding children’s interest in sexual contact with adults associated with more justifications for one’s own sex offenses. Although some medium-size correlations consistent with Sample 1 and past research were found, none of the correlations reached statistical significance because of inadequate power afforded by the sample size. Power to reach significance (α = .05, two-tailed) with a medium correlation (.30) was .50 for Sample 2 (G*Power 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063212453941">Faul et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

The results often seemed to vary between measures and samples and some of the analyses had inadequate statistical power due to small sample. To synthesize the findings from Samples 1, 2, and 3, we conducted a fixed-effects meta-analysis of the observed correlations between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization using comprehensive meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1079063212453941">Biostat, 2006</xref>). We examined the four areas of denial/minimization that the SOARS and CID-SO seem to have in common (guilt and deviance, victim harm, need for treatment, and responsibility) as well as the SOARS Acceptance of Sexual Interests subscale. We also conducted a meta-analysis on the combined effects across all the subscales of the denial/minimization measures. The SOARS and CID-SO subscales examined as well as the results of each meta-analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1079063212453941">Table 8</xref>.</p>

<p>When multiple subscales of denial/minimization or cognitive distortion measures were examined for each independent sample, these nonindependent effects were averaged within each independent sample of child molesters and rapists. For example, the individual effect size from Sample 2 entered in the meta-analysis for the relationship between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization of guilt and deviance was the mean of the four relevant correlations run on the same sample: Sexual Entitlement scale with SOARS Acceptance of Sexual Offense, Sexual Entitlement scale with SOARS Acceptance of Offense Planning, Sexy Children scale with SOARS Acceptance of Sexual Offense, and Sexy Children scale with SOARS Acceptance of Offense Planning (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1079063212453941">Table 5</xref>). As noted above, there was slight overlap in the child molester and rapist samples in Sample 1 because 10 participants had both child and adult victims. For the meta-analysis, these 10 nonindependent participants were removed from the rapist group. Individual effects were coded such that a positive correlation indicated that greater endorsement of cognitive distortions was associated with more denial/minimization of guilt and deviance, victim harm, need for treatment, responsibility, or nondeviant sexual desire.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1079063212453941">Table 8</xref>, all effects were statistically significant (95% confidence intervals do not include zero), with the exception of the SOARS Acceptance of Sexual Interests. The nonsignificant Q statistics indicate the individual effects in each meta-analysis were not significantly heterogeneous. Small average correlations were found between cognitive distortions and most of the denial/minimization constructs (i.e., guilt and deviance, need for treatment, responsibility). However, a medium-magnitude correlation was found between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization of victim harm.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the current study was to examine the degree to which measures of cognitive distortions are associated with denial/minimization among sex offenders. In the three samples, correlations between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization ranged from small to large. Meta-analysis of the findings from Samples 1, 2, and 3 revealed that cognitive distortions were associated with greater denial/minimization of guilt and deviance, victim harm, need for treatment, and responsibility, but were not associated with denial/minimization of nondeviant sexual desire.</p>
<p>Our results are generally consistent with past research finding that greater endorsement of cognitive distortions is associated with greater denial/minimization. Our effects were similar to, but smaller than, those found by Schneider and Wright. The highest average correlation between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization was .32, whereas Schneider and Wright’s highest correlation was .59. Our findings for denial/minimization of responsibility (average <italic>r</italic> = .18) were also consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1079063212453941">Gudjonnson’s (1990)</xref> correlation between cognitive distortions and attribution of blame for one’s sex offense to mental elements (e.g., “I would not have committed the crime if I had not lost control of myself”) among child molesters (<italic>r</italic> = .21, nonsignificant). The current findings are also somewhat consistent with Gudjonsson’s and also Blumenthal et al.’s correlations between cognitive distortions and attribution of responsibility to external elements (e.g., “I am entirely to blame for my crime” [reverse scored]) among child molesters (<italic>r</italic> = .20, <italic>r</italic> = .62) and rapists (<italic>r</italic> = .66). The current study and past research indicate that cognitive distortions are associated with greater denial/minimization in many domains. However, the observed correlations are not high enough to indicate the measures are assessing the same construct. Thus, these constructs, at least as measured, do appear to be distinct and may not be interchangeable (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063212453941">Blumenthal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063212453941">Gannon &amp; Polaschek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1079063212453941">Mann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1079063212453941">Schneider &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>What is the nature of the relationship between these correlated, yet apparently distinct, constructs? One intriguing possibility comes from social psychological research on collective guilt. Just as one may experience guilt for one’s own transgressions, one may also experience guilt for transgressions committed by one’s social group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1079063212453941">Branscombe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1079063212453941">Doosje, Branscombe, Spears, &amp; Manstead, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1079063212453941">Miron, Branscombe, &amp; Biernat, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1079063212453941">Wohl &amp; Branscombe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1079063212453941">Wohl, Branscombe, &amp; Klar, 2006</xref>). Justifications and minimizations can mitigate feelings of guilt for one’s own transgressions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1079063212453941">Brock &amp; Buss, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1079063212453941">Fried, 1998</xref>) as well as feelings of collective guilt for the transgressions committed by the group with which one is identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1079063212453941">Branscombe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1079063212453941">Branscombe &amp; Miron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1079063212453941">Maitner, Mackie, &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1079063212453941">Miron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1079063212453941">Wohl &amp; Branscombe, 2008</xref>). Thus, denial/minimization may be an attempt to make one’s own sex offenses more acceptable and forgivable, whereas cognitive distortions may be an attempt to make the offenses committed by one’s group more acceptable and forgivable (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063212453941">Blumenthal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1079063212453941">Maruna &amp; Mann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1079063212453941">Schneider &amp; Wright, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1079063212453941">Yates, 2009</xref>). Both may function, at least in part, to reduce guilt for one’s own offenses and the offenses of one’s group. This hypothesis could be tested in future research by examining whether categorical denial moderates the relationship between measures of cognitive distortions and denial/minimization (measured along a continuum).</p>
<p>A number of limitations and possible alternate interpretations of our findings warrant consideration. First, sample sizes were small in most of the subsamples (<italic>n</italic> = 14 to 73), which limits statistical power and generalizability. However, focusing on the magnitude of the correlations rather than statistical significance indicates that several correlations were in the medium to large range. In addition, conducting a meta-analysis increased power and provided clearer and more accurate estimates of the true effects. Although the findings may not necessarily generalize to all sex offenders, we did have offenders from a variety of settings (e.g., provincial and federal institutions, incarcerated and community). A second concern is that less than half of the participants in the data sets from which Samples 1 and 2 were drawn had complete data on all the measures of interest. Although we do not know with certainty why these data were missing, there are a number of possible causes. For example, some participants may have simply failed to complete all items or measures in the treatment test battery. Some participants may have withdrawn from the program prior to completing the treatment test battery. And even when the treatment measures had been completed, they may not have been transferred to us. Although this is clearly a threat to the validity of the findings, our results were generally consistent with past research and our meta-analysis did not reveal significant variability between individual effects from the different samples. Nonetheless, replication with more complete data sets is needed. In addition, this highlights the importance of concerted efforts to maximize the completeness of such data (e.g., ensuring offenders complete all items and measures and ensuring that all data are made available for inclusion in the data set).</p>
<p>A third issue is that we did not include a measure of social desirable responding in our analyses. Although there is often skepticism about the validity of offenders’ self-reports, research with general offenders suggests surprisingly high agreement between self-reported and file-coded criminal history information (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1079063212453941">Kroner, Mills, &amp; Morgan, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, some self-report risk assessment measures are excellent predictors of recidivism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1079063212453941">Campbell, French, &amp; Gendreau, 2009</xref>). Similarly, research with sex offenders indicates self-report measures can assess deviant sexual interests reasonably well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1079063212453941">Banse, Schmidt, &amp; Clarbour, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063212453941">Laws, Hanson, Osborn, &amp; Greenbaum, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1079063212453941">Worling, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, a growing body of evidence suggests that measures like the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1079063212453941">Paulhus, 1984</xref>) may inadvertently assess general antisociality in addition to, or instead of, deceptive responding. More specifically, greater “social desirability” has been associated with <italic>lower</italic> risk and <italic>lower</italic> likelihood of recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063212453941">Hanson &amp; Wallace-Capretta, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1079063212453941">Mills &amp; Kroner, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1079063212453941">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1079063212453941">Mills, Loza, &amp; Kroner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1079063212453941">Nunes, Firestone, &amp; Baldwin, 2007</xref>). Thus, the inclusion of a social desirability measure in the current study would not have provided any clarity on the relationship between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization.</p>
<p>Beyond concerns about response bias, a more general issue is the challenge of accurately assessing denial/minimization with self-report measures. Apparent minimizations on such measures may actually be accurate reports of the offense and its circumstances in some cases. For example, for some offenders it may be true that they would not have committed the offense if they had been sober. Similarly, some victims of sex offenses may be resilient and recover relatively quickly (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063212453941">Brennan &amp; Taylor-Butts, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1079063212453941">Resick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1079063212453941">Rind, Tromovitch, &amp; Bauserman, 1998</xref>). Thus, self-report measures, such as the SOARS, may not distinguish minimization from true variability in the severity and circumstances of offenses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063212453941">Jung’s (2004)</xref> CID-SO partially addresses this issue by assessing many areas of denial/minimization by contrasting offenders’ accounts of their sex offenses with information from collateral sources, such as police reports and criminal records. We expect that the SOARS could overestimate denial/minimization because there may truly be mitigating factors and lower levels of deviance, planning, and victim harm for some offenders; however, the SOARS counts such claims, whether true or not, as denial/minimization. In contrast, the CID-SO should not overestimate denial/minimization in this way because only discrepancies between offenders’ accounts and official accounts are deemed denial/minimization in these areas, which can accommodate true variability in level of victim harm and so on.</p>
<p>However, it is possible that the CID-SO may overestimate denial/minimization in other ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1079063212453941">Marshall et al. (2011)</xref> have convincingly argued that official reports are not necessarily completely accurate accounts of the offense (e.g., due to imperfect memory of victims). To the extent that official reports exaggerate aspects of sex offenses, discrepancies in offenders’ accounts, even when accurate, would be viewed as denial/minimization. Thus, all approaches may overestimate denial/minimization, but the CID-SO likely provides a more accurate assessment than self-report measures like the SOARS. However, these self-report measures may be useful for screening or when interviews and file reviews are not possible due to limited resources. Regardless of the assessment approach, it is important to keep in mind that measures may over- or under-estimate denial/minimization for some offenders because ground truth (i.e., what really happened) is not always completely known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1079063212453941">Marshall, Anderson, &amp; Fernandez, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1079063212453941">Marshall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1079063212453941">Yates, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A fourth concern is that some offenders in our samples completed the measures during or after sex offender treatment whereas the rest completed them before treatment. Although, it is very likely that cognitive distortions and denial/minimization would decrease over treatment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1079063212453941">Nunes, Babchishin, &amp; Cortoni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1079063212453941">Schneider &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>), it does not necessarily follow that the relationship between these two constructs would change. In other words, there may be a main effect of treatment on both cognitive distortions and denial/minimization, but whether treatment moderates the relationship between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization is a separate question. We do not know of any published research that has examined the moderation question, but if treatment were to moderate the relationship between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization, then it would be important to consider pre- and post-treatment assessments separately.</p>
<p>Fifth, the measures of cognitive distortions and denial/minimization differed in many ways beyond whether they focused on general sex offending versus one’s own sex offenses. This may have attenuated the correlations between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization. A better way to test the distinctiveness of these constructs would be to use identical items that vary only in their focus on general sex offenses versus one’s own sex offenses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1079063212453941">Fernandez et al., 2003</xref>). In defense of our approach, examining the relationship between existing measures–potential asymmetries and all–is important because these are the tools being used in research and practice to inform theory, assessment, case conceptualization, and treatment. An important focus for future research is to work toward greater precision and clarity in conceptualization and measurement of these constructs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063212453941">Gannon &amp; Polaschek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063212453941">Gannon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1079063212453941">Mann &amp; Beech, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1079063212453941">Maruna &amp; Mann, 2006</xref>). Finally, we used the subscales as established by the authors of the measures and took their construct validity on faith; however, these subscales may not necessarily be the optimal organization of items, and, for most of the measures, there is little empirical evidence that they truly assess their intended constructs. A stronger test of the overlap versus distinctiveness of the different measures would be to conduct factor analyses with a large sample using several measures of cognitive distortions and denial/minimization. Unfortunately, this was not possible in any of our samples primarily because they were too small for factor analysis.</p>
<p>The current study indicates that cognitive distortions are associated with greater denial/minimization of guilt and deviance, victim harm, need for treatment, and responsibility. Although correlated, cognitive distortions and denial/minimization, at least as typically measured, are clearly distinct constructs. The current study addresses important questions about the relationship between cognitive distortions and denial/minimization and also raises several questions about the construct validity of existing measures and the function of their latent constructs. Future research aimed at increasing precision and clarity in measurement and conceptualization of cognitive constructs will facilitate better understanding of the role these cognitions play in sex offending and, consequently, better assessment and treatment.</p>
