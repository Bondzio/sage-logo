<p>As more students return to college for their bachelor’s and graduate degrees after time in the private sector, one of the largest challenges they face is updating their writing styles and skills. As a nontraditional graduate student, I was introduced to the resources provided by Pyrczak Publishing in the mid-2000s. The fifth edition of <italic>Writing Empirical Research Reports</italic> (2005) impressed me and provided a wonderful review of research-based paper guidelines. Additionally, my more traditional-aged colleagues benefited from the helpful guide and introduction to writing of empirical research reports provided by the text. Because of these positive experiences, I was happy to review the seventh edition of <italic>Writing Empirical Research Reports</italic> and the fourth edition of <italic>Writing Literature Reviews.</italic></p>
<p><italic>Writing Empirical Research Reports</italic> (seventh edition) and <italic>Writing Literature Reviews</italic> (fourth edition) are highly structured, well-written texts that carry the student through the complete process of writing a research article and a literature review, respectively. The formatting remains unchanged across the editions, with each chapter addressing one particular task or component of the writing process. The chapter then details, using guidelines, examples, and exercises, how to complete the named task. Pyrczak Publishing has maintained this format throughout each text, making each of them a valuable resource for those reentering the academic climate after years of absence or those who are new to the academy, including instructors. Additionally, <italic>Writing Empirical Research Reports</italic> (seventh edition) includes an answer key to assist the instructor with the discussion questions at the end of each chapter.</p>
<p><italic>Writing Empirical Research Reports</italic> is broken down into 15 chapters, which is useful during a semester-long course. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the essential elements of a research report, setting the stage for the remainder of the text. Chapters 2 and 3 cover the often difficult task of writing a simple research hypothesis. The authors have broken this task into guidelines that address each element necessary for writing this type of hypothesis. The use of the terms <italic>independent variable, dependent variable</italic>, and <italic>predicted relationship</italic> are covered in the first three guidelines. Often writing the most basic or simple hypothesis is difficult as students are often unsure as to what components should and should not be included within one. Pyrczak and Bruce break the step into manageable and understandable terms, include examples, and offer improved examples as well.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 speaks to writing the research objectives or purposes and research questions. The concept of qualitative research questions and objectives are discussed within this chapter as an alternative to writing a simple research hypothesis. Throughout the text, Pyrczak and Bruce point out the subtle differences between qualitative and quantitative research writing. This allows the text to be used not only for those who are writing research reports that are based on quantitative methodology, but also qualitative research. Additionally, Pyrczak and Bruce focus solely on writing reports of qualitative research within chapter 14. For those normally writing quantitative reports/articles, this later chapter both alerts and assists in the differences in writing style and terminology.</p>
<p>Titles are another nail-biting issue for many students. Chapter five, “Writing Titles,” makes the process much less painful by presenting what a title should and should not include. For example, a title should not be a complete sentence (p. 35) and a title should indicate the findings of the study (p. 37). One guideline states that the title should not be “clever” (p. 42), which for many students is difficult to comprehend when they see others using “catchy” or “cute” titles for their presentations or articles.</p>
<p>When reviewing the remainder of the chapter titles one can see how simply the authors have constructed each element or task in the research report writing process. The chapters’ titles highlight the task at hand and focus on writing the various sections of the research paper (introduction and literature review [Chapter 6], definitions [Chapter 7], methods [Chapter 9], analysis and results [Chapter 11], discussion [Chapter 12]). The breakdown of each research report section allows the student to focus on the current application and not be overwhelmed with the complete process or expected outcome.</p>
<p>Additionally, Pyrczak and Bruce include improvements in the examples when necessary, showing where a guideline was not followed and how the sentence could be restructured in order to follow them. For example, in chapter eight the guideline says, “When stating an assumption, consider providing the reason(s) why it was necessary to make the assumption” (p. 73). The example shown is “it was assumed that the cheerfulness scale was valid” (p. 73). But the authors then issue an improved version of the example, highlighting the fact that no reason was given as to why the assumption was necessary and including the missing portion of the guideline within the improved example. Both the examples and the improved version examples are highly advantageous when teaching students how to identify an adherence to the research report guidelines, particularly undergraduate students who may have never read an empirical report, much less written one.</p>
<p>Moreover, graduate students can benefit from the examples to remind them of the correct or more scholarly attributes of their writing. In my teaching, I have often found that graduate students, while knowing the proper procedure, may be rushing to complete a paper in a timely manner and not pay attention to the details of the report. The text’s examples have the ability to highlight their weaknesses and assist them in corrections prior to submission, whether to a professor, a conference, or a publication. As a professor, I continue to use the text with my own work, particularly when trying to meet publication or conference deadlines, to make sure that my writing is more academic in nature.</p>
<p>My favorite chapter within <italic>Writing Empirical Research Reports</italic> is chapter 13, “Writing Abstracts.” For an academic who must write abstracts for conference presentations and journal articles, this would be a wonderful addition to their toolbox. Throughout my academic career, I have never once had instruction on how to actually produce or write an abstract. It appeared to me that abstract writing was something of an art. But Pyrczak and Bruce have succeeded in moving it from an art to an almost fill-in-the-blank concept with 12 guidelines. Numerous conferences are now insisting that abstracts contain findings or face rejection. The authors address how to write not only the findings within the abstract but how to summarize the methodology, the theoretical undercurrents, and the uniqueness of the study. This chapter is worth the purchase price of the text for those who struggle to complete a satisfactory abstract.</p>
<p>Often when reviewing or using a continued edition, limited changes are noted within the review. Such is not the case with <italic>Writing Empirical Research Reports</italic> (seventh edition). Each subsequent edition includes more contemporary research examples. Additionally, the seventh edition incorporated the latest changes of the <italic>Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X12463561">American Psychological Association, 2009</xref>). This is most useful as well when teaching students who may not be familiar with the 2010 APA style changes or those who are writing across numerous disciplinary genres.</p>
<p>Pyrczak and Bruce note that the text is useful for both undergraduate and graduate students, particularly graduate students who are in the process of writing theses or dissertations. To further this assistance, Pyrczak and Bruce intersperse pointers for these graduate students throughout the text. There is only one suggestion that I have to the authors of <italic>Writing Empirical Research Reports</italic> (seventh edition) and to professors/instructors considering using the text. In the introduction section of the text, the authors suggest using “Appendix B” as the place to begin. The article, “Thinking Straight and Writing That Way,” presents an overview of the five fundamental principles toward effectively composing a research report. If the authors believe this article should be first in the presentation of material, I recommend relocating it to the front of the text as the first chapter.</p>
<p>An accompanying text is Jose Galvan’s <italic>Writing Literature Reviews</italic> (fourth edition), which could be considered an expansion of <italic>Writing Empirical Research Reports</italic>’s chapter six. Additionally, the text follows the familiar style and organization, using guidelines, examples, and activities, which assist the writer through the process of completing the academic literature review.</p>
<p>Galvan uses the first chapter to familiarize the reader with the terminology of literature reviews, including the types of writings found in journal articles and explaining what constitutes primary or secondary sources. He goes on to further describe what primary sources may consist of within a social or behavioral sciences, noting that all journal articles are not original research but may be theoretical proposals or critiques, literature review articles synthesizing works, anecdotal reports based on personal experiences, or professional practices and standard reports. Often as professors, we fail to give our students this information, particularly toward upper-level undergraduates or beginning graduate students. Many students will never attempt to publish an excellent class paper simply because they are unaware of the various types of articles contained within academic journals.</p>
<p>Additionally, within the first chapter Galvan breaks down the three major issues that may confound both readers and reviewers of research articles. This section of the text may confuse lower-level undergraduates, causing them to pose the question “Why do research if there are always issues?” It is because of the level of attention to detail Galvan uses, that would direct me away from using the first five pages of the text with this group of students. I would be inclined to move these five pages to the end of the first chapter or even address them as a separate section prior to chapter five, “Analyzing Qualitative Research Literature.” However, when using the text with upper-level undergraduate or graduate students I would leave the pages in order as it should simply be a review or reminder to them on research methodological issues.</p>
<p>Chapter two is quite short (four pages) but addresses the specific purposes in which a literature review would be used. Galvan notes the three reasons as a class term paper, a research article, and a thesis or dissertation. He notes within each reason how to utilize the timeframe available to work within, such as a class term paper where you are only allotted the semester to complete the task. He offers a timeline for a 15-week semester (p. 12), breaking the tasks into four stages, from the beginning library search to the final draft. This is most helpful for professors as well as students when constructing deadlines for class papers. I have used this timeline within various courses and have been able to modify it for 8- to10-week sprint classes quite easily.</p>
<p>My favorite chapter within <italic>Writing Literature Reviews</italic> (fourth edition) is chapter five, “Selecting a Topic &amp; Identifying Literature for Review.” Numerous times, I have heard graduate students state that they cannot choose a topic or they cannot narrow a topic into a specific path. This chapter walks the reader through this tedious and challenging process in 14 steps. Of particular importance is the use of the Educational Resource Information Center (ERIC) database, highlighting the importance of using a disciplined-focus database such as PsychoINFO or Sociological Abstracts. Galvan leads the reader through the concepts of academic databases by including a “how-to guide” for novices (p. 18). This step-by-step guide is a bonus for readers who have never had a library course on locating resources. Additionally, a sample list is included of discipline-specific library databases (pp. 22-23).</p>
<p>Chapters four through six walk the student through choosing the appropriate literature and quantitative/qualitative research for the selected topic. Galvan inserts the concept of using note cards while reading articles to make it easier for categorization and grouping of topics/subtopics. Additionally he suggests using note cards for definitions, important points of the article, quotes, and key statistics, as well as methodological strengths and weaknesses. For those of us “old-school” types this makes sense. But for the current traditional-aged students, the concepts of using notecards and not computer-generated spreadsheets may appear to be an old and outdated notion. I still suggest to students that they should use notecards, particularly when writing lengthy papers.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 consists of 10 guidelines in building literature summary tables. Galvan notes that “you may want to include in your literature review one or more of the tables you build, which will also help to provide an overview for the readers of your review” (p. 63). The most useful guidelines in this chapter are 9 and 10. Galvan includes instructions on how to use Microsoft Word to build and format the table.</p>
<p>Galvan uses chapter eight as more of a planning and synthesis module. He offers 12 guidelines to assist the reader on choosing their “voice,” creating an outline, and organizing notes. He also includes a sample outline (p. 73), which is to be used to illustrate various points during the remainder of chapter eight. At the end of the chapter, he clarifies what is meant by a more detailed outline, or in his words “fleshed-out” (p. 78). For readers unfamiliar with the concept of outlining a literature review and constructing a detailed outline, this is a vital piece of information in assisting them in moving toward the next step, writing a first draft.</p>
<p>The writing of the first draft is addressed in chapter 9 with chapter 10 assisting in the first draft’s refinement. These two chapters are critical to the success of the final paper. Students will often write their first draft, turn it in to the professor, and consider the project completed. By employing Galvan’s methods of refinement, the student will be well on their way toward the completion of the project with the possibility of fewer revisions. Additionally, chapter 11 leads the reader through the process of checking writing style, language usage, and the mechanics of writing, including the technical aspects of grammar rules, punctuation, and spelling.</p>
<p>Of major importance within chapter 11 is Galvan’s section on plagiarism. While all professors and universities usually address plagiarism in their syllabi or on the university Web site, most of us do not address the topic in class. This can lead to egregious violations of academic protocol. By Galvan including this section within the text, it allows professors to then address this topic from a nonaccusatory standpoint of covering the text material and not from an adversarial position at a later date when a student has committed a violation. Personally, I would move chapter 11 ahead of chapters 9 and 10 when using this textbook so that this section is covered prior to the writing of the first draft.</p>
<p>The last three chapters (12-14) are mainly concerned with what happens after the feedback and the submittal of the first draft, the final steps in the completion of the literature review. I applaud Galvan’s statement of what to do when you get back your paper with feedback, “put the manuscript aside for a period of time, thereby creating some distance from the manuscript and from your role as the writer” (p. 107). No greater advice was ever given to me during my years as a student, particularly during the intense process of thesis or dissertation writing. Chapter 14 is actually a checklist to assist the reader, now a writer, in editing, redrafting, and overall refinement of the project.</p>
<p>An entirely new chapter to this edition of <italic>Writing Literature Reviews</italic> is chapter 13, “Preparing a Reference List.” Reference lists can cause many students to go into panic mode for no apparent reason and I am very glad that Galvan has added this chapter. I would however address reference lists and compilation earlier within the text so as to alert the student to the careful construction of their notecards. Having surveyed where to relocate this information, I believe that it probably should be addressed either just after or during chapter 4, along with the guidelines for analyzing literature and the suggestion of notecard usage.</p>
<p>Supplemental material at the end of the text contains eight literature review models, which can be used for discussion or evaluation during the course. Additionally, these literature review models are used during end-of-chapter activities for several chapters and have been updated with the addition of three new models.</p>
<p>My bookshelves at home and at the university hold several texts from Pyrczak Publishing, including previous editions of <italic>Writing Empirical Research Reports</italic> and <italic>Writing Literature Reviews</italic>. I continuously find myself referencing them for classroom instruction, one-on-one conferences on term papers, and professional conference abstracts. After carefully reviewing the newer editions, I am incorporating each of them into a graduate professional seminar this coming semester, continuing the tradition set forth in my first graduate pro-sem. It is a fitting tribute to the longevity of the texts, to their formatting, and to the texts’ ability to allay writing fears within students and even professors.</p>
